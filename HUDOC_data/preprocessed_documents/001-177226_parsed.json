For the investigation to be regarded as \u2018effective\u2019, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation as to the results to be achieved but as to the means to be employed. The authorities must have taken the steps reasonably available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter\u00a0alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. In cases under Article 3 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation has been at issue, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time. Consideration has been given to the opening of investigations, delays in taking statements and the length of time taken for the preliminary investigation (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 119-23; Mocanu and Others, cited above, \u00a7 322; Identoba and Others, cited above, \u00a7 66; Begheluri and Others, cited above, \u00a7 99; Denis Vasilyev, cited above, \u00a7 100 with further references; and Stoica v. Romania, no. 42722/02, \u00a7 67, 4 March 2008). A prompt response by the authorities in investigating allegations of ill-treatment may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. Tolerance by the authorities towards such acts cannot but undermine public confidence in the principle of lawfulness and the State\u2019s maintenance of the rule of law (see Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Others v.\u00a0Georgia, no.\u00a071156/01, \u00a7 97, 3 May 2007).",

Children and other vulnerable individuals, in particular, are entitled to State protection, in the form of effective deterrence, against such serious breaches of personal integrity (see, for example, A. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 22, and Opuz v. Turkey, no. 33401/02, \u00a7 159, ECHR 2009, as well as the Council of Europe Recommendation on integrated national strategies for the protection of children from violence, cited in paragraph 103 above). The Court has also acknowledged the particular vulnerability of victims of domestic violence and the need for active State involvement in their protection (see Bevacqua and S. v. Bulgaria, no. 71127/01, \u00a7\u00a065, 12\u00a0June\u00a02008, and Opuz, cited above, \u00a7 132). Those positive obligations, which often overlap, consist of: (a) the obligation to prevent ill-treatment of which the authorities knew or ought to have known (see, for example, \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 v. Croatia, no.\u00a041526/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0138-139, ECHR 2012), and (b) the (procedural) obligation to conduct an effective official investigation where an individual raises an arguable claim of ill-treatment (see, for example, Dimitar Shopov v.

Respect for the dignity of children is consonant with provision of those elements important to their growth as full members of the community.

The thinking underlying this notion of erreur manifeste d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation (a concept of French administrative law), as used in the context of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, is doubtless that if the error of law or fact by the national court is so evident as to be characterised as a \u2018manifest error\u2019 \u2013 that is to say, is an error that no reasonable court could ever have made \u2013, it may be such as to disturb the fairness of the proceedings.

In effect, it created an exception to the principle that it is for the victim to request damages, placing the obligation on the investigative authority and the court itself. The ex officio nature of this type of inquiry trumps the principle quantum apellatum, tantum devolutum. In such a scenario, one would expect that only an explicit waiver of such right to compensation by the victim would release the courts from their ex officio legal obligation to consider the issue of the damages. No such explicit waiver was ever put forward by the applicant or his representative. The fact that the applicant\u2019s mother did not want to participate as a civil party (constituire de parte civil\u0103) in the criminal proceedings (paragraph 9) \u2013 and not, as tendentiously stated by the Government (paragraph 60), that she did \u201cnot request moral damage\u201d \u2013 cannot be read as a waiver on behalf of her minor son. In effect, the requirements imposed upon the courts by Article 17 were independent of any formal request to participate as a civil party as well as of any specific request for moral damages made by the legal representative of the person without legal capacity or with restricted legal capacity. Thus, the argument of the Government that the applicant had waived, through his representative, his right to compensation by limiting the appeal to the criminal aspects of the case, is wrong. In fact, the County Court itself accorded damages to the applicant of its own motion in its decision of 22 December 2009. More critically, there was a constant practice affirming the ex officio nature of the inquiry. Thus, in decision no. 1776/2005, the High Court of Cassation and Justice, relying precisely on the said Article 17, quashed a decision because the Court of Appeal, while convicting the husband for murdering his wife, had omitted to examine the question of damages for the victim\u2019s minor children. In like vein, in case no. 254/1990, the Bucharest County Court dismissed, as running counter to the interests of the minor children, a waiver of the right to receive compensation made by their mother on their behalf. It is, therefore, quite surprising that in the instant case the same court decided not to award such damages, without giving any justification, in its decision of 26 April 2012. This arbitrary conduct of the County Court was reproached even by the prosecutor, who complained about the fact that the County Court had not awarded damages (see paragraph 17). Bearing in mind that the Bucharest Court of Appeal was called to remedy this conduct of the lower court and did not, the applicant was the victim of a serious denial of justice and thus of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention, which is not absorbed or consumed by the autonomous violation of Article\u00a03.",

This punishment should be sufficiently severe to act as a deterrent, as required by the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (see paragraph\u00a027) and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (paragraph\u00a032). Article 45 of the above mentioned Council of Europe Convention requires Parties to match their action with the seriousness of the offences; the parties are in fact required \u201cto take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that the offences established in accordance with [the] Convention are punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, taking into account their seriousness\u201d. We note that D.D. was convicted of physical and verbal abuse against the applicant, covering a period of two years (from 2002 to 2004), and yet he was sentenced to a mere suspended prison term. Such a penalty would clearly not be in line with the above-mentioned international standards.",

In my opinion, the circumstances described in paragraphs 42 to 44 of the judgment are in themselves sufficient to find the above violation. The competent authorities failed to take any action in respect of the first four criminal complaints lodged by the applicant\u2019s mother. Once the authorities decided to react, it took them almost three and a half years to complete the investigation in a case of child abuse, and the proceedings as a whole lasted more than eight\u00a0years for three levels of jurisdiction, with an intervening significant period of inactivity. The fact that the perpetrator was finally convicted and given a suspended sentence of one year\u2019s imprisonment can hardly counterbalance the serious lack of diligence in conducting the case or lead to a conclusion that the investigation into allegations of ill-treatment of a vulnerable child was effective.",

Yet one can hardly imagine any form of compensation for a victim within criminal proceedings for the excessive length of those same proceedings. Such compensation can possibly be sought and awarded in separate proceedings, but these have never been initiated by the applicant. I do not believe that Article 3 of the Convention, under its procedural limb, requires the High Contracting Parties to award damages for possible excessive length of criminal proceedings within those proceedings themselves.",

Be that as it may, together with judges Yudkivska and Ranzoni, I have expressed my dissent with the majority\u2019s view that the national courts in the present case were under a Convention obligation to award damages to the applicant in this respect. I\u00a0believe that those arguments (especially the fact that the applicant\u2019s mother, acting on his behalf, expressly waived any claim for damages) are also pertinent to the issue of a violation of Article 3.",

While one cannot but agree, it is hard to understand why these principles speak for finding a violation in the particular case. In particular, the domestic courts did in fact convict the perpetrator, thereby apparently finding no justification for his acts. On the legislative level, the respondent State has adopted The Protection and Promotion of Children\u2019s Rights Act, which in its relevant provisions guarantees the right to respect for a child\u2019s personality and expressly prohibits physical punishment or humiliating or degrading treatment (see paragraph 21 of the judgment). It might be fair to say that on the abstract level, the Respondent State complied with these requirements.

However, this positive obligation under Article 3 of the Convention cannot, in our view, be extended to Article 6, which provides for minimum procedural guarantees in the determination of civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against a person. For example, a State has an obligation to provide a vulnerable victim of torture with free legal assistance in order to ensure his or her effective participation in the relevant domestic proceedings, but this is an obligation under Article\u00a03 of the Convention and not under Article 6 (see Savitskyy v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 38773/05, \u00a7 119, 26 July 2012).",
