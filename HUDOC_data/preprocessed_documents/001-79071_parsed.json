The Court fully agrees with that opinion; whether or not the applicant consented to many of the prosecutor\u2019s requests for extensions of time-limits, it was for the District Court to ensure that the case proceeded with appropriate speed. Having regard to the aforementioned four-year period as well as the total length of more than seven years, involving only one judicial instance, it is clear that the criminal proceedings were not conducted with the promptness required by Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01. In regard to the tax proceedings, the Court notes that the appeal of the applicant\u2019s company against the \u2019s judgment was pending before the Administrative Court of Appeal for more than three years.
