The applicant was accused, in particular, of having transferred a significant amount of money, acquired as a result of criminal conduct, to a bank account in Dubai on 21 November 2002. The alleged criminal conduct was the embezzlement of USD\u00a040,000,000 from the Central Bank of Turkmenistan in the period between 25 July and 3 September 2002 by means of the standard system for bank-to-bank payments, SWIFT, that is, the same offence for which extradition had been denied a few months earlier (see paragraph 16 above).",

In the Government\u2019s view, the detention ordered by the prosecutor for a period of seventy-two hours had been mandatory under the 2005 Act. The domestic courts had assessed the necessity of the detention and taken the applicant\u2019s arguments into account. The Government further argued that the national authorities had correctly applied the national legislation, which contained sufficient safeguards against arbitrariness.

The applicant went on to argue that the authorities\u2019 approach may have prompted a chain of extradition requests on the part of the Turkmen authorities, and, accordingly, his repeated detention, which in itself had been a measure of repression and a means of persecuting him for his political activities.

Also, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) does not require that the detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing (see \u010conka v.

The only difference between the first and the second requests was the date on which they were sent to the Bulgarian authorities. The order for the applicant\u2019s detention of 22 October 2002 issued by the Turkmen authorities was also the same. In this connection, it cannot be overlooked that the first extradition request had been rejected by a final judicial decision in May 2003 on the ground that the applicant could not have committed the alleged offence and that the criminal proceedings against him in Turkmenistan had been brought with a view to persecuting him for his political activities (see paragraph 16 above). Furthermore, under Article 65 of the 1975 Treaty, the main legal instrument governing the applicant\u2019s extradition and detention (see paragraph 46 above), the requested Party could take measures for the detention of the person concerned except in cases when extradition was not possible. The Court notes that under Article 61(\u0433) of that Treaty, if criminal proceedings for the same offence had been brought in the requested Party and discontinued, that circumstance constituted an impediment to extradition. In the applicant\u2019s case, criminal proceedings had been brought in Bulgaria in relation to the same facts and discontinued on 16 February 2004 on the ground that no offence had been committed.",

In the Court\u2019s view, when the authorities received the extradition request on 9\u00a0March 2007 and had to decide whether or not to extend the period of the applicant\u2019s detention, they were duty-bound by those provisions to assess whether extradition would be possible. However, neither the prosecutor nor the relevant courts appear to have carried out such an assessment. The Court finds that their failure to do so could not be considered compatible with the requirement of lawfulness and with the purpose of Article 5 of the Convention to protect individuals against arbitrariness.",
