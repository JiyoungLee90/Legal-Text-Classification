The Court is ready to accept that such a procedure does not in itself contradict the principle of legal certainty where it is used to correct miscarriages of justice (see Pravednaya v.\u00a0Russia, no. 69529/01, \u00a7\u00a7 27-28, 18\u00a0November 2004, and Popov v.\u00a0Moldova (no. 2), no.\u00a019960/04, \u00a7 46, 6\u00a0December 2005).

Even though the outcome of the main proceedings was unfavourable to the applicant company, the supplementary judgment of 30\u00a0March 2006 altered a legal situation which was final and resulted in a further loss of property by the applicant company. In such circumstances the Court cannot but find that the partial upholding of company C.\u2019s claims constituted an unjustified interference with the applicant company\u2019s right to property. The applicant company was ordered to pay amounts of money in legal fees in addition to those determined by the final judgment delivered in the main proceedings. Even assuming that such an interference may be regarded as serving a public interest, the Court finds that it was not justified since a fair balance was not preserved and the applicant was required to bear an individual and excessive burden (see, mutatis mutandis, Brum\u0103rescu v.
