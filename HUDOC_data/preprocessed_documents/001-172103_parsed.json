Article 3 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as laying down a general obligation to release a detainee on health grounds or to transfer him to a civil hospital, even if he is suffering from an illness that is particularly difficult to treat. However, this provision does require the State to ensure that prisoners are detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject them to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, their health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see Mouisel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040).",

Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, \u00a7\u00a0116, 29\u00a0November 2007). The authorities must also ensure that a comprehensive record is kept concerning the detainee\u2019s state of health and his or her treatment while in detention (see Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696, \u00a7\u00a083, ECHR 2006-XII), that diagnosis and care are prompt and accurate (see Melnik v.

It is true that the only medical document mentioning the wheelchair is a note made by a psychiatrist on 31 October 2010 (see paragraph 43 above). However, taking into consideration all the available evidence, the Court considers that the applicant must have had difficulties with mobility. In this connection the Court notes that the applicant fell to the floor three times \u2013 once on an unspecified date in cell no. 114 in the Kielce Remand Centre (see paragraph\u00a037 above), once at the police station on 17\u00a0June 2010 (see paragraph\u00a039 above), and once on 31 August 2010 in the corridor in the detention centre (see paragraph 43 above). On 23\u00a0March 2010 (that is to say 10\u00a0days after the applicant\u2019s arrest) the doctor recommended that a hard mattress be provided to him, and on 26\u00a0April 2010 (that is to say some six\u00a0weeks after his arrest and detention in the Kielce Remand Centre) the applicant was prescribed crutches (see paragraph 37 above). Moreover, the fact that the prison authorities first provided the applicant with a wheelchair which could not be safely used and subsequently agreed that another wheelchair could be given to the applicant by his wife indicates in the Court\u2019s view that the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant used the wheelchair only because of his own personal wish is not convincing. In this connection the Court further notes that in their submissions the Government admitted that between 8\u00a0October 2010 and 18 February 2011 the applicant was placed in the Kielce Remand Centre in a cell situated on the first floor and that in that period he had to rely on the assistance of his fellow inmates to be able to access the exercise yard (see paragraphs 59 and 62 above). The Court has already examined a situation in which a detainee with health problems had to rely on the assistance of other inmates and expressed its disapproval of a situation in which the staff of a remand centre feels relieved of its duty to provide security and care to more vulnerable detainees by making their cellmates responsible for providing them with daily assistance (see Kaprykowski v. Poland, no. 23052/05, \u00a7\u00a074, 3\u00a0February 2009). The Court has also criticised schemes whereby a prisoner with a physical disability is provided routine assistance by his fellow inmates, and considered that that must have given rise to considerable anxiety on the applicant\u2019s part and placed him in a position of inferiority vis\u00e0vis the other prisoners (see, Farbtuhs, cited above, \u00a7\u00a060, 2\u00a0December 2004 and D.G. v.\u00a0Poland, no. 45705/07, \u00a7\u00a0147, 12 February 2013).",

Poland (dec.), no. 65653/01, 21 March 2002 and Kaprykowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a075). The Court notes that in fact from the beginning of his detention the applicant consulted on regular basis doctors of various specialisations. It appears that the treatment recommended by the doctors was followed by prison authorities, although it is unclear when (or indeed whether) the applicant received the hard mattress prescribed him on 23\u00a0March 2010. The Court further observes that on 18 February 2011, that is to say 11\u00a0months after his arrest, the applicant was transported to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a prison no. 2 where he underwent treatment in the facility ward where he remained in a cell adjusted to the detainees using wheelchairs. He had the assistance of professional \u201ccarriers\u201d when he wanted to go to the exercise yard. He attended various forms of kinesiotherapy, including exercises to strengthen the muscles of his legs and various other forms of treatment. He also consulted a dermatologist, orthopaedist, neurologist and ophthalmologist.",

However, a few months later, on 16\u00a0October 2011, the doctors for the first time found that the applicant\u2019s state of health constituted an obstacle to his further detention since he needed neurological surgery (see paragraph 24 above). That conclusion was repeated almost a month later in an opinion of a neurologist of 14\u00a0November 2011 which found that the applicant\u2019s further detention and the refusal of treatment might pose a serious danger to his health or even life (see paragraph 27 above). In spite of these opinions, the applicant\u2019s detention was extended on 8\u00a0November 2011, and that extension was upheld on 22\u00a0November 2011. The applicant was released from detention in order for him to be able to undergo surgery on 8\u00a0December\u00a02011, that is to say seven weeks after the issuance of the first opinion indicating that the applicant\u2019s further detention might be harmful to his health. As can be seen from the material at the Court\u2019s disposal and is not contested by the Government, the applicant\u2019s state of health deteriorated while he was in detention.",
