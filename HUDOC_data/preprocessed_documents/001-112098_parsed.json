However, from the documents submitted it follows that these orders were effectively ignored by the investigators and therefore they failed to yield any tangible results. If the applicant had continued to lodge court complaints against the investigators, and if the investigators had actually complied with the courts\u2019 orders and carried out the required steps, it is highly doubtful that the applicant\u2019s complaints would have brought meaningful results, as certain measures that should have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. In addition, the applicant was neither properly informed about the progress of the criminal proceedings nor provided with timely access to the case file (see paragraph 140 above). In such circumstances, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success.",

In their submission to the Court the Government did not contest this information. Furthermore, even if the authorities had been unaware of the abduction prior to June 2002, the delay between the applicant\u2019s written complaint of 2 June 2002 and the opening of the official investigation on 3\u00a0November 2002 comprised more than five months. Such a long delay in reacting to the information concerning a life-threatening crime, along with the subsequent protracted conduct of the criminal proceedings, cannot allow the Court to conclude in the circumstances of the case that it was the applicant\u2019s belated complaint which seriously impeded the conduct of the investigation.",

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee, as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",
