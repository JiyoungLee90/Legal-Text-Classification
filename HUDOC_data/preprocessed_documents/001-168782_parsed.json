Under the Act LXVI of 1997 on the Organisation and Administration of the Courts, the Vice-President was already entitled to act in the stead of the President of the Supreme Court only with regard to managerial tasks at the Supreme Court, but not with regard to his or her functions as President of the National Council of Justice (see Baka, cited above, \u00a7 56). The dissenting judges concluded that the premature termination of the applicant\u2019s term of office had not been sufficiently justified by the reorganisation of the judicial system; and that it had weakened the guarantees in respect of the separation of powers, had been contrary to the prohibition on retroactive legislation, and had breached the principle of the rule of law and the right to a remedy.",

(VII. 17) AB of 16 July 2012 (see paragraph\u00a012 above), any release from his duties as a judge on the basis of the unconstitutional and overturned section 90 (ha) of the ALSRJ was to be considered unlawful within the meaning of section 135 of the same Act (see paragraph\u00a015 above). The K\u00faria was of the view that although the stringent legislation rendered the unlawful dismissal unpreventable by the employer, the termination of the employment relationship nevertheless fell within its scope of activity and this fact excluded the application of the exemption rule contained in section 135 (2) of the ALSRJ. Considering that a person\u2019s work or professional activity was a manifestation of utmost importance of his or her personality, the K\u00faria took the stance that a judge\u2019s unlawful dismissal also violated his or her human dignity and personality rights, as protected by section 75 of the Civil Code. On the basis of that reasoning, it confirmed a judgment under which the employer was to pay 1\u00a0million Hungarian forints (approximately 3,300 euros (EUR)) to the judge concerned in non-pecuniary damages.",

One of them is the overly discretionary interpretation of a legal provision and its application contrary to what that provision explicitly states, or in such an expansive manner that its boundaries become blurred and its content inflated. This particular judgment is a vivid manifestation of such inflation. In it, Article 8 of the Convention is interpreted so broadly that it is capable of covering almost anything, including those fields of life which have until now been conventionally perceived as belonging exclusively or at least primarily to the public domain. Article 8 was intended to protect private life. However, as a result of this and other judgments of the Court in which its applicability has been significantly expanded, it seems to have become all-embracing, because the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d has itself become all-embracing.",

Thus, the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d appears to be not necessarily and/or not always related to \u201cfamily\u201d, \u201chome\u201d or \u201ccorrespondence\u201d and in this sense to have a somewhat autonomous content.

This is a very general statement \u2013 and a cautious one, which allows for the invocation of Article 8 under certain circumstances which have to be established, but does not lend itself to indiscriminate application under any factual circumstances, irrespective of what these may be. A non-mechanistic, non-formalistic \u2013 that is, not blindly dogmatic \u2013 application of this most general doctrinal provision would require that what is \u201cnot excluded in principle\u201d and hence may be closer to an exception is not automatically transformed into a rule, by implying that whenever a person is dismissed from employment or from another official \u2013 which by definition amounts to public \u2013 position, let alone deprived of an function that is \u201cadditional\u201d to his or her principal occupation, that person\u2019s private life is always interfered with. In the present case, for a fair and careful application of the said doctrinal provision it would have been required that the Court (as a minimum) looked into whether the applicant really belonged to the aforementioned \u201cmajority\u201d whose \u201crelationships with the outside world\u201d were \u201csignificant[ly]\u201d developed particularly on account of his holding the post of Vice-President of the Supreme Court and that the dismissal from that post \u201csignificant[ly]\u201d severed his opportunity to develop the said relationships.",

The termination of the applicant\u2019s judicial mandate was another matter; to argue that here there has not been an unlawful interference with the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 8 would run counter to the Court\u2019s most clear case-law as consolidated in Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine (referred to in \u00a7 9 above). With regard to this applicant, however, that issue (dismissal from the judicial service as such) was settled at the national level (see paragraph\u00a0\u00a011 of the judgment). As to the termination of the applicant\u2019s mandate as Vice-President of the Supreme Court, this dismissal could and most probably did bring about some undesirable consequences in his relations with other judges, other legal professionals or other State officials, and perhaps also with certain other people, but my imagination fails to see these developments as a genuine or powerful intrusion into this applicant\u2019s private life \u2013 of course, if private is still considered as something essentially different from (even if not always unrelated to) what is public. Most important is that the applicant himself did not think so. And he was right: a person\u2019s private life would really be poor, feeble and sorrowful if his or her \u201crelationships with the outside world\u201d depended, mainly or to a considerable extent, on him or her holding a certain official position within the administration, irrespective of what branch of power that administration belonged to. Let it be repeated once again that the applicant (as well as his co-applicants) did not initially invoke Article 8. He did not do so until this Court, at the stage of communicating the case, presented him with an either/or alternative: either his case is examined under Article 8, or it is not examined at all.",

The first is that the said \u201cdismissal\u201d encompassed the applicant\u2019s \u201cdismissal\u201d not only from the post of Vice-President of the Supreme Court, but also from the judicial service as such (i.e. from his post as a judge of that court); only later were the applicant\u2019s two complaints pertaining to the two \u201cdismissals\u201d disjoined by the Court. The second circumstance to be taken into account is that this contention was indeed not the applicant\u2019s complaint \u201cproper\u201d, but the joint complaint of as many as twenty-seven co-applicants, only some of whom had previously held, in addition to their judicial function, the posts of court president, vice-president, head or deputy head of division of some court.",

Ukraine and Baka v. Hungary (both cited above). It is not. There are essential, even crucial differences between these two cases and the present one. To begin with, Baka was not an Article 8 case. In that case, the violations found were those of Articles 6 \u00a7 1 and 10, and not of Article\u00a08. And the applicant in Oleksandr Volkov, in which a violation of Article\u00a08 was indeed found (alongside numerous violations of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01), had been dismissed from the post of a judge of the Supreme Court (and only per extentionem from the function of President of the Military Chamber of that court, this latter function being mentioned in passing only once in the entire judgment adopted in that case (see Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a011)). (The applicant in \u00d6zp\u0131nar v. Turkey (referred to in \u00a7 9 above), where a violation of Article 8, taken alone and in conjunction with Article\u00a013, was found, was also a \u201cmere\u201d judge.) One can put and turn and mix things as one likes, and still these two cases, Oleksandr Volkov and Baka, even taken together (or perhaps especially taken together), do not suggest in the least that the premature termination of the applicant\u2019s function as Vice-President of the Supreme Court, which in this applicant\u2019s case preceded his dismissal from judicial service as such, amounted to interference with his rights under Article 8.",

If, however, a violation of the Convention has taken place with regard to the dismissal in question, it must have been a violation not of Article 8, but of some other provision(s) of the Convention.
