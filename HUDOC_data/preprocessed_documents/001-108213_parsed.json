In the latter respect, the Court considers that, even though the courts have several times applied compulsory summonses on the witnesses failing to appear, they have also had at their disposal other effective mechanisms to ensure the witnesses\u2019 presence, including administrative penalties (see Kobtsev v. Ukraine, no.\u00a07324/02, \u00a7\u00a031, 4 April 2006). It was not suggested by the Government that the courts have ever considered applying them. Nor have the majority of the summonses seemed to have any effect (see Kobtsev v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a071).
