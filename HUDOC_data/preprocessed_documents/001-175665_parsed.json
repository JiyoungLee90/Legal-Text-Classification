Russia (no.\u00a057519/09, 5\u00a0February 2015) that a delay in commencing a criminal investigation into credible assertions by the applicant (in that case amounting to five months) had had an unavoidable and significant adverse impact on the investigation, considerably undermining the investigating authority\u2019s ability to secure evidence of the alleged illtreatment (ibid., \u00a7\u00a061).",

The proceedings were subsequently suspended on sixteen occasions in the period between 12\u00a0January 2008 and 10\u00a0May 2012 on the grounds of it being impossible to identify those responsible for the applicant\u2019s injuries, and they appear to be ongoing to the present day (see paragraphs 26-53 above). Several initial decisions suspending the proceedings were taken without basic investigative measures to establish the circumstances of the alleged ill-treatment (see paragraphs 26, 31, 34, 36 and\u00a038 above). In particular, the applicant was not given victim status and questioned as a victim until four months after the institution of criminal proceedings (see paragraph 33 above). The police officers whom the applicant indicated as the alleged perpetrators were questioned quite late in the proceedings: Officer Ch. was questioned two months after the institution of criminal proceedings, Officer K. almost eight months after and Officer S. two years and eight months after the institution of criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 30, 37 and 51 above). The questioning of other witnesses who had seen the applicant during his arrest and of those who had seen him at the police station thereafter was not carried out with due swiftness either (see paragraphs 35, 39 and 41 above). It took the domestic authorities over a year and seven months to address the contradictory results of the applicant\u2019s psychiatric expert examinations of 4\u00a0October 2007 and 28\u00a0October 2008 (see paragraph 47 above).",
