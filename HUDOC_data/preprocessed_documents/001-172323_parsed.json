Individuals are targeted for identity checks in public places such as markets and railway stations, notably on the basis of their skin colour or their \u201cnon-Slavic\u201d appearance. While the authorities emphasise that such cases are rare, this is not the perception of persons belonging to the groups concerned, who report that they are regularly harassed by the police. Such practices shake the confidence of ethnic minorities and non-nationals in the police, who are perceived by these vulnerable groups as a threat rather than as the guarantors of their rights. As noted elsewhere in this report, this contributes to significant under-reporting of racist attacks against persons coming within ECRI\u2019s mandate, meaning that justice is not done in individual cases and creating a sense of impunity for the perpetrators. ECRI notes with interest that the authorities have been implementing joint activities with international partners since 2009 to review the relevant legal framework in place and provide training to law enforcement officers on combating racism and xenophobia; it stresses the importance of following up on these activities by enacting any legislative changes identified as necessary. It also emphasises that more vigorous efforts are needed to combat racial profiling, first because it directly discriminates against the persons concerned and second because its consequence is to expose members of minority groups to a greater risk of racist attacks...\u201d",

At the time when he was bound he was already at the police station under police control and was not committing any other administrative offence (this is evidenced by the fact that there was no record of any administrative offence committed by him inside the police station). Accordingly, none of the grounds for binding hands and feet provided for in the Police Act (see\u00a0paragraph 39 above) had existed, and the action had therefore been unlawful.

The method of binding used by the police usually involved tying hands and feet together behind the back in a so-called \u201chogtie\u201d.

Furthermore, it is observed that Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio. Where the events at issue lie within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see\u00a0ElMasri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no.\u00a039630/09, \u00a7\u00a7 151 and 152, ECHR 2012, with further case-law references).",

In particular, they neglected to question the officers accused by the applicant on this precise point and to establish whether they had been involved in similar incidents in the past (compare Nachova, cited above, \u00a7 167). It would appear that, in dismissing the applicant\u2019s allegations, the authorities relied solely on the statements of the arresting officers, who denied that their actions had been motivated by ethnic prejudice. However, the applicant apparently did not accuse those officers of any prejudice and his complaint in this respect referred only to the officers who had allegedly ill-treated him at the police station. Moreover, there was no suggestion that the arresting officers even witnessed any of the events at the police station or otherwise had any knowledge of them. By contrast, the officers who had actually been involved in the events were apparently never questioned on this specific point.",
