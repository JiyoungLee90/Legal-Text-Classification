The case originated in an application (no. 30811/11) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Şirin Taş (“the applicant”), on 7 March 2011.
The applicant was represented by Ms N. Selçuk, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 5 February 2015 the complaint concerning the lack of legal assistance available to the applicant during police custody was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
On 12 October 2016 the Vice-President of the Second Section invited the Government to submit further observations, if they wished, in the light of the judgment in Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, ECHR 2016.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Muş.
On 19 April 2003 the applicant was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation.
On 20 April 2003 the applicant’s statements were taken by the police in the absence of a lawyer. During the interrogation, the applicant gave a detailed account of his acts within the illegal organisation PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party).
On 22 April 2003 the applicant was heard by the public prosecutor and the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court, again in the absence of a lawyer. In his statements before both the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, the applicant denied the accusations and maintained that his statements to the police had been given under duress. On the same day, upon the order of the investigating judge, the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention.
On 6 May 2003 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment accusing the applicant of membership of an illegal terrorist organisation under Article 168 of the former Criminal Code, Law no. 765.
The State Security Courts were later abolished by Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, and the case was transferred to the Istanbul Assize Court.
On 19 September 2006, relying on, inter alia, the applicant’s statements to the police, the Istanbul Assize Court convicted the applicant under Article 314 § 2 of the new Turkish Criminal Code and sentenced him to six years and three months’ imprisonment.
On 19 November 2007 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment on procedural grounds.
On 30 December 2008 the Istanbul Assize Court convicted the applicant again under Article 314 § 2 of the new Turkish Criminal Code and sentenced him to six years and three months’ imprisonment.
On 20 March 2012 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Istanbul Assize Court.
A description of the relevant domestic law concerning the right of access to a lawyer may be found in Salduz v. Turkey ([GC] no. 36391/02, §§ 2731, ECHR 2008).
On 15 July 2003 Law no. 4928 repealed Section 31 of Law no. 3842, whereby the restriction on an accused’s right of access to a lawyer in proceedings before the State Security Courts was lifted.
