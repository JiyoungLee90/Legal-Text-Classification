They considered that the measure imposed on them had not been necessary in a democratic society and that it was incompatible with the principle of proportionality. Lastly, the first applicant party observed that the acts referred to in the judgment of the Spanish Supreme Court of 27 March 2003 against the applicant parties had taken place one year before the LOPP had come into force, and that Herri Batasuna had been dissolved even though the Supreme Court had not found it guilty of any such act occurring after the relevant Law had come into force.

According to the explanatory memorandum, the Law is based on the principle that any project or objective is constitutional provided that it is not pursued by means of activities which breach democratic principles or the fundamental rights of citizens. The Law is not intended to prohibit the defence of ideas or doctrines calling into question the constitutional framework. Its aim is rather to reconcile freedom and pluralism with respect for human rights and the protection of democracy. The explanatory memorandum states that a party may be dissolved only in the event of repeated or accumulated acts which unequivocally prove the existence of undemocratic conduct at odds with democracy and in breach of constitutional values, democracy and the rights of citizens. In that connection, sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 2 of section 9 draw a clear distinction between organisations which defend their ideas or programmes, whatever they may be, in strict compliance with democratic methods and principles, and those whose political activity is based on an accommodation with violence, political support for terrorist organisations or violation of the rights of citizens or democratic principles.",

The judgment delivered by the Supreme Court upon completion of those proceedings may be challenged only by way of an amparo appeal to the . Section 12 details the effects of the court-ordered dissolution of a political party. Once the judgment has been served, the dissolved party must cease all activity. Furthermore, it may not set up a political organisation or use an existing party with a view to pursuing the activities of the party that has been declared illegal and dissolved. In order to rule as to whether or not there is any continuity between an existing party and a party which has been dissolved, the Supreme Court has regard to whether any \u201csubstantial similarity\u201d exists between the structure, organisation and operation of the parties in question, or other evidence such as the identity of their members or leaders, their funding or their support for violence or terrorism.

Despite the fact that the legal significance of those references can be grasped only in the context of each of the provisions containing them and that each of the provisions in question must in turn be interpreted in the light of the law and of the legal system as a whole, the Basque government\u2019s submission that there is no place, in our constitutional order, for a model of \u2018militant democracy\u2019 within the meaning given to that expression by the Government, namely, a model in which not only compliance with, but also positive acceptance of, the established order and first and foremost the Constitution is required, must be endorsed ... The impugned Law allows for no such model of democracy. Right at the outset, the explanatory memorandum lays down the principle of a distinction between the ideas and aims proclaimed by political parties, on the one hand, and their activities, on the other, and states that \u2018the only aims explicitly vetoed are those which fall within the criminal law\u2019, so that \u2018any project or objective is deemed to be constitutional provided that it is not pursued by means of activities which breach democratic principles or the fundamental rights of citizens\u2019. Consequently, and as regards the aspect which is of particular interest here, the Law lists as grounds for illegality \u2018conduct\u2019 \u2013 that is to say, acts \u2013 of political parties which, through their activities, and not through the ultimate aims proclaimed in their manifestos, fail to satisfy the requirements of Article 6 of the Constitution, which the impugned Law merely mentions.",

Paragraph 2 provides that a political party may be declared illegal only \u2018when as a result of its activities, it infringes democratic principles, in particular when it seeks thereby to impair or to destroy the system of liberties, to hinder or to put an end to the democratic system by repeatedly and seriously engaging in any of the conduct described below\u2019.

In order for that measure to be pronounced, as stated in section 9(2), the conduct in question must be engaged in \u2018repeatedly and seriously\u2019. Secondly, it must be pointed out that the existence of a party which, through its activities, collaborates with or supports terrorist violence, jeopardises the survival of the pluralist order proclaimed by the Constitution and that, faced with that danger, dissolution would appear to be the only sanction capable of repairing the damage done to the legal order. Lastly, it must be stressed that Article 6 of the Constitution contains a definition of a party. According to the Constitution, a party may only be considered a party if it is the expression of political pluralism. Consequently, it is quite acceptable, constitutionally, for a party whose activities undermine pluralism and to a greater or lesser extent destabilise the democratic order, to be dissolved. Similarly, the European Court of Human Rights has considered that even though the margin of appreciation left to States must be a narrow one where the dissolution of political parties is concerned, where the pluralism of ideas and parties inherent in democracy is in danger, a State may forestall the execution of a policy at the root of that danger [Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v.

To conclude, [the relevant provisions] describe particularly serious conduct and establish as grounds for dissolution only those which are manifestly incompatible with the peaceful and lawful means which are an essential part of the process of political participation to which the Constitution requires political parties to lend their qualified support. ... The criteria established by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights as regards the dissolution of political parties have therefore been complied with (United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I; Socialist Party and Others v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, Reports 1998III; Freedom and Democracy Party (\u00d6ZDEP) v.

That case-law states that in order to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights, the dissolution of a party must satisfy certain criteria, namely: (a) the law must include the circumstances and causes of dissolution (that criterion is clearly satisfied by the rules at issue, since they are set out in a formal law); (b) the aim pursued must be legitimate (which, as indicated above, consists in the instant case of protecting the democratic process of political participation through the exclusion of any associative organisation which could be likened to a party exercising an activity not falling within the constitutional definition of political parties); and (c) the dissolution must be \u2018necessary in a democratic society\u2019 (demonstrated in the context of the foregoing analysis of the specific causes of dissolution provided for by law).",

The failure to condemn terrorist actions also constitutes a tacit or implicit manifestation of a certain attitude towards terror. ... Against a backdrop of terrorism that has been in place for over thirty years, with those responsible always legitimising terror by claiming equality between the types of forces fighting each other and by presenting it as the only possible solution to an allegedly historical conflict, the refusal of a party to condemn a specific terrorist attack, which undeniably reflects that party\u2019s wish to disassociate itself from the condemnatory stance taken by other parties in relation to such acts, is all the more significant since it reflects the position of a party which has sought to pass off the terrorist phenomenon as an inevitable reaction to the past and unjust aggression of a terrorised State. ... Furthermore, ... the refusal to condemn [terrorist acts], combined with serious and repeated acts and conduct, indicates an accommodation with terror which runs counter to organised coexistence in the context of a democratic State. ...

It distinguishes two types of conduct in issue here, namely, conduct having encouraged a climate of social confrontation and conduct having implicitly supported ETA\u2019s terrorist activities. It notes, in particular, that during the demonstration organised by Batasuna in San Sebastian on 11 August 2002 and led by A.O., J.P. and J.A., the party leaders, not only had slogans in support of ETA prisoners been heard, but also threatening expressions such as \u201cborroka da bide bakarra\u201d (struggle is the only way), \u201czuek faxistak zarete terroristak\u201d (you, the Fascists, are the real terrorists) or \u201cgora ETA militarra\u201d (long live ETA military).

Lastly, the Court notes the attendance of a Batasuna councillor at a pro-ETA demonstration, the fact that ETA terrorists had been made honorary citizens of towns run by the applicant parties and that the anagram of the organisation \u201cGestoras Pro-Amnist\u00eda\u201d, declared illegal by central investigating judge no. 5 at the Audiencia Nacional and included on the European list of terrorist organisations (Council Common Position 2001/931/PESC), had been posted on the website of the second applicant party.",

Moreover, the Court cannot consider that the impugned conduct was covered by the protection afforded to freedom of expression, as claimed by the applicant parties, since the methods used fell outside the bounds set by the Court\u2019s case-law, namely the lawfulness of the means used to exercise that right and their compatibility with fundamental democratic principles.",
