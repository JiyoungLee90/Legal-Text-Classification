However, the schoolbook distribution sector in itself was an unregulated market. The schoolbook distributors\u2019 clients were the schools, which, in an often highly competitive market, were able to select the publishers and schoolbook distributors, the former for the products they offered and the latter mainly for their reliability and accessibility and for the discounts promoted.",

Besides their regular staff, ranging from three to fifty-seven employees, they employed an additional ten to thirty seasonal workers, normally students, for the compilation of schoolbook packages. Larger market participants generally had their own vehicles and storage bases where they performed both retail and wholesale activities. These companies bought the books from the publishers and made them available to the smaller distributors. There were well over thirty market-dominant schoolbook distributors operating in the country (six large and about thirty medium-sized distributors).",

It found that the State had failed to properly implement an EU Directive, and that this omission had had repercussions on the claimant\u2019s private life. Therefore, the State\u2019s responsibility could in principle be engaged; however, the K\u00faria dismissed the claim for damages because the Civil Code did not contain any provision on the direct liability of the legislature. The Court is thus not persuaded that in the present case an action in damages on the basis of a breach of EU law would have been a remedy capable of providing redress for the applicant companies\u2019 complaints and offering reasonable prospects of success (see Sejdovic v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a056581/00, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2006-II).",

Greece [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7 54, ECHR 1999II). Rights akin to property rights have existed in cases where, by dint of their own work, the applicants concerned had built up a clientele. This clientele had, in many respects, the nature of a private right and constituted an asset, and hence a possession within the meaning of the first sentence of Article\u00a01 (see Van\u00a0Marle and Others v. the Netherlands, 26 June 1986, \u00a7\u00a041, Series A no. 101, and Malik v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 23780/08, \u00a7 89, 13 March 2012). The applicability of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 extends, among others, to professional practices, their clientele and their goodwill, as these are entities of a certain worth that have in many respects the nature of private rights, and thus constitute assets, being possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of this provision (see Van Marle and Others, cited above, \u00a7 41; D\u00f6ring v. Germany (dec.), no.\u00a037595/97, ECHR 1999-VIII; Wendenburg and Others v.

The Court has held, for example, that operating a cinema for eleven years without the interference of the authorities had resulted in the creation of a clientele which constituted an asset (see Iatridis, cited above, \u00a7 54). The Court has also held that an applicant could be said to have an existing possession in respect of providing funeral services during a period of legal vacuum (see Okle\u0161en and Pokopali\u0161ko Pogrebne Storitve Leopold Okle\u0161en S.P., cited above, \u00a7\u00a058).",

The Court is therefore convinced that the clientele \u2013 although somewhat volatile in nature \u2013 was an essential basis for the applicant companies\u2019 established business, which cannot, in the nature of things, be easily benefited from in other trading activities. Indeed, the applicant companies\u2019 lost clientele has in many respects the nature of a private right, and thus constitutes an asset, being a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Van Marle and Others, D\u00f6ring, and Wendenburg and Others, all cited above).

On the contrary, in terms of market reality, the Court considers that the State, through the New Regulations, stopped the applicant companies from continuing their business operations and in fact created a monopolised market in schoolbook distribution. The monopolised nature of the market was confirmed and strengthened by the subsequent legislation (see Act no.\u00a0CCXXXII of 2013 on Schoolbook Supply in the National Public Education System, cited in paragraph 19 above). The Court observes that, although there was no formal withdrawal of a licence (compare and contrast Tre Trakt\u00f6rer AB, cited above, \u00a7 53, and V\u00e9kony, cited above, \u00a7 29), the New Regulations introduced a system of schoolbook procurement where, inevitably, the applicant companies\u2019 entire clientele was taken over by the State-owned K\u00f6nyvt\u00e1rell\u00e1t\u00f3. As of the 2013/14 school year, the applicant companies were practically excluded from schoolbook distribution contracts.",

No evidence was provided that the applicant companies or their representatives or any other schoolbook distributors or their representatives were ever charged, let alone found guilty, of any unlawful or improper conduct with respect to their professional activities in the schoolbook distribution market. More generally, no statistical or other evidence was produced to demonstrate that such a practice existed and, if so, its real impact on the schoolbook distribution market in Hungary. Secondly, the Government\u2019s line of reasoning does not exclude the possibility that the same unethical conduct might occur with the State-run company, which might take decisions, or influence the taking of decisions by others, strictly on the basis of a cost-effectiveness analysis and not on the basis of professional educational standards.

I am not insensitive to the Government\u2019s concern about possible shortcomings in the public education management system that may eventually reinforce social inequalities between pupils coming from well-off and poor families, create regional inequalities between urban and rural areas and hinder mobility in the public education system. The public education system has an important role in levelling the playing field between pupils coming from well-off and poor families and between pupils coming from urban and rural areas.

For instance, in paragraphs 52 and 56 of the judgment, the impugned legislative intervention is held to be not \u201cjustified in itself\u201d (emphasis added) and \u201carbitrary\u201d; the latter label is also present in paragraph 59, which concludes the reasoning.

Legal scholars have expressed strong scepticism about the idea that clientele may be the object of a subjective right (see, for instance, P. Roubier, Droits subjectifs et situations juridiques, Dalloz, Paris 2015, p. 352). In many European States it is neither a subjective right nor a possession.

Such entrepreneurs might have invested considerable sums over several years preparing to enter an existing market, relying upon the assumption that the existing regulations will be maintained. Yet the recourse to the notion of clientele will leave them outside the scope of any Convention protection. The approach adopted by the Court is therefore fundamentally unjust because it protects only the established market operators, and may even protect those operators to the detriment of newcomers. Under the approach adopted, rent-suppressing and market-restoring measures, which by their very nature affect established clientele, require special justification whereas the opposite should apply: the preservation of existing market distortions should require justification under the Convention.

This is indeed a relevant factor which has to be taken into account. I welcome the fact that the Court decided to introduce an economic rationality analysis as part of the proportionality assessment under Article 1 of Protocol 1. It is a major and positive development in human rights adjudication. Economically irrational interference with economic liberty cannot be justified under the Convention. At the same time, I consider that the concrete argument put forward is not decisive. Firstly, the economic rationality analysis should be carried out in a broader context; otherwise the balancing exercise becomes irrational. The Government argued that the reform measures had resulted in a broader group of parents having access to schoolbooks financed by the State. This element and other elements of the reform seen as a whole should also have been examined by the Court for the purpose of the proportionality assessment. Secondly, it is not clear whether the methodology of determining the maximum schoolbook prices has changed with the reform. The Court should also have established the actual pricing policy applied by the new distributor, and whether the margin guaranteed by law to the new State-owned distributor was effectively applied in practice or whether the newly created company provided schoolbooks to parents below the maximum price. Thirdly, before the reform the distributors offered a commission to schools in exchange for certain services (see paragraph 39 of the judgment). It is not clear to what extent the reform enabled the schools to get rid of these burdensome tasks and allocate the corresponding resources for educational purposes.",
