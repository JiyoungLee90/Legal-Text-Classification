The Law further provides a remedy for all those prisoners who had previously lodged objections with the enforcement judges concerning disciplinary sanctions imposed on them before the enactment of this Law (provisional section 1). Accordingly, those who had previously lodged objections with enforcement judges against a prison disciplinary sanction have the possibility of lodging a fresh objection with the enforcement judge within six months of the enactment of this Law, and their cases will be dealt with in accordance with the new procedures.",

However, the restriction of the applicant\u2019s right to private communication with his lawyer was not ordered on the basis of the disciplinary regulations and has never been classified as a disciplinary sanction. This was also confirmed by the approach of the Edirne Enforcement Court in its decision of 6 December 2010, which explicitly referred to the restriction as not being a disciplinary measure (see paragraph 17 above). What is more, the Government have argued in their observations concerning the merits of the application that the measure in question could not be classified as a disciplinary sanction (see paragraph 61 below). In any event, the Court notes that the Government have failed to provide any explanation as to how a complaint to the Compensation Commission, which does not have the competence to quash court decisions or order new measures, could have put an end to the continuing situation, or to the kind of redress which the applicant could have been afforded as a result of the complaint.

That provision only allowed a restriction to be placed on communications between a prisoner and his or her lawyer when it had become evident from the documents that the lawyer-client relationship was serving as a means of communication with a terrorist organisation, which had not been the case here. Moreover, it had become clear from the decision of the Compensation Commission that the decision of 25 August 2005 not to hand over the books and materials in question to the applicant had not been justified by relevant and sufficient reasons and had contravened the applicant\u2019s right to receive information. In so far as there had not been a justified basis for the decision of 25 August 2005 which had been used as a justification for the decision of 23\u00a0September 2005, the applicant maintained that his right to confidential communication with his lawyer amounted to an unlawful interference with his rights under Article 8 of the Convention. As regards the findings of the authorities that the applicant\u2019s lawyer\u2019s conduct had been incompatible with the profession of a lawyer, the applicant argued that neither the prison authorities nor the Enforcement Court were the competent authorities to determine what constituted incompatible conduct on the part of a lawyer. Such a complaint could only be determined by the relevant Bar association.",

Article 8 protects the right to personal development, whether in terms of personality or of personal autonomy, which is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the Article 8 guarantees. It encompasses the right for each individual to approach others in order to establish and develop relationships with them and with the outside world, that is, the right to a \u201cprivate social life\u201d, and may include professional activities or activities taking place in a public context (see B\u0103rbulescu v. Romania [GC], no. 61496/08, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, 5\u00a0September 2017). There is, therefore, a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d (see Uzun v. Germany, no. 35623/05, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2010 (extracts), with further references). The Court further considers that a person\u2019s communication with a lawyer in the context of legal assistance falls within the scope of private life since the purpose of such interaction is to allow an individual to make informed decisions about his or her life. More often than not, the information communicated to the lawyer involves intimate and personal matters or sensitive issues. It therefore follows that whether in the context of assistance for civil or criminal litigation or in the context of seeking general legal advice, individuals who consult a lawyer can reasonably expect that their communication is private and confidential.",

The Court has previously held, in the context of Articles 8 and 6, that confidential communication with one\u2019s lawyer is protected by the Convention as an important safeguard of the right to defence (see Apostu v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a022765/12, \u00a7 96, 3 February 2015, with reference to Campbell, cited above, \u00a7 46). In Beuze v. Belgium ([GC], no. 71409/10, \u00a7\u00a0133, 9 November 2018, and the cases cited therein), the Court stressed the importance of a prisoner\u2019s right to communicate with counsel out of earshot of the prison authorities in the context of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(c) of the Convention. In the Court\u2019s view, prisoners may feel inhibited in discussing with their lawyers in the presence of an official not only matters relating to pending litigation but also in reporting abuses they may be suffering through fear of retaliation. The Court further observes that the privilege of the lawyer-client relationship and the national authorities\u2019 obligation to ensure the privacy of communications between a prisoner and his or her chosen representative are among recognised international norms (see paragraphs 32-34 above).",

It noted in that connection that the borderline between correspondence concerning contemplated litigation and that of a general nature was especially difficult to draw and correspondence with a lawyer could concern matters which had little or nothing to do with litigation (ibid., \u00a7 48). The Court considers that this principle applies a fortiori to oral, face-to-face communication with a lawyer. It therefore follows that in principle oral communication, as well as correspondence between a lawyer and his or her client, is privileged under Article 8 of the Convention.",

The Court further notes that the margin of appreciation of the respondent State in the assessment of the permissible limits of interference with the privacy of consultation and communication with a lawyer is narrow in that only exceptional circumstances, such as to prevent the commission of serious crime or major breaches of prison safety and security, might justify the necessity of limitation of these rights. For instance, in the context of persons deprived of their liberty for terrorist activities, the Court has held that they cannot be excluded from the scope of the provisions of the Convention and the essence of their rights and freedoms recognised by the latter must not be infringed; the national authorities can impose \u201clegitimate restrictions\u201d on them inasmuch as those restrictions are strictly necessary to protect society against violence (see \u00d6calan v.

They ruled in that connection that the lawyer\u2019s behaviour had been incompatible with the profession of a lawyer in so far as she had sent books and periodicals to the applicant which had not related to his defence. The Court observes, however, that section 59 of Law no.\u00a05275 is an exceptional provision which contains an exhaustive list of circumstances in which the confidentiality of lawyer-client communication may be restricted. In accordance with that provision, only when it is apparent from documents or other material that the privilege enjoyed by a prisoner and his or her lawyer is being used as a means for communication with a terrorist organisation, or for the commission of a crime or otherwise jeopardises the security of the institution, may the presence of a prison official during lawyer-client meetings be ordered. The interception of correspondence solely because it does not relate to the rights of the defence is not provided for in section 59 as a ground for restricting the confidentiality of consultations with a lawyer. To conclude otherwise would run counter to the plain meaning of the text of the provision and would mean that any correspondence from a lawyer which is not defence-related could result in such a serious measure being imposed, without a limitation in duration. Having regard to the circumstances of the present case, the Court concludes that although the letter and spirit of the domestic provision in force at the time of the events were sufficiently precise \u2013 save for the lack of temporal limits to the restriction \u2013 its interpretation and application by the Edirne Enforcement Court in the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case were manifestly unreasonable and thus not foreseeable within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.

Thus the substance of the right in question, which concerns the applicant\u2019s ability to converse in private with his lawyer, is of a predominantly personal and individual character, a factor that brings the present dispute closer to the civil sphere. Since a restriction on either party\u2019s ability to confer in full confidentiality with each other would frustrate much of the usefulness of the exercise of this right, the Court concludes that private-law aspects of the dispute predominate over the public-law ones.",

The only exception to this rule concerned objections against disciplinary penalties, where a hearing would be held.

They also argued that in certain proceedings, such as those in the present case, the demands of efficiency and economy could justify dispensing with a hearing. They maintained in that connection that if each application submitted to an enforcement court were to be examined by holding a hearing, thousands of detainees and convicts would frequently be required to go outside prison institutions, and that, leaving aside the question of economic hardship, this would jeopardise security and discipline within such institutions.",

This does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases. The overarching principle of fairness embodied in Article 6 is, as always, the key consideration (see Jussila, cited above, \u00a7 42, and the cases cited therein). Furthermore, the Court has previously held that the lack of a hearing at a lower level of jurisdiction may be remedied by an appellate court as long as it has full jurisdiction to review the facts and law of the dispute (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e S\u00e1 v. Portugal, cited above, \u00a7 192 with further references).",

The Court also does not rule out that a simplified procedure might be conducted via written proceedings provided that they comply with the principles of a fair trial as guaranteed under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, P\u00f6nk\u00e4 v. Estonia, no. 64160/11, \u00a7 30, 8 November 2016). However, even under such a procedure, parties must at least have the opportunity to request a public hearing, even though the court may refuse the application and hold the hearing in private (see, mutatis mutandis, Martinie v. France [GC], no.\u00a058675/00, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2006-VI).",

Under domestic legislation, the proceedings before enforcement courts and subsequently before the assize courts were carried out on the basis of the case file and neither the applicant nor his chosen representative could attend the sittings in those courts. It is therefore of little importance that the applicant did not explicitly request a hearing, as the relevant procedural rules did not require one except in the case of disciplinary sanctions. Although the Government argued that the applicant could have requested that the Edirne Assize Court hold a hearing, the Court is not persuaded that any such application would have had any prospects of success. In that connection, the Government have not submitted any examples in a similar context where an assize court held a hearing in reviewing the decision of an enforcement court. Secondly, the relevant rules concerning the procedure before assize courts in these types of disputes indicate that the question of holding a hearing is a matter decided by the assize courts of their own motion (see paragraph 26 above). In other words, it was not up to the applicant to request a hearing (contrast the position in D\u00f6ry, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 38). The Court therefore finds that he cannot reasonably be considered to have waived his right to an oral hearing before the Edirne Assize Court.",

In that connection, the decision of 23 September 2005 to restrict the applicant\u2019s right to confidential meetings with his lawyer was taken by the Edirne Enforcement Court in a non-adversarial manner without obtaining the applicant\u2019s defence submissions. Lastly, the applicant\u2019s objections to that decision before the Edirne Assize Court were also determined on the basis of the case file alone without holding a hearing, even though the objections concerned factual and legal issues. The Court refers in particular to the submissions made by the applicant before the Edirne Assize Court concerning the nature of the publications sent by his lawyer and the alleged practice of the authorities in allowing representatives to bring in non-prohibited items to convicted prisoners for the sake of convenience. The Court further notes that the Assize Court had full jurisdiction to assess the facts and the legal aspects of the case and could have given a final decision by setting aside the decision of the Edirne Enforcement Court had it allowed the applicant\u2019s objection. In the Court\u2019s view, the holding of a hearing would therefore have allowed the assize court to form its own impression of the sufficiency of the factual basis for the consideration of the case, as well as the legal issues raised by the applicant.",
