In particular, he had amended and further particularised his claim on a number of occasions, two of which after the Convention had entered into force in respect of Montenegro; several hearings scheduled between 1983 and 2002 had been adjourned because of him; and the impugned proceedings had been stayed between 23 September 1985 and 6 January 1986 due to his absence (see paragraphs 9, and 16-17 above). Thirdly, Y and Z had passed away in the meantime (see paragraph 20 above), which required that their legal successors be identified, which added to the overall length of the proceedings. Lastly, the impugned proceedings were of no vital importance to the applicant and, as such, did not require priority or any urgent action on the part of the courts.

Some States have fully understood the situation by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation (see Scordino v.
