It stated that the police had received intelligence reports that hooligan groups from both countries were set on fighting each other on the match day. The risk of fighting was increased by the fact that the match would not start until 8\u00a0p.m., leaving considerable time for each group to consume alcoholic beverages beforehand. In order to prevent such clashes, the plan was to start engaging in proactive dialogue from 12 noon, when the first fans/spectators appeared, and in the event of clashes, first to arrest the instigators under section 755 of the Administration of Justice Act and charge them or, if that was not possible, to detain the instigators by virtue of section 5(3) of the Police Act. Since detention under the latter provision, as far as possible, should not exceed six hours, the memorandum specifically stated that it was preferable to avoid detaining anyone too early during the day, since they would then have to be released during or after the game, with the possibility that they would head for the city centre again and resume their involvement in brawls. At 3.41 p.m. the first big fight started between Danish and Swedish supporters at Amagertorv Square, on Str\u00f8get in the centre of Copenhagen, resulting in five or six individuals being detained, including the second and third applicants. Subsequently, elsewhere, other supporters were detained, including the first applicant. Up until the start of the match, further individuals who instigated and directed fights were detained, but the manoeuvre tactics continued to be a dialogue to ensure that the large number of supporters behaved and made their way to the stadium to watch the match. After the match, another large brawl started in the city centre, resulting in further detentions of a large group of Swedish and Danish supporters/hooligans.",

The police had already deployed forces and divided them into groups at around 2\u00a0p.m. on the basis of intelligence that the spectators would arrive early to go partying. They had managed to locate the groups of fans by means of their spotters, and it had turned out that the fans were divided into a Swedish and a Danish group. They had seen the first large fight between Danish and Swedish hooligans at around 3.40 p.m. The fight had occurred in the central part of Str\u00f8get, the pedestrian shopping street, outside bar D, where the Swedish group had settled down. Prior to the fight, they had located the Danish groups in the central courtyard of Boltens G\u00e5rd.

Ten additional police officers were there to help. One of his tasks had been to make sure that the six-hour rule was observed. They had been faced with the issue that the six-hour period applicable to two of the persons detained under the Police Act expired at 9.50 p.m. He had contacted the control-room supervisor before the expiry of this period. Concurrently, clashes had been starting in the streets, and the control-room supervisor had decided not to let the relevant persons out. They had not wanted to add fuel to the fire. This decision had been made by the supervisors because he himself did not have the power to make such a decision. He had talked to the control room many times during that evening from 9.30\u00a0p.m. onwards. Very many detainees had been brought to the police station up until around 11 p.m., reaching a total of 136 detainees. Half of them had been detained under the Police Act. He had regularly asked when they should start releasing the detainees. He had not called and asked about specific names, but a general assessment had been made on an ongoing basis for all detainees from the time when the statutory six-hour periods started to expire. The radio communication had made it possible for him to keep updated about when things started calming down after the arrests of people in the Boltens G\u00e5rd courtyard, and finally it had been confirmed that he could start releasing the persons detained under the Police Act. He did not keep a log of all telephone calls and was therefore unable to give the exact time. As far as he recalled, there had probably been one detainee under 18 years old who had been fetched by his parents before the end of the six-hour period, but otherwise no one else had been let out before the two initial detainees. It could very well have happened that some of his colleagues had started taking people out of the cells before the end of the six-hour period when they had received the information from the control room, because everybody was highly aware of the six-hour rule. If the persons concerned had subsequently been returned to their cells, the reason was an order from the control room saying that they should continue to be detained.\u201d",

The purpose of a detention under section 5(3) is not to bring the person before a judge, neither to assess the lawfulness of a continued detention. The lawfulness may, however, subsequently be subject to judicial review. According to the preparatory notes on the Police Act, detention based on section 5(3) of the Police Act may not take place for the purpose of investigating or initiating criminal measures. The condition that the person must be causing a \u201crisk or danger\u201d implies that a concrete and imminent risk of disturbance of public order or of danger to the safety of individuals or public security must have been ascertained. What is crucial is the probability that the risk or danger will occur if the police do not intervene. The fact that a person is a well-known troublemaker does not as such justify such measures. Prior knowledge of a person or a group of persons may, however, be taken into account, together with the current circumstances. Whether the risk or danger is sufficient to justify a measure depends on an assessment made by the police of the individual situation. As to the wording \u201cshould not extend beyond six hours where possible\u201d, the preparatory notes point out that the period should be reckoned from the time when the detention is effected. Any time spent on transfer to a police station must therefore be included in the calculation of the detention period.

It would be perverse if it were the law that in such circumstances, in order to be lawfully able to detain the person so as to prevent their imminently committing an offence, the police must harbour a purpose of continuing the detention, after the risk had passed, until such time as the person could be brought before a court with a view to being bound over to keep the peace in future.

I agree therefore with Judges Lemmens and J\u00e4derblom in para 5 of their judgment in Ostendorf (cited at para 25 above) that in the case of an early release from detention for preventive purposes, it is enough for guaranteeing the rights inherent in article 5 if the lawfulness of the detention can subsequently be challenged and decided by a court.",

I have no disagreement with the Court of Appeal that the appellants would have been brought before a court to determine the legality of their continued detention, if it had been considered necessary to detain them long enough for this to happen. The case would then have been materially similar to Nicol and Selvanayagam, where the applicants\u2019 initial detention was preventive and they were later kept in custody and brought before the court to be bound over. It would be contrary to the spirit and underlying objective of article 5 if the appellants\u2019 early release placed them in a stronger position to complain of a breach of article 5 than if it had been decided to detain them for longer in order to take them before magistrates to be bound over.",

As to article 5.1(b), I am inclined to the same view as the minority in Ostendorf that the obligation has to be much more specific than a general obligation not to commit a criminal offence (or, in this case, a breach of the peace), and that such a general obligation does not acquire the necessary degree of specificity by focusing narrowly on the particular facts or by the person concerned being given a reminder of it in specific circumstances. There are also practical considerations. The police may find it necessary to take action to prevent an imminent breach of the peace in circumstances where there is not sufficient time to give a warning. An example might be a football match where two unruly groups collide and the police see no alternative but to detain them, or the ringleaders on both sides, immediately for what may be quite a short time. In summary, I would be concerned that in stretching article 5.1(b) beyond its previously recognised ambit the majority found it necessary to impose limitations which in another case might leave the police effectively powerless to step in for the protection of the public.\u201d",

The applicants had been subject to an obligation to refrain from committing criminal offences, including the obligation not to instigate fights or exhibit any other form of violent behaviour likely to disturb public order. This obligation followed from a number of provisions on punishable acts, including section 3 of the Executive Order on Police Measures to Maintain Law and Order (which is considered to define a criminal offence), and sections 134a, 244, 245 and 291 of the Penal Code. The obligation was specific and concrete, and the time and place of the imminent commission of the offence had been sufficiently specified, as well as its potential victims. The applicants had been aware of the large police presence in the city and it must have been clear to them that the police were there to prevent violence and disturbance in connection with the football match, notably as all three applicants had previously been detained in connection with similar events. In the Government\u2019s view, it would have been futile for the police to have given the applicants explicit orders to disperse and refrain from arranging/taking part in brawls, as the applicants could simply have walked away from the police and engaged in hooligan brawls elsewhere. Likewise, it would have made little sense to escort them to the stadium and warn them of detention if they left the groups of hooligans, as the police had done in Ostendorf (cited above), since many of them, including the third applicant, had not even had a ticket for the match.",

It will be recalled that this provision does not, according to the Court\u2019s established case-law, permit a policy of general prevention directed against an individual or a category of individuals who are perceived by the authorities, rightly or wrongly, as being dangerous or having the propensity to commit unlawful acts. This ground of detention does no more than afford the Contracting States a means of preventing a concrete and specific offence (see, for example, Guzzardi v. Italy, 6\u00a0November 1980, \u00a7 102, Series A no. 39; Ciulla v.

This can be seen both from the use of the singular (\u201can offence\u201d) and from the object of Article 5, namely to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of his or her liberty in an arbitrary fashion (see Guzzardi, cited above, \u00a7 102, and M.\u00a0v.

Where, for example, detention is sought to be justified by reference to the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) in order to bring a person before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence, the Court has insisted upon the need for the authorities to furnish some facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence in question (see James, Wells and Lee v. the United Kingdom, nos. 25119/09 and 2 others, \u00a7 193, 18\u00a0September 2012, and O\u2019Hara v. the United Kingdom, no. 37555/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a034-35, ECHR 2001X). Similarly, the Court is of the view that in order for a detention to be justified under the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), the authorities must show convincingly that the person concerned would in all likelihood have been involved in the concrete and specific offence, had its commission not been prevented by the detention.",

This interpretation was restated in different ways in the judgment, for instance in paragraph 82: \u201cthe second alternative of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) ... only governs pre-trial detention and not custody for preventive purposes without the person concerned being suspected of having already committed a criminal offence\u201d. In paragraph 86 the Court held that \u201cdetention under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 may be ordered, in particular, against a person having carried out punishable preparatory acts to an offence in order to prevent his committing that latter offence\u201d. This interpretation was given with reference to the requirements under paragraphs 1 (c) and 3 respectively that the person\u2019s detention was to be effected \u201cfor the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority\u201d and that the person was to \u201cbe brought promptly before a judge\u201d and was \u201centitled to a trial within a reasonable time\u201d under paragraph 3 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 68, 82, 85 and 86), and also with reference to previous case-law (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 67-69) to the effect that sub-paragraph (c) permitted deprivation of liberty only in connection with criminal proceedings. This line of case-law can be traced back to Ciulla (cited above) and was reaffirmed in J\u0117\u010dius v. Lithuania (no. 34578/97, ECHR 2000IX), Epple (cited above, \u00a7 35), and Schwabe and M.G.

On the contrary, in the first and third of the above-mentioned British cases, the Court left open what part of the measures fell under the one or the other ground, and in the second case it clearly distinguished between them, specifying that the initial detention fell under the preventive ground. On the basis of this analysis, the line taken in the three British cases is in a sense reminiscent of that taken in Ireland v. the United Kingdom and Guzzardi (both cited above). The former left open to what extent the respective limbs applied to the case before the Court, whereas the latter identified more clearly the application of the second limb (see paragraph 107 above) in a manner that can be traced back to the clear distinction made between the two limbs in Lawless, consistent with the Report of the Conference of Senior Officials on Human Rights to the Committee of Ministers in relation to Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 (c) and 3 of the second draft Convention (see paragraph 42 above).",

Although the \u201cpurpose\u201d requirement under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) applies also to deprivation of liberty under the second limb of this provision, this requirement should be applied with a degree of flexibility so that the question of compliance depends on whether the detainee, as required by Article 5 \u00a7 3, is intended to be brought promptly before a judge to have the lawfulness of his or her detention reviewed or to be released before such time. Furthermore, in the event of failure to comply with the latter requirement, the person concerned should have an enforceable right to compensation in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 5.

In order to prevent hooligan clashes, the police had made a plan to engage in proactive dialogue with the spectators from 12 noon, when they started to arrive in the city centre. The police had planned that, in the event of any clashes, they would charge the instigators of fights with criminal offences and arrest them under section 755 of the Administration of Justice Act or, should that not be possible, they would detain the instigators by virtue of section 5(3) of the Police Act. In view of the time-limit, they sought to avoid resorting to detention early in the day because any person so detained would otherwise have had to be released during or immediately after the match and would then have been able to head for the city centre again and resume their involvement in brawls (see paragraph 20 above). Moreover, from Chief Inspector B.O.\u2019s statement before the City Court it appears that in their implementation of the plan the police continuously assessed the situation. The continuing violence made it necessary to exceed the six-hour limit. The police started releasing detainees after midnight, when the situation in central Copenhagen had calmed down and the resumption of any fighting was deemed unlikely (see paragraph 21 above).",

It discerns no evidence of bad faith or neglect on the part of the national authorities in applying the relevant legislation. On the contrary, as Chief Inspector B.O. explained before the domestic court, the police\u2019s intention was, first, to talk to the various groups in an attempt to calm them down. After the first fights, it was planned that only the instigators should be detained. The assessment in this regard was to be made on the basis of the actual behaviour of those concerned, and the premise was that no persons would be detained who did not act as instigators (see paragraph 21 above). However, all three applicants were considered instigators (see, in particular, the statements of police officers P.W. and M.W. in paragraphs 22 and 23 above). The domestic courts accepted the facts as presented by the police officers. These findings were neither arbitrary nor manifestly unreasonable, and the Court lacks any objective reasons, let alone cogent evidence, to call into question the assessment made at national level.",

Moreover, Article 134a of the Penal Code set out the obligation not to take part in fights or become involved in other serious breaches of the peace in a public place where such actions took place by mutual consent or with several persons acting together; a breach of this provision was punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and six months. Finally, Articles 244, 245 and 291 of the Penal Code concerned, respectively, violence, aggravated violence, and the obligation to refrain from committing criminal damage.",

With a view to its examination of the preventive detention at issue in the present case, the Court considers it useful to elaborate on this criterion in respect of the second limb. In its view, less severe measures have to be considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained. Preventive detention cannot reasonably be considered necessary unless a proper balance is struck between the importance in a democratic society of preventing an imminent risk of an offence being committed and the importance of the right to liberty. In order to be proportionate to such a serious measure as deprivation of liberty, the concrete and specific \u201coffence\u201d referred to under the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) must also be of a serious nature, entailing danger to life and limb or significant material damage. It follows in addition that the detention should cease as soon as the risk has passed, which requires monitoring, the duration of the detention being also a relevant factor (on the latter point, see, for example, Schwabe and M.G., cited above, \u00a7\u00a078).",

European human rights law has not yet reached the level of development and refinement of domestic legal systems on this point and the European Court of Human Rights not only has not developed a sufficiently coherent interpretative methodology within the scope of the discretion left to it by the general rules of treaty interpretation, but has often overlooked, or shied away from, the applicable customary rules of treaty interpretation codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
