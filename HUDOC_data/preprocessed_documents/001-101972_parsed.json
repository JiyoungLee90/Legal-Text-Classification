Where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during detention.

In this connection the Court attaches decisive importance to the fact that these injuries were not mentioned in the medical report of 11 July 1998, which rules out in principle, the possibility that they occurred during the applicant's arrest and to the very particular location and apparent widespread nature of the applicant's back injuries, making it unlikely to be selfinflicted. Considering the circumstances of the case as a whole, and the absence of a credible explanation from the Government as to the cause of these injuries to the applicant, a minor, who was throughout this whole time under the control of the State authorities, the Court finds that it was the result of treatment for which the Government bore responsibility.",

Moreover, when the official investigation leads to the institution of proceedings in the national courts, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirements of the prohibition of ill-treatment. While there is no absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction or in a particular sentence, the national courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow grave attacks on physical and moral integrity to go unpunished (see Okkal\u0131 v.

Firstly, evidence obtained during forensic examinations plays a crucial role during investigations into detainees' allegations of ill-treatment (see Salmano\u011flu and Polatta\u015f v. Turkey, no. 15828/03, \u00a7 79, 17 March 2009). In this connection, the Court cannot but note that the medical reports established during the applicant's detention in police custody were drafted in a cursory manner, for example without any mention as regards size, colour or possible relationship between the physical findings and the applicant's statements, and fall significantly short of the standards recommended by both the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), which are regularly taken into account by the Court in its examination of cases concerning ill-treatment (see, inter alia, Akko\u00e7 v. Turkey, nos. 22947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000-X), and the guidelines set out in the Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, \u201cthe Istanbul Protocol\u201d, submitted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (see Bat\u0131 and Others, \u00a7\u00a0100, cited above). Moreover, although the Assize Court sought to obtain additional medical evidence, the time which elapsed during that time adversely affected, in the Court's view, the possibility of the 2nd Specialised Commission of the Forensic Medicine Institute establishing the origins of the applicant's back and leg injuries, particularly since their examination was limited to the applicant's previous medical reports.",

Nor was he ever asked to give a detailed statement as regards their respective roles in the alleged illtreatment. Thirdly, both the prosecutor and the first-instance court failed to secure the testimonies of potential eyewitnesses, such as the persons arrested together with the applicant, others present at the police station or in detention on the day of the events or the receptionist of the hotel.",
