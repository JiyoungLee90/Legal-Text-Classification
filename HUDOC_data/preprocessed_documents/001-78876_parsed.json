That letter contains untrue information about the claimant and the authority of which he is the head. The [court's] assessment of the evidence showed that it was not true that a document had been lost from the case file in one of the cases examined by the Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w District Office, that documents had been forged, or that the District Office had sought to intimidate the defendant or had acted maliciously against him. Nor is it true that the claimant violated the defendant's rights by instituting enforcement proceedings, in the course of which he broke the law and abused his authority. The investigation carried out in respect of the [lost] document did not establish the time or place of its disappearance. The defendant did not prove that the maps prepared by the District Office were forgeries or that the District Office had acted improperly, still less, maliciously. These are the defendant's impressions which are arbitrary and unsupported by evidence. All of the proceedings which were pending before the Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w District Office were instituted and carried out on the basis of applicable law and the defendant exercised his right to appeal against individual decisions. It was established that the proceedings were conducted speedily, as evidenced by the dates on which they were instituted and on which they ended. As regards the claimant's statement in 'Gazeta Wroc\u0142awska' the court found credible his claims that the statement had not been approved beforehand and so might be inaccurate and that the claimant could not speak about a sewer which had existed in the place he had indicated.",

Hungary (dec.), no.\u00a033352/02, 4 April 2006). Nor did they give any consideration to the fact that the limits of acceptable criticism of Mr S.L. as the head of the local administrative authority were wider than in relation to a private individual. The Court notes that by taking a decision to stand for local election Mr\u00a0S.L., who up to that point had been the head of an administrative authority, entered the political arena and thus had to accept close scrutiny of his words and deeds and display a greater degree of tolerance (see, Jerusalem v.

It is prepared to accept that some of the statements, such as the assertion that the claimant \u201cfrequently broke the law\u201d could be considered as statements of fact which lacked a sufficient factual basis. However, the Court observes that the thrust of the applicant's open letter was to cast doubt on the claimant's suitability for local public office, based on the applicant's long experience of dealing with the District Office of which Mr S.L. was the head. It considers, contrary to the view taken by the domestic courts, that the applicant's open letter also included statements which could reasonably be regarded as value judgements, such as the statement that the claimant \u201ccarried out his duties ineptly\u201d. In paragraph (c) and (d) of the open letter the applicant provided specific examples of decisions issued by the District Office which were subsequently quashed on appeal. In this respect, the Court also notes that the Court of Appeal's judgment of 12 October 1998 expressly confirmed that most of the decisions referred to in the open letter had been successfully appealed against by the applicant. Thus, the Court finds that the applicant's allegations that Mr S.L. did not run the District Office competently were not devoid of a factual basis. In this respect the Court reiterates that, in a democratic society, public authorities and their representatives expose themselves in principle to the\u00a0permanent scrutiny of citizens and that everyone must be able to draw public attention to situations that they consider unlawful provided\u00a0that they do so in good faith (Vides Aizsardz\u012bbas Klubs v. , no. 57829/00, \u00a7\u00a046 in fine, 27 May 2004). In the circumstances of the present case, it cannot be said that the applicant acted in bad faith. Having regard to the above, the Court considers that the applicant's statements were not a gratuitous personal attack on Mr S.L., but part of a debate on matters of public interest.",

Proceedings of this type are conducted within very short time-limits. As pointed out by the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal, they are aimed at ensuring the proper conduct of the electoral campaign by preventing infringements of the candidates' personal rights, which are capable of affecting the result of the elections. The Court considers that the provision of such a summary remedy during periods of (local and national) electoral campaigns serves the legitimate goal of ensuring the fairness of the electoral process and as such can not be questioned from the Convention standpoint. At the same time, as desirable as the expeditious examination of election-related disputes may be, it should not result in the undue curtailment of the procedural guarantees afforded to the parties to such proceedings, in particular the defendants. In this respect, the Court notes that in the proceedings under consideration the applicant relied heavily on the fact that the Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w District Office had given a number of unfavourable decisions against him which had subsequently been quashed on appeal. These circumstances, which were properly documented by the applicant in the proceedings, formed the basis for his critical comments concerning Mr S.L. as the person in charge of the District Office. However, the Court notes that neither the  nor the Court of Appeal appears to have sufficiently examined the evidence adduced by the applicant which, at least to some extent, could be considered as justifying his critical remarks about S.L. On that account, the fairness of the proceedings may be called into question. The Court also notes that the Court of Appeal's judgment was given on 12 October 1998, one day after the local elections had taken place, by which time the proceedings had lost all relevance to the claimant's electoral prospects. By the same token, the Court of Appeal failed to comply with the statutory requirement to deliver judgment within 24 hours from the moment the appeal is lodged. The Court notes that in these circumstances the Court of Appeal could have discontinued the proceedings, having regard, in particular, to the fact that the aggrieved party had the right to issue ordinary civil proceedings against the applicant for the protection of his personal rights.",

Under the Convention, an award of damages for defamation, or similar remedies such as those granted in the present case, must bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered (Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no.\u00a0316B, \u00a7\u00a049). In the instant case the applicant was ordered to arrange for the publication of a correction in the press, and to pay PLN\u00a010,000 (approximately EUR 2,500) to the claimant for non-pecuniary damage and PLN 10,000 to a charity. The Court notes that both awards were the maximum amounts which could be imposed under the Local Elections Act, as worded at the relevant time. The combined total came to more than sixteen times the average monthly wage at the material time. The Court observes that on 26 July 2002 Parliament amended section 72 of the Local Elections Act by repealing the provision which allowed the claimant to seek an award of damages from the defendant. In addition, the Court notes that, when imposing the pecuniary sanctions on the applicant, the domestic courts failed to provide any reasons to justify the imposition of the maximum pecuniary sanctions on the applicant or, therefore, to carry out any assessment of proportionality. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the pecuniary sanctions imposed on the applicant were excessive (see Independent News and Media and Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited v.\u00a0Ireland, no.\u00a055120/00, \u00a7\u00a0132, ECHR 2005...
