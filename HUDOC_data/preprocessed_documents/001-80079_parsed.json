In so far as its conclusion in respect of the lawfulness of the prohibition rested solely on the question of whether the mayor or the secretary of the municipality could issue such a prohibition, the Court does not find it justified that the domestic proceedings took such a period to conclude. The Court does recognise that the municipality and the applicant organisation contributed to some extent to part of the delay in the proceedings by failing to provide the domestic court with all the relevant documents and to timely deposit the required court fees (see paragraphs\u00a01417 above).
