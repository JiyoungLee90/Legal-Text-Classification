He had also lodged further applications for an annulment of seven other decisions. The applications were rejected in June 1993, August 1994 and June 1995. The Government also pointed out that on 23 November 1995 the District Court adjourned the case upon request by the applicant and the complainant and on 1 February 1996 upon the applicant\u2019s request. Moreover, in the Supreme Court he requested on 29 December 1997 that it deal with the case in February 1998 at the earliest. The Government emphasised that there were negotiations between the applicant and the company during the pre-trial investigation. Lastly, the applicant was not residing at his official address, which delayed the serving of the summons. The Court observes that the minutes from the Supreme Court\u2019s hearing in 1998 disclose that the applicant admitted that he had not been residing at his official address since 1991. The serving of the summons to the Supreme Court hearing had therefore been delayed. The Court further notes that the applicant has not contested that he lodged the above complaints or that he requested postponements.",

However, the dormant proceedings can be explained by the fact that the police and the local prosecutor were awaiting the outcome of the two applications for an annulment and the Chancellor of Justice\u2019s decision, as requested by the applicant in February 1990. It appears that he never withdrew that request. The same applies to the second consideration of the charges carried out by the . The Court observes that the applicant had two further annulment applications pending from October 1992 and September\u00a01993. The latest application for an annulment in the ownership proceedings was rejected in August 1994. Furthermore, at the time when the  was considering the charges it appears from the facts outlined above that the official receiver was preparing the lodging of a civil action aiming at obtaining the possession of the shares, which he subsequently did on 13 January 1995. As noted above, this proved to be unsuccessful as the applicant appeared in court with the shares but refused to hand them over.
