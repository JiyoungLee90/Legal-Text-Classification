As to the length of the trial, the Government asserted that it had been warranted due to the location of the accused, their counsel, the witnesses and the material evidence in different towns within the same region. The court had questioned sixteen individuals whose examination had sometimes continued during two or three hearings and had waited for the results of a repeated expert examination, which had taken one month. Examination of the case had also been delayed due to the involvement of the counsel in different proceedings and their illness. Overall, thirteen court hearings had had to be rescheduled due to the applicant\u2019s or his counsel\u2019s failure to attend for various reasons. The Government added that the trial court had disciplined the defaulting parties by fining the counsel and replacing them with other lawyers and had attempted to expedite the proceedings by moving the hearings temporarily to another town for examination of the witnesses residing there and by re-detaining the applicant on remand.",
