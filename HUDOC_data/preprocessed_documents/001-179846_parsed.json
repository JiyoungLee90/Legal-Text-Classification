All of them sought judicial review. In a series of judgments delivered on 18 and 19 February, 11 March, and 22 and 29 May 2008 the Blagoevgrad District Court annulled the fines. In some of the judgments it found that they were invalid, as under the applicable rules the deputy Mayor had no power to impose administrative punishments. In other judgments the court found that the deputy Mayor\u2019s decisions were defective because they did not specify which administrative offences had been committed. In others it held that although the Mayor\u2019s ban on the rally planned for 12 September 2007 was legally binding, the actions of the members of Ilinden on that date had not amounted to the staging of a rally, as they had been too few and had not tried to wave banners and make speeches, but merely to lay flowers on Gotse Delchev\u2019s monument. The court went on to say that every person, regardless of their political convictions, had the right to honour the memory of national heroes in peace.\u201d",

At the same time, the Court had not awarded damages to the individual applicants, but only to the applicant organisation, noting that its claims had been made on behalf of its religious community. The Court had also held that no individual measures were required to execute its judgment (merits judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 114, and just satisfaction judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 23-46, both cited above). In the follow-up case, Pantusheva and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria ((dec.), nos. 40047/04 and 33 others, 5 July 2011), in which several hundred Christian Orthodox believers who regularly attended church services and took part in the life of the religious community had raised identical complaints in relation to the same events, the Court struck out the applications under Article 37 \u00a7 1 (c), chiefly on the basis that in the leading case it had already discharged its duty under Article 19 of the Convention to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by Bulgaria, and that nothing was to be gained if it were to repeat its findings in a series of comparable or even identical cases (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a056-57).

The Court therefore found a violation of Article 11. Its findings thus covered the effect which the ban had had on the applicant, who had been acting on Ilinden\u2019s behalf in its dealings with the authorities in relation to that rally (see paragraph\u00a016 above). The finding of violation and the joint award which the Court made to Ilinden and its chairman in respect of non-pecuniary damage (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0141) must also be regarded as encompassing any damage suffered by the applicant, who had been acting on the organisation\u2019s behalf.",

Since the applicant\u2019s related complaint under Article 14 of the Convention does not require separate examination (see paragraphs\u00a068-71 below), the fact that no such complaint was raised or determined in that earlier case does not alter that conclusion. Nor can the applicant claim to have suffered additional damage in connection with that rally that calls for a separate award of just satisfaction. It is therefore no longer justified to continue examining these two complaints. There is no need to determine whether this also applies to the complaint under Article\u00a013 of the Convention relating to the rally planned for 12 September 2007, as it is in any event inadmissible (see paragraphs 4 above and 50-52 below).",

Given that at the time when that court dealt with the case an almost identical point had already been determined by this Court in two judgments against Bulgaria relating to materially indistinguishable facts (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, \u00a7\u00a7 106-07, and United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Ivanov, \u00a7\u00a7 113-14, both cited above), that omission was striking.
