The Court particularly notes in this regard that the fact that the applicant had been absent from the hearings had no bearing on the decision of the Erzurum State Security Court, whose decision of lack of jurisdiction involved a purely technical matter. The Court, therefore, cannot but conclude that the authorities failed to deal with the case diligently, particularly in relation to the period of time when the case was pending before the Erzurum State Security Court, and caused a substantial delay (see, among others, Obluk v.
