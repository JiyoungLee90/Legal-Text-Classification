The facts of that case and the present case are similar to a significant degree. The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions made in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment also apply to the present case. In particular, the Court noted the existence of serious concerns about the foreseeability and precision of the legislation governing public assemblies, and about the possibility of public assemblies being arbitrarily banned or dispersed (ibid., \u00a7 55); doubts about the credibility of the formal grounds, namely Article 310.1 of the CAO, relied on by the authorities to arrest and convict the applicant, who was a participant in an unauthorised demonstration (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 56 and 62); a failure by the authorities to take into consideration the fact that notice of the demonstration had been given (ibid., \u00a7 60); a lack of relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstration which had been intended to be peaceful and had been conducted in a peaceful manner (ibid., \u00a7 61); and a lack of any acknowledgment that the act of participating in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration was by itself protected by Article 11 of the Convention (ibid.,\u00a0\u00a7 63). Having regard to the above, in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment the Court found that the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of assembly had been violated on account of the dispersal of the demonstration and his arrest and conviction.",

As in Gafgaz Mammadov, the applicant in the present case was arrested and convicted following an accelerated procedure under the CAO. He was held in police custody without any contact with the outside world, presented with charges, without receiving a copy of the administrativeoffence report, and shortly afterwards (in a matter of hours) taken to a court and convicted. The applicant was not given an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of his own choosing at the pre-trial stage or for the hearing before the first-instance court in the first set of proceedings. Representation by the State-funded lawyer during that hearing was purely formalistic: during the hearing that lawyer did not submit any written objections, complaints or motions on the applicant\u2019s behalf. The domestic courts relied strongly on the statements given by the police officers and the administrative-offence report prepared by the police. The domestic courts also completely disregarded important factual circumstances and legal issues of the case, inter alia, the peaceful nature of the unauthorised demonstration (compare Gafgaz Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 74-96; compare also Ibrahimov and Others v.
