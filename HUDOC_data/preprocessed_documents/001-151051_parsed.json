He was accused of having subjected her to verbal abuse, hit her on the head with his hand and fist, slapped her, held her by the throat, tried to strangle her, thrown her against the furniture or onto the ground, pushed her down stairs and kicked her. He was further accused of having hit the children, gambled away the household\u2019s money on gaming machines and smashed the crockery. As a result, his wife had sustained haematomas, bruising and a fractured nose and had been obliged to seek medical assistance on that account on 26 June 2000, 18 July 2003 and 8 February 2006 following assaults committed on 24 June 2000, 17 July 2003 and 8\u00a0February 2006 respectively. The applicant had allegedly sought to undermine his wife psychologically in order to control her. According to the prosecutor, the applicant had thus committed the \u201ccontinuing\u201d criminal offence (trvaj\u00edc\u00ed trestn\u00fd \u010din) of abusing a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article 215a \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 (b) of the Criminal Code, given that his conduct prior to the introduction of that offence on 1 June 2004 had amounted to the offence of violence against an individual or group of individuals under Article 197a of the Criminal Code and assault occasioning bodily harm under Article 221 of the Code.",

It sentenced him to a suspended term of two and a half years\u2019 imprisonment and placed him on probation for five years. The applicant was also placed under supervision and ordered to undergo treatment for alcohol dependency. The court based its decision on the statements given by the applicant, the victim (his wife) and several witnesses, including the couple\u2019s two children \u2013 who reported, among other incidents, ten instances of the applicant verbally insulting his wife, four instances of the applicant grabbing his wife by the arms and strangling her, and verbal and/or physical assaults committed by the applicant on his wife at monthly intervals \u2013 and on documentary evidence and expert reports.

Lastly, the court considered that, owing to the duration of the conduct in question, the offence committed in the present case presented a relatively high degree of danger which justified a sentence ranging from two to eight years\u2019 imprisonment under paragraph 2 of Article 215a of the Criminal Code. Taking into consideration the extenuating circumstances (in particular the fact that the applicant had confessed and that he had no previous convictions), it imposed a suspended sentence situated at the lower end of the range.",

On this point the Supreme Court noted, referring to its ruling Tzn 12/93 of 8 December 1993, that where there was, as in the case at hand, a \u201ccontinuation of the criminal offence\u201d (pokra\u010dov\u00e1n\u00ed v trestn\u00e9m \u010dinu), which was considered to constitute a single act, its classification in criminal law had to be assessed under the law in force at the time of completion of the last occurrence of the offence. That law therefore also applied to the earlier acts, provided that these would have amounted to criminal conduct under the previous law. In the instant case the Supreme Court considered that the applicant\u2019s conduct prior to the amendment of the Criminal Code on 1 June 2004 had amounted at least to an offence punishable under Article 197a or Article 221 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code. After examining the file it also concluded that the accused\u2019s actions as described in the operative part of the first-instance court\u2019s judgment disclosed all the legal elements of the offence of abusing a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article 215a \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 (b) of the Criminal Code. Concerning the continuation of the offence, the Supreme Court noted that the abuse itself amounted to ill-treatment characterised by a certain duration. For the offence to be regarded as having continued over a long period of time it had to have lasted for some months. As the applicant had perpetrated the offence in question at least from 2000 until 8 February 2006, that is, over a period of several years, his conduct certainly disclosed the material element of continuation of the offence of abuse under Article\u00a0215a \u00a7 2 (b) of the Criminal Code.",

Two different approaches were developed by scholars and legislatures, based on a subjective and an objective view of the notion of a continuous criminal offence. According to the subjective view, which existed, for instance, in Italy (see, for example, Article 81 of the 1930 Italian Criminal Code), a continuous criminal offence was a group of acts united by a single intention, by one single criminal plan. According to the objective view, developed mainly in Germany (see, for example, Article 110 of the 1813 Bavarian Criminal Code), a continuous criminal offence was based on the repeated intention of the offender to attack the same or similar object or legally protected interest (Rechtsgut). Moreover, the fact that the repetition of the criminal acts and of the criminal intention was facilitated by the material circumstances \u2013 involving the offender, the close temporal connection and the identity of the legally protected interest affected \u2013 was seen as justifying the imposition of a lighter penalty on the offender. This objective perspective gained support all over Europe, with some countries incorporating it in their legislation. However, in order to avoid excessive leniency towards repeat offenders, certain legislatures restricted the application of this concept to specific categories of crimes.",

In so far as the applicant disputed the effects of that interpretation, which in his view had in fact resulted in retroactive application of the law, the Chamber held that the interpretation adopted by the courts in the present case had not in itself been unreasonable, given that a continuous offence, by definition, extended over a certain period of time and that it was not arbitrary to consider that it had ceased at the time of the last occurrence of the offence. Moreover, the Czech authorities had observed that the applicant\u2019s acts had at all times been punishable as criminal offences.

At the relevant time there had also existed a considerable body of case-law in respect of continuous offences and the interpretation of Article 89 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code which followed the same logic as that applied in the instant case. It was thus clearly established that the conduct should be assessed as a single offence under the law in force at the time it came to an end. Moreover, in the Government\u2019s view, the introduction on 1 June 2004 of Article 215a of the Criminal Code had rendered the likelihood of the applicant\u2019s being held criminally liable even clearer and more foreseeable. Indeed, the new Article 215a of the Criminal Code dealt with unlawful conduct in a more comprehensive manner than Articles 197a and 221. Since the applicant had continued his unlawful acts after 1 June 2004, he could and should have expected to be held criminally liable under Article 215a of the Criminal Code for all his acts including those that had preceded the change in the legislation.",

They conceded that the close temporal connection as defined by domestic judicial practice generally referred to days, weeks or months. However, a maximum limit had never been set and the notion necessarily allowed for flexibility depending on the nature of the offence in question. It followed from the evidence gathered in the case and from the domestic courts\u2019 reasoning that the three incidents which occurred on 24\u00a0June 2000, 17 July 2003 and 8 February 2006 had been singled out as the most violent. The courts had consistently held that the applicant\u2019s unlawful conduct had spanned a period of several years and that the individual assaults perpetrated by him had been of varying intensity and recurrent in nature, occurring within weeks of each other. Furthermore, the bill of indictment as well as the domestic courts\u2019 decisions had clearly stated that the applicant was being tried for actions carried out before and after the entry into force of Article 215a, actions which could not be separated from each other. The requirement of legal certainty had thus been met as a result of the consistent assessment of the case by the prosecution and the courts (the Government cited, to converse effect, Ecer and Zeyrek v. Turkey, nos. 29295/95 and 29363/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a033-35, ECHR 2001II). It was clear from the conviction itself that the courts were also of the view that the applicant\u2019s actions taken as a whole had disclosed the elements of the offence defined by Article 215a of the Criminal Code.",

Indeed, in that event the applicant would have been tried for multiple offences punishable by a concurrent sentence which would have been defined on the basis of the provision concerning the most serious offence, that is to say, Article 215a of the Criminal Code. Moreover, the existence of multiple criminal offences and the duration of the conduct in question would have constituted aggravating circumstances.",

However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances.

Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 36; C.R. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 34; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz [v.

Secondly, the Court must determine whether the application of this provision by the national courts to encompass those acts that were committed before 1 June 2004 entailed a real possibility of the applicant\u2019s being subjected to a heavier penalty in breach of Article 7 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Maktouf and Damjanovi\u0107 [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2013).",

In the aforementioned judgments the Court observed that, by definition, such an offence was a type of crime committed over a period of time (see Veeber, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035). It further held that, when an accused was charged with a \u201ccontinuing\u201d offence, the principle of legal certainty required that the acts which went to make up that offence, and which entailed his criminal liability, be clearly set out in the bill of indictment. Furthermore, the decision rendered by the domestic court also had to make it clear that the accused\u2019s conviction and sentence resulted from a finding that the elements of a \u201ccontinuing\u201d offence had been made out by the prosecution (see Ecer and Zeyrek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a033).",

As a result, his wife had sustained serious injuries obliging her to seek medical assistance on 26 June 2000, 18 July 2003 and 8 February 2006 (see paragraph 10 above). In its judgment of 21\u00a0February 2008, the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts\u2019 legal classification of the offence as abuse of a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article 215a of the Criminal Code, as in force since 1\u00a0June 2004, and applied that provision also to the abuse perpetrated by the applicant against his wife before that date. In that connection, the Supreme Court referred to its ruling (Tzn 12/93) of 8 December 1993 to the effect that a continuous criminal offence was to be considered as a single act and that its legal classification in criminal law had to be assessed under the law in force at the time of completion of the last occurrence of the offence. Thus Article 215a also applied to the earlier assaults, provided that these would have amounted to criminal conduct under the previous law, and the applicant\u2019s conduct prior to the amendment of 1 June 2004 had amounted at least to an offence punishable under Article 197a or Article 221 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code. After examining the file, the Supreme Court concluded that the applicant\u2019s actions disclosed all the constituent elements of the offence of abusing a person living under the same roof within the meaning of Article 215a \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 (b) of the Code. Since the offence in question had been perpetrated at least from 2000 until 8 February 2006, the material conditions for considering the offence as aggravated on the ground of its long duration, in accordance with paragraph 2 (b) of Article 215a, had been fulfilled (see paragraph 13 above).",

It emerges from the clear and settled case-law of the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 25-27 above) and from the views expressed in the legal literature (see paragraph 24 above) that a continuous offence was considered to constitute a single act, whose classification in Czech criminal law had to be assessed under the rules in force at the time of completion of the last occurrence of the offence, provided that the acts committed under any previous law would have been punishable also under the older law.",

By way of comparison it is worth noting in this context that the notion of a continuous criminal offence as defined in Czech law is in line with the European tradition reflected in the national laws of the vast majority of Council of Europe member States (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above) and that, accordingly, the situation as regards the issue of foreseeability raised in the present case appears not to be markedly different from that obtaining in relation to such offences in the national legal systems of other Contracting Parties to the Convention. As can be seen from the domestic authorities\u2019 description of the applicant\u2019s conduct, his acts were directed against a specific victim, namely his wife, and particularly against her legal interests of physical and mental integrity as well as honour. It is also clear that the modus operandi was the same, consisting of attacks committed under the same roof; that there was a temporal connection between the various acts, which spanned several years; that each assault committed during this period of time was driven by the same criminal intent; and that the applicant\u2019s conduct was on each occasion in breach of the criminal law. In other words, the offence of which the applicant was convicted shared a number of characteristics common to such offences elsewhere in the Convention community, as did the response of the criminal justice system, in the form of a sentence handed down for one single offence (see paragraphs 33-37 above).",

The notion remains controversial, and the controversy is not limited to the term \u201cconsensus\u201d itself, which would, at least in the ordinary meaning, require agreement on the part of those concerned (see L. Wildhaber, A. Hjartarson and S.\u00a0Donnelly, \u201cNo consensus on consensus\u201d, Human Rights Journal, 2013, pp. 248-63, and S. Besson and A.-L.

In my view this means that the Court, when it examines domestic laws and practices and the positions which European States may have expressed on the issue in question in other international fora, is in fact looking for a particular regional practice that the States consider it necessary to follow, in other words, regional custom. (Incidentally, the notion of custom has also evolved in international law and is most likely no longer as rigid as may have been the case some time ago.) If the Court establishes the existence of a practice which the European States by and large follow (for instance, soft custom), there is no question but that it needs to keep that State practice in mind when interpreting the Convention in the light of modern-day developments. However, there is nothing new about applying the law over time and assessing the applicability of the right in issue then and now. Had the Court better linked its use of the consensus and living-instrument doctrines to analogous concepts in international law, there might have been less ground for discussion on the Court\u2019s expansive interpretation of the Convention.",

There are probably many common approaches to this notion in domestic criminal law (see paragraph 33 of the present judgment). However, there are certainly also differences. It is not necessary in the comparative-law part of the judgment to make a statement as to the existence of a broad consensus among States. Taking into consideration the specific use of the notion of consensus in the case-law as normally applied in cases in which States enjoy a margin of appreciation, one may wonder what the purpose of the statement in paragraph 33 is in an Article 7 case.",

According to these scholars, there were two major criteria for the punishment of a succession of individual criminal acts as a continuous offence: a short period of time between the different individual criminal acts committed by the offender (cum temporis intervallo, as Baldus said) and the existence of a single intention or purpose underlying those individual acts (ad eundem finem, as Bartolus put it).

According to Carrara, it was not the voluntary element of the dolus that unified the various criminal acts of the offender, but its intellectual element, that is to say, the existence of the same odious idea underlying all his or her acts. Manzini talked about the same criminal project, Carnelutti about the same interest and Leone about the same desire, these diverse formulations being nothing more than variations of the subjective doctrine of Carrara.

In view of the principle of absorption, the punishment of a continuous offence was less problematic. The discussion of the problem was transferred to the domain of criminal procedure. When faced with the problem of successive criminal acts committed with the same purpose, the French doctrine, spearheaded by the general prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, Faustin Helie, reiterated the point of view of the Italian scholars. The novelty of Helie\u2019s approach lay in the procedural inference he drew from the Italian doctrine: when an offender was charged with one or more individual acts making up the continuous offence, he or she could not be charged a second time with a view to being tried for other individual acts making up the continuous offence which had not been taken into account in the first trial.

Mittermaier\u2019s famous critique of the terms of this distinction had the immense value of opening up a theoretical discussion on the meaning of the concept of \u201cone and the same object\u201d, a discussion which is not yet closed. It was not, as Feuerbach claimed, the sole fact that the object of the offence was the same, nor, as the Italian scholars taught, the intellectual element alone that unified the various individual acts committed by the offender, but rather the unity of the offender\u2019s overall resolve to commit the crime, the homogeneity of the various individual acts and the violation of the same legally protected interest (Rechtsgut). Mittermaier was correct in his intuition that imposing a lighter punishment for a continuous offence was justified by the fact that the repetition of the individual criminal acts and the offender\u2019s renewed criminal purpose were \u201cfacilitated\u201d by the material circumstances involving the offender: it is the favourable external situation surrounding the offender which leads him or her to violate the same or similar legal interest on two or more occasions within a short period of time. The justification for imposing a more lenient punishment lies precisely in the lesser guilt of the offender, who is driven by favourable external circumstances to repeat the crime. This perspective gained support in the German Imperial Court, which acknowledged the concept of a continuous offence in spite of the silence of the Imperial Criminal Code of 1871 and the partial abolition of the rule of strict accumulation of penalties. Subsequently, the concept spread all over Europe, in some countries even being converted into statute law. Understood as a case of legal unity of the offender\u2019s conduct (juristische Handlungseinheit) in criminal responsibility theory, the continuous offence is based on the renewed purpose of the offender to take advantage of a constant set of favourable external circumstances in order to attack the same or similar legal interest and not necessarily the same criminal provision.",

Criminalpolicy reasons explain this move. The frequent criticism heard in the political arena was that the concept of a continuous offence favoured recidivism and weakened the legal force of social rules, since it treated offenders who committed various criminal acts within a short period of time in an excessively lenient way. In line with this criticism, a harsh criminal policy prevailed that was incompatible with the liberal rationale behind the concept of a continuous offence.",

Firstly, it is not necessary for all the individual acts to form part of an initial plan or \u201coverall intention\u201d (Gesamtvorsatz). It suffices for each new individual act to be understood as a purposeful sequel to the preceding one or ones (Fortsetztungsvorsatz or erweiterter Gesamtvorsatz). As a matter of principle, a cold-blooded offender who plans the commission of a series of criminal acts in advance does not deserve to be treated better, in terms of the imputation of criminal liability and sentencing, than an offender who did not plan to commit the successive criminal acts but could not resist the temptation to commit them in the same favourable external context. As the Grand Chamber puts it clearly, \u201cthe individual acts do not have to be planned ab initio\u201d, which means that the overall mens rea underlying the various individual acts need not be present at the commission of the first individual act or even when each individual act forming part of the legally unified conduct is committed, and may not arise until the final individual act is committed.",

To subject the sentenced offender to a new trial would be tantamount to exposing him or her to the risk of being punished twice for the same legally unified offence. This holds true not only for individual acts committed before the final act forming part of the continuous offence that has already been tried, but also for individual acts which occur after it.",

At least between 2000 and February 2006, the applicant abused his wife both physically and mentally on various occasions while drunk. As a result, his wife sustained haematomas, bruising and a fractured nose and was obliged to seek medical assistance on that account in June 2000, July 2003 and February 2006. The applicant was found guilty of the continuous offence of abusing a person living under the same roof, committed between 2000 and 8\u00a0February 2006, under a provision, Article 215a, which had been introduced into the Criminal Code on 1 June 2004. Under Czech law, a continuous offence is considered to constitute a single act and its classification in criminal law has to be assessed under the law as in force on completion of the last occurrence of the offence (the last assault). In the instant case the applicant was of the opinion that his conviction and sentence pursuant to a penal provision that had come into force on 1 June 2004 had involved retroactive application of the Criminal Code and had operated to his detriment, in breach of Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. He argued that the domestic courts had not examined whether he had actually committed the offences punishable before that date under Articles 197a and 221 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.",

In the light of the Government\u2019s observations and the sentencing rules defined by Czech law, the domestic courts\u2019 approach could not, and did not, have any detrimental effect on the severity of the applicant\u2019s punishment. Albeit summarily, the domestic courts did consider, correctly, that all the legal ingredients of the offence set forth in Article 215a \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 (b) of the Criminal Code were fulfilled also with regard to the assault committed prior to the entry into force of that provision.",

On the contrary, this hallmark of a liberal criminal-law policy is still at the heart of the European law on concursus delictorum, if not of a universal system of criminal law, a \u201cgrammar of criminal law\u201d, as George Fletcher put it (Verbrechenslehre, th\u00e9orie des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019infraction, teoria del reato, teoria del delito, teoria do crime). Legislatures and courts may make use of it as an instrument to attenuate the severity of punishment in cases where the offender was driven to commit successive criminal acts by favourable external circumstances and his or her guilt was therefore considerably diminished. This instrument may be applied even in those national systems where a rule of strict accumulation of penalties or consecutive sentences is absent, but is particularly called for in those national systems where such a rule exists. The resocialisation purpose of criminal penalties and the principles of legality and non bis in idem favour that use. Where successive criminal laws are enacted, the offender may be punished under the new law when the conditions laid down in it are fulfilled also by the acts committed prior to the entry into force of that law.",
