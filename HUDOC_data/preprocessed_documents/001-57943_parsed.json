The use of a timer was, according to O, considered highly unlikely in light of the recent IRA explosion of a bomb by timer device at Enniskillen which had resulted in a high number of civilian casualties. Use of a remote-control device was considered to be far more likely since it was safer from the point of view of the terrorist who could get away from the bomb before it exploded and was more controllable than a timer which once activated was virtually impossible to stop.",

He believed that there had been an IRA directive not to repeat the carnage of a recent bomb in Enniskillen and to keep to a minimum the loss of life to innocent civilians. It was thought that the terrorists knew that if it rained the parade would be cancelled and in that event, if a timer was used, they would be left with a bomb that would go off indiscriminately.",

The computer room was at some distance from the frontier crossing point itself. The Spanish officers at the immigration post showed him passports by means of a visual aid unit. It appears that they only showed him the passports of those cars containing two men and one woman. Several pictures were flashed up for him during the course of the day but he did not recognise them. At the inquest, under cross-examination, he at first did not recall that he had been given any of the aliases that the three suspects might be employing.

D intended to arrest by getting slightly closer, drawing his pistol and shouting \"Stop. Police. Hands up\".

D believed that Savage was going for a detonator. He used one hand to push the lady out of line and opened fire from about two to three metres away.

In them, he alleged that while in a friend\u2019s car on the way to the frontier via , he passed the Landport tunnel. He heard \"crackers\" and saw a man bleeding on the floor. He saw another man showing an ID card and wearing a black beret who had his foot on the dying man\u2019s throat and was shouting, \"Stop. It\u2019s OK. It\u2019s the police\". At that instant, the man fired a further three to four shots. At the inquest, he stated that the part of the statement relating to the shooting was a lie that he had made up. He appeared considerably confused and contradicted himself frequently. When it was pointed out to him that until the inquest it had not become known that the soldiers wore berets (no newspaper report had mentioned the detail), he supposed that he must have heard it in the street. When asked at the inquest why he had made up the statement, he referred to previous illness, pressure at work and the desire to stop being telephoned by a person who was asking him to give an interview to the media.",

Her account contained a number of apparent discrepancies with the evidence of other witnesses; she said the soldier shot with his left hand whereas he was in fact right-handed; no one else described Savage as running; and she described the body as falling with feet towards the nearby tree rather than his head which was the way all the other witnesses on the scene described it. The Coroner in his summing-up thought that it might be possible to reconcile her account by the fact that Miss Treacy may have not been looking at Savage as he spun round to face the soldiers and that by the time she did look he was spinning round towards the tunnel in reaction to the firing. 89. Mr Bullock and his wife stated that a man pushed past them as they walked up  to the junction and that they saw that he had a gun down the back of his trousers. They saw him meet up with another man, also with a gun in his trousers, on the corner of the alleyway to the Landport tunnel.

The position of the entry wounds suggested that some of the wounds were received facing the shooter. But the wounds in the chest had entered at the back of the chest. Professor Watson agreed that Savage was \"riddled with bullets\" and that \"it was like a frenzied attack\". He agreed that it would be reasonable to suppose from the strike marks on the pavement that bullets were fired into Savage\u2019s head as he lay on the ground. Professor Pounder also agreed that the evidence from strike marks on the ground and the angle and state of wounds indicated that Savage was struck by bullets when lying on his back on the ground by a person shooting standing towards his feet. He insisted under examination by counsel for the soldiers that the three strike marks on the ground within the chalk outline corresponded with wounds to the head.

While it would be possible to set the device so that it would be necessary to press one button (the transmit button) in order to detonate a bomb, this would require leaving the power switches on for both the transmitter and the encoder with the risk that the batteries would run down. There would also be the risk that the device might be set off accidentally by being bumped in the street or being hit by a bullet or by a person falling awkwardly so as to hit the edge of a pavement or bench.",

The equipment used was not identical to that of Dr Scott. He stated that it was possible to receive both voice communication and a single audio tone at the site of the shootings from the assembly area. He did not however use an encoder and his equipment was matched and compatible. Mr Feraday was also recalled. He gave the opinion that if a weak voice communication could be received then the signal would be sufficient to set off a bomb.",

In both cases they intended to kill not in self-defence or in the defence of others or in the course of arrest ... so it is murder and you will return a verdict of unlawfully killed. If in this second example you were to conclude that it is killing in pursuance of force used which was more than reasonably necessary, then the verdict should also be killed unlawfully but it would not have been murder. The third example I offer is precisely of that situation. If you accept the account that the soldiers\u2019 intention was genuinely to arrest (in the sense that they were to apprehend the three suspects and hand them over live to the Gibraltar police force) and that the execution of the arrest went wrong and resulted in the three deaths because either (a) force was used when it was not necessary or (b) the force that was used was more than was reasonably necessary, then that would not be murder ... and the verdict would be, as I say, unlawfully killed.

The physical welfare of a criminal armed with a firearm should not be given greater consideration than that of a police officer, and unnecessary risks must not be taken by the police. In their full use of firearms, as in the use of any force, the police are controlled by the restrictions imposed by the law. The most important point which emerges from any study of the law on this subject is that the responsibility is an individual one. Any police officer who uses a firearm may be answerable to the courts or to a coroner\u2019s inquest and, if his actions were unlawful (or improper), then he as an individual may be charged with murder, manslaughter or unlawful wounding. Similarly, if his use of a firearm was unlawful or negligent the individual could find himself defending a civil case in which substantial damages were being claimed against him.

A real expert would have thought of removing the aerial to nullify the radio detonator, which could have been done without destabilising the explosive, as testified by Dr Scott. He would have also known that if the suspects had intended to explode a bomb by means of a radio signal they would not have used a rusty aerial - which would reduce the capacity to receive a clear signal - but a clean one (see paragraph 114 above).

Having had advance warning of the terrorists\u2019 intentions it would certainly have been possible for the authorities to have mounted an arrest operation. Although surprised at the early arrival of the three suspects, they had a surveillance team at the border and an arrest group nearby (see paragraph 34 above). In addition, the Security Services and the Spanish authorities had photographs of the three suspects, knew their names as well as their aliases and would have known what passports to look for (see paragraph 33 above).",

It is recalled that while Soldier G had experience in car bombs, it transpired that he was not an expert in radio communications or explosives; and that his assessment that there was a suspect car bomb, based on his observation that the car aerial was out of place, was more in the nature of a report that a bomb could not be ruled out (see paragraph 53 above).",

It would be wrong to conclude in retrospect that a particular course would, as things later transpired, have been better than one adopted at the time under the pressures of an ongoing anti-terrorist operation and that the latter course must therefore be regarded as culpably mistaken.

The consequences of the explosion of a large bomb in the centre of Gibraltar might well be so devastating that the authorities could not responsibly risk giving the suspects the opportunity to set in train the detonation of such a bomb. Of course the obligation of the  under Article 2 para. 1 (art. 2-1) of the Convention extended to the lives of the suspects as well as to the lives of all the many others, civilian and military, who were present in Gibraltar at the time. But, quite unlike those others, the purpose of the presence of the suspects in Gibraltar was the furtherance of a criminal enterprise which could be expected to have resulted in the loss of many innocent lives if it had been successful.

In our view, the answer is clear: certainly, previous experience of IRA activities would have afforded no reliable basis for concluding that the killing of many civilians would itself be a sufficient deterrent or that the suspects, when confronted, would have preferred no explosion at all to an explosion causing civilian casualties. It is relevant that, according to Soldier F\u2019s evidence at the inquest, part of the intelligence background was that he had been told that the IRA were under pressure to produce a \"spectacular\". He also gave evidence of his belief that, when cornered, the suspects would have no qualms about pressing the button to achieve some degree of propaganda success: they would try to derive such a success out of having got a bomb into Gibraltar and that would outweigh in their minds the propaganda loss arising from civilian casualties.",

The implication at the end of paragraph 211 that the authorities did not exercise sufficient care in evaluating the information at their disposal before transmitting it to soldiers \"whose use of firearms automatically involved shooting to kill\" appears to be based on no more than \"the failure to make provision for a margin of error\" to which the beginning of the paragraph refers. We have dealt already with the \"insufficient allowances for alternative possibilities\" point (see, again, paragraphs 13-16 above), which we take to be the same as the alleged failure to provide for a margin of error which is referred to here. Any assessment of the evaluation by the authorities of the information at their disposal should, in any event, take due account of their need to reckon throughout with the incompleteness of that information (see paragraph 8 above); and there are no cogent grounds for any suggestion that there was information which they ought reasonably to have known but did not.",

As regards any suggestion that, if an assessment on the issue had been required by their training or instruction to be carried out by the soldiers, shooting to wound might have been considered by them to have been warranted by the circumstances at the time, it must be recalled that those circumstances included a genuine belief on their part that the suspects might be about to detonate a bomb by pressing a button. In that situation, to shoot merely to wound would have been a highly dangerous course: wounding alone might well not have immobilised a suspect and might have left him or her capable of pressing a button if determined to do so.",

There was also evidence at the inquest that soldiers would not be accepted for the SAS unless they displayed discretion and thoughtfulness; that they would not go ahead and shoot without thought, nor did they; but they did have to react very fast. In addition, evidence was given that SAS members had in fact been successful in the past in arresting terrorists in the great majority of cases.",

Those differences are no doubt attributable to the differences in backgrounds and requirements of the recipients to whom they were addressed, account being taken of relevant training previously given to each group (it is to be noted that, according to the evidence of Soldier F at the inquest, many lectures are given to SAS soldiers on the concepts of the rule of law and the use of minimum force).

The accusation of a breach by a State of its obligation under Article\u00a02 (art. 2) of the Convention to protect the right to life is of the utmost seriousness. For the reasons given above, the evaluation in paragraphs 203 to 213 of the judgment seems to us to fall well short of substantiating the finding that there has been a breach of the Article (art. 2) in this case. We would ourselves follow the reasoning and conclusion of the Commission in its comprehensive, painstaking and notably realistic report. Like the Commission, we are satisfied that no failings have been shown in the organisation and control of the operation by the authorities which could justify a conclusion that force was used against the suspects disproportionately to the purpose of defending innocent persons from unlawful violence. We consider that the use of lethal force in this case, however regrettable the need to resort to such force may be, did not exceed what was, in the circumstances as known at the time, \"absolutely necessary\" for that purpose and did not amount to a breach by the United Kingdom of its obligations under the Convention.",
