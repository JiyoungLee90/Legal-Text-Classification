It follows that either the applicants\u2019 lawyer received a very late call from the clerk at the Court of Appeal or he received no summons at all. In either case, the Court considers that the lawyer did not have sufficient time to familiarise himself with the prosecutor\u2019s request and to prepare his clients\u2019 position in response to that request.
