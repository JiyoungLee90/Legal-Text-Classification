The proceedings were resumed when the applicants informed the court that they were fit to stand trial. Nothing in the submitted materials indicates that there were other delays which could be attributed to their conduct. It follows that owing to factors pertaining to the applicants, the proceedings had been delayed for eight months and twenty-eight days which appears rather insignificant compared to their overall length. On the other hand, it has been established that the authorities did not demonstrate the requisite diligence in handling the case (see paragraphs 45-48 above).",
