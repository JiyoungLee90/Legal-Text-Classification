To control the crowd, a police cordon forced the protesters to remain within the barriers. There were numerous clashes between the police and protesters.

In respect of a person who is deprived of his or her liberty, or, more generally, is confronted with lawenforcement officers, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Bouyid v.\u00a0Belgium [GC], no. , \u00a7\u00a7 100-01, 28\u00a0September 2015). In respect of recourse to physical force during an arrest, Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force for effecting a lawful arrest (see Annenkov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. , \u00a7 79, 25 July 2017). However, such force may be used only if indispensable and must not be excessive (see Ivan Vasilev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. , \u00a7 63, 12 April 2007). The burden to prove that this was the case rests on the Government (see Rehbock v.\u00a0Slovenia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a072, ECHR 2000XII, and Boris Kostadinov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 53, 21 January 2016).",

However, none of them was released on that day; both applicants were formally remanded in custody to secure their attendance at a hearing before the Justice of the Peace the next day. The Government argued that the term of the applicants\u2019 detention had remained within the forty-eight-hour time-limit provided for by Article 27.5 of the Code of Administrative Offences. However, neither the Government nor the domestic authorities provided any justification as required by Article 27.3 of the Code, namely that it was an \u201cexceptional case\u201d or that it was \u201cnecessary for the prompt and proper examination of the administrative case and to secure the enforcement of any penalty to be imposed\u201d. In the absence of any explicit reasons given by the authorities for not releasing the applicants, the Court considers that their administrative detention for approximately eighteen and twenty hours respectively was unjustified and arbitrary (see, for similar reasoning, Navalnyy and Yashin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 76204/11, \u00a7 96, 4\u00a0December 2014).",

He argued that the video-recording submitted by him proved that the submissions of the police officers in question were false.

As far as breaking through the police cordon is concerned, the Court has previously found that this resulted partly from the pressure of the crowd which had built up because of the unexpected and unannounced change of the venue layout by the authorities, and partly from a coordinated attempt by a group of individuals to force the cordon open (see Frumkin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 113-16 and 132, and Razvozzhayev and Udaltsov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0284). It must be stressed that the second applicant was not accused of having acted within that group, and even if he found himself outside the cordon after it was broken, there is no evidence that he had contributed to breaking it. Shouting slogans and entering the traffic area (which had been closed to traffic at the material time) could not be regarded as proof of any violent intentions on his part (see Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, \u00a7 171). Therefore, the Court considers that the behaviour of both applicants remained strictly peaceful and that they thus enjoyed the protection of Article 11 of the Convention.",

He was one of the active participants and speakers at the assembly and he was on his way to address the public gathered at the meeting venue when he was apprehended. It appears that the police prevented him from going on the stage and arrested him in an attempt to implement their decision to terminate the assembly. However, most of those present at the assembly venue were not aware of its early termination, or of the official order to disperse (see Frumkin, cited above, \u00a7 36), and therefore it cannot be conclusively established that the first applicant had received the order by way of a general announcement.
