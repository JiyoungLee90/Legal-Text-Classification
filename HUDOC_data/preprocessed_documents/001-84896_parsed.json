Such ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention. The assessment of this minimum level is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the state of health of the victim (see Ireland v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p.\u00a065, \u00a7\u00a0162). Although the purpose of such treatment is a factor to be taken into account, in particular the question of whether it was intended to humiliate or debase the victim, the absence of any such purpose does not inevitably lead to a finding that there has been no violation of Article 3 (e.g. Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 2001-III, and Vala\u0161inas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7 101, ECHR\u00a02001-VIII).",
