One wall of the building was completely demolished, two were partially destroyed and one wall remained intact. Among the debris of the building there were two pillows, a blanket and metal kitchenware. There also were two consumer gas cylinders, one of which had a hole in it. The investigators took samples of the soil and collected metal fragments. There were also utility structures next to the building, some of them unfinished. In one of those there was a horse standing. In another one thirty-five cartridges of 5.45 mm calibre were found hidden in a plastic bottle. In a third structure the investigators found seventeen blank cartridges of 7.62 mm calibre. There was a cattle stable which was not damaged. There was a shell hole located within the distance of some 1.5 \u2013 2\u00a0kilometres from the building.",

However, its judgments are essentially declaratory in nature and, in general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment (see, among other authorities, Scozzari and Giunta v.\u00a0Italy [GC], nos.\u00a039221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7\u00a0249, ECHR 2000-VIII; Brum\u0103rescu v.\u00a0Romania (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7 20, ECHR 2001I; Akdivar and Others v.
