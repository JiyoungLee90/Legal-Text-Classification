It recalls that, while entrusting the prosecution and punishment of similar minor offences to administrative authorities is not inconsistent with the Convention, the person concerned must have an opportunity to challenge any decision made against him or her before a tribunal that offers the guarantees of Article\u00a06 (see Kadubec v.\u00a0Slovakia, judgment of 2\u00a0September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, \u00a7 57).

This decision was reviewed by the Ministry of Defence. Thus the decisions in question were taken by administrative authorities which - and this has not been disputed before the Court - did not meet the requirements of an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Since section 83(1) of the Minor Offences Act of 1990 and Article 248(2)(f) of the Code of Civil Procedure, as in force at the relevant time, precluded such decisions from being examined by ordinary courts, and given that the Constitutional Court failed to redress the situation complained of, the Court concludes that the applicant's right to a hearing by a tribunal has not been respected. The fact that the relevant legal provisions preventing the ordinary courts from reviewing administrative decisions on minor offences in similar cases were later repealed cannot affect the position in the present case.",
