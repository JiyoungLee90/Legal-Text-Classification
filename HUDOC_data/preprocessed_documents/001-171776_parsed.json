They had married in December 2001 and she had moved to Denmark in 2002. In March 2003, she had met E. on a dating site and they had commenced a relationship and had sexual relations twice a week, on a few occasions without protection. She had become pregnant and informed E., but he had been in a dilemma because he was married at the time. In November 2003 she had been diagnosed as HIV-positive. When L. was born in January 2004 the second applicant was considered to be the father. They had separated in 2005 but had continued to live together until the beginning of 2006. After she and the second applicant had stopped having sexual relations, she had only had sexual relations with E. The latter had said that he would provide support for her and L, but he had never given her any money. He had said that everything would fall into place once he divorced. E. had seen L. several times and taken him swimming or to play in a park. She wanted L. to be introduced to E.\u2019s other children, but E. did not want that. Instead they had agreed that L. should have a sibling and they had planned their sexual activities according to her ovulation cycle in order for her to become pregnant. When S. was born in December\u00a02006, the second applicant had wanted to help her and had therefore acknowledged fatherhood. E. had come to see her at the hospital after she had given birth to S. He knew that he was the biological father of both boys. He had also acknowledged that in several emails and text messages to her. Moreover, E.\u2019s mother had met the boys and had said that L. reminded her of E. when he was a child. E. had never contributed financially to the care of the children. In 2008 she had told E. that he would have to take care of the children soon and that she would report to the authorities that he was the biological father. He had replied that he did not want any responsibility for the children and ended their relationship. She wanted the boys to know their true identity while she was alive. L. was confused about the situation and had said \u201cmy father is uncle E., but my old father is [the second applicant]\u201d.",

He had met the first applicant in April or May 2003 but at the time they could not meet very often, because they were both married. The relationship was purely sexual, and he had no feelings for the first applicant. Their relationship had continued until 2008. They had met in the first applicant\u2019s home or in swinger clubs or in hotels. They had had sexual relations in swinger clubs from spring 2003 until 2007. He and another man had had sexual relations with her at the same time, but he could not recall when. The first applicant had given him the impression that she protected herself. He had chosen to use a condom. He might be L.\u2019s father, but they had not as such discussed the matter at the time. He had not wanted a child, whereas the first applicant had. She had told him that she would take care of the child herself. In December 2004, due to the applicants\u2019 separation, the first applicant had taken an apartment on her own and E. had visited her and L. there. L. called him \u201cuncle E\u201d. Their sexual relationship had continued in 2005 but the first applicant had told him that she had also met other men on a dating site. In 2006 they had had sexual relations regularly, including in a swinger club once or twice. They had made a plan for the first applicant to become pregnant again and thought that it would be good for L. to have a sibling. He could not remember whether they had had sexual relations in the fertile period between December 2005 and 26 February 2006 and they had not discussed whether he was the biological father. He had visited the first applicant in hospital in connection with the birth. He had found it natural that the second applicant should be father to the children since he was married to the first applicant. He had never behaved like a father to the children: he was still \u201cuncle E\u201d. It was true that he had gone swimming with L. once in October\u00a02008 and that he had told his mother that he might be the children\u2019s father.

The rules were amended on 1 December 2013 because of the introduction of comaternity, but the amendments did not change the substantial rules relevant to this case. The purpose of the paternity rules is to ensure the mutual rights of the child and the father. The most important legal effects of paternity are that the father has a duty to maintain the child, that the father and the child have a right to inherit from each other, that the child may take the father\u2019s surname and that the child may have the same nationality as the father if the relevant conditions are met. In addition, paternity is generally a condition for allowing the father to share the custody of the child and a condition for the right to contact for a man whose child does not live with him.",

The Children Act Committee was appointed by the Ministry of Justice in 1992 and was to make proposals for a revision of the Children Act, including the consideration of new paternity rules. In 1997, the Committee issued an interim report on paternity. According to the interim report, the Committee had worked on the basis of the fundamental assumption that a child should be entitled to have both a mother and a legal father to the widest extent possible. The report also states that the Committee found that an attempt should be made to design the rules on reopening paternity proceedings so that permanent stability concerning the child\u2019s situation could be provided as rapidly as possible. This particularly implied that a paternity case would only qualify for reopening when certain conditions were met. Apart from reopening shortly after the child\u2019s birth (section 5), and reopening due to an error in recording of paternity (section 23) the leading principle of the reopening rules is that a paternity case will only be reopened if it is proved on the balance of probabilities that another man can become the child\u2019s father. The Children Act Committee also proposed enactment of the non-statutory doctrine of acknowledgement on which caselaw had been based prior to the Act. The doctrine of acknowledgement implies that a party can be barred from instituting paternity proceedings even when the statutory time-limits have not expired. This is the case if the father or mother has treated the child as being the father\u2019s even though they know or suspect that the father is not the genetic father of the child. Application of the doctrine is based on a specific assessment of the individual case.",

However, the boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under this provision do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar. The Court does not find it necessary to determine whether in the present case the impugned decision, to refuse to reopen the paternity cases, constitutes an interference with the applicants\u2019 exercise of the right to respect for their private and family life or is to be seen as involving an allegation of failure on the part of the respondent State to comply with a positive obligation.

The Court points out in this respect that in various cases in which men have acknowledged paternity in full awareness that they may not be the biological father, but subsequently, after the expiry of the limitation period, wish to seek annulment of such recognition, it has accepted that it is open to the domestic courts to give greater weight to the interests of the child rather than to the applicant\u2019s interest in disproving his freely-acknowledged paternity (see, for example, Yildirim v.

The Court points out in this connection that when domestic authorities carefully assess the best interests of the child, the Court should not, in principle, contradict their findings, in particular if they are made by an independent court in judicial proceedings (see, A.L., cited above, \u00a7 72).",

In the present case, it was established that the second applicant was not the father of L. or S., and there was a high probability that the biological father was E. However, he opposed the reopening of the paternity suit and did not want to subject himself voluntarily to DNA testing. In making its decision not to allow the reopening of the paternity proceedings, one of the decisive elements for the High Court was that reopening carried a slight risk that paternity would not be established, with the result that the children might become fatherless. Apparently, Danish law does not give the courts the possibility of subjecting an alleged father to DNA testing prior to the reopening of a paternity suit. Thus the law obliges children who want to find out their true identity to bear the risk of becoming fatherless. In this way Danish law, instead of giving priority to the interest of children in establishing their true identity, actually protects the interests of alleged fathers who are afraid of having to assume their responsibilities.",

However, in that exercise the best interests of the child should be given priority. This is especially important in such sensitive cases as the present one, where the discovery of the truth concerning the identity of a child\u2019s parents (see Odi\u00e8vre v. France [GC], no. 42326/98, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2003III) is highly relevant for his or her personal development. If the question of paternity is at stake and a potential biological father known to the mother, there should be some means guaranteed by the authorities whereby that person is obliged to undergo a DNA test, in order to ensure, as a prerequisite for the reopening of a paternity suit, that the biological father has already been established before the proceedings are finally resumed. As it failed to guarantee that possibility, we find Danish law to be contrary to the best interests of the child and overly protective of the interests of the putative or alleged father.",

The Court has on several occasions emphasised the importance of the right of children to be heard and the need to take their views into consideration on matters which concern them in accordance with their age and maturity (see, for example, M. and M. v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 10161/13, \u00a7 171, ECHR 2015; see also Mandet, cited above, \u00a7 55). The children were not parties to the proceedings before the High Court.

Yet, in the present case, the first applicant has been reproached by the majority for not having taken any initiative to establish the biological identity of the father of her children any earlier than 2008. In the circumstances as they were in the case at hand we find this criticism inappropriate, as it appears to have been delicate for the first applicant to reveal the situation about the alleged true biological father of her first son, L., any earlier.",
