However, that does not make the undesirable behaviour disappear. Only if therapy makes the patient acknowledge and accept his disorder and face the consequences, which might be chemical castration in extreme cases, will it be possible to cause a behavioural change that has the nature of palliative care, and if that is the case, the risk of relapse will be reduced, as will also the patient\u2019s dangerousness.\u201d",

If his heart were to become even slightly affected by the libido-suppressing medication, he would die from it. Ever since his youth, it had been a known fact that he suffered from a heart condition but Herstedvester Institution had ignored this fact. His heart condition was one of the reasons why he could not tolerate the libidosuppressing drugs. Androcur (cyproterone acetate), the libidosuppressing medication that they wanted to prescribe for him, would also lead to a deterioration in his general health, including his osteoporosis, and would affect his weight.

The consent given by patients of that category may be influenced by their penal situation, especially if they were facing a long - or even indeterminate - period of imprisonment. The Committee recommended that steps be taken to ensure that the signed consent of patients was obtained prior to the commencement of treatment with libido-suppressing drugs, and that such persons be given a detailed explanation (including in writing) of all recognised adverse effects of the drugs concerned. Further, the CPT stressed that additional safeguards (e.g. the support of a system of lay/legal \u201cadvocates\u201d) should exist to ensure that the consent given by such prisoners to medical treatment can be as free and informed as possible in the circumstances.",

As regards the first group, the signed consent of persons concerned had been obtained prior to the commencement of treatment. However, it appeared that they had accepted the treatment as a \u201cticket to freedom\u201d (i.e. release on parole or transfer to an open prison) rather than as a treatment for something which was wrong with them, not to speak of an illness. They indicated that they met a psychologist at varying intervals (from once every two weeks to once every two months), but that they did not take part in group therapy. Consultations with a psychiatrist were reportedly rare. All of them had been informed of the possible adverse side-effects effects of the treatment (i.e. bone decalcification, dose-dependent liver damage, weight gain, breast enlargement and hot flushes), but some felt that the information was not complete and feared that the treatment was dangerous for them. Some of them were experiencing side-effects for which they were receiving medication. From the group of prisoners waiting to start treatment, one prisoner stated that he had not received any information in writing about the treatment, but after a number of meetings with his case worker and a psychologist, he had decided to follow it because of having been told that he can be transferred to an open prison. Some of the prisoners who had refused the treatment because they could not come to terms with its adverse side-effects indicated that they had felt pressured to accept it.",

In response to the delegation\u2019s preliminary observations, the Danish authorities indicated that the conditions for offering libido-suppressing treatment to prisoners are very restrictive and only two to four inmates a year commence this treatment. Medical libido-suppressing treatment is only offered when all other options have been exhausted or are deemed insufficient to counter the risk of relapse into sexual offences. Combined with psychotherapy, the libido-suppressing treatment is intended to prevent the sexual offender from having compulsive and violent sexual fantasies while suppressing the sexual libidinal pressure, so as to avoid new sexual offences. According to the authorities, treatment is only commenced when the inmate has given his written informed consent. During a consultation with an external endocrinologist, the inmate is briefed on the effects and side-effects of the medicine orally and in writing, whereupon the inmate is invited to sign a statement confirming that he has received such a briefing and that he is willing to receive the treatment. In Denmark, the person\u2019s consent is a condition for the treatment of persons of unsound mind. This also applies to persons who undergo libido-suppressing treatment. Typically, however, the inmate is motivated by the fact that he cannot obtain permission for leave, release on parole or conditional discharge without commencing libido-suppressing treatment. Since 1997, all cases concerning libido-suppressing treatment as a condition for release are submitted to the Medico-Legal Council for approval. The Medico-Legal Council, which is an independent body, considers whether psychotherapeutic treatment is sufficient to reduce the risk of relapse into similar dangerous crime. Medical libido-suppressing treatment can start only if the Council agrees that it is necessary. In the opinion of the Herstedvester Institution, most of the inmates undergoing libido-suppressing treatment benefit from the psychotherapeutic element of the treatment. The therapeutic element of the treatment has several purposes, including assessing whether the inmate\u2019s mental condition changes in connection with the medical element of the treatment. Libido-suppressing treatment is typically given over a long period, and some inmates may therefore feel that a long time passes before liberty privileges are granted. This may be perceived as highly frustrating by the inmate, who might get the impression of not benefiting from the treatment.",

They would indicate that the medical libido-suppressing treatment of sex offenders is at present surrounded by appropriate safeguards. Nevertheless, in the light of the information obtained by the delegation during the visit to the Herstedvester Institution, the Committee considers that more attention should be paid to ensuring that these safeguards are being fully respected in practice. In particular, special care should be taken to make sure that prisoners\u2019 consent to medical libido-suppressing treatment is genuinely free and informed. In this connection, the provision of full information (oral and written) on the known adverse effects \u2013 as well as the possible benefits \u2013 of the treatment, should be improved. Further, no prisoner should be put under undue pressure to accept medical libido-suppressing treatment. Moreover, in addition to drug treatment, efforts should be made to step up psychotherapy and counselling with a view to reducing the risk of re-offending.\u201d",

Firstly, since Mr Ruiz Rivera could be considered of unsound mind, the assessment of his dangerousness involved an assessment of whether therapy had improved his mental condition. The applicant in the present case was not suffering from a mental disorder and he had a normal intellectual capacity (see the opinion by the Medico-Legal Council of 2 November 1995, paragraph 11 above). Moreover, the mental status examination report of 14 September 1995 (see paragraph 10 above) concluded that \u201cthe applicant was not suited for psychotherapy, the reason being that due to his distinctive personality characteristics, and despite his awareness of the consequences, he exhibits strong mental resistance to psychotherapy attempts by adopting his mental defence mechanisms ...\u201d. He was not motivated for chemical castration either. The latter conclusion was confirmed by the Medico-Legal Council\u2019s opinion of 22 August 2016 (see paragraph 34 above). Thus, the assessment of whether he was dangerous did not involve an assessment of whether his mental condition had improved, rather it concentrated on whether he was willing to take libido-suppressing drugs, which had been deemed essential by a number of different psychiatric consultants since 1995.",

There must be a sufficient causal connection between the conviction and the deprivation of liberty at issue. The causal link required by sub-paragraph (a) might possibly be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release or to re-detain was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the initial decision (by a sentencing court) or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives (see, among others, H.W. v.

Moreover, when the offender has been detained in the same prison for a considerable time and there appears to be a \u201cdeadlock situation\u201d it is particularly important to consult an external expert also in order to obtain fresh propositions for initiating the necessary therapeutic treatment (see H.W. v.

The Court has noted in this respect that a decision not to release a detainee because he still posed a threat to the public may become inconsistent with the objectives of the sentencing court\u2019s order for preventive detention if the person concerned is placed and remanded in detention because there was a risk that he would reoffend but is, at the same time, deprived of the necessary means, such as suitable therapy, to demonstrate that he was no longer dangerous.
