That the authorities had entrusted the investigation to a team of two investigating judges also showed the great importance they attached to it.

It based a secondary argument on the personality of the applicant, whose behaviour both before and after his arrest reflected his intention of systematically deleting all evidence of liability, for example by falsifying or destroying accounts. According to the indictments chamber, there were also specific indications justifying the fear that he might abuse his regained liberty by carrying out acts, which would also be facilitated by the thorough entanglement of the sixty-odd companies controlled by him and his influence on their employees, namely eliminating items of evidence which were still hidden but whose probable existence followed from other documents, manufacturing false evidence, or conniving with witnesses.

Moreover, no other pre-trial detention had ever lasted so long. The authorities had neglected nothing in order to complete the case-file and had even established a unit consisting of two investigating judges who were themselves assisted by persons assigned exclusively to that unit, including two specialist policemen and four secretaries; a cantonal attorney was in charge of supervising them. There had also been substantial technical resources, including computer equipment. A total of 350 interrogations, including 36 of the applicant, and some 30 decisions on appeals by the applicant had been needed to reach the final judgment, which was 1,100 pages long.",

The Court notes that as early as 7 November 1985 the Federal Court, when verifying the proportionality of the length of the impugned deprivation of liberty, gave consideration to the conduct of the proceedings. After an examination it concluded that W.\u2019s complaints in this respect were not substantiated (see paragraph 40 above). Fearing an overlong period of pre-trial detention, it regularly urged the cantonal authorities to act with all speed and even gave them specific instructions, and also observed that these had been complied with. Consequently, despite certain worries, it never regarded the time spent by the applicant in prison as excessive. It considered that the applicant was primarily responsible for the slow pace of the investigation: there had been great difficulties in reconstructing the financial situation of his companies, as a result of the state of their accounts. It stated that things had become even more difficult when he decided to refuse to make any statement, thereby delaying the progress of the case (see paragraph 10 above).",

In agreement with the Commission on this point, it finds no period during which the investigators did not carry out their inquiries with the necessary promptness, nor was there any delay caused by possible shortage of personnel or equipment. Consequently, it appears that the length of the detention in issue was essentially attributable to the exceptional complexity of the case and the conduct of the applicant. To be sure, he was not obliged to co-operate with the authorities, but he must bear the consequences which his attitude may have caused for the progress of the investigation.",

There should be no place for judicial speculation or judicial intuition as a substitute for objective evidence. The issues involved should be judged by the same objective standard which is the basis as all other justiciable controversies. The present case, as presented to the Court, does not reveal any record of witnesses having been heard on probability of the applicant absconding or interfering with the gathering of evidence or with the evidence already gathered. The suggestion in one of the Swiss courts that because his bad bookkeeping (referred to in paragraph 16 of the majority judgment) made investigation more difficult should militate against his provisional liberation is not a reason which should be put against him in the balance. Likewise his alleged failure to assist in the gathering of evidence against himself is also an untenable reason for supporting the refusal to grant him provisional liberty. It is always open to a court to impose conditions upon provisional liberty even to the extent of reporting daily to the police if there exists some suspicion of absconding. If there lingers some suspicion of interfering with the evidence a reasonable condition may be imposed restricting consorting with certain named persons or restricting access to certain offices or documents. None of that appears to have been considered seriously, if at all.",
