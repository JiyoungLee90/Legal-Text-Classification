There is no indication in the case file that this celebration was not peaceful or that the people who had attended the celebration engaged in acts of violence. Consequently, the applicants were prosecuted solely for shouting slogans.",

                                        "content": "28.\u00a0\u00a0The Court observes that, taken literally, one of the slogans shouted by the second applicant \u201cRise up again and again, our president is \u00d6calan\u201d might be construed as having a violent tone. Nevertheless, as stated above, this slogan was shouted during a lawful and peaceful gathering \u2013 which limited its potential impact on \u201cnational security\u201d and \u201cpublic order\u201d \u2013 and thus it is not a call for violence. The Court further notes that the present application is distinguishable on its context from the case of Ta\u015fdemir v.\u00a0Turkey ((dec.), no. 38841/07, 23 February 2010). In the latter case, the slogan shouted by the applicant, \u201cBiji Serok Apo, HPG cepheye misillemeye\u201d (Long live Apo, HPG (the armed wing of the PKK) to the front line in retaliation) had clearly amounted to an apology for terrorism. In this connection, the Court stresses that Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed (see Karata\u015f v. Turkey [GC], no. 23168/94, \u00a7 49, ECHR 1999IV; and G\u00fcl and Others, cited above, \u00a7 41). The Court also reiterates that, according to its well-established case-law, paragraph 2 of Article 10 is applicable not only to \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cideas\u201d which are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d (see S\u00fcrek and \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey [GC], nos. 23927/94 and 24277/94, \u00a7 57, 8 July 1999).",
