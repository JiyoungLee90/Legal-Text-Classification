Under the pertinent case-law, an appeal under public law was only admissible if the legal provisions relied upon also protected the applicant\u2019s own interests. In view of the fact that the applicant\u2019s building marked the historical centre of Samedan, the Tribunal concluded that the provisions serving the protection of the overall appearance of the locality also served the protection of the applicant\u2019s building.

In those cases, the Court based its decision on the fact that the non-communicated observations did not contain anything new or relevant to the case and that the impugned decision had not been based on them. In the present case, the Federal Department of Interior, which had not been heard in the previous proceedings before the administrative authorities, made submissions falling within its own competency as a Federal organ. It does not appear that the Federal Department merely repeated arguments which had already been raised before. It cannot thus be said \u2013 and it has not been alleged by the Government \u2013 that the submissions were completely irrelevant for the proceedings before the Federal Tribunal.

The procedural situation thus resembles the one examined by the Court in the case of Schaller-Bossert. In that case, the Court was not called upon to pronounce an opinion on the impact of the case-law adopted by the Federal Tribunal by judgment of 22 November 2005 (see paragraph 13, above), because this judgment was given only after the relevant proceedings had been terminated (see Schaller-Bossert, cited above, \u00a7 41).

In fact, Article 6 \u00a7 1 is intended above all to secure the interests of the parties and those of the proper administration of justice (see Nider\u00f6st-Huber, cited above, \u00a7 30). Consequently, it falls within the responsibility of the domestic courts to ensure that the standards set by Article 6 \u00a7 1, and, in particular, the protection of the equality of arms, are respected in each individual case. This implies the obligation to interpret the provisions on the admissibility of a further exchange of comments (see paragraph 12, above) in a way which does not curtail the adverse party\u2019s right to comment on any new submissions.",

It observes, in particular, that the Federal Tribunal, when serving new submissions on the adverse party \u201cfor information\u201d, does not appear to indicate to that party when it will give its decision on the case. Consequently, the adverse party may encounter difficulties in assessing how much time is left for examining the new submissions and preparing comments. However, in the specific circumstances of the instant case, the Court is satisfied that this procedural disadvantage was sufficiently counterbalanced by the option to request leave to submit comments. In this respect, the Court notes that the comments of the Federal Department of Interior that had been served on the applicant contained not more than two pages and that the Federal Tribunal gave its judgment more than three weeks after serving this document on the applicant. The Court consider that the applicant should have been in a position to examine whether the content of the documents necessitated further comments, in which case he could have requested leave to submit such comments. In light of the fact that the Federal Tribunal, in its judgment of 22 November 2005, expressly referred to the case-law of this Court on Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the Court has no reason to assume that such a request would have lacked any prospect of success.",
