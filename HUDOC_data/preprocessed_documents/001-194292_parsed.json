In their turn, the Government contended that the minimum standard at issue had been respected in the applicant\u2019s prison (see paragraph 35 above). However, the Government failed to specify the exact size of the cells in which the applicant had been detained. Nor did they specify how many inmates had actually occupied those cells at the material time. In the absence of such information, the Court is inclined to accord weight to the applicant\u2019s factual submissions on this issue to the extent that the minimum standard of 3\u00a0square metres of personal space had not been respected during his detention (see Aleksandr Vladimirovich Smirnov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a069250/11, \u00a7 60, 13 March 2014, and Kiyashko v.\u00a0Ukraine [Committee], no. 37240/07, \u00a7\u00a7 86-87, 23 February 2017). In this connection, the Court also has regard to the findings of the CPT concerning its visit in 2012 to another prison, where male life prisoners, like the applicant, were detained at the material time. Those findings suggest that the standard of 3 square meters of floor space per inmate, that is without counting in-cell sanitary facility (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 114), might not have been respected in that prison (see paragraph 42 above).",

The Government did not demonstrate that there were factors capable of adequately compensating for the scarce allocation of personal space to the applicant in order to rebut that presumption. To a certain extent, their submissions tended to support his allegations that most of the time \u2013 at least, twenty-three hours per day \u2013 he had remained confined to his cell, while the size of the outdoor exercise facilities \u2013 measuring around 11\u00a0square metres \u2013 was very restricted, regard being had to the applicant\u2019s uncontested statement that he had had to share those facilities with eight other detainees (see paragraphs 32 and 35 above). Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s allegations that there were problems with lighting, ventilation and heating, which are supported by the findings of the Ukrainian Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights who visited the applicant\u2019s prison in 2012 (see paragraph 41 above), suggest that the applicant\u2019s lack of personal space might have been aggravated by those problems (see Aleksandr Vladimirovich Smirnov, cited above, \u00a7 60).",
