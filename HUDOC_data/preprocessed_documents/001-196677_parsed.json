It held that a substitution of assets was possible in respect of unitary enterprises. However, under sections\u00a094(2) and 115(2) of the Insolvency Act, this way of restoring a company\u2019s solvency could only be included in the external administration plan or submitted for the committee of creditors\u2019 consideration if there was a decision by the managerial body of the debtor entitled to decide on the debtor\u2019s concluding such transactions by the company\u2019s constituent documents. The FGUP\u2019s assets were State property allocated to the FGUP\u2019s economic control. The enterprise could not enter into any transactions leading to the encumbrance or alienation of immovable property without the owner\u2019s consent (Article\u00a0295\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Civil Code). The court established that the interests of the owner of the assets of the debtor unitary enterprise in the context of the insolvency proceedings were represented by the Federal State Assets Management Agency. The court rejected the OAO\u2019s reference to the Agency\u2019s letter of 28\u00a0June 2005, as it indicated that transactions involving immovable property and shares of the newly created joint-stock company were subject to a mandatory expert examination by the Federal State Assets Management Agency. However, according to the court, the market valuation report (see paragraph\u00a014 above) had not been subject to the mandatory expert examination by that Agency. The court concluded that the decision of 25\u00a0December 2006 had been taken in violation of domestic law, and accordingly declared the creation of the OAO and transfer of assets invalid. It further ordered the assets to be returned to the FGUP, pursuant to Article\u00a0167\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Civil Code (see paragraph\u00a066 below).",

The court established that, in accordance with section\u00a094(1) of the Insolvency Act, as of the date of the institution of external administration, the powers of the managerial bodies of the debtor, as well as those of the owner of property of the debtor incorporated as a unitary enterprise, had to be terminated, and the powers of the head of the debtor and other managerial bodies of the debtor were transferred to the administrator. However, that rule was subject to the exceptions set out in section 94(2) of the Insolvency Act (see paragraph\u00a071 below). In particular, within the limits of the competences provided for by federal law, the managerial bodies of the debtor were entitled to take decisions on substitution of the debtor\u2019s assets. Even though the rights of the owner of the assets of the unitary enterprise were not set out directly in the Insolvency Act, section\u00a094(2) thereof was to be applied by analogy. The court concluded that in the absence of any decision by the owner of the FGUP\u2019s assets, a substitution of assets could not be included in the external administration plan. The court, however, found no evidence that such a decision had ever been taken by the owner of the assets. Accordingly, the external manager\u2019s decision to create the OAO was invalid, as it had been taken in violation of the Insolvency Act. The appellate court further confirmed that the first-instance court had correctly applied the consequences of the invalid transaction and had rightly ordered the OAO to return the assets to the FGUP.",

In particular, they submitted that the applicants had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to them, such as compensation for damage under Articles\u00a01069 and 1070 of the Civil Code, as well as non-pecuniary damage under Article\u00a0151 of the Civil Code. They argued that the debts of the State unitary enterprise \u2013 a separate legal entity under domestic law \u2013 could not be attributed to the State, for exactly the same reasons as those summarised in Liseytseva and Maslov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0136-42). The company had not performed any public functions. Its activities had been commercial, performed at the FGUP\u2019s own risk. The subsidiary liability of the State could not be engaged since the owner had not caused the company\u2019s insolvency. It had not given any binding instructions or otherwise defined the company\u2019s actions. The authorities had provided the requisite assistance to the applicants in their efforts to have the court orders enforced. Furthermore, the State had not been responsible for the FGUP\u2019s debts as since 2005 it had been placed in \u201cexternal administration\u201d; the owner\u2019s powers had accordingly terminated in accordance with the Insolvency Act as in force at the material time (see paragraphs\u00a070-71), and the owners\u2019 rights defined in Article\u00a0113\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a01, 2 and 4 of the Civil Code (see paragraph\u00a086 above) had been discontinued. They argued that since the external manager was not a \u201cpublic official\u201d, his actions could not be directly attributed to the State (see Katsyuk v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 58928/00, \u00a7\u00a039, 5 April 2005). Furthermore, the awards in the applicants\u2019 favour against the FGUP had been fully recovered and the delay in enforcement of one year and ten months had been justified by the complexity of the insolvency procedure involving numerous creditors. Lastly, as regards Mr Tomilin and Ms\u00a0Kudryashova, they argued that the applicants\u2019 rights had been restored at the domestic level as the awards in the applicants\u2019 favour had been indexlinked and each applicant had received RUB\u00a01,000 (EUR\u00a022) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",

Having examined the Government\u2019s respective objection in detail, the Court held that the existing legal framework in Russia did not provide unitary enterprises with the degree of institutional and operational independence that would absolve the State from any responsibility under the Convention for any such companies\u2019 debts (see Liseytseva and Maslov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0193-204). The Court held that, in order to decide on the operational and institutional independence of a given unitary enterprise having the right of economic control, it had to assess the nature of the enterprise\u2019s functions and the degree of the State authorities\u2019 actual involvement in the management of the enterprise\u2019s assets. In order to determine the issue of State responsibility for the debts of unitary enterprises, the Court must examine whether and how the extensive powers of control provided for by domestic law were actually exercised by the authorities in a given case (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 18392 and 204-06).",

With respect to the external administration procedure, the Court cannot but agree with the Government that, in accordance with section\u00a094(1) of the Insolvency Act, as of the date of the institution of external administration, the powers of the managerial bodies of the debtor, as well as those of the owner of property of the debtor incorporated as a unitary enterprise, had to be terminated, and the powers of the head of the debtor and other managerial bodies of the debtor were transferred to the administrator (see paragraph\u00a070 above). However, as it follows from the relevant provisions of domestic law \u2013 and as specifically established by the domestic courts in the proceedings concerning the validity of the OAO\u2019s creation in the present case \u2013 that rule was subject to the exceptions set out in section 94(2) of the Insolvency Act \u2013 notably, in so far as the approval of the substitution of assets was concerned (see paragraph\u00a071 for the relevant domestic law and paragraph\u00a023 above for the courts\u2019 reasoning). Furthermore, the newly created company\u2019s transactions remained subject to the authorities\u2019 mandatory approval (see paragraph\u00a023 above). This lack of approval was precisely the crux of the court action which the prosecutor brought in the interests of the Ministry of Defence and the Federal State Assets Management Agency, claiming to declare the substitution of assets invalid (see paragraph\u00a020 above). Having applied section\u00a094(2) of the Insolvency Act by analogy, the courts confirmed that the debtor had been entitled to decide on the substitution of the debtor\u2019s assets (ibid.) \u2013 a crucial element of the case at hand. The courts concluded that in the absence of a relevant decision by the owner of the FGUP\u2019s property, a substitution of assets could not have been included in the external administration plan (paragraph\u00a023 above). As a result, the creation of the OAO was declared invalid, and at the time of the judgments in the applicants\u2019 favour (late 2008 to early 2009, see Column\u00a03 of Appendix\u00a0I) the assets were being returned under the FGUP\u2019s economic control.",

However, it is sufficient for the Court to note that no details about the final awards in the index-linking proceedings against the FGUP and their eventual enforcement were provided by the parties (see paragraph\u00a062 above).

Considering the minor nature of the awards, the Court arrives at the conclusion that the applicants did not suffer a significant disadvantage as a result of the authorities\u2019 failure to enforce the awards in good time. The Court further observes that it has already dealt with the issue of the non-enforcement of judgments against unitary enterprises on several occasions (see Liseytseva and Maslov, cited above, and numerous follow-ups) and concludes that respect for human rights, as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto, does not require examination of the present complaint on its merits.

The Court has already found that if an applicant for any reason obtains the writ of enforcement from the trial court himself, it would appear logical to require that he submits it to the competent authority with a view to enforcement of the judgment (see, mutatis mutandis, Gadzhikhanov and Saukov v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 10511/08 and 5866/09, \u00a7\u00a026, 31\u00a0January 2012). In the absence of any explanation from the parties, the authorities cannot to be held responsible for the applicant\u2019s unexplained failure to follow the domestic enforcement procedure and, notably, for his deliberate refusal to provide the writ of enforcement (see, mutatis mutandis, Gadzhikhanov and Saukov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027-31). Accordingly, the delay up to 19\u00a0October 2011, which in itself was not unreasonable, is not attributable to the authorities.

Ukraine, nos. 35091/02 and 9\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-46, ECHR 2004XII; Cooperativa Agricola SloboziaHanesei v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a039745/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01719, 3 April 2007; Yershova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054-63; and Kotov [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092107). The key criteria used in the above-mentioned cases to determine whether the State was indeed responsible for such debts were as follows: the company\u2019s legal status (under public or private law); the nature of its activity (a public function or an ordinary commercial business); the context of its operation (such as a monopoly or heavily regulated business); its institutional independence (the extent of State ownership); and its operational independence (the extent of State supervision and control) (see Ali\u0161i\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no.\u00a060642/08, \u00a7\u00a0114, ECHR 2014).

The Court can only discern from the documents submitted by the parties that the OAO was required to return all assets to the FGUP and was proceeding with the transfer at the material time, having \u201cdiscontinued production activities\u201d (see paragraph\u00a035 above).",

The Court finds it significant that in each set of those proceedings, the courts had no reason to doubt that, as the transfer of title to the FGUP\u2019s assets had taken place as a result of the invalid transaction, the OAO had not acquired the rights and obligations under the applicants\u2019 contracts of employment during the impugned period (ibid.).

As regards the remaining provisions of Chapter\u00a059, the Court has already found on several occasions \u2013 albeit in the context of judgments given against the State authorities \u2013 that, while the possibility of such compensation was not totally excluded, this remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, notably because it requires the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities. It was not contested by the Government that at no point had the fault of the authorities been established in the cases at hand.

Otherwise, at no point did the applicants allege in their complaints to the Court that the bailiffs had unduly delayed the transfer of the writs or otherwise failed to carry out their duties properly.
