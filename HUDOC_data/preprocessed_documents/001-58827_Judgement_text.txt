The case was referred to the Court, by Mr Hans Peter Löffler (“the applicant”), an Austrian national, on 3 November 1998, within the three-month period laid down by former Articles 32 § 1 and 47 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It originated in an application (no. 30546/96) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 by the applicant. The applicant is represented by Mr R. Gabl, a lawyer practising in Linz (Austria). The Government of Austria are represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Winkler, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant’s request to the Court referred to Article 48 as amended by Protocol No. 9, which Austria had ratified. The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention as regards the length of the criminal proceedings against the applicant.
On 14 January 1999 the Panel of the Grand Chamber decided, pursuant to Article 5 § 4 of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention and Rules 100 § 1 and 24 § 6 of the Rules of Court, that the application would be examined by one of the Sections. It was, thereupon, assigned to the Third Section. Within that Section, the Chamber was constituted in accordance with Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
In accordance with Rule 59 § 3 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Chamber invited the parties to submit a memorial on the issues of the case. The applicant submitted a memorial on 16 April 1999, and the Government on 17 May 1999.
After consulting the Agent of the Government and applicant’s lawyer the Chamber decided not to hold a hearing.
On 11 April 1986 preliminary investigations on the suspicion of murder were instituted against the applicant. On 31 March 1987 a Court of Assizes (Geschworenengericht) at the Linz Regional Court (Landesgericht) convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to eighteen years' imprisonment. On 15 September 1987 the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) dismissed the applicant's plea of nullity and appeal against sentence.
On 6 September 1990 the applicant requested the re-opening of the criminal proceedings against him. On 11 December 1991 the Linz Regional Court dismissed the applicant's request. On 15 June 1992 the Linz Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) granted the applicant's appeal and reopened the criminal proceedings against him. At the same time the applicant was released.
On 23 August 1993 the Linz Public Prosecutor's Office filed a bill of indictment charging the applicant with murder. On 7 October 1993 the Linz Court of Appeal accepted the applicant's objections to the indictment.
On 30 May 1994 the Public Prosecutor's Office filed a new bill of indictment against the applicant. On 9 September 1994 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's objections to it.
On 6 February 1995 the Supreme Court dismissed a request by the Linz Regional Court to transfer jurisdiction in the case to a court in Vienna.
On 3 April 1995 the applicant filed a request under Section 91 of the Courts Organisation Act (Gerichtsorganisationsgesetz) with the Linz Court of Appeal. He complained about the inactivity of the Regional Court and requested the Court of Appeal to order the Regional Court to fix a date for the trial. On 24 May 1995 the Court of Appeal refused this request. The Court of Appeal found that the Regional Court had to wait for further expert opinions concerning a DNA test of hair and skin parts which had been found on the victim and the applicant’s clothes.
On 30 October 1995 the DNA test results were transmitted to the court.
On 12 February 1996 the Presiding Judge of the Assize Court fixed the date of the applicant's trial for 19 August 1996.
The applicant's trial commenced on 19 August 1996 and finished on 29 August 1996. On 29 August 1996 the Assize Court acquitted the applicant.
