The abductors, who had been armed, masked and in camouflage uniforms, had driven around in two cars without registration numbers in the centre of Derbent in broad daylight. Having abducted the applicant\u2019s husband, they had passed by the Road Police station situated about six hundred metres from the place of the abduction without being stopped. The fact that Sirazhudin Shafiyev had been given the passports and the money for the visa processing could have been learnt only by State agents and only directly from him after his abduction. The authorities had suspected Sirazhudin Shafiyev of terrorist activities. The applicant further stated that since her husband had been missing for more than one year, he could be presumed dead.

As regards the general background, the events complained of took place not in Chechnya, but in Dagestan, in September 2009, and there was neither a curfew in place nor any restrictions on driving around in civilian vehicles. Furthermore, from the documents submitted it follows that the applicant\u2019s version of the events was based on the statements of her relatives who had not witnessed the abduction themselves (see paragraphs 22, 23, 26 and 27 above) and that there were discrepancies between their statements and the statements given to the investigative authorities by the actual eye-witnesses (see paragraphs 32, 33 and 42 above). For instance, it is unclear whether the abductors had been in camouflage uniforms or black T-shirts (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above), whether or not their vehicles had official registration numbers (see paragraphs 7, 23, 32 and 45 above) or whether the applicant\u2019s relatives had video footage of the abduction (see paragraphs 22-23 and 41 and 45 above). Furthermore, as to the applicant\u2019s argument that the authorities could have learnt about the money and the documents handed over by Sirazhudin Shafiyev to Mr R.Sh. only from the former and only after his abduction, the Court is not persuaded that this could have been the only way for the representatives of the law-enforcement authorities to obtain this information (see paragraph 35 above).",

For instance, the investigators obtained the photograph of the abductors\u2019 vehicles from Sirazhudin Shafiyev\u2019s brother, Mr Ta.Sh., on 14 April 2010, almost seven months after the witness had provided them with this information (see paragraph 45 above).

Assuming that the applicant\u2019s access to the case file in April 2010 provided her with the chance to assess the progress of the investigation, in the light of the supervising prosecutor\u2019s orders of 19 March 2010 (see paragraph 38 above), it would have been sensible to presume that the shortcomings would be remedied and the necessary steps would be taken.

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the authorities cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin to request particular lines of inquiry or investigative procedures (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0130lhan, cited above, \u00a7 63): they must show their commitment to take all steps of their own motion and to demonstrate that they have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the identity of the person responsible will risk falling below this standard (see, for example, Salman v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106, and Tanrikulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, ECHR 1999-IV, \u00a7\u00a0109).",

This failure to act in a timely manner led to unnecessary protractions and a loss of time because steps which could have yielded results were not taken. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that any appeals by the applicant against the investigators\u2019 decisions would have had any prospects of spurring the progress of the investigation or effectively influencing its conduct. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their objection as regards the applicant\u2019s failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
