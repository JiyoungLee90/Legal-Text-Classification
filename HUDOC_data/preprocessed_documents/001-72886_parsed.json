The CPT has objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements in closed prisons and those objections are reinforced when, as is frequently the case, the dormitories in question are found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions. No doubt, various factors\u00a0\u2013 including those of a cultural nature - can make it preferable in certain countries to provide multi-occupancy accommodation for prisoners rather than individual cells.

Moreover, the risk of intimidation and violence is high. Such accommodation arrangements are prone to foster the development of offender subcultures and to facilitate the maintenance of the cohesion of criminal organisations. They can also render proper staff control extremely difficult, if not impossible; more specifically, in case of prison disturbances, outside interventions involving the use of considerable force are difficult to avoid. With such accommodation, the appropriate allocation of individual prisoners, based on a case by case risk and needs assessment, also becomes an almost impossible exercise. All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level; further, in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insufficient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions.",

Lack of sufficient funds has resulted in failure to modernize and equip tuberculosis facilities and, more generally, to maintain overall treatment services, leading to a decline in access to services.

At present, the share of tuberculosis cases that are HIV-positive is estimated at 54 per 100,000\u00a0population. The increase in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis resulted from inadequate treatment and shortages in the drug supply.

It notes that certain documents, such as an order issued by the advocate's union, which do not specifically state that the applicant instructs his representative to apply to the European Court of Human Rights, can imply that the representative is entitled to take any legal action aimed at remedying the applicant's situation, including the lodging of an application with the Court (see Falkovych v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a064200/00, 29\u00a0June 2004). The Court also notes that Mr Shulgin acted on behalf of the applicant from the initial stages of the proceedings, as his public defender, on the basis of a decision of 24\u00a0October 2000 by the AllUkrainian Committee for the Defence of Human Rights in the Vinnytsia Region. Moreover, he attempted to participate in the proceedings before the criminal courts as the applicant's public defender, as is clear from the case file, and, as a lawyer, he is entitled to represent the applicant in the proceedings before the Court.",

In this judgment the Court also found that decisions concerning complaints lodged with the prosecutor could be appealed to the domestic courts. Furthermore, the Government maintained that the applicant had a separate option of lodging civil complaints with regard to violations of his rights during his detention by the State Department on Enforcement of Sentences, with a view to receiving compensation for pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage. They referred to Articles 248-1, 248-3 and 248-7 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Articles 440-1, 442 and 455 of the Civil Code. The Government further noted that the availability of such remedies had been confirmed by a judgment of the Chervonogvardiysk District Court of Dnepropetrovsk of 1 November 2001, which had rejected the plaintiff's claims for compensation but analysed his complaints in depth.",

It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement (see Dankevich v. Ukraine, no. 40679/98, \u00a7 107, 29\u00a0April 2003). The Court further emphasises that Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 of the Convention must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. Moreover, the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically. In reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the State concerned, the general legal and political context in which they operate, as well as the particular circumstances of the case and whether the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected in order to exhaust available domestic remedies (see Merit v.
