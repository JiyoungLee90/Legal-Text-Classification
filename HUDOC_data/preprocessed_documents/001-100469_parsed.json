Observing the findings of the Federal Employment Court\u2019s judgment of 9 April 1997 (see Obst v. Germany, no. 425/03, \u00a7\u00a7 12-19, 23 September 2010), which had applied the principles set out by the Federal Constitutional Court in its leading decision of 4 June 1985 (see paragraph 35 below), it took the view that the applicant\u2019s conduct did not yet (noch nicht) justify his dismissal, under section 1(1) of the Protection from Dismissal Act (see paragraph 36 below). In the Tribunal\u2019s view, he had not been bound by heightened duties of loyalty (gesteigerte Loyalit\u00e4tsobliegenheiten) because he did not perform pastoral or catechistic duties, did not have a canonical mandate (missio canonica) and was not a member of the managerial staff (leitender Mitarbeiter) within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Basic Regulations. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the respondent had not proved that the applicant\u2019s duties as head musician of the deanery were equivalent to managerial office; accordingly, pursuant to Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Basic Regulations, the parish church should first have summoned him for a clarification interview (kl\u00e4rendes Gespr\u00e4ch) or issued him with a warning (Abmahnung) before having recourse to the most serious of the disciplinary measures available, his dismissal, especially on account of his length of service in the parish church (fourteen years) and the fact that he had practically no chance of finding work as an organist on the labour-market outside the Catholic Church. The Employment Tribunal observed that an employer could only be dispensed from the obligation to issue a warning in the first instance where the employee could not expect his or her conduct to be tolerated by the employer in view of the seriousness of the breach, or where he or she was not inclined to perform, or capable of performing, his or her professional duties.",

Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Basic Regulations expressly required consideration of the question whether a staff member opposed the precepts of the Catholic Church or, whilst recognising its precepts, had not succeeded in complying with them in practice. The Tribunal added that the parish church had failed to prove that the applicant had told the Dean he did not wish to put an end to his new relationship.",

The Tribunal pointed out that, whilst the applicant\u2019s duties in the Church did not fall under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Basic Regulations, his dismissal nevertheless remained possible under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a04, in view of the proximity between his work and the Church\u2019s proclamatory mission. However, after formally hearing evidence from the applicant as a party to the proceedings, the Appeal Tribunal reached the conclusion that the dismissal had been vitiated by a procedural omission, as the parish church had failed to prove that the Dean had first sought to induce the applicant to put an end to his extramarital relationship. In view of the fundamental significance of the case, the Tribunal granted leave to appeal on points of law before the Federal Employment Tribunal.",

It took the view that Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Basic Regulations, which required a clarification interview, applied not only to dismissals decided under paragraph 2 of that Article (dismissal as the ultimate measure for a serious breach) but also to those based on paragraph\u00a03 (exclusion from post as a matter of principle, and possibility of waiving dismissal on an exceptional basis). The difference between the two paragraphs being merely a question of degree, a clarification interview would be necessary in all cases. In the case before it, the Federal Tribunal took the view that considering the lack of clarity of the ecclesiastical provisions applicable to the applicant as to whether or not his functions entailed heightened duties of loyalty, it had not been clearly established that the applicant could have known with sufficient foreseeability that his dismissal would fall under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Basic Regulations. If the holding of a clarification interview had been mandatory in the applicant\u2019s case, the absence of such an interview was thus capable of rendering his dismissal wrongful (sozialwidrig). However, the Federal Employment Tribunal observed that the Employment Appeal Tribunal had been mistaken in finding that no interview had been conducted with the applicant. On that point it took the view that the Appeal Tribunal had wrongly omitted to hear evidence also from the Dean, as a party to the proceedings, in order to establish whether or not he had attempted to induce the applicant to put an end to his extramarital relationship and that, accordingly, the judgment appealed against was to be quashed. However, since the facts had not yet been sufficiently established, the Federal Employment Tribunal was not in a position to rule on the question whether the applicant\u2019s dismissal had been justified. As a result, it referred the case back to the Employment Appeal Tribunal.",

Church labour law was therefore applicable in conjunction with the ordinary domestic law. The enactment of the Basic Regulations, in particular Articles 4 and 5, reflected the principle of the Catholic Church\u2019s autonomy, as provided for in Article 137 \u00a7 3 of the Weimar Constitution (see paragraph 34 below). The application of domestic labour law could not call into question the specificity of ecclesiastical service, which was protected by the Constitution. The Catholic Church was therefore entitled to base its contracts of employment on the model of a Christian service community and, in particular, to require its Catholic employees to recognise and comply with the principles of Catholic religious and moral precepts, as provided for in Article 4 \u00a7 1 of the Basic Regulations. As the credibility of the Church might depend on its employees\u2019 conduct and respect for the ecclesiastical order, including in their day-to-day lives, Articles 4 and 5 of the Basic Regulations stipulated the applicable criteria on which to assess contractual duties of loyalty and the seriousness of any breach of such duties.",

However, in applying those precepts the employment tribunals\u2019 decisions could not run counter to the fundamental principles of law, which included the concepts of \u201cmorality\u201d and \u201cpublic order\u201d. According to the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court (see paragraph 35 below), it was for the employment tribunals to ensure that religious denominations did not impose excessive requirements of loyalty on their employees. The Federal Employment Tribunal found that the beliefs of the Catholic Church regarding fidelity in marriage were not at odds with the fundamental principles of law. Marriage enjoyed special protection under Article 6 of the Basic Law and adultery was regarded as a serious fault in a civil law context. The Tribunal observed that it had, moreover, already found in its judgment of 24 April 1997 that adultery constituted a serious fault in the view of the Catholic Church (see Obst, cited above, \u00a7 15).",

After hearing evidence from the Dean as a party to the proceedings, and with the applicant having acknowledged that he had, at his interview of 2\u00a0July 1997 with the Dean, described as permanent his new relationship with his lawyer, the Tribunal held that the parish church had dismissed him in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Basic Regulations. According to the Dean\u2019s statements at the hearing \u2013 which the Tribunal found more credible than those of the applicant \u2013 there had indeed been an interview between the two parties. In view of the applicant\u2019s inflexible position as regards his new relationship, the Dean and the parish church had rightly considered that a prior warning would be superfluous.",

In this connection it was necessary to take into account the fact that, even if the applicant was not among those members of staff that were bound by heightened duties of loyalty under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Basic Regulations, his activity was closely related to the Church\u2019s proclamatory mission. It was thus hardly conceivable vis-\u00e0-vis the general public that the applicant and the Dean could continue to perform the liturgy together.

This constitutional guarantee included the right for the Churches to choose the staff they needed for the fulfilment of their mission and, accordingly, to enter into employment contracts. When the Churches chose to exercise their freedom of contract, like everyone else, then ordinary domestic labour law became applicable. However, the applicability of labour law did not have the effect of removing employment relations from the domain of a Church\u2019s own affairs. The constitutional guarantee of autonomy (Selbstbestimmungsrecht) afforded to Churches affected the content of contracts of employment. A Church could thus, in the interest of its own credibility, base its contracts of employment on the model of a Christian service community, and, accordingly, require its employees to respect the general principles of its dogmatic and moral doctrines and the basic duties applicable to all its members. That did not mean, however, that the legal status of a Church\u2019s employee became \u201cclericalised\u201d.

It noted that, whilst the Directive permitted a difference in treatment only if the religion or belief constituted a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement, having regard to the organisation\u2019s ethos, section 9(1) of the General Equal Treatment Act also provided for different treatment when the religion or belief constituted an occupational requirement on the basis of its right of autonomy and the religious society\u2019s or association\u2019s own perception, without necessarily having regard to the nature of the activity. According to the European Commission, such a difference not being covered by the terms of the Directive, this manner of transposition did not fulfil the Directive\u2019s objectives. Such transposition would enable a religious society to define an occupational requirement purely on account of its right of autonomy, without the requirement undergoing a proportionality test in the light of the actual activity. In addition, whilst Article 4 \u00a7 2 of the Directive presented the question in terms of genuine and determining occupational requirements, section 9(1) of the General Equal Treatment Act had reduced that notion to one of justified occupational requirements, which was a weaker standard than that of the Directive. The European Commission further observed that, whilst an organisation\u2019s particular ethos played a role in determining the occupational requirement, it should not be the sole criterion, otherwise German legislation might not guarantee such a difference in treatment and, even as regards ordinary assistance activities, specific requirements related to religious affiliation might be imposed.",

This was consistent with an automatic judicial policy that existed in such matters for the benefit of the Churches, which, in his view, enjoyed a privileged status in German law that was not granted to any other charity-type association. His rights to respect for his private life or his private sphere had not been examined by the employment tribunals. In the applicant\u2019s submission, Article 8 of the Convention conferred on him the right to discontinue a particular way of life and to begin a new one. He argued that, whilst he did not call into question the right of the Churches to manage their affairs autonomously, that right could not go as far as forcing their employees to observe precepts outside the occupational sphere. He asserted that the employment tribunals had extended their case-law in a totally unforeseeable manner, as until then a dismissal had only been endorsed in the event of remarriage, and not on account of a private extramarital relationship. In view of the large number of ecclesiastical precepts, there was a lack of foreseeability in this connection and the decision to dismiss ultimately depended solely on the view of each human resources manager. The role of the employment tribunal was thus limited to upholding the wishes of the employing Church. According to the applicant, as a consequence of this tendency the employer and the employment tribunal were increasingly scrutinising the employee\u2019s private life in order to establish and assess the facts on which the dismissal was based. Moreover, the fact that a particular employee failed to comply with certain ecclesiastical precepts to the letter would not undermine the credibility of the Church, but would merely be a manifestation of the individual\u2019s human condition.",

Moreover, he asserted that at the time he signed the contract, in 1983, he had not been in a position to predict that one day he would leave his wife. In any case, as he was neither an ecclesiastical public servant nor a cleric, but a mere staff member within the liturgical service, having no pastoral mission, he was not bound by any heightened duties of loyalty. He did not deny the fact that music played a particular role in the liturgy, but in his view each worshipper performed the liturgy with singing and prayers to the same degree as the organist. He further observed that the Basic Regulations had not come into force until ten years after the signing of his contract of employment. Accordingly, those regulations were not part of his contract and thus could not constitute a legal basis for his dismissal.",

On the contrary, he would continue to be a Catholic and would not call into question the sacramental nature of marriage in the eyes of the Catholic Church. However, the unavoidable (schicksalhaft) separation from his wife for strictly personal reasons fell exclusively within his private sphere. He had not in fact remarried. It could not be demanded of him, as canon law did, that following his separation and divorce he would lead a life of abstinence until the end of his days. He would accept the internal consequences of his choice within the Church (he would no longer be able to take communion), but his dismissal was an excessively harsh consequence. The applicant lastly argued that the margin of appreciation relied upon by the Government did not exist because the general public in Germany was becoming less and less sensitive to cases of remarriage, and that European Directive 2000/78/EC dealt only with the question of appointment and not that of dismissal after many long years of service. Referring to his training as a Catholic musician, he also argued that it was difficult for him to find employment outside the Catholic Church. As regards his current employment in a Protestant Church, he indicated that he could now only work part time because he was a Catholic.",

In their submission, the employment tribunals, in applying the statutory provisions on dismissal, had been bound to take account of the principles laid down by the Catholic Church, because it was for the Churches and religious communities themselves, through their right of autonomy, to define the duties of loyalty that their employees had to observe in order to safeguard the credibility of those Churches and communities. The Government observed that, nevertheless, the consideration given to ecclesiastical precepts was not unlimited and a domestic court could not apply a precept that ran counter to the general principles of law. In other words, in their view, whilst employing Churches could impose duties of loyalty on their employees, it was not for those employers to determine the grounds for dismissal, as that depended on the interpretation by the courts of the statutory provisions concerning protection from dismissal.",

The Government added that, whilst dismissal indeed constituted the harshest penalty (ultima ratio) in German labour law, a more lenient measure, such as a warning, had not been appropriate in the present case as, in their opinion, the applicant could not have been unaware that his employer would not tolerate his conduct. They emphasised that the applicant, in signing his contract of employment of his own accord, had freely agreed to the limitation of his rights, as was apparently possible under the Convention (according to Rommelfanger, decision cited above), and had thus accepted the risk of professional sanctions resulting from certain conduct. The Government were convinced that, in view of his length of service, the applicant had been aware of the fundamental importance for the Catholic Church of the sanctity of marriage and of the potential consequences of his adultery. The fact that the duties might have repercussions for his private life was a feature of contracts between employing Churches and their staff. The Government lastly asserted that the applicability of the Basic Regulations, which did not in fact lay down particularly extensive duties of loyalty, had not been discussed before the domestic courts and could not therefore be called into question before the Court. Although it was true that the Regulations had not come into force until September 1993, Articles 2\u00a0and 6 of the Regulations on Ecclesiastical Employment and Remuneration of 15 December 1971 (see paragraph 37 above), whose applicability to the employment contract was not in doubt for the Government, had already referred to the fundamental principles of the religious and moral precepts of the Catholic Church, and had subsequently also referred to the 1993 Basic Regulations. Moreover, the applicant had apparently found new employment, this time in a Protestant Church in Essen.",

In the Diocese\u2019s opinion, the employing Churches would then find themselves unable to require their employees to comply with particular occupational duties corresponding to their specific missions. The Diocese pointed out that the applicant\u2019s separation from his wife and his relationship with another woman were not consonant with the sanctity of marriage in the eyes of the Catholic Church. More than a mere contract, marriage was a sacrament, resulting in an indissoluble bond and a life-long community. The Diocese also emphasised the special function of music in the Catholic liturgy, far from simply being an aesthetical background. The choice of person responsible for the music, in view of its proximity to the Church\u2019s proclamatory mission, should thus be a matter for the Church alone, to be decided according to its own criteria, including moral requirements, and this was moreover a manifestation of religious freedom. The Diocese added that, with the adoption of its Basic Regulations, the Catholic Church had introduced a graded system.

As the case concerned a dismissal following a decision by the applicant concerning his private and family life, which attracts the protection of the Convention, the Court considers that a more detailed examination was required when weighing the competing rights and interests at stake (see Obst, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 48-51), particularly as in this case the applicant\u2019s individual right was weighed against a collective right. Whilst it is true that, under the Convention, an employer whose ethos is based on religion or on a philosophical belief may impose specific duties of loyalty on its employees, a decision to dismiss based on a breach of such duty cannot be subjected, on the basis of the employer\u2019s right of autonomy, only to a limited judicial scrutiny exercised by the relevant domestic employment tribunal without having regard to the nature of the post in question and without properly balancing the interests involved in accordance with the principle of proportionality.",

The Court considers, however, that the applicant\u2019s signature on the contract cannot be interpreted as a personal unequivocal undertaking to live a life of abstinence in the event of separation or divorce. An interpretation of that kind would affect the very heart of the right to respect for the private life of the person concerned, particularly since, as the employment tribunals found, the applicant was not bound by heightened duties of loyalty (contrast Obst, cited above, \u00a7 50). In this connection the applicant submitted that he had been unable to avoid his separation from his wife, for strictly personal reasons, and that he was unable to live a life of abstinence for the rest of his days as required by the Catholic Church\u2019s Code of Canon Law.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, the fact that an employee who has been dismissed by a Church has limited opportunities of finding another job is of particular importance. This is especially true where the employer has a predominant position in a given sector of activity and enjoys certain derogations from the ordinary law, as is the case of the two big Churches in certain regions of Germany, notably in the field of social activities (for example, kindergartens and hospitals \u2013 see paragraphs 30-32 above), or where the dismissed employee has specific qualifications that make it difficult, or even impossible, to find a new job outside the Church, as is the case for the applicant. In this connection the Court notes that the Protestant Church\u2019s rules concerning church musicians (see paragraph 39 above) stipulate that the Church may employ non-Protestants only in exceptional cases and solely in the context of secondary employment. The applicant\u2019s case moreover confirms this. The Court reiterates that, as a result of the wage-tax card that an employee must present and which contains certain personal data (see paragraph 33 above), an employer is automatically informed, to some extent, of the employee\u2019s personal and family situation.",
