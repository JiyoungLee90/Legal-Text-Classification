They all expressed the view that if given the opportunity by the creditor to examine such a request, the courts would be entitled to apply Articles 712 and 720 \u00a7 7 of the RCCP, as well as Articles\u00a045 and 56 of Law no. 188/2000 (see paragraphs 39 and 46 above).

In that judgment, the Court concluded that a complaint concerning enforcement was not an effective remedy, in so far as the Government had not provided examples from domestic practice in respect of complaints about belated acts of enforcement by the bailiff being declared admissible. The only relevant examples provided showed that the domestic courts considered such complaints ill-founded or even incompatible ratione materiae (see \u00a7\u00a7 40-44 and 60 of the judgment).",
