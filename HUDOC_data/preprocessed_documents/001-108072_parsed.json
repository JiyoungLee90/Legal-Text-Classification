The judge at the hearing decided that S.T.\u2019s statement should be read to the jury at trial. He observed that the first applicant was very likely to feel that he had no realistic alternative other than to give evidence in order to defend himself on the second count relating to V.U. Therefore, the reading of S.T.\u2019s statement would not have the effect of making it very difficult for the applicant not to give evidence.

The judge found that the first applicant could give evidence as to what had happened during the consultation. It was also the intention of the prosecution to call S.T.\u2019s friends to give evidence as to what she had said to them. There were inconsistencies between their statements and S.T.\u2019s, which provided a route by which S.T.\u2019s statement could be challenged.

She was the only witness whose evidence went directly to the commission of an indecent assault on her by the appellant. If her statement had been excluded, the prosecution would have had to abandon the first count. The [applicant] was able to attack the accuracy of [S.T.\u2019s] statement by exploring the inconsistencies between it and the witnesses, [B.F.] and [S.H.], and through the expert evidence relating to \u2018altered perception\u2019 under hypnosis. The relevant sections of the 1988 Act [see paragraph 41 below] contained provisions designed to protect defendants, which were properly considered by the judge, before the statement was admitted in evidence. Lastly, the tribunal of fact, here the jury, could and should take proper account of the difficulties which the admission of a statement might provide for the [applicant], which should be provided by an appropriate direction to the jury.",

That was the case here. That public interest must not be allowed to override the requirement that the defendant have a fair trial. Like the court in Sellick [see paragraph 48 below] we do not consider that the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights requires the conclusion that in such circumstances the trial will be unfair. The provision in Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) that a person charged shall be able to [have] the witnesses against him examined is one specific aspect of a fair trial: but if the opportunity is not provided, the question is \u2018whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way the evidence was taken, were fair\u2019 \u2013 Doorson, paragraph 19 [see paragraph 58 below]. This was not a case where the witness had absented himself, whether through fear or otherwise, or had required anonymity, or had exercised a right to keep silent. The reason was death, which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own, as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph.\u201d",

The court upheld the reasoning of the trial judge, stating that there was available not only cross-examination of other prosecution witnesses but also evidence from the second applicant himself and the potential for evidence from other bystanders in order to prevent unfairness. It was also stated that the trial judge had explicitly warned the jury in detail as to how they should treat this evidence and properly directed them as to how they should consider it in reaching their verdict. Although the second applicant maintained that even a proper direction by the judge could not cure the unfairness, the Court of Appeal held that the jury was informed of all matters necessary to its decision-making process. Leave to appeal on conviction was refused on 24 January 2006. The Court of Appeal did, however, give the second applicant leave to appeal against his sentence and reduced the sentence of nine years\u2019 imprisonment to seven years\u2019 imprisonment.",

Horncastle and others, summarised at paragraphs 57 to 62 below). As a general rule it is inadmissible in a criminal case unless there is a common-law rule or statutory provision which allows for its admission. The relevant statutory provisions applicable to each applicant are set in the following section. Those statutory provisions are supplemented by three common-law principles. Firstly, there is an additional discretion at common law for a trial judge to exclude any evidence if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. This, in turn, is supplemented by section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which provides the court with a discretion to exclude evidence if its admission would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the trial that it ought not to be admitted. Secondly, if hearsay evidence is admitted and the jury have heard it, the trial judge, in his summing up, must direct the jury as to the dangers of relying on hearsay evidence. Thirdly, in a jury trial, the jury must receive the traditional direction as to the burden of proof, namely that they must be satisfied of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.",

In addition to recommending clarification of the conditions under which a witness statement could be admitted at trial (including the existing grounds of death and fear), the Commission proposed that there should be a limited discretion to admit hearsay evidence that did not fall within any other statutory or common-law exception (recommendation 28).",

The Commission considered that this risk was sufficiently serious to warrant requiring the trial court to stop the case where hearsay is the only evidence of an element of the offence (paragraph 9.5 of the consultation paper). After criticisms of this proposal (principally that it was unduly cautious and was beset with practical difficulties), in its 1997 report the Commission decided not to maintain its proposal (see paragraphs 5.33-5.41 of the report). It concluded instead that the adequate protection would be provided by the safeguards it proposed, in particular its recommendation 47, which proposed giving the trial judge the power to stop a case if hearsay evidence was unconvincing (see paragraph 45 below).",

There could be a very real disadvantage in admitting hearsay evidence and it needed cautious handling. However, having regard to the safeguards contained in the 2003 Act, which were rigorously applied, there would be no violation of Article 6 if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive degree on hearsay evidence. Where the hearsay evidence was demonstrably reliable, or its reliability could properly be tested and assessed, the rights of the defence would be respected, there would be sufficient counterbalancing measures and the trial would be fair. It was not appropriate that there should be a rule that counterbalancing measures could never be sufficient where the evidence was sole or decisive.

Firstly, as a principled difficulty, the test assumed that all hearsay evidence was unreliable in the absence of testing in open court, and secondly, it further assumed that the fact-finder (such as the jury) could not be trusted to assess the weight of the evidence. Neither assumption was justified. For the first, the Court of Appeal gave examples of hearsay evidence that would be reliable such as a victim who, before dying, revealed the name of his or her murderer. For the second, the Court of Appeal found that juries were perfectly able to understand the limitations of written statements and, under section 124 of the 2003 Act, would be provided with material about the maker of the statement (see paragraph 45 above). The mere fact that the evidence was an essential link in the chain of evidence against the accused did not alter that conclusion. For example, forensic evidence might depend on work done by unidentified laboratory assistants (and to that extent was hearsay). However, it was not necessary for every member of the laboratory who had worked with the evidence to be called in order for the strength of the evidence to be tested.",

Any test of admissibility must be one which can be applied in advance of the giving of the evidence, let alone of the outcome of the trial. A routine test of admissibility of evidence which can only be applied in retrospect, after the outcome of the trial is known, makes the trial process little more than speculative. Judge, jury, witnesses and parties may find themselves engaged in shadow-boxing without knowing whether the solemn result of the trial will stand to be reversed on the grounds that, as things have turned out, the test of admissibility was not met. Nor can any defendant decide how to conduct his case, and indeed whether or not to plead guilty, if he does not know what evidence can and cannot be relied upon.",

Conversely, what appears at the outset to be hearsay evidence standing alone may sometimes come to be supported by other material as the evidence develops. A witness may add something of great significance not previously mentioned, or the significance of something always said may become apparent when apparently unconnected other evidence is given. In any case where there is more than one accused jointly charged, it is common experience that the evidence of one may well shed enormous light upon the guilt or innocence of another.

But no person who is becoming not simply a source of information but a witness should be told that his evidence will be read, or indeed given any indication whatsoever that this is likely. The most that he can be told is that witnesses are expected to be seen at court, that any departure from that principle is exceptional, and that the decision whether to depart from it is one for the judge and not for the police. In the case before us of Marquis and Graham [two of the appellants], as we set out at paragraphs 127 and 132, the judge found that the investigating police officer had significantly contributed to the fear of the witness by referring repeatedly to a notorious local example of witnesses being hunted down, although relocated, and killed. Although notorious, that incident was an extreme and very unusual case. The need for police officers to tender careful advice to potential witnesses in order to discharge their duty of care towards them should not lead to such frightening information being laboured out of defensiveness. Whilst the [2003 Act] requires fear to be construed broadly, it is not to be expected that fear based upon inappropriate assurances by police officers will result in the evidence being read and the case proceeding on the basis of it to the jury. If the evidence can really only be assessed by the jury by seeing the witness, as will often be the case, it may not be admitted. If it is admitted and central to the case, there is a significant possibility that at the end of the trial the judge may have to rule under [section] 125 that a conviction relying upon it would be unsafe.\u201d",

The sole or decisive rule had been introduced into the Strasbourg case-law in Doorson (cited above) without discussion of the underlying principle or full consideration of whether there was justification for imposing the rule as an overriding principle applicable equally to continental and common-law jurisdictions.

Secondly, it would be hard enough to apply that test at first instance but it would be impossible for national appellate courts or this Court to decide whether a particular statement was the sole or decisive basis for a conviction.

There will, however, be some cases where the evidence in question is demonstrably reliable. The Court of Appeal has given a number of examples. I will just give one, which is a variant of one of theirs. A visitor to  witnesses a hit and run road accident in which a cyclist is killed. He memorises the number of the car, and makes a statement to the police in which he includes not merely the number, but the make and colour of the car and the fact that the driver was a man with a beard. He then returns to his own country, where he is himself killed in a road accident. The police find that the car with the registration number that he provided is the make and colour that he reported and that it is owned by a man with a beard. The owner declines to answer questions as to his whereabouts at the time of the accident. It seems hard to justify a rule that would preclude the conviction of the owner of the car on the basis of the statement of the deceased witness, yet that is the effect of the sole or decisive test.\u201d",

In a previous ruling given before trial (2000 SLT 508), the High Court of Justiciary, sitting as an appeal court, had found that it was only in extreme circumstances that an accused could contend in advance of trial that the introduction of the hearsay evidence would be so prejudicial to the prospects of a fair trial that the court could determine the issue in advance. It therefore allowed the trial to proceed. When the statements were introduced at trial and the accused was convicted, he appealed against his conviction. In its judgment dismissing the appeal (2003 SLT 508), the High Court of Justiciary found that, while the statements were important evidence, having regard to the other evidence led at trial (which included admissions by the accused and forensic evidence), it could not be said that the appellant\u2019s conviction was based to a decisive extent on them. The jury had also been adequately and satisfactorily directed as to how to approach the absent witness\u2019s statement. A similar conclusion was reached by the same court in HM Advocate v.

The case concerned a complaint of assault made by an elderly resident at a retirement home against one of the home\u2019s employees. The patient, S., gave the police a videotaped statement; the statement was unsworn. After S.\u2019s statement other residents came forward to give statements that they too had been assaulted by the accused. By the time of trial, all those who had made statements, including S, had either died or were no longer competent to testify. Some of the statements were admitted by the trial judge because of the striking similarity between them. The Court of Appeal for  excluded all the statements and acquitted the accused. The Supreme Court dismissed the Crown\u2019s appeal from that decision and affirmed the acquittal. The Supreme Court clarified its previous case-law on reliability and stated that the reliability requirement would generally be met by showing: (i) that there was no real concern about whether the statement was true or not because of the circumstances in which it came about; or (ii) that no real concern arose because the truth and accuracy of the statement could nonetheless be sufficiently tested by means other than cross-examination. It was for the trial judge to make a preliminary assessment of the \u201cthreshold\u201d reliability of the statement and to leave the ultimate determination of its worth to the fact-finder/jury.

The absence of any opportunity to cross-examine him had a bearing on the question of reliability and there were no adequate substitutes for testing the evidence. The principled exceptions to the hearsay rule did not provide a vehicle for founding a conviction on the basis of a police statement, videotaped or otherwise, without more (paragraph 106 of the judgment). Nor could the reliability requirement be met by relying on the inherent trustworthiness of the statement; this was not a case such as Khan where the cogency of the evidence was such that it would be pedantic to insist upon testing by cross-examination. S. was elderly and frail; his mental capacity was at issue and there was medical evidence that his injuries could have arisen from a fall. It was also not clear that he had understood the consequences of his statement for the accused.

In reaching that decision, the court should have regard, inter alia, to the importance of such evidence to the case against the accused. The Commission also found that these recommendations meant that its model of reform would comply with the Chamber judgment in the present cases.",

It also endorsed previous authority that a court should \u201chesitate long\u201d in admitting or relying on hearsay evidence which plays a decisive or even significant part in convicting an accused, unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. Despite the reforms enacted by section 3(1), the Supreme Court found that reliability was a factor that should continue to be considered in determining the admissibility of hearsay. Moreover, in that case, in assessing what prejudice would arise to the accused if the hearsay were admitted, the trial judge had erred in relying upon the fact that the accused had other avenues open to him to counter the evidence, one of which was to give evidence himself; the logical conclusion of this approach was that the State, by introducing \u201cflimsy\u201d hearsay could force the accused to testify in a case where the absence of direct evidence was such that he would be entitled not to testify.",

Roberts 448 US 56 (1980) the Supreme Court of the United States of America held that evidence with \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d was admissible without confrontation. That was overruled in Crawford v.\u00a0Washington 541 US 36 (2004), where the court ruled that the confrontation clause applied to all evidence which was testimonial in nature and there was no basis in the Sixth Amendment for admitting evidence only on the basis of its reliability. Where testimonial statements were at issue, the only indicium of reliability which was sufficient was the one prescribed by the Constitution: confrontation. Consequently, testimonial evidence was thus inadmissible unless the witness appeared at trial or, if the witness was unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination (see also Melendez-Diaz v.

It is correct that even without S.T.\u2019s statement, the applicant may have had to give evidence as part of his defence to the other count, count two. But had S.T.\u2019s statement not been admitted, it is likely that the applicant would only have been tried on count two and would only have had to give evidence in respect of that count. In respect of the inconsistencies between the statement of S.T. and her account as given to two witnesses, the Court finds these were minor in nature. Only one such inconsistency was ever relied on by the defence, namely the fact that at one point during the alleged assault, S.T. had claimed in her statement that the applicant had touched her face and mouth while in the account given to one of the witnesses she had said that she had touched her own face at the instigation of the applicant. While it was certainly open to the defence to attempt to challenge the credibility of S.T., it is difficult to see on what basis they could have done so, particularly as her account corresponded in large part with that of the other complainant, with whom the trial judge found that there was no evidence of collusion. The absence of collusion may be a factor in domestic law in favour of admissibility but in the present case it cannot be regarded as a counterbalancing factor for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 read with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d). The absence of collusion does not alter the Court\u2019s conclusion that the content of the statement, once admitted, was evidence on count one that the applicant could not effectively challenge. As to the judge\u2019s warning to the jury, this was found by the Court of Appeal to be deficient. Even if it were not so, the Court is not persuaded that any more appropriate direction could effectively counterbalance the effect of an untested statement which was the only evidence against the applicant.\u201d",

It is appropriate for domestic courts, when faced with the problem of absent or anonymous witnesses, to consider whether alternative measures could be employed which would be less restrictive of the rights of the defence than admitting witness statements as evidence. However, the fact that alternative measures are found to be inappropriate does not absolve domestic courts of their responsibility to ensure that there is no breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) when they then allow witness statements to be read. Indeed, the rejection of less restrictive measures implies a greater duty to ensure respect for the rights of the defence. As regards the ability of the applicant to contradict the statement by calling other witnesses, the very problem was that there was no witness, with the exception of T., who was apparently able or willing to say what he had seen. In these circumstances, the Court does not find that T.\u2019s statement could have been effectively rebutted. The Court accepts that the applicant gave evidence himself denying the charge, though the decision to do so must have been affected by the admission of T.\u2019s statement. The right of an accused to give evidence in his defence cannot be said to counterbalance the loss of opportunity to see and have examined and cross-examined the only prosecution eyewitness against him.",

In that case, it was satisfied that adequate steps had been taken because of the express declaration by the Court of Appeal that it had treated the relevant statements \u2018with the necessary caution and circumspection\u2019. However, in the case of an absent witness such as T., the Court does not find that such a warning, including a reminder that it was not the applicant who was responsible for the absence, however clearly expressed, would be a sufficient counterbalance where that witness\u2019s untested statement was the only direct evidence against the applicant.\u201d",

It had, in turn, shaped the fair-trial guarantees enshrined in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the criminal procedure of all common-law countries and international human rights law. Although the hearsay rule had become too rigid in English law, it was incorrect to state, as the Supreme Court had in Horncastle and others, that the Law Commission\u2019s proposed reforms had been \u201clargely implemented\u201d in the 2003 Act. For example, the 2003 Act had included in section 114 a more general discretion to admit hearsay when it was \u201cin the interests of justice\u201d than the Law Commission had envisaged (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). Moreover, even if the hearsay rule was in need of reform the common-law right of confrontation was not: the right enshrined the principle that a person could not offer testimony against a criminal defendant unless it was given under oath, face-to-face with the defendant and subject to cross-examination.",

The Supreme Court had placed too much faith in the possibility of counterbalancing measures as a means of overcoming the manifest unfairness of convicting a person wholly or largely on the basis of unchallenged testimony. The essence of the common-law right of confrontation lay in the insight that cross-examination was the most effective way of establishing the reliability of a witness\u2019s evidence. It was instructive to remember the warning of Megarry J (in John v. Rees [1970] Ch 345) that \u201cthe path of the law [was] strewn about with examples of open and shut cases which, somehow, were not; of unanswerable charges which, in the event, were completely answered\u201d. In addition, JUSTICE submitted that it was, as Sedley LJ had observed in Secretary of State for the Home Department v. AF and others [2008] EWCA Civ 1148, \u201cseductively easy to conclude that there can be no answer to a case of which you have only heard one side\u201d. It was for this reason that the paradox referred to by Lord Phillips was not a paradox at all. Hearsay did not become more cogent simply because it might be the sole or substantive evidence of a person\u2019s guilt. The need for the exclusion of apparently \u201cdecisive\u201d hearsay evidence was justified by the centuries-old fear of common-law judges that juries might give it undue weight.",

The underlying principle is that the defendant in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. This principle requires not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of their evidence, by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings.",

As was pointed out by the Supreme Court, in the earlier case-law of the Court, where the rule had been adumbrated in cases of absent or anonymous witnesses, the violation found of Article 6 \u00a7 3\u00a0(d) had been based at least in part on the fact that there was no justification for not calling or identifying the witness in question.

However, the Court notes that the present cases have arisen precisely because the legal system in England and Wales has abandoned the strict common-law rule against hearsay evidence. Exceptions to the rule have been created, notably in the 1988 and 2003 Acts, which allowed for the admission of S.T.\u2019s statement in the Al-Khawaja case and T.\u2019s statement in the Tahery case (see paragraphs 41 and 44 above). The Court recognises that these dilutions of the strict rule against hearsay have been accompanied by statutory safeguards and, accordingly, the central question in the present cases is whether the application of these safeguards was sufficient to secure the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d). Against this background, while it is important for the Court to have regard to substantial differences in legal systems and procedures, including different approaches to the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials, ultimately it must apply the same standard of review under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d), irrespective of the legal system from which a case emanates.",

It further means more than that, without the evidence, the chances of a conviction would recede and the chances of an acquittal advance, a test which, as the Court of Appeal in Horncastle and others pointed out (see paragraph 54 above), would mean that virtually all evidence would qualify. Instead, the word \u201cdecisive\u201d should be narrowly understood as indicating evidence of such significance or importance as is likely to be determinative of the outcome of the case. Where the untested evidence of a witness is supported by other corroborative evidence, the assessment of whether it is decisive will depend on the strength of the supportive evidence; the stronger the corroborative evidence, the less likely that the evidence of the absent witness will be treated as decisive.",

The House of Lords concluded in the  case that not only had the evidence of the anonymous witness been the sole or decisive basis on which the defendant could have been convicted but that effective cross-examination had been hampered. The decision in the Davis case led to the introduction into the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 of the very requirement that, in deciding whether to make a witness anonymity order, a judge must have regard, inter alia, to whether evidence given by the witness might be the sole or decisive evidence implicating the defendant (see paragraph 46 above).",

For the first, the Court finds no reason to depart from its finding in Kostovski that inculpatory evidence against an accused may well be \u201cdesignedly untruthful or simply erroneous\u201d. Moreover, unsworn statements by witnesses who cannot be examined often appear on their face to be cogent and compelling and it is, as Lord Justice Sedley pointed out, \u201cseductively easy\u201d to conclude that there can be no answer to the case against the defendant (see paragraph 115 above). Experience shows that the reliability of evidence, including evidence which appears cogent and convincing, may look very different when subjected to a searching examination. The dangers inherent in allowing untested hearsay evidence to be adduced are all the greater if that evidence is the sole or decisive evidence against the defendant. As to the second reason, the defendant must not be placed in the position where he is effectively deprived of a real chance of defending himself by being unable to challenge the case against him. Trial proceedings must ensure that a defendant\u2019s Article 6 rights are not unacceptably restricted and that he or she remains able to participate effectively in the proceedings (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, \u00a7 83, 16 December 1999, and Stanford v. the United Kingdom, 23 February 1994, \u00a7 26, Series A no.\u00a0282A). The Court\u2019s assessment of whether a criminal trial has been fair cannot depend solely on whether the evidence against the accused appears prima facie to be reliable, if there are no means of challenging that evidence once it is admitted.",

Even though the testimony may have been coherent and convincing on its face it cannot be said to belong to the category of evidence that can be described as \u201cdemonstrably reliable\u201d such as a dying declaration or other examples given by the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in their Horncastle and others judgments (see paragraphs 53 and 60 above).",

While, as is apparent from the judgment, the Court has not been able to accept all the criticisms of the test, it has addressed what appears to be one of the central problems identified by the Supreme Court, namely the inflexible application of the test or rule, as reflected in the Chamber\u2019s Luc\u00e0 v. Italy judgment (no. 33354/96, ECHR 2001II), whereby a conviction based solely or to a decisive degree on the statement of an absent witness is considered incompatible with the requirements of fairness in Article 6, notwithstanding any counterbalancing procedural safeguards within the national system. I share the view of the majority that to apply the rule inflexibly, ignoring the specificities of the particular legal system concerned, would run counter to the traditional way in which the Court has, in other contexts, approached the issue of the overall fairness of criminal proceedings. While, as the Court has now held, in assessing the fairness of the proceedings, the fact that a conviction is based solely or to a decisive extent on the statement of an absent witness is a very important factor to weigh in the scales and one which requires strong counterbalancing factors, including the existence of effective procedural safeguards, it should not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

The question is whether the latter rule is to be considered as an absolute rule whose breach automatically leads to a finding that the proceedings have not been fair, in violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 119 of the judgment). But there is a much more important issue at stake, namely the relationship between the fundamental human rights of the accused and society\u2019s legitimate interest in imposing punishment \u2013 after a fair trial. (Fairness also implies that the innocent shall not be punished.)

The impetus behind Article 6 is the premise that the interests of justice will not properly safeguard the accused against the dangers of an unfair trial and improper conviction. Because prosecutorial power is subject to abuse as well as to the bureaucratic pressure to single out and punish a perpetrator, the defence should not be unduly impeded in countering the State\u2019s allegations. It is sometimes said that the defendant\u2019s rights must be \u201cbalanced\u201d against the public interest in administering justice, and in particular against the Convention rights of victims and witnesses. But the protection of the defence\u2019s rights, including the right to examine adverse witnesses, is already embedded as fundamental to a fair trial in the administration of justice, prior to such considerations. When the Convention singled out paragraph 3 rights this meant that these basic rights of the defence were necessary to counterbalance the dominant power of the prosecution, in the interests of fairness. To balance these rights a second time against the interests of the administration of justice, as the Government have sought to do in Al-Khawaja and Tahery, is to give the prosecution and the interests of administering justice (namely, to punish) a clear advantage. This Court has never held that \u201cArticle [6 \u00a7 3 (d)] is simply an illustration of matters to be taken into account in considering whether a fair trial has been held\u201d as Waller LJ claimed, reviewing Strasbourg case-law in R. v.

Firstly, those rights are premised on the principles of equality of arms and adversarial proceedings, both of which require that the defence should not be disadvantaged relative to the prosecution and that a criminal defendant should be able to test the evidence underlying his conviction. Secondly, although some derogation is permitted with respect to these rights, it must be justified and sufficiently counterbalanced by procedural safeguards. Thirdly, the extent of disadvantage to the defence is a factor in determining whether the trial as a whole has been fair. Finally, where statements by witnesses whom the defence has had no chance to examine before or at trial underpin the conviction in a decisive manner, the disadvantage is of such a degree as to constitute in itself a violation of Article 6 which no procedural safeguards can effectively counterbalance. It is the fourth proposition that has come to be known as the sole or decisive rule. But, as we suggest below, it is perhaps more sensible to understand the second, third, and fourth propositions together, as carving out a narrow exception to the prohibition of hearsay. Once again, it is up to States to determine what kind of evidence is admissible, and the Court has never imposed a blanket prohibition in that regard. But it is obvious in the light of its case-law that hearsay remains a problematic source of evidence which requires special caution because of the general inability to test the reliability of hearsay statements. As the Court has put it, \u201c[t]he dangers inherent in such a situation are obvious\u201d (see Kostovski v. the , 20 November 1989, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 166).

To determine the fairness of a trial, the Court must nevertheless assess, inter alia, the manner in which evidence for the defence and prosecution was given. In principle, Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) demands that witness statements be made at a public hearing in the presence of the accused with a view to adversarial argument. In the absence of confrontation at trial, examination at the pre-trial stage may suffice (ibid.). Concerns around Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) will be triggered above all in cases like Al-Khawaja and Tahery, where the defence was afforded no opportunity to examine key witnesses in either the pre-trial or trial proceedings. The point of departure is thus that the defence shall be given a chance to contest the witness\u2019s statement in court and, unless compelling reasons dictate otherwise, in the very court judging the case.

Even experienced trial judges may erroneously give undue weight to evidence by witnesses whom the defence has not cross-examined. A fortiori, these factors are more significant in a jury system, in so far as a professional judge is better positioned than a layperson to evaluate information obtained by or in the presence of another judge conducting a prior hearing. Asking members of a jury to weigh evidence in the light of its being untested demands far more in the way of judicial competence than asking judges to rule on admissibility in the light of the potential value of the evidence to the prosecution\u2019s case. To conform with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d), special care may therefore be necessary to ensure that untested evidence does not go before the jury if that evidence is likely by itself to decide the case. In this regard this Court has to ask: (a) is the care applied in the English and Welsh legal system in the light of the present cases sufficient; or (b) are the risks associated with an otherwise carefully counterbalanced admission of hearsay as sole or decisive evidence such that they put the defence rights and hence the fairness of the trial in jeopardy to an extent that undermines effective human rights protection?",

The adoption of the counterbalancing approach means that a rule that was intended to safeguard human rights is replaced with the uncertainties of counterbalancing. To our knowledge this is the first time ever that this Court, in the absence of a specific new and compelling reason, has diminished the level of protection. This is a matter of gravest concern for the future of the judicial protection of human rights in Europe.",
