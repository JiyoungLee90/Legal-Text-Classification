Referring to the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraph 46 below), the Court of Appeal found that a potential violation of the constitutional right to liberty did not automatically warrant the applicant\u2019s release from preventive detention. The interruption of the applicant\u2019s preventive detention could only be ordered in proceedings under Article 458 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

It recommended not suspending the further execution of the applicant\u2019s preventive detention and not granting probation. As the applicant had not reflected on his offences and had not made any therapy, there was nothing to indicate that he was no longer dangerous to the public. It submitted that necessary therapeutic measures had not been carried out because the applicant did not trust the prison staff and had explained to be ready for treatment only with a therapist in whom he could trust fully. In 2002 the applicant had not been transferred to a social therapeutic institution because it appeared that the applicant, who had to be and could be treated, lacked sufficient motivation to undergo treatment. In 2006 the applicant had started monthly conversations with the psychological counselling service in prison. However, in view of the duty to treat information given by the applicant confidentially, it was unknown whether there had been any resulting positive developments. As the last report by expert K. had been drawn up in 1997 and the applicant had become older since then, the prison authority considered it useful to obtain a fresh expert report in order to examine whether there had been any changes in the applicant\u2019s personality, even though such changes had not been observed in prison.",

Despite this, the domestic authorities took the deadline laid down in Article 67e of the Criminal Code seriously: the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office made doubles of the file and the Berlin Regional Court set a date for a hearing of the applicant\u2019s case speedily. In view of that, the applicant\u2019s detention remained lawful under domestic law, as interpreted by the Federal Constitutional Court, despite the fact that the time-limit in Article 67e of the Criminal Code had been exceeded by a couple of days.",

The applicant was convicted of several very serious sexual offences. The psychiatric expert, K., who had examined the applicant in the 1997 criminal proceedings, had diagnosed the applicant in his report dated 29 May 1997 with a dissocial and narcissistic personality disorder and a sexual deviation which necessitated psychotherapeutic treatment. Moreover, it is uncontested that the applicant did not undergo the therapy considered necessary by the expert and the domestic courts as he had only started monthly conversations with the psychological counselling service in prison, but no adequate therapy. It was further clear from the documents before the courts and the applicant\u2019s written and oral submissions that the applicant confessed to his offences already in the criminal proceedings, but did not appear to reflect on these offences or on deficits in his personality.",

It was clear, however, that he globally did not trust in the staff of Berlin Tegel Prison, in which he had been detained throughout his preventive detention. He had only taken up regular conversations with the psychological counselling service in that prison, which was under an obligation to keep information given by him confidential.

In such circumstances, a sufficient establishment of the relevant facts concerning a person\u2019s current dangerousness, which resulted from personality disorders and a sexual deviation and thus from a condition the persistence of which is difficult to evaluate by persons without medical expertise, will, as a rule, necessitate obtaining recent expert advice (see for the \u2013 similar \u2013 standards set up by the Federal Constitutional Court in cases concerning a person\u2019s detention in a psychiatric hospital paragraph 48 above). Moreover, the Court notes that further elements relevant to the development of the applicant\u2019s personality in prison, and thus of his dangerousness, remained unclear.

In such a situation it is particularly important to consult an external expert also in order to obtain fresh propositions for initiating the necessary therapeutic treatment.

In such circumstances, a detention which complied with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with that provision (see Osterm\u00fcnchner v.
