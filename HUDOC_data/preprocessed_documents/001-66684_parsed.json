It further notes that in January 2003 the applicants applied for and were issued a writ of execution and that on 21 April 2003 they entered into an agreement with Softaxi in which they specified the manner of execution of the judgment debt (see paragraphs 54 and 55 above). The applicants suggested that the time between the judgment\u2019s entry into force and 21 April 2003 should be included in the period under consideration.

Portugal (judgment of 23 March 1994, Series A no. 286-A, p. 13, \u00a7 30), in its judgment of 17 October 2002 the Sofia Court of Appeals ruled on the applicants\u2019 entitlement to compensation and determined as well the amount of compensation due, thereby bringing the domestic proceedings to an end (see Pailot v. France, judgment of 22 April 1998, Reports 1998II, p.\u00a0802, \u00a7 59). It is true that subsequently the applicants were issued a writ of execution and entered into an agreement with Softaxi, but no enforcement proceedings, whose length could be taken into account for the purposes of the present case, were brought.

Therefore, the applicants needed only to produce evidence of the pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage they had suffered and of the causal link between that damage and the accident.

The fact that they had chosen to file a separate tort action instead of lodging a civil claim within the framework of the 1988 criminal proceedings had not been unreasonable. There was no indication that criminal proceedings were in principle faster than civil ones, and the civil courts were better equipped to assess their claims for damages. The applicants conceded that they had failed to pay the fee for filing their tort action in 1991 and had caused the adjournment of the hearings on 7 October 1994 and 11 March 1997. However, they argued that this had given rise to only minor delay. They maintained that they had had to increase their claims for non-pecuniary damages because of the inflation in the country (between 30% and 70% per annum during the period 199196 and approximately 300% per annum in the early months of 1997). The statutory rate of default interest which the court could award on top of their original claims had always been lagging behind inflation. They had thus been forced to increase the nominal amount of their claims so as to preserve their value. The applicants also disputed the Government\u2019s assertion that the need to serve the requests for leave to increase their claims on the absent parties had led to delays. In fact, it had been the courts\u2019 choice to have Mr V.G.\u2019s thirdparty claims examined together with their tort action, thus increasing to five the number of parties to the case. The joint examination of all claims had also resulted in delays occasioned by the third-party defendants.",

Moreover, the applicants had not made a civil claim against Mr V.G. in the framework of the 1988 criminal proceedings, which would in all likelihood have been dealt with expeditiously. They had waited until 1991 to do so in separate proceedings. Upon the filing of their action in 1991 the applicants had failed to pay the requisite fee. They had also repeatedly failed to comply with the Sofia City Court\u2019s instructions to provide a breakdown of their claims for pecuniary damages, which had eventually led the court to dismiss the claims. The applicants had also been responsible for the adjournment of the hearings on 7 October 1994, 17 March 1995 and 11 March 1997. Finally, the applicants had made many requests to be allowed to increase their claims for non-pecuniary damages.

Therefore, the applicants\u2019 argument that the severing of Mr V.G.\u2019s thirdparty claims would have altogether obviated the need for adjournments does not appear convincing. The authorities were not responsible for Softaxi\u2019s failures to appear: it was invariably summoned in proper and due form. However, the applicants were not to blame either. Nor does it seem that the applicants can be blamed for having used a procedural device to try to prevent the erosion of the value of their claims as a result of the high inflation rate, even though by so doing they prolonged the proceedings (see Lobarzewski v.

This was due above all to the difficulties encountered in obtaining the original and the supplementary technical expert reports. Many hearings had to be adjourned solely or mainly because of the expert\u2019s failure to draw up these reports (see paragraphs 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27, 28, 29 and 30 above). Significantly, once the court replaced the expert, the report was drawn up by the new expert in approximately two months, from 5 November 1995 until 10 January 1996 (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). Having regard to the fact that the first expert was appointed and could be \u2013 and indeed was, but only after substantial delays had already accumulated \u2013 replaced by the court, the responsibility for the delay in the presentation of the expert opinion may be considered to lie with the authorities (see Capuano v. Italy, judgment of 25\u00a0June 1988, Series A no. 119, p. 14, \u00a7 32 and Nibbio v. Italy, judgment of 26 February 1992, Series A no. 228 A, p. 10, \u00a7 18). Moreover, the expert opinion was not necessary for the examination of the applicants\u2019 action, but only for the examination of Mr V.G.\u2019s thirdparty claim against Ms V.B.",

In the instant case, the Court does not consider that the hourly rate of EUR 50 is excessive (see Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, \u00a7 176 in fine, ECHR 2002IV, Nikolov v. Bulgaria, no. 38884/97, \u00a7 111, 30 January 2003 and Toteva v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 42027/98, \u00a7 75, 19 May 2004). However, it considers that the number of hours claimed seems excessive and that a reduction is necessary on that basis. Having regard to all relevant factors, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicants EUR 1,500 in respect of costs and expenses.",
