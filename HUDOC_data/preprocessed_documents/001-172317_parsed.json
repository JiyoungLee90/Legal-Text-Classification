The Constitutional Court held that the statute which delegated law-making powers to the executive for circumscribing disciplinary offences and penalties applicable to the security forces did not specify with sufficient clarity the scope of disciplinary offences nor did it include safeguards against the discretionary powers of the executive. The mere reference to \u201cthe importance of the profession of the security\u201d in the statute as a guideline for the executive did not fulfil the constitutional requirement of the principle of legal certainty relating to offences and penalties, as set forth in Article 38 of the Constitution. The Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment thus rendered the disciplinary regulations in question null and void; this order took effect on 13 January 2017.",

Under its first aspect, the principle of presumption of innocence prohibits public officials from making premature statements about the defendant\u2019s guilt and acts as a procedural guarantee to ensure the fairness of the criminal trial itself. However, it is not limited to a procedural safeguard in criminal matters: its scope is broader and requires that no representative of the State should say that a person is guilty of an offence before his guilt has been established by a court (Konstas v.\u00a0Greece, no. 53466/07, \u00a7 32, 24 May 2011). In that respect the presumption of innocence may be infringed not only in the context of the criminal trial, but also in separate civil, disciplinary or other proceedings that are conducted simultaneously with the criminal proceedings.",

                                        "content": "42.\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the first aspect of protection under Article 6 \u00a7 2, in Allen, cited above, \u00a7 93, the Grand Chamber reiterated that, viewed as a procedural guarantee in the context of a criminal trial, \u201cthe presumption of innocence imposes requirements in respect of, inter alia, ... premature expressions by the trial court or by other public officials of a defendant\u2019s guilt\u201d. The Court has previously held in this context that the presumption of innocence will be violated if a judicial decision or, indeed, a statement by a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before his guilt has been proven according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards that person as guilty (see, inter alia, Allenet de Ribemont v. France, no. 15175/89, \u00a7 35, Series A no.\u00a0308; Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2000X; A.L. v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a072758/01, \u00a7 31, 28 April 2005; and Caraian v.\u00a0Romania, no. 34456/07, \u00a7\u00a074, 23 June 2015). The scope of the protection under the first aspect of presumption of innocence therefore extends to all statements made by a public authority regardless of whether they have been pronounced in the confines of the criminal trial, in a different public setting or in other parallel judicial proceedings. Nevertheless, whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see, among others, Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7\u00a043; and Caraian, cited above). The presumption of innocence, considered in the light of the general obligation of a fair criminal trial under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01, excludes a finding of guilt outside the criminal proceedings before the competent trial court, irrespective of the procedural safeguards in such parallel proceedings and notwithstanding general considerations of expediency (see B\u00f6hmer v.\u00a0Germany, no. 37568/97, \u00a7 67, 3 October 2002). In this connection, the Court considers that the duty to refrain from making prejudicial or premature comments regarding a person\u2019s guilt applies a fortiori to courts other than the one determining the criminal charge. The Court emphasises that the purpose of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty is not only to guarantee the fairness of the criminal trial from undue influences but also to protect a person\u2019s reputation from unjustified brandings of guilt (see El Kaada v. Germany, no. 2130/10, \u00a7\u00a042, 12\u00a0November 2015, and mutadis mutandis, Allen, cited above, \u00a7 94).",

In order to determine the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 2 under its respective aspects in the present case, the Court deems it necessary to recall the sequence of events in the domestic proceedings. The Court observes that the disciplinary proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s dismissal ran parallel to the criminal proceedings against him. Both sets of proceedings were initiated against the applicant on suspicion that he had committed criminal offences. The Court further notes that the administrative courts reviewing the disciplinary sanction gave substantial consideration to whether the applicant had in fact committed the offences of false imprisonment, robbery and attempted rape with which he had been charged and in respect of which criminal proceedings against him were pending. In that respect, when the Samsun Administrative Court rendered its judgment on 29 September 2005, the criminal court had not yet given a decision concerning the criminal charges arising out of the same facts and concerning identical accusations that were the subject of the disciplinary proceedings. Likewise, on appeal, when the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests on 10 April 2007, the criminal proceedings were still pending before the Court of Cassation, which was in the course of reviewing the judgment of the first-instance criminal court of 21 March 2006, partly acquitting the applicant of the charges of false imprisonment and robbery and partly convicting him on the requalified charge of assault and battery. Therefore, when the administrative courts reviewed the applicant\u2019s dismissal, no final judgment had yet been adopted in the criminal proceedings. In other words, the applicant\u2019s initial right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty in the context of the criminal charges against him remained valid under the first aspect of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. Having regard to the point in time when the impugned statement was made and the applicant\u2019s complaint that he had been presumed guilty before his guilt was proven, the Court will confine its examination to the first aspect of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. The Court notes in this connection that the subsequent developments in the criminal proceedings partly acquitting the applicant and discontinuing the proceedings on the charge of assault and battery are not relevant in its examination of the present application in so far as the impugned statements made by the Samsun Administrative Court preceded the partial acquittal and the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings. Therefore, the Court can assess under the first aspect, whether the reasoning adopted in the disciplinary proceedings, before the final decision in the criminal proceedings, violated the applicant\u2019s right to be presumed innocent. As a result, Article 6 \u00a7 2 is applicable in the context of the disciplinary proceedings at issue. The application is therefore not incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention.",

In that respect, the Court reiterates that the Convention does not preclude that an act may give rise to both criminal and disciplinary proceedings, or that two sets of proceedings may be pursued in parallel. The Court has held in this context that the imposition of civil or other forms liability on the basis of a less strict burden of proof in parallel proceedings is not incompatible per se with the presumption of innocence (see, for example, C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11882/85, Commission decision of 7\u00a0October 1987, DR 54, p. 162, and Erkol v. Turkey, no. 50172/06, \u00a7\u00a037, 19\u00a0April 2011). Moreover, the guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention should not be read in a manner that implies an obligation on the part of States to stay disciplinary proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal trial. Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention safeguards first and foremost the way in which the accused is treated in the context of criminal proceedings by public authorities. It also places an obligation on judicial authorities in parallel or subsequent proceedings to stay within their respective fora and refrain from commenting on the person\u2019s criminal guilt when no such guilt has been established by the competent court. Thus, in the absence of a final criminal conviction, if the disciplinary decision were to contain a statement imputing criminal liability to the applicant for the misconduct alleged against him in the disciplinary proceedings, it would raise an issue under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a02 (see Moullet, cited above; \u00c7elik (Bozkurt) v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 34388/05, \u00a7\u00a032, 12\u00a0April 2011; Erkol, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03841; Tripon v. Romania (dec.) no.\u00a027062/04 \u00a7 25, CEDH, 7 February 2012; Teodor v. Romania, no.\u00a046878/06, \u00a7 40, 4 June 2013; Milojevi\u0107 v.\u00a0Serbia (dec.), nos. 43519/07 and 2 others, \u00a7 37, 3 September 2013; and, mutatis mutandis, Y v. Norway, no.\u00a056568/00, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2003II (extracts)). The Court has repeatedly stressed the importance of the choice of words by public authorities both in the context of the criminal trial and in parallel or subsequent proceedings (see, among others, Daktaras, cited above; B\u00f6hmer, cited above, \u00a7 56, and Garycki, cited above, \u00a7 70). Where the criminal proceedings are pending and have not yet resulted with a final conviction or where they have ended with a result other than a conviction, any official statement that calls into question the person\u2019s presumed or established innocence may fall foul of the presumption of innocence.",

In that respect, the Court reiterates that no authority may treat a person as guilty of a criminal offence unless he has been convicted by the competent court (see X v. Austria, no.\u00a09295/81, Commission decision of 6 October 1992, Decisions and Reports (D.R.)).",

It is not clear whether these offences refer directly to the corresponding offences under the Criminal Code, or whether they concern separate and independent \u201cdisciplinary offences\u201d, or whether they attract a different standard of proof or entail different constitutive elements from their criminal counterparts. The indication by the Supreme Administrative Court that \u201ca conviction or acquittal by criminal courts has no influence or effect on the disciplinary proceedings\u201d does not shed light on any of these questions. The same is true for the sample administrative court decisions submitted by the Government, since they do not contain any principles by which an accused\u2019s right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court could be safeguarded in disciplinary proceedings that are conducted simultaneously or subsequently to criminal proceedings.",

The Court, however, finds it relevant to underline that its findings do not imply that the applicant\u2019s dismissal from the police force as a consequence of the incident on 3 July 2004 was unjustified, as the Court\u2019s examination is confined to the grounds relied on by the disciplinary and judicial authorities and the language they used, and does not concern the question whether the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings is as such compatible with the guarantees enshrined in Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a02 (compare Jakumas v.

As regards complaints not included in the initial application, the running of the sixmonth timelimit is not interrupted until the date when the complaint is first submitted to the Court (see Allan v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a048539/99, 28 August 2001). When the applicant introduced his application to the Court on 4 October 2007, he complained solely under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention and did not make any reference, explicit or implicit, to Articles 3 and 7 of the Convention. In these circumstances, the Court finds it established that the applicant did not raise these new complaints that concern the same facts until 23 May 2014, that is almost seven years after the exhaustion of domestic remedies; therefore, it concludes that these complaints are introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

In this connection, the Court rejects item (a) since those fees were incurred in relation to the criminal proceedings, which do not relate to the violation found. The Court also rejects item (b) as the applicant failed to submit documentary evidence, such as a contract, a fee agreement or a breakdown of the hours spent by his lawyer on the case. Concerning item (c), the applicant submitted to the court a number of documents showing payments made by the applicant in respect of fees for the national courts, including those for the reopening of proceedings at the national level in 2013, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s claims were only partially successful before it.
