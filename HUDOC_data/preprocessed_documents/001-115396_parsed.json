In interviews with the Migration Board (Migrationsverket) as well as in written submissions, the applicants claimed essentially the following. In 1995 the first applicant had been arrested when the authorities had raided a mosque while he was there. After three days in solitary confinement, he had been released with a travel ban. Before trial in 1998, he had been arrested and detained for six months, and was then convicted for being a Muslim separatist. He had been granted clemency because his lawyer had presented him as being handicapped. He had been put on the authorities\u2019 blacklist. On 13 May 2005 he had participated in a demonstration in Andijan as a member of Akrami, a non-political local organisation, when the police had opened fire against the demonstrators. He had been able to flee and to travel back to  by bus. Two days later the police had arrived at the applicants\u2019 home and had arrested him in a brutal manner. He had been taken to the police station where he had been threatened and tortured with the purpose of extorting a confession, but he had refused. After four days, his parents had been able to obtain his release through bribery. He had, however, been prohibited from travelling anywhere. Immediately after release he had been admitted to hospital due to the injuries he had sustained, but had left shortly afterwards as he had been warned against staying. He had been too afraid to return home and had, with the help of an acquaintance, gone into hiding for a period of six months.

Although the applicants had not proved their identities, it accepted that it was probable that they were of Uzbek origin. It then considered that the first applicant did not risk persecution because of the incidents in 1995 and 1998, noting that he had been granted clemency. Next, the Board found the first applicant\u2019s claims about how he had left Andijan after the demonstration in 2005 remarkable, noting that he alleged that he had been able to travel home by bus after the demonstration despite the roads having been closed. Moreover, it noted that he had claimed that he had been arrested after the demonstration because he had been convicted in 1998. The Board did not find this credible as it questioned that the police would have arrested someone whom they had not identified as a participant in the demonstration. It further considered that his statement concerning police torture in order to obtain a confession that Akrami had been responsible for the demonstration was not consistent with independent sources on the event. Against this background, the Board found that it was not likely that he had been present in Andijan at the time of the demonstrations. Turning to the documents he had produced, the Board considered that the posters of persons wanted for the events in Andijan had very low evidentiary value as the applicant\u2019s photograph differed from the others in size, and the text and placing of the information about the applicant was inconsistent with that of the other wanted persons. Furthermore, it noted that the summons produced clearly stated that he had been called to appear before the authorities as a witness and not as a suspect. It also found it remarkable that the summons had been completed in Russian by an official Uzbek authority. Moreover, it noted that the authorities had not come for him in person but had sent the summons to him.",

Moreover, the Board found that the fourth applicant was healthy and that the third applicant, who had both physical and social difficulties, had improved significantly as from the autumn of 2006. It further noted that the applicants had not produced any medical certificates to show that the third applicant needed medical treatment. Hence, in conclusion, the Board found that the applicants had failed to show that they were at risk of being persecuted if returned to  and thus found no reason to grant them leave to remain.",

However, their identities could be established through the documents produced. The first applicant then submitted that his detention in 1995 had primarily been invoked to explain how he had been placed on the authorities\u2019 blacklist of suspected Islamists. Due to that he had also had difficulties finding a job in  for which reason he had started commuting to Andijan. Moreover, after the events in Andijan in 2005, the Uzbek regime\u2019s persecution of suspected Islamic extremists had increased. The first applicant claimed that the police had been able to identify him after the demonstration because friends who had been arrested had given his name under torture. The police had also accused him of having encouraged people to demonstrate and of having been armed during the demonstration. He had only been released because he had bribed the police. As regards the posters of people wanted for the Andijan events, the first applicant claimed that they had probably been issued by the local police after he had left the country. Moreover, several names were not in alphabetical order. Since the summons had also been issued after he had left , he had reason to believe that the authorities continued to have a special interest in him. The fact that they were in Russian was simply because many officials still preferred to use that language. He stressed that the family had left the country illegally, that he was sought by the authorities on suspicion of extremist crimes and risked 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and torture. Furthermore, there were impediments to his deportation since the Uzbek authorities would arrest him upon arrival because he had applied for asylum in .",

However, due to the lack of identification documents, their identity could not be determined and for that reason, it could not be established whether the documents produced referred to the applicants. Moreover, due to the poor quality of the documents, they could not be regarded as having any significant value as evidence. The court then considered that the first applicant\u2019s story about the events before and after the demonstration in 2005 had been vague and did not appear to show firsthand experience. It also noted that, contrary to information that the first applicant had given, the second applicant had stated that he had participated in several demonstrations. Moreover, it observed that during the hearing before the court, the applicants had changed their story as regards, for example, how the first applicant had been identified by the police after the demonstration, details concerning his activities with Akrami, for how long the family had been persecuted and in which part of  the family had been living. The court found this to be an escalation of their asylum story in order to try to strengthen it and it also considered their stories to be marked by inconsistencies and contradictory information. Thus, they were not credible. As concerned the third applicant, the court found that his anxiety and learning disabilities had not improved much while in . Taking into account that he would be able to receive medical care in his home country, it considered that his psychosocial development and state of health were not such that the applicants could be granted residence permits on this ground.

The first applicant\u2019s claim that there were Uzbek spies in  was his own speculation. Moreover, he had not been politically active before leaving  and he had now left the party.

In the Board\u2019s view, it was more likely that the applicants had left the country legally with their own passports. Moreover, the Board considered it possible to return to Uzbekistan from Sweden, for example, via Russia or  from where Uzbeks did not need visas, without attracting the attention of the Uzbek authorities. Furthermore, the Board noted that it had not informed the Uzbek Embassy that the applicants were former asylum seekers. Since there were other reasons why the applicants might be in Sweden, such as for studies, work or family reasons, and the Migration Board was the central authority in Sweden for all migration issues, it was not unusual for persons to need the Migration Board\u2019s help to obtain travel documents from their home country\u2019s embassy. Also, due to Schengen cooperation, the fact that a Swedish authority assisted the applicants did not necessarily mean that they had been in  all the time. The Board further observed that it was common for Uzbeks to work outside their country, even for long periods of time, and that this was accepted by the authorities. Thus, the Board concluded that no such new circumstances which could entail an impediment to the enforcement of the deportation order had been invoked.",

It further noted that the applicants had not plausibly proved their identities. Thus, the court could not assume that the applicants\u2019 correct identity information had been given to the Embassy. Furthermore, the court considered that the applicants could arrange for their return themselves, which they were actually responsible for doing, and that in such a case the Uzbek authorities need not find out where they had been or what they had done.

Unanimous sources confirmed the vulnerability of those risk categories previously indentified by the Board (namely political opponents, independent journalists, Human Rights activists, certain religious groups, all persons with any connection to the Andijan event, relatives of persons from these groups and women from these groups). It was further noted that the Uzbek regime was repressive and had strong control over its population and several sources described the Uzbek exercise of authority as arbitrary and unpredictable. It was observed that Andijan, and the remainder of Fergana Valley, was particularly strictly controlled whereas the authorities\u2019 control in  was somewhat lower.

However, they stated that to avoid repercussions based on imputed political opinion, returns should be implemented in a way that avoided identifying claimants as rejected asylum seekers. This was particularly important with regard to potential asylum countries, for example Sweden or , where many opposition leaders were based, rather than from neighbouring countries to which there was a mixed migratory movement. The UNHCR added that reports indicated that the Uzbek justice system was arbitrary, corrupt and subject to political manipulation and that beatings and torture were widespread, thus asylum decisions should err on the side of caution.",

It starts by observing that detailed, concrete information is scarce, due to the lack of international presence in the country, but that most sources claim that the situation upon return for Uzbeks who have applied for asylum in Western countries is problematic. It notes that the UNCHR has recommended that Uzbek Embassies should not be informed that a return concerns an asylum seeker and that returns to  should be weighed with extreme caution and care. With reference to the UNHCR and Human Rights Watch, Landinfo further observes that Uzbeks who left the country after the events in Andijan still faced risks, such as detention, torture, threats and interrogation, upon return. Moreover, their relatives in  were harassed in various ways to pressure them to return to the country. All sources also stressed that  was a \u201csurveillance society\u201d where the authorities closely watch over its citizens. The surveillance is carried out both by the SNB and through the Mahalla system. The fact of having been outside the country, and applied for asylum would attract the attention of the authorities and would be considered negative, some would even see such persons as traitors. The person might not necessarily risk being tortured but could be interrogated and exposed to pressure of various sorts. In this respect, it was noted that if attempts were made to verify the identity of asylum seekers at an Uzbek embassy, the Uzbek authorities would be informed.",

Thus, although there was not enough evidence to conclude that returning former asylum seekers who had not previously come to the attention of the Uzbek authorities risked being subjected to reprisals due to their asylum application upon return, a high degree of caution in return procedures was still urged.

Hence, the explanation that the medical certificate from a  hospital does not state that the first applicant had been tortured by the Uzbek authorities because the doctor would then be at risk of repercussions from the authorities seems reasonable. Thus, although the certificate cannot be considered as proof of ill-treatment by the authorities, it is an indication that the first applicant was hospitalised at that time. Moreover, the Swedish authorities\u2019 arguments that the first applicant had been called as a witness, not a suspect, and that the police had not come for him in person, was explained by the applicants as being a method used by the Uzbek authorities. They would call persons as witnesses to get them to present themselves at the police station where they would then be accused of having committed crimes. The Court notes that this explanation is supported by the report published by the Migration Board itself (see \u00a7 46) and consequently should not be dismissed as being improbable, although it does not prove the authenticity of the summons.",

Thus, it must be assumed that this information has come to the Uzbek authorities\u2019 knowledge (see above \u00a7 48). In this respect, and contrary to the Migration Court\u2019s judgment of 22 March 2010 in which it considered that the applicants could arrange for their own trip home without the Uzbek authorities knowing where they had been or what they had done, the Court considers it unlikely that the applicants would be able to enter the country without being noticed.

By submitting the fourth applicant\u2019s Swedish birth certificate to the Uzbek Embassy, the Uzbek authorities were also made aware that the applicants had been in  at least since January 2006. It is thus likely that the Uzbek authorities drew the conclusion that the applicants were not just visiting or studying.

Having regard to all of the above, the Court finds that it is probable that, if returned to , the applicants would be detained and interrogated about their activities during their time outside the country.",

The Court\u2019s concern is whether or not the applicants would be ill-treated or tortured, contrary to Article 3 of the Convention, if returned. In examining this matter, the Court observes that it has already in previous cases (see, Rustamov v. Russia, no. 11209/10, \u00a7\u00a7 124-125, 3 July 2012, with further sources) found that the practice of torture of those in police custody was systematic and indiscriminate and concluded that ill-treatment of detainees remained a pervasive and enduring problem in Uzbekistan. Moreover, having regard to the information from international sources (see above \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 45-46), the Court cannot but conclude that the situation in Uzbekistan has not improved in this respect but that torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by law enforcement and investigative officials remain widespread and endemic. In these circumstances, the risk of the applicants being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention must be considered a real one if they were to be detained and interrogated by the Uzbek authorities.",

The Court further noted, in that case, that the individual profiles of the applicants were highly significant in its assessment of the risk of arrest by the Uzbek authorities upon return (\u00a7 69). To the Court, the present case is clearly distinguishable from that case in that the applicants in the case now before the Court have invoked various grounds for fear and the Court has found reasons to believe that the Uzbek authorities may have a special interest in the applicants, as set out above, both in relation to the events in Andijan and the first applicant\u2019s membership in Birdamlik.",
