During the journey the two men told her that they intended to \u201csell\u201d her as a prostitute to people with whom they were in contact in Blagoevgrad, and then to \u201ctake her back\u201d after receiving the money. The applicant refused, but was threatened by B.Z. On their arrival at Blagoevgrad the group met a number of people in various caf\u00e9s in the town; those people were apparently involved in prostitution rings abroad and discussed with B.Z. and S.P. sending the applicant to Greece, Italy or Macedonia to work as a prostitute and her alleged experience in the trade. The applicant was told that three of the men they had met were police officers. The applicant was then taken to a flat where she was held against her will and repeatedly beaten and raped by several men for about 48 hours, following which she managed to escape and found refuge in a neighbouring apartment block where occupants called the police.",

He also noted a number of irregularities in the charges against the various defendants, such as wrong dates, inaccurate legal classifications or inconsistencies between the facts set out and the legal classification retained. The prosecutor also noted that the investigation had been carried out in the absence of one of the defendants without a duty lawyer being appointed and that some of the charges had to be amended, to take account, inter alia, of the fact that the applicant had attempted to commit suicide, which was an aggravating circumstance. In an order of 16 October 2002, the prosecutor noted that no measures had been carried out in accordance with his previous decision. In a further order of 12 March 2004, he observed that the instructions given had not been followed in their entirety, and in particular that the charges had not been amended.",

On 26 June 2007 part of the investigation, which concerned the offences of which the applicant accused Y.Y.G. and K.M., was severed from the main proceedings and fresh proceedings brought against persons unknown.

The Government referred to the complexity of the case to explain the length, but the Court is not convinced that the complexity of the present case can justify proceedings of that length particularly as the main suspects had been identified by the applicant at the very beginning of the proceedings.",

Apart from a number of periods of inactivity, the Court observes that the investigation was closed four times but the prosecutor decided to send the case back for further investigation on the grounds that the necessary investigative measures had not been carried out or that procedural irregularities had been committed, often despite instructions given by the prosecutor in the preceding committal decisions (see paragraph 10 above). These circumstances reveal a lack of diligence by the authorities and undeniably had the effect of delaying the investigation phase of the proceedings. They also incur the risk of causing the criminal proceedings to become time-barred. It turns out that prosecution of the less serious offences was indeed terminated on account of expiry of the absolute limitation period, which applies even where a criminal trial is under way (see paragraphs 16 and 19).",

Admittedly, it is not, in theory, the Court\u2019s task to call into question the lines of inquiry pursued by the investigators or the findings of fact made by them, unless they manifestly fail to take into account relevant elements or are arbitrary (see Georgiev v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 34137/03, 11\u00a0January 2011, see also Nikolay Dimitrov v. Bulgaria, no. 72663/01, \u00a7 76, 27 September 2007). The Court also observes, with regard to the proceedings brought against the two police officers, that the applicant did not challenge the order of 19 October 1999 discontinuing the proceedings, although she could have appealed to a court against the prosecutor\u2019s decision to discontinue the proceedings. It is a cause for concern, however, that given the nature of the offences in the present case and despite the applicant\u2019s allegations that her assailants were members of a network trafficking in women with a view to their prostitution abroad, the authorities did not consider it necessary to examine the possible involvement of an organised criminal network and confined themselves to prosecuting the individuals directly responsible for the abduction and assault of the applicant. With regard to the involvement of the other two individuals, there is no evidence that following the prosecutor\u2019s decision to sever the investigation in their regard the authorities displayed diligence and carried out concrete measures with a view to finding the individuals in question or gathering additional evidence.",

The Court observes that it has already found, on many occasions, violations of the obligation to carry out an effective investigation in applications concerning Bulgaria. It has concluded, accordingly, that there was a violation of the procedural obligations under Article 2 or Article 3 of the Convention in more than 45 judgments (see, inter alia, with regard to violence perpetrated by individuals, Angelova and Iliev v.
