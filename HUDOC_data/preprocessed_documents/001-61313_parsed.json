In the light of the number of judgments given in the course of the proceedings and the frequency of hearings held before the domestic courts there seem to be no grounds for criticising the domestic authorities. All the same, the proceedings lasted over seven years within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction ratione temporis. The Court observes that within that period the case was on three occasions remitted to the Szczecin District Court for re-examination. Although the Court is not in a position to verify the validity of the applicant\u2019s view that the lower courts failed to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s guidelines as to the further examination of the case, it finds that such a number of remittals of the case significantly delayed the proceedings.",
