The strain that flows from detention on remand - in the view of the Committee - caused not only by the uncertainty that follows from the charge and the imprisonment, but also uncertainty with respect to the length of the detention and the consequent questions, inter alia, whether the detainee can resume his work or his education after the detention ends, relationships with family and friends, etc. The strain must normally be presumed to grow concurrently with the length of the interference and especially for this reason the length of detention should be limited as far as possible. Against this background, the Committee finds that there is a need for further measures to reduce the length of detention on remand. Considering the serious character of the interference, the Committee further notes that it must be incumbent on the police, the prosecution authorities and the courts that, in the organisation of their work, they pay special attention to expediting these cases in order for detention on remand to be of the shortest possible duration.\u201d",

As explained in more detail in the preparatory notes (see the Official Report on Parliamentary Proceedings 2007-2008 (2nd sitting), Addendum A, p. 2952 (Bill No. L 78)), it depends on a specific assessment of all the circumstances of each case whether there is a basis for deviating from the maximum periods of pre-trial detention, as concerns both charged persons under and over the age of eighteen. When assessing this, the court must start from the reason for detention applied, that is, the reasons for pre-trial detention under section 762, subsection 1(i) (danger of absconding), section 762, subsection 1(ii) (danger of reoffending), or section 762, subsection 2 (public interest) of the Administration of Justice Act.

Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, \u00a7 58, ECHR 2003IX (extracts) and Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no. 5829/04, \u00a7 182, 31\u00a0May 2011). The national judicial authorities must ensure that, in a given case, the detention of an accused person pending trial does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and set them out in their decisions on the applications for release (see Letellier v. France, 26\u00a0June 1991, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 207). Arguments for and against release must not be general and abstract (see Clooth v. , 12 December 1991, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 225). The persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a0153, ECHR 2000IV). The Convention case-law has developed four basic acceptable reasons for detaining a person before judgment when that person is suspected of having committed an offence: the risk that the accused would fail to appear for trial (see St\u00f6gm\u00fcller v. Austria, 10 November 1969, \u00a7 15, Series A no. 9); the risk that the accused, if released, would take action to prejudice the administration of justice (see Wemhoff v. Germany, 27 June 1968, \u00a7 14, Series A no. 7) or commit further offences (see Matznetter v. Austria, 10 November 1969, \u00a7 9, Series A no.\u00a010) or cause public disorder (see Letellier, cited above, \u00a7 51). More specifically, as to public disorder, in the latter quoted judgment, the Court accepted \u201cthat, by reason of their particular gravity and public reaction to them, certain offences may give rise to a social disturbance capable of justifying pre-trial detention, at least for a time. In exceptional circumstances this factor may therefore be taken into account for the purposes of the Convention, in any event in so far as domestic law recognises - as in Article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure - the notion of disturbance to public order caused by an offence. However, this ground can be regarded as relevant and sufficient only provided that it is based on facts capable of showing that the accused\u2019s release would actually disturb public order. In addition detention will continue to be legitimate only if public order remains actually threatened; its continuation cannot be used to anticipate a custodial sentence...\u201d.",

It notes that whenever the applicant\u2019s detention was extended after 1 July 2008, the domestic courts expressly stated that they found that there were such very special circumstances in the present case. Moreover, on 11 September and 6\u00a0November 2008, when the applicant objected to the extension of the detention, the City Court gave detailed reasoning as to why it found that such very special circumstances existed (see paragraph 19 and 23).",

It cannot be concluded that the domestic courts used identical, stereotyped terms, nor can it be said in the circumstances of the present case that one year, four months and fourteen days was such a long lapse of time, that other grounds had to be given by the judicial authorities to justify the continued deprivation of liberty, other than the one set out in 762, subsection 2\u00a0(i), of the Administration of Justice Act, which in the concrete case before it was that it would have offended the public sense of justice if the applicant, who had committed and admitted to the rape and homicide of an eightyfive year-old lady, had been released pending completion of the mental status examinations.",

Russia, no. 24202/05, \u00a7 148, 24 June 2010 and Sutyagin v. Russia, no. 30024/02, \u00a7 143, 3 May 2011). In the present case the domestic courts relied not only on the gravity of the charge against the applicant, but also on the public reaction. More concretely they found that it would have offended the public sense of justice if the applicant, who had been charged with rape and homicide of an eightyfive year-old lady, had been released pending completion of the mental status examinations. The more so, because the applicant from the beginning had admitted to the crime committed. Moreover, although the public prosecution is also responsible for drawing up the indictment in Denmark, it is for the Danish courts, regularly during the pretrial detention, to verify and control that the indictment is still justified, as opposed to the Russian legal system, where the characterization in law of the facts, and thus the sentence faced by the accused, is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of whether the evidence obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the accused has committed the alleged offence (see, inter alia, Veliyev v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7 148).",

It will be recalled that already on 20\u00a0September\u00a02007 the City Court in Aalborg decided that the applicant should be placed in an appropriate home or institution as provided for in section 765, subsection 1 and 2(iii), of the Administration of Justice Act. The following day, the applicant was placed in a secure institution for young offenders (see paragraph 8). Accordingly, it cannot be said that the Danish courts did not consider and decide to apply a less interfering measure than ordinary pretrial detention.",
