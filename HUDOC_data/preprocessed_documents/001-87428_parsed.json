In the Ergin case the applicant was the editor of a newspaper and was charged with incitement, by publication of an article, to evade military service. In the present case, the applicant was convicted of espionage (\u00a7\u00a7 12, 16). Clearly, the two offences are of a very different nature. The judgment takes note of the prevailing practice in the Council of Europe Member States and points to a strong trend at the international level to limit the jurisdiction of military courts (\u00a7\u00a7 43 \u2013 44). However, it does not go as far as to say that in times of peace military courts should not try civilians no matter what the offence is. The Court\u2019s position is that \u201cthe power of military criminal justice should not extend to civilians unless there are compelling reasons justifying such a situation. The existence of such reasons [has] to be substantiated in each specific case.

It would have been preferable if the Court had further elaborated on the meaning of the \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d approach. A case of espionage was a good opportunity to do so. However, if the Court considered that military courts should not try civilians in peacetime since it was incompatible with the fair trial guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1, it ought to have ruled on that principle.",
