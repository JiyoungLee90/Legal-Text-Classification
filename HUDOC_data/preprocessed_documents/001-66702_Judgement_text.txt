The case originated in an application (no. 60408/00) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Yulia Aleksandrovna Yemanakova (“the applicant”), on 7 July 2000.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Ms O. Panchenko, a lawyer practising in . The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr. P.A. Laptev, the Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicant alleged that the proceedings in a civil case to which she was a party were unreasonably long, in violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. She also submitted that she had no effective remedies against the alleged violation, in breach of Article 13 of the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).
By a decision of 6 November 2003 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1919 and lives in .
The facts of the case are partially disputed by the parties. They may be summarised as follows.
The applicant’s father was subjected to repression in 1929-1930 as a rich peasant (“kulak”). In 1930 the family property, including a two-storey house in Sorochinsk, Orenburg Region, , was confiscated. In 1989 the applicant’s father was rehabilitated post mortem. The family house remains intact in Sorochinsk, where it is used by the  to house its employees. At some point during the proceedings the families who lived in the house were permitted to acquire their flats.
The applicant lives in , and the train journey to Sorochinsk takes about two and a half days.
In 1990 the applicant and her sister, Mrs Mikhaylishina, initiated proceedings to have their property right to the house recognised. On 26 October 1990 the  rejected their request and advised them to seek compensation for the property from the Orenburg Regional financial department. It appears that the department refused their request for compensation.
In January 1992 the applicant’s sister died and the applicant remained the sole party to the proceedings.
At some point in March 1992 the applicant submitted new claims to the Leninskiy District Court of Orenburg. On 24 September 1992 the Leninskiy District Court rejected both her complaint about the decision of the Regional financial department and her civil claim to have her property right to the house confirmed. On 6 May 1993 the  quashed the decision of 24 September 1992 and remitted the case to the District Court. On 15 September 1993 the Leninskiy District Court ordered the transfer of the case to the  which had territorial jurisdiction for the dispute over the building.
On 20 January 1995 the Head of the  administration issued an order, requesting the  to pay the applicant the maximum compensation allowed by the national legislation, which would later be reimbursed to the College by the regional budget. The order was never complied with. On 10 April 1995 the  ordered the closure of the civil case as the applicant had been awarded the compensation. On 25 September 1995 the Presidium of the , acting by way of supervisory review, quashed the order of 10 April 1995 and returned the case to the .
On 27 December 1995 the  rejected the applicant’s claim against the Town administration as having no basis in the national legislation and because she had already been awarded the compensation. On 9 April 1996 the  quashed the judgment and remitted the case.
On 24 July 1996 the  confirmed that the applicant’s family had been the owners of the property and that the confiscation had taken place, but rejected the applicant’s claim to have the house returned. On 27 August 1996 the  quashed this judgment and remitted the case.
On 13 February 1997 the  again confirmed the family’s previous ownership of the property and the fact of confiscation, but rejected the applicant’s claim to have the house returned. On 24 April 1997 the  quashed this judgment. The applicant was then informed that the  would consider her case as the first instance court.
On 28 April 1998 the  of the  rejected the applicant’s claim for compensation filed against the Regional financial department and refused to return the house in natura. It ordered the  administration to pay the applicant the maximum compensation for the confiscated property in the amount of RUR 8,349 (100 “units” of the minimum monthly wage), plus travel expenses and legal fees in the amount of RUR 3,540. The applicant submits that she was served with the decision on 6 May 1998.
On 7 May 1998 the applicant received RUR 3,540, representing travel fees and legal costs, at the Town administration.
On 14 May 1998 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the , which was to be forwarded together with the case file to the Supreme Court. The applicant then wrote to the  to inquire about the progress of the case on 21 August 1998 and 24 March 1999, but received no reply. She also wrote directly to the Supreme Court on several occasions, including on 21 August and 26 November 1998, 6 May, 21 June, 2 August, 18 August and 16 December 1999. She received standard replies from the Supreme Court on 5 November 1998, 19 July 1999 and 19 January 2000, stating that her appeal could not be considered as no case file had been attached. On at least one occasion, in May 1999, the applicant copied the decisions of the courts and her appeal and forwarded the copies to the Supreme Court herself. Her letters to other bodies, including the Ministry of Justice, the High Qualification Board of Judges, the President’s administration, the , prosecutors’ offices of various levels were either not answered or forwarded to the . The applicant submits that she was not aware of any procedural orders issued by the  in respect of her appeal.
According to the Government’s submissions filed after the communication of the complaint, the Orenburg Regional Court pronounced its judgment on 28 April 1998 in short form (without reasoning), and then on 29 April 1998 in full. The decision was served on the applicant on 6 May 1998. She thus missed the ten-days time-limit for filing a cassation appeal, which was eventually lodged on 15 May and arrived at the  on 25 May 1998. As a result, on 1 June 1998 the  issued a procedural order adjourning her appeal and requesting the applicant to submit reasons for the delay. This decision was forwarded to the applicant by a letter of 3 June 1998.
On 21 June 1998 the  again adjourned the appeal and requested reasons for the delay from the applicant. A letter, dated by mistake 21 July 1998, was sent to the applicant. The applicant failed to respond.
The Government also submit that the court decision was executed in full in April 2000, when the sum of RUR 8,349 (one hundred minimum monthly wages) was transferred to a new account opened in the applicant’s name in the Sorochinsk branch of Sberbank. The applicant was informed accordingly by a letter. The applicant had already received the RUR 3,539 to cover her travel expenses.
In February 2004, upon the Court’s request, the Government submitted copies of documents supporting their submissions. These included, notably, the ’s decision of 1 June 1998, a letter from the same court dated 21 July 1998 informing the applicant about the adjournment and documents from the Sorochinsk Town Administration concerning execution of the judgment in April 2000.
The applicant claims that she did not receive the letters of 3 June and 21 June (July) 1998. With respect to the award, the applicant submits that she only learned of the transfer to a bank account opened in her name in 2002, after receipt of the Government’s memorandum.
The complaint was communicated to the Russian Government in September 2001.
On 21 January 2002 the Presidium of the , acting upon the Regional Prosecutor’s application for supervisory review, quashed and remitted for procedural reasons the decision of the Sorochinsk Town Court of 26 October 1990. On 30 January 2002 the applicant was informed of this.
On 12 February 2002 the  issued an order by which the applicant and her sister were instructed to update their claim of 1990 and to submit the applicant’s sister’s birth certificate before 15 March 2002. On 13 February 2002 the order was forwarded to the applicant. On 26 April 2002 the applicant replied to the  that her sister had died in 1992 and forwarded a copy of her death certificate. On 16 May 2002 the judge of the  confirmed receipt of her letter and again requested her to update the claim initially submitted in August 1990 and to clarify if she wanted the case to be reviewed in her absence. It appears that a court hearing was scheduled for 22 August 2002. The applicant responded in July 2002 that she was not interested in a new review of the case, since it had lost its meaning. Her new claims against the defendants had been submitted in 1992 to the , and these proceedings were the issue of her complaint.
On 18 September 2002 the  issued an information note, stating that the hearing in the applicant’s claim against the  administration was adjourned to 27 September 2002, due to the non-appearance of the claimant. On 14 October 2002 the applicant requested the court to terminate these proceedings.
Section 283 of the Civil Procedural Code then in force provided that cassation appeals are submitted through the court which acted as the court of first instance. Submission of the appeal directly to the cassation instance cannot prevent its consideration.
Section 284 (1) set a one month time-limit for review of cassation appeals by the Supreme Court.
