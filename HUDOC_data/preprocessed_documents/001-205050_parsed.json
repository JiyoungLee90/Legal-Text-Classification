As it appears from the case-file material, the applicant had travelled through that route twenty-six times in the period between 21\u00a0May 2009 and 20\u00a0May 2010. After going through the passport control at the checkpoint she passed the desk designated for customs declarations without making such a declaration. Subsequently the applicant was approached by customs officers and asked whether she had anything to declare. The applicant responded in the negative. She was nevertheless required to go through a search procedure which revealed that she had 40,000 United States dollars (USD) hidden on her person which she had failed to declare. The money was hidden underneath the applicant\u2019s clothes, placed in a stocking tied around her waist. The customs officers drew up a report on the discovery of an undeclared sum of money on the applicant\u2019s person and its seizure, which was signed by the customs officers, the applicant, and an interpreter. No objections were recorded on that document. The officers also drew up an official report concerning the violation of customs rules, which was also signed by the applicant, without objections having been recorded on that document.",

It found that she had been duly assisted by an interpreter. As regards the confiscation measure, the court established that the applicant had deliberately avoided making the customs declaration by failing to stop at the desk designated for such declarations, and had concealed the money underneath her clothes, placed in a stocking tied around her waist. The court also noted that the applicant had failed to substantiate her submission concerning the shared ownership of the money confiscated from her given that she had deliberately avoided making the appropriate declaration and this argument had not been raised at the time the violation of the customs regulations had been discovered. The court considered that the applicant\u2019s behaviour had indicated that the subsequently raised argument concerning the shared ownership of the confiscated sum had been aimed at avoiding the imposition of the relevant sanction. It further noted that given the \u201cdubious circumstances\u201d of the case, the verbal explanations given by the applicant and her travelling companions as to the shared ownership had been insufficient to substantiate her assertions. The court continued to note that, in any event, the relevant regulation had been concerned with the transportation of money, not its ownership, and it had been the applicant who was found to have transported the whole amount on her person. Therefore, the declaration obligation had rested with her. The undeclared money having been found through the personal search, it had been, in the court\u2019s conclusion, rightfully forfeited, in accordance with Article\u00a0242 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Customs Code. The applicant lodged an appeal on an unspecified date, reiterating her complaints (see paragraphs\u00a07 and 11 above).",

The appellate court agreed with the Batumi City Court that the applicant had been duly assisted by an interpreter at the time the violation of the customs regulations had been discovered. It further endorsed the finding that the applicant\u2019s argument regarding shared ownership of the confiscated money had been unsubstantiated, as she had failed to put that argument forward at the time the violation of the customs rule had been found, and had signed the relevant reports on the violation of the customs regulations. The appellate court continued to note that regardless of the question of ownership, as the person transporting the full amount, it had been the applicant\u2019s obligation to have it declared in accordance with the relevant regulations. The appellate court also noted that the declaration obligation and the relevant sanction had applied to the totality of the sum exceeding GEL\u00a030,000, and not the part in excess, as argued by the applicant. Therefore the applicant had been under the obligation to declare the transportation of USD\u00a040,000 which she had instead chosen to conceal. The Kutaisi Court of Appeal stated that while no taxes had been applicable to any sum transported through Georgia, a failure to declare a sum of money exceeding GEL\u00a030,000, as in the applicant\u2019s case, had constituted a violation of customs rules, warranting the application of the sanction provided for in Article\u00a0242 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Customs Code.",

The Court has found that rigid domestic laws which made full confiscation an automatic sanction would often lead to domestic court decisions that fail to strike a fair balance between the requirements of the general interest and the protection of an individual\u2019s right to property (see, among other authorities, Gyrlyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30 and 31).",

The measure was the only sanction imposed on the applicant (compare and contrast, Ismayilov, \u00a7\u00a038, and Togrul, \u00a7\u00a045, both cited above). Having gone through the relevant checkpoint twenty-six times prior to the impugned events (see paragraph\u00a06 above), the applicant must have been well aware of the fact that any sum exceeding the legal limit provided for by the relevant regulations (see paragraphs\u00a017-18 above) must be declared to the customs authorities. In this context, while the amount claimed as the applicant\u2019s own fell well within the legal limit, the applicant chose, according to her own account, to carry additional sums and took the risk of having it confiscated by deliberately circumventing the customs inspection (see paragraphs\u00a06 and\u00a014-15 above).",
