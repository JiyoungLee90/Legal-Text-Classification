The present situation is to be distinguished from cases where the application was first validly introduced by an\u00a0applicant who subsequently died during the proceedings before the Court and his or her heirs were then allowed to\u00a0pursue that application (see Bitt\u00f3 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a073-74, 28\u00a0January 2014).

In such circumstances the Court cannot accept her standing to continue the present proceedings in her mother\u2019s stead and must declare this part of the application incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention. Accordingly, the part of the application regarding the claims of Ms\u00a0S.\u00a0Andr\u00e1ssyov\u00e1 must be rejected under Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a03 and 4 of the Convention.

Those sums were then increased by the default interest applicable under Slovak law. The individual applicants\u2019 claims are set out in Appendices 5 and 6 (column G). In addition, the applicants claimed EUR\u00a050,000 each in respect of non-pecuniary damage. They supported their claims by submitting statements in which they described the difficulties they had experienced as a\u00a0result of the application of the rent-control scheme to their property, and in some cases they also described the circumstances under which the property had been taken away from them or their predecessors under the previous regime.",
