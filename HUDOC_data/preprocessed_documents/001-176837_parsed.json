The court found that the applicant had stalked his former girlfriend, terrorised her and her family with telephone calls, sudden appearances and threats against their life and limb, had finally waylaid his former girlfriend in front of her workplace and had stabbed her twice in the neck with a pair of scissors with the intention of killing her. He had stopped short of stabbing his victim to death.

The court found that the applicant, who had previously been convicted in 1975, 1977, 1981, 1983 and 1988 of comparable offences including dangerous and sexual assault and rape, committed mostly against former girlfriends at the end of their relationship with him, had a propensity to commit serious violent offences and was dangerous to the public.",

The court held that, in accordance with the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court (see decision of 3 February 2003, file no. 2 BvR 1512/02) and of the Constitutional Court of Berlin (see decision of 4 March 2009, file no. VerfGH 104/07) it was otherwise within the discretion of the court assessing the need to extend the preventive detention order to decide whether a new expert opinion was necessary. As a rule, an expert opinion would be necessary if the detainee suffered from psychiatric anomalies that demanded a psychiatric expert\u2019s assessment in order to be able to predict the danger he represented for the public.

The court considered that releasing the applicant on probation on the condition that he underwent therapeutic treatment outside the detention centre would be irresponsible. There were no convincing and verifiable indications that the applicant had tackled his offences or the flaws in his character that had led to them. The year he had spent at liberty during the interruption of his preventive detention did not prove otherwise, although he had not reoffended during that period of time. The applicant had already abstained from committing offences for longer periods of time in the past, but had nevertheless repeatedly committed serious offences against the physical integrity of his female partners when they had ended their relationship with him. Having regard also to the personality disorders leading to his dangerousness, the period of one year at liberty was therefore too short to prove that the applicant was no longer dangerous. In this regard, the court referred to the reasoning in its decision of 27 May 2008 and the expert opinion of B. and S. on which that decision was based (see paragraphs 13-15 above).",

The court recognised that prison leave was necessary in order to enable the applicant, in the long run, to prove his capacity to live at liberty again without committing further offences.

The causal link required by sub-paragraph (a) might eventually be broken, first, if a position were reached in which a decision not to release was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the initial decision (by a sentencing court) or, second, on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives. In those circumstances, a detention that was lawful at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with Article 5 (see M. v.

They indicated that the year he had been at liberty was too short to prove that he was no longer dangerous, on the following grounds: the applicant suffered from a serious personality disorder, which had not been successfully treated in the past and there was no proof that it had been successfully treated in his therapy with So. The applicant, who had been convicted fifteen times since 1971, including ten convictions for violent crimes (see paragraph 20 above), several of which had been committed at the end of a relationship with a female partner, had not been in a relationship during the period when he had been at liberty. Having heard both the prison authorities and the applicant, the domestic courts further had regard to the impulsive and offensive way in which the applicant still treated other persons notably in the detention centre.
