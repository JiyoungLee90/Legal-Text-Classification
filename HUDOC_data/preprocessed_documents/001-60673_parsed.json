The system is inter-disciplinary, involving the participation of the police, educational bodies, doctors and others. At all stages the system involves joint discussions, joint recommendations and joint decisions. The key organisation is the Child Protection Conference, a multi-disciplinary body which decides whether to place the child on the Child Protection Register. This procedure by way of joint action takes place, not merely because it is good practice, but because it is required by guidance having statutory force binding on the local authority. The guidance is extremely detailed and extensive: the current edition of \u201cWorking Together\u201d runs to 126 pages. To introduce into such a system a common law duty of care enforceable against only one of the participant bodies would be manifestly unfair. To impose such liability on all the participant bodies would lead to almost impossible problems of disentangling as between the respective bodies the liability, both primary and by way of contribution, of each for reaching a decision found to be negligent.",

We were not referred to any category of case in which a duty of care has been held to exist which is in any way analogous to the present cases. Here, for the first time, the plaintiffs are seeking to erect a common law duty of care in relation to the administration of a statutory social welfare scheme. Such a scheme is designed to protect weaker members of society (children) from harm done to them by others. The scheme involves the administrators in exercising discretion and powers which could not exist in the private sector and which in many cases bring them into conflict with those who, under the general law, are responsible for the child\u2019s welfare. To my mind, the nearest analogies are the cases where a common law duty of care has been sought to be imposed upon the police (in seeking to protect vulnerable members of society from wrongs done to them by others) or statutory regulators of financial dealing who are seeking to protect investors from dishonesty. In neither of these cases has it been thought appropriate to superimpose on a statutory regime a common law duty of care giving rise to a claim in damages for failure to protect the weak against the wrongdoer. ... In my judgment, the courts should proceed with great care before holding liable in negligence those who have been charged by Parliament with the task of protecting society from the wrong doings of others.\u201d",

It is a prerequisite to there being any liability in negligence at all that as a matter of policy it is fair, just and reasonable in those circumstances to impose liability in negligence. (2)\u00a0\u00a0In a wide range of cases public policy has led to the decision that the imposition of liability would not be fair and reasonable in the circumstances, e.g. some activities of financial regulators, building inspectors, ship surveyors, social workers dealing with sex abuse cases. In all these cases and many others the view has been taken that the proper performance of the defendant\u2019s primary functions for the benefit of society as a whole will be inhibited if they are required to look over their shoulder to avoid liability in negligence. In English law the decision as to whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a liability in negligence on a particular class of would-be defendants depends on weighing in the balance the total detriment to the public interest in all cases from holding such class liable in negligence as against the total loss to all would-be plaintiffs if they are not to have a cause of action in respect of the loss they have individually suffered.

The records of the social services showed that there was no suggestion of sexual abuse occurring in the family. They concentrated considerable energy and resources on the severe problems of the family which were known to them. The later evidence from the criminal investigation suggested a history of inter-generational abuse where the mother was complicit, and there was a culture of absolute silence on the issue between members of the family. The first applicant\u2019s complaints to the social worker referred to instances of physical assault and there was no mention of sexual abuse. The interpretation of the situation by the social workers must be viewed in its historical context, in particular the limited awareness of sexual abuse which existed at that time. It is likely that, given even today\u2019s level of awareness, the social workers would not have considered the case to suggest sexual abuse. Signs such as soiling, advanced sexualisation and truancy, are considered low risk indicators which could have a number of explanations and which do not include abuse.

From 1967, the social services were in almost constant contact with the family, providing relief for the mother, practical help with housing and threats from the Electricity Board to cut off their electricity, assistance with chronic financial problems, and, increasingly involved in the difficulties experienced by the children. From 1973, the social service records refer to the second applicant\u2019s problem of soiling, which led to the involvement of medical professionals and his admittance as an inpatient. From at least 1978, there were concerns about truanting by a number of the children in the family and involvement of the Education Welfare Officer. Incidents of violence were reported but these were sporadic - an incident on 29 June 1978 when the children complained that N.C. had hit them, on 7 July 1980 when the child A. complained that she had been hit during a family row, a complaint by J. on 29 May 1981 that N.C. had hit her and on 27 November 1981 when it was N.C. who complained that the second applicant had been smashing up the house. These cannot be regarded as revealing a clear pattern of victimisation or abuse. The Court is not persuaded therefore that there were any particular aspects of the turbulent and volatile family situation which should have led the social services to suspect a deeper, more insidious problem in a family which was experiencing financial hardship, occasional criminal proceedings and with a mother observed to be \u201cless caring\u201d than she should be. Far from N.C. being perceived as a risk element in this scenario, the social services considered that there was grounds for believing, at least in the early years, that he was a positive influence, providing a father figure for the growing number of children, support for the mother and some added wage-earning capacity. In view of the apparent assistance of the mother in covering for N.C. and the silence of all the children notwithstanding their numerous contacts with various professionals over the years, the Court does not consider that the social services can be criticised for failing to instigate an investigation into the possibility of some additional underlying problem.

While there were times when both applicants showed significant distress in the family environment, both also showed strong ties to the family.

The second applicant was placed in a Children\u2019s Home from 1982 to 1984, with alternate weekends at home and though on some occasions he showed reluctance to go home on other occasions he appeared to enjoy the visits.

The Court has already found however in the case of Z. and Others v. the United Kingdom that the House of Lords\u2019 decision that as a matter of law there was no duty of care arising in a similar situation could not be characterised as either an exclusionary rule or an immunity which deprived the applicants in that case of access to court. In deciding not to extend liability in negligence into a new area, the House of Lords had circumscribed the range of liability under tort law. As the Court has recalled above, it is a principle of Convention case-law that Article 6 does not in itself guarantee any particular content for civil rights and obligations in national law, although other Articles such as those protecting the right to respect for family life (Article 8) and the right to property (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1) may do so. It is not enough to bring Article 6 \u00a7 1 into play that the non-existence of a cause of action under domestic law may be described as having the same effect as an immunity, in the sense of not enabling the applicant to sue for a given category of harm.",

In this case, the second applicant had the opportunity, in adversarial proceedings, to have his claims examined in court in light of the applicable domestic legal principles concerning the tort of negligence. The first applicant would have had the same opportunity, if she had chosen to pursue it. The fact that the second applicant\u2019s claims were struck out as disclosing no cause of action does not therefore disclose any restriction on access to court. The resulting lack of any possibility to obtain redress in the courts may however raise issues under Article 13 of the Convention, which requires an effective remedy in respect of violations, or arguable claims of violations, of the Convention (see Z. and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 102-103; see further below).

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention.

Turkey judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, pp. 330-31, \u00a7 107). Where alleged failure by the authorities to protect persons from the acts of others is concerned, Article 13 may not always require that the authorities undertake the responsibility for investigating the allegations.

Furthermore, in the case of a breach of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, which rank as the most fundamental provisions of the Convention, compensation for the non-pecuniary damage flowing from the breach should in principle be available as part of the range of redress (see Z. and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, \u00a7 109; Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, ECHR 2001-III, \u00a7\u00a7 122, 129; Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, judgment of 14 March 2002, \u00a7 97).",

This does not however mean, for the purposes of Article 13, that their complaints fall outside the scope of its protection. These complaints were not declared inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded and necessitated an examination on the merits. It is not disputed that the applicants did suffer appalling abuse at a time when they were under the supervision of the local authorities. The issue as to whether the local authority should have been aware of what was going on and taken steps to safeguard the applicants required consideration of documentary records going back over thirty years. While the Court was not persuaded on the materials available before it that these disclosed a situation where the local authorities knew of, or had reason to suspect, the sexual abuse, this Court\u2019s role is essentially subsidiary to that of the domestic courts who are better placed and equipped as fact-finding tribunals. An effective domestic procedure of enquiry would have offered more prospect of establishing the facts and throwing light on the conduct reasonably to be expected from the social services in a situation where the applicants demonstrated long-term and serious problems that arguably might have called for additional efforts of investigation to uncover the reality of the family dynamics.",
