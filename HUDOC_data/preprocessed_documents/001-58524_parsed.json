This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions.

Furthermore, although the indictment lodged against the suspect H\u00fcseyin G\u00fcney arrested in Diyarbak\u0131r on 24 December 1993 listed the killing of Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 as one of the separatist offences committed by him as a Hizbullah member, there was no direct evidence linking him with that particular crime (see paragraphs 48 and 50 above). The Diyarbak\u0131r National Security Court did not hear any witnesses concerning the K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 incident nor had H\u00fcseyin G\u00fcney made any admissions as to his involvement.

This finding is confirmed by the decision of 29 March 1999 of the Diyarbak\u0131r National Security Court, which found that it was not proved that H\u00fcseyin G\u00fcney had used the gun in any other incident (see paragraph 26 above).",

However, the Court notes that on 16 February 1994 the \u015eanl\u0131urfa public prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction in respect of the incident, stating that the incident fell within the jurisdiction of the National Security Court to which he therefore transferred the file.

The Court noted that the Schwerin public prosecutor's office had decided to drop the prosecution on the ground that the police officers had fired in lawful self-defence and Grams had committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. In arriving at that conclusion, the public prosecutor's office had relied on a 210-page report (Abschlu\u03b2vermerk) in which the special unit responsible for the investigation of the case had set out its findings. What is interesting in this example \u2013 and it will be noted in passing that the application was not even communicated to the Government \u2013 is that the investigation was conducted not by a judicial body but by a special unit, that is to say a purely administrative body.",
