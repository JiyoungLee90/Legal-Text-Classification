Their machine guns had been equipped with silencers used by security forces. The armed men had moved freely around Urus-Martan past curfew; on their way to the centre of Urus-Martan they must have passed two military checkpoints. The authorities had taken no measures to find and arrest the perpetrators.

It was doubtful that the prints of running shoes seen by the first and second applicants had been left by Akhmed Shaipov, because some of the perpetrators had worn running shoes as well and that type of shoe had been quite popular among Urus-Martan residents. Moreover, State agents on a mission could not wear running shoes because that would be a breach of military rules on dress-code; accordingly, the kidnappers were not federal servicemen. They further contended that the investigation into the incident was pending, that there was no evidence that the armed men had been State agents and that there were therefore no grounds for holding the State liable for the alleged violations of the applicants\u2019 rights. They further pointed out that groups of Ukrainian, Belorussian and ethnic Russian mercenaries had committed crimes in the territory of the  and emphasised that the fact that the perpetrators had Slavic features and spoke Russian did not prove their attachment to the Russian military. They also observed that a considerable number of armaments had been stolen by illegal armed groups from Russian arsenals in the 1990s and that anyone could purchase masks and camouflage uniforms. In sum, the Government insisted that involvement of State agents in Akhmed Shaipov\u2019s kidnapping had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt.",

The applicants submitted that the kidnappers had been armed, spoke Russian and wore camouflage uniforms. It was not alleged that they had used military vehicles, such as armoured personnel carriers. The mere fact that the armed men\u2019s machine guns were equipped with silencers does not necessarily prove that the men were State servicemen. The camouflage uniform that they were wearing bore none of the insignia that should normally appear on uniforms of State agents. It appears that silencers and camouflage uniforms with no insignia could have been obtained by persons not belonging to the military via various, possibly illegal channels. According to the applicants, the perpetrators spoke Russian fluently; however, lack of accent does not necessarily show that they were Russian servicemen. Some of the kidnappers wore running shoes, which do not normally form part of the regular uniform of any Russian law enforcement agencies. There are no witness statements confirming that Akhmed Shaipov was seen being brought to the military commander\u2019s office or any other State agency after his abduction. The applicants\u2019 assertion that they identified footprints from their relative\u2019s running shoes and followed them to the centre of Urus-Martan has been rather vague and unsubstantiated. The Court is not persuaded that the first and second applicants could so easily identify with a naked eye the footprints left by a pair of running shoes with no distinctive marks. Furthermore, given that the perpetrators used no vehicles and walked, they could have moved around the town unbeknownst to servicemen at military checkpoints with greater ease than, for example, groups of armed men riding in an armoured personnel carrier. Accordingly, the information at the Court\u2019s disposal does not suffice to establish that the perpetrators belonged to the security forces or that a security operation had been carried out in respect of Akhmed Shaipov.",

The applicants informed the investigating authorities that Akhmed Shaipov had been kidnapped by a large group of unknown armed men. Given a considerable number of reported enforced disappearances of persons in the  and enduring confrontation between illegal armed groups and federal troops in the region in the early 2000s, the Court considers that the disappearance of Akhmed Shaipov could be regarded as life-threatening. Furthermore, after a certain lapse of time during which no information on the fate of the missing man had been received, both the applicants and investigators could have presumed that he had been deprived of his life at the hands of the kidnappers. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the State authorities were under a positive obligation to investigate the crime in question.",

Such a delay per se was liable to affect the investigation into the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. Furthermore, it transpires from the documents submitted to the Court that at least several investigative measures were unreasonably delayed (see paragraphs 42 and 51 above). Moreover, it remains unclear whether they have ever been taken at all. It is obvious that these measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",
