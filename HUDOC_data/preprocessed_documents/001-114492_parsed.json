The matter appears to be regulated in both primary and delegated legislation. In addition, in two States (Sweden and ) access to such products appears to be possible despite the absence of specific rules. Five States (Albania, Cyprus, Moldova, Montenegro and ) appear not to have in place rules allowing access to unauthorised medicinal products outside clinical trials. However, in two of those (Albania and ) domestic law appears to contain somewhat unclear provisions, which could be interpreted as allowing access. At the same time, there is a variety of practices among States as regards the type of access provided and the procedure to be followed. For instance, it appears that in four States (Croatia, Lithuania, Poland and ), access to unauthorised medicinal products is possible only if those products have been authorised in another jurisdiction. Seven States appear to allow access only for individual patients, and fifteen States allow access for both individual patients and groups (or cohorts). The procedures for individuals and groups tend to vary, with the conditions attaching to group access being more stringent.",

Rutherford, 442 U.S. 544 (1979), the United States Supreme Court unanimously dismissed a request by terminally ill cancer patients to enjoin the authorities from interfering with the distribution of an unlicensed drug. The court held that the statutory scheme governing drug licensing did not contain an implicit exemption for drugs intended for use by the terminally ill. In its view, the safety and effectiveness standards laid down in the legislation applied equally to such drugs, because the legislature could be regarded as intending to protect terminal patients from ineffectual or unsafe drugs. For such patients, as for anyone else, a drug was unsafe if its potential to cause death or physical injury was not offset by the possibility of therapeutic benefit. In relation to terminally ill people, unlicensed drugs carried a further risk, namely that the individuals concerned might eschew conventional therapy in favour of a drug with no demonstrable curative properties, with potentially irreversible consequences. In that connection the court noted, on the basis of expert evidence presented to it, that with diseases such as cancer it was often impossible to identify a patient as terminally ill other than in retrospect. It went on to say that acceptance of the proposition that statutory safety and efficacy standards have no relevance for terminal patients would be tantamount to denying the authorities\u2019 power to regulate any drugs, however toxic or ineffective, for such individuals, which would allow abusive marketing of many purportedly simple and painless cures. Lastly, the court observed that its ruling did not exclude all resort to experimental cancer drugs by patients for whom conventional therapy was inefficacious, because the statutory scheme exempted from pre-marketing approval drugs intended solely for investigative use if they satisfied certain pre-clinical testing and other criteria.",

The Master of the Rolls, as he then was, Sir Thomas Bingham, made two general comments. He firstly pointed out that the case involved the life of a young patient, which was a fact which had to dominate all consideration of all aspects of the case, because British society was one in which a very high value was put on human life and no decision affecting human life could be regarded with other than the greatest seriousness. He secondly observed that the courts were not arbiters as to the merits of cases of that kind, because if they expressed opinions as to the likelihood of the effectiveness of medical treatment, or as to the merits of medical judgment, they would be straying far from their domain. He went on to say that difficult and agonising judgments had to be made as to how a limited budget was best allocated to the maximum advantage of the maximum number of patients. That was not a judgment which a court could make.",

The High Court of Justice (Family Division) allowed the applications, holding, among other things, that the lack of an alternative treatment for the incurable disease meant that it was reasonable to use an experimental treatment that presented no significant risk to the patient. The President of the Family Division, Dame Elizabeth ButlerSloss, observed that the treatment was an untried one, and that until then there had been no validation of experimental work done abroad. However, she went on to say that if one waited for full certainty in experimental treatments, no innovative work such as the use of penicillin or heart transplant surgery would ever have been attempted. Referring to, inter alia, Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention and \u201ca very strong presumption in favour of a course of action which will prolong life\u201d, and having regard to the patients\u2019 prospects with and without treatment and the fact that no alternative treatment was available, she concluded that it was in their best interest that the treatment should be carried out.

First, the authorities\u2019 refusal to allow the applicants access to the unauthorised medicinal product that they wished to have administered did not affect other individuals, such as their heirs.

However, this criterion cannot be applied in a rigid, mechanical and inflexible way throughout the proceedings (see, as a recent authority, OAO Neftyanaya kompaniya YUKOS v.  (dec.), no. 14902/04, \u00a7 441, 29\u00a0January 2009). The Court\u2019s approach to cases introduced by applicants themselves and only continued by their relatives after their deaths differs from its approach to cases in which the application has been lodged after the death of the direct victim (see Fairfield and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), 24790/04, 8 March 2005; Bi\u00e7 and Others v. Turkey, no. 55955/00, \u00a7\u00a020, 2 February 2006; Direk\u00e7i v. Turkey (dec.), no. 47826/99, 3 October 2006; Gr\u0103dinar v.

Bulgaria (dec.), no. 9035/06, \u00a7 52, 19 June 2012). Moreover, the transferability or otherwise of the applicant\u2019s claim is not always decisive, for it is not only material interests which the successors of deceased applicants may pursue by their wish to maintain the application (see Capital Bank AD v. , no. 49429/99, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2005XII (extracts)). Cases before the Court generally also have a moral or principled dimension, and persons close to an applicant may thus have a legitimate interest in obtaining a ruling even after that applicant\u2019s death (see Malhous, cited above). This is particularly true in the present case, for two reasons. First, it concerns the application of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention system. Secondly, its subject matter is closely connected with the four applicants\u2019 deaths. In these circumstances, it would be contrary to the Court\u2019s mission to refrain from ruling on the complaints raised by the deceased applicants just because they did not, owing to their serious diseases, have the strength or the time to await the outcome of the proceedings before it.",

First, the requirements laid down in the applicable regulations were vague. Secondly, because of the absence from Regulations no. 2 of provisions dealing with the possibility of judicial review, and of any caselaw under that regulation or under the regulations that preceded it, it was unclear which would be the competent court, and even whether the courts would consider the Agency\u2019s pronouncements to be administrative decisions subject to judicial review. Thirdly, there was no guarantee that the applicants would be able to obtain unbiased expert opinions. The impossibility of securing objective opinions by medical experts was a systemic problem in , as illustrated by a number of cases concerning medical negligence and reports in the press. Fourthly, all those procedural uncertainties made it very likely that any legal challenges brought by the applicants would not have been determined before their deaths. In support of that assertion the applicants pointed to several cases in which proceedings brought by patients in connection with the State\u2019s failure to provide them with medicines had been marred by delays and had dragged on for years; in some of those cases the claimants had died long before the courts had dealt with their claims. As regards proceedings concerning challenges to statutory instruments, their average duration was two years. Fifthly, the regulations in issue were not contrary to Bulgarian law, and thus could be challenged only on Convention grounds. However, as was evident from their caselaw, the Bulgarian courts were likely to take into account Conventionrelated arguments only if they were based on clear and consistent caselaw of this Court in relation to , which was not the case. There was an abundance of Bulgarian judicial decisions which had given short shrift to Conventionbased arguments. In sum, the prospect of a national court providing redress to the applicants before their deaths was illusory. Nor could they realistically hope to obtain from the authorities a different decision under newly issued Regulations no. 10, which likewise required that the medicinal product in issue be authorised in another country.",

Under the express terms of that Regulation, and of the Regulations that preceded and superseded it, medicinal products which had not been authorised in another country \u2013 which was the case here\u00a0\u2013 could not exceptionally be permitted for use in  (see paragraphs 26, 27 and 31 above). It has not been disputed that in his decisions in respect of each of the applicants the Agency\u2019s Director applied that provision correctly; this is confirmed by the opinion expressed by the Ombudsman of the Republic (see paragraph 16 above) and by the Government\u2019s submissions (see, mutatis mutandis, Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, \u00a7 42 in limine, ECHR 1999V; Urb\u00e1rska Obec Tren\u010dianske Biskupice v. Slovakia, no. 74258/01, \u00a7 86, 27 November 2007; Ognyan Asenov v. Bulgaria, no. 38157/04, \u00a7 32, 17 February 2011; and Valkov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 2033/04, 19125/04, 19475/04, 19490/04, 19495/04, 19497/04, 24729/04, 171/05 and 2041/05, \u00a7 72, 25\u00a0October 2011). As regards the possibility of relying on the direct application of European Union law, the Court takes note of the examples cited by the Government in which the Bulgarian courts relied on that law to set aside administrative decisions (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). However, the Court observes that, as evident from the terms of its relevant provisions, European Union law enables, but does not require, the Union\u2019s member States to allow \u201ccompassionate use\u201d of unauthorised medicinal products (see paragraphs 4551 above). There is therefore no basis on which to argue that the Director\u2019s decisions were in breach of that law. Lastly, the Court is not persuaded that the applicants could have successfully challenged those decisions on the strength of Conventionbased arguments. It takes note of the examples cited by the Government in which the Bulgarian courts relied on the Convention and the Court\u2019s caselaw to set aside administrative decisions, or to hold that they had jurisdiction to review such decisions (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above). However, it cannot be overlooked that in all those examples the Bulgarian courts based their decisions on established caselaw of this Court, whereas there is to date no firm basis in the Court\u2019s caselaw on which to hold that impossibility of access to unauthorised medicinal products on a \u201ccompassionate use\u201d basis is in breach of the Convention. The issue is novel and not free from doubt. The Court is mindful that its role is intended to be subsidiary to that of national systems safeguarding human rights, and that the national courts should normally have the initial opportunity to determine whether domestic law is compatible with the Convention (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2008...). However, it considers that the examples cited by the Government cannot lead to the conclusion that in the specific circumstances of this case a domestic legal challenge based on Conventionrelated arguments would have had a reasonable prospect of success (see, mutatis mutandis, Slavgorodski v. Estonia (dec.), no.\u00a037043/97, 9 March 1999, and Odi\u00e8vre v. France [GC], no. 42326/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a021 and 23, ECHR 2003III). The Court also notes that, by the Government\u2019s own admission, the Bulgarian courts have never dealt with the use of unauthorised medicinal products; it appears that since 1995, when the Minister of Health laid down regulations on this matter for the first time, no cases have been reported under those regulations (see paragraph 34 above).",

All individuals in Bulgaria who, like the applicants, had cancer which was terminal and which was no longer responding to conventional treatment, were being denied access to experimental medicinal products. In the applicants\u2019 case, this was not justified by lack of budgetary resources, because the company which had developed the product was willing to provide it free of charge.

The manner in which a person chose to live, even if that choice could entail harmful consequences, was part of that person\u2019s private life. The refusals had been of a blanket nature, not taking into account the specifics of each case. They had been based on inadequate legal provisions which did not permit an individualised assessment, and did not correspond to a pressing social need. They had not been intended to protect the applicants\u2019 lives, because all of them were terminally ill and, without recourse to some new medicinal product, had only a short span of life left. In that connection, it had to be borne in mind that the exception sought would simply have given the applicants a chance to prolong their lives, and would not have shielded anyone else from criminal liability.

Such regulations exist and have recently been updated (see paragraphs 2332 above). The applicants rather take issue with the terms of those regulations, arguing that they are overly restrictive. However, in the Court\u2019s view Article 2 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as requiring access to unauthorised medicinal products for the terminally ill to be regulated in a particular way.

In considering whether a treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d, the Court will have regard to whether its object was to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3 (see, among other auhtorities, Wainwright v. the , no. 12350/04, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2006X).",

It may be described in general terms as imposing a primarily negative obligation on States to refrain from inflicting serious harm on persons within their jurisdiction. However, in view of the fundamental importance of Article 3, the Court has reserved to itself sufficient flexibility to address its application in other situations (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, \u00a7 50, ECHR\u00a02002III). For instance, suffering which flows from a naturally occurring illness may be covered by Article 3 where it is, or risks being, exacerbated by treatment stemming from measures for which the authorities can be held responsible (see N. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 26565/05, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2008...).

This complaint clearly falls to be examined under Article 8, whose interpretation, so far as the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d is concerned, is underpinned by the notions of personal autonomy and quality of life (see Pretty, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61 in fine and 65, and Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, \u00a7 90, ECHR\u00a02002VI).

The central issue in the case may be seen as either a curtailment of the applicants\u2019 choice of medical treatment, to be analysed as an interference with their right to respect for their private life (compare, mutatis mutandis, Pretty, cited above, \u00a7 67; A, B and C v. Ireland, cited above \u00a7 216; and S.H. and Others v.\u00a0Austria, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 8588), or as an allegation of a failure on the part of the State to provide an appropriate regulatory framework securing the rights of persons in the applicants\u2019 situation, to be analysed in terms of the State\u2019s positive duty to ensure respect for their private life (compare, mutatis mutandis, Christine Goodwin, \u00a7 71; Tysi\u0105c, \u00a7\u00a7 10708; Haas, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05253; A, B and C v.

Although the boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition, the applicable principles are similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole (see, among other authorities, Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1990, \u00a7 41, Series\u00a0A no. 172; Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2007I; and Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 2007V).

A number of factors must be taken into account. Where a particularly important facet of an individual\u2019s existence or identity is at stake, the margin will normally be restricted. Where, however, there is no consensus within the Contracting States, either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, particularly where the case raises sensitive moral or ethical issues, the margin will be wider.

However, the analysis cannot stop there. When it comes to experimental medicinal products, it is in the nature of things that their quality, efficacy and safety are open to doubt. The applicants do not deny this. They rather seek to argue that because of the dire prognosis attaching to their medical condition, they should have been allowed to assume the risks attendant on a potentially lifesaving experimental product. Framed in these terms, the applicants\u2019 interest is of a different nature. It may be described as the freedom to opt, as a measure of last resort, for an untested treatment which may carry risks but which the applicants and their doctors consider appropriate to their circumstances, in an attempt to save their lives.",

Firstly, to protect them, in view of their vulnerable state and the lack of clear data on the potential risks and benefits of experimental treatments, against a course of action which may prove harmful to their own health and life, their terminal condition notwithstanding (see, mutatis mutandis, Haas, cited above, \u00a7 54). The Court notes in this connection that it has emphasised, albeit in a different context, the importance of informed consent to medical procedures (see V.C. v.\u00a0Slovakia, no. 18968/07, \u00a7\u00a7 10717 and 152, ECHR 2011... (extracts), and N.B. v. Slovakia, no. 29518/10, \u00a7\u00a7 7678 and 96, 12 June 2012).

Thirdly, to ensure that the development of new medicinal products is not compromised by, for instance, diminished patient participation in clinical trials. All those interests are related to the rights guaranteed under Articles 2, 3 and 8 the Convention, the first very specifically and the second and third more generally. Moreover, balancing them against the applicants\u2019 interest touches upon complex ethical and risk-assessment issues, against a background of fast-moving medical and scientific developments.",

They have, however, made this option subject to conditions of varying strictness (see paragraphs 5455 above). On that basis, and on the basis of the manner in which the issue is regulated in the law of the European Union (see paragraphs 4451 above), the Court concludes that there is now a clear trend in the Contracting States towards allowing, under certain exceptional conditions, the use of unauthorised medicinal products. However, that emerging consensus is not based on settled principles in the law of the Contracting States. Nor does it appear to extend to the precise manner in which that use should be regulated.",

That was apparently the main reason for the refusals by the Medicines Executive Agency in the applicants\u2019 cases (see paragraph 14 above). Such a solution tilts the balance between potential therapeutic benefit and medicine risk avoidance decisively in favour of the latter, because medicinal products authorised in another country are likely already to have been subjected to comprehensive safety and efficacy testing. At the same time, this solution leaves products which are still in the various stages of development entirely inaccessible. In view of the authorities\u2019 broad margin of appreciation in this domain, the Court considers that\u00a0regulatory solution did not fell foul of Article 8. It is not for an international court to determine in place of the competent national authorities the acceptable level of risk in such circumstances. The salient question in terms of Article\u00a08 is not whether a different solution might have struck a fairer balance, but whether, in striking the balance at the point at which they did, the Bulgarian authorities exceeded the wide margin of appreciation afforded to them (see, mutatis mutandis, Evans, \u00a7 91, and S.H. and Others v.

However, in this regard the State authorities have a margin of appreciation in deciding whether or not to undertake regulatory functions in relation to individual patients\u2019 treatment (see paragraphs 45, 49, 50, 51 and 5455). The extent to which the implementation of the national secondary legislation fulfilled the intended purposes of such functions is highly questionable. The fact remains that these regulations did not require any analysis or consultation for the purposes of quality control of the product requested and the risk/benefit test normally involved in the process of authorisation. In this regard, these regulations served to restrict the meeting of individual needs concerning the \u201cexceptional use of unauthorised products\u201d only to \u201calready authorised\u201d ones (see paragraph 125 of the judgment), thus rendering meaningless the \u201cexceptional\u201d nature of such permission.

I am not prepared to accept that fifty years after the thalidomide tragedy, which triggered the requirement for stricter State regulation, this responsibility may be interpreted as involving some \u201cwide margin of appreciation\u201d as to how to avoid discharging it. Unlike the dissenting minority, I consider that this is a question of the lawfulness of the purpose of the restrictions which appear to have been imposed, instead of the promised proactive functions in the interests of safe medical services, and not a question of the authorities\u2019 \u201cmargin of appreciation\u201d in striking the requisite balance between the allegedly competing public and individual interests in obtaining such services.

In this regard, it cannot be overlooked that the applicants\u2019 condition rendered them eligible for the compassionate use of morphine \u2013 a substance whose distribution is not only unauthorised, but also criminalised. It was not argued that the new product to which the applicants sought access was more dangerous or less effective than morphine. I mention this fact as it cannot be overlooked that the State\u2019s functions relating to the authorisation of medicinal products involve a distinction of different levels of authorisation for the use of medicinal products for different purposes. I will not make any contribution to pharmaceutical or medical science in noting that some products, including poisons, are never authorised for market distribution, whereas their use is legitimate and authorised for specific medical purposes. Thus, even the thalidomide tragedy, which triggered the introduction of stricter controls on the distribution of medicinal products on the market, did not result in the \u201cprohibition\u201d of that product, but in its limited use, which is currently authorised for specific patients. Regrettably, the distinction of authorised use for different purposes, such as market distribution, prescribed use, off-label individual treatment or compassionate individual use, was neither reflected in the applicable secondary legislation nor taken into consideration by the majority in their analysis of the proportionality or necessity of the automatic refusal with which the applicants were confronted, despite the already approved use of the experimental product for specific purposes in other countries. Lastly, it appears that the impugned refusals served neither to inform the applicants of any risk to life or of any degrading experiments which the treatment requested might entail, nor to prevent such treatment. In fact, some of the applicants availed themselves of the product in question outside the territory over which the national authorities exercised jurisdiction.

They are fully aware of the risks which go with this treatment. The treatment is not available in Bulgaria, and, although it has been offered for free by the Canadian company, the participation of Bulgarian medical institutions and Bulgarian doctors is nevertheless required for it to be administered in .

Indeed, as correctly pointed out in paragraph 116 of the judgment, the very notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d implies a degree of personal autonomy coupled with an assessment of the quality of life in a specific situation. I also agree that matters of health care policy are, in principle, within the margin of appreciation of the domestic authorities, who are best placed to assess priorities, use of resources and social needs (see paragraph 119 of the judgment). However, the issue in the present case is a considerably narrower one, and does not involve the allocation of resources. No financial considerations or imperatives were involved. The applicants were not calling upon the State to pay for this treatment (contrast, among others, Wiater v. Poland (dec.), no. 42290/08, \u00a7 33, 15 May 2010). They were simply asking for the State to \u201cget out of the way\u201d and allow them access to an experimental product which would be provided to them free of charge. In the instant case, therefore, the Court should have determined the applicable margin of appreciation by reference to factors that are more specific to the situation at hand (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, \u00a7 103, ECHR 2003VIII, where the Court said that a conflict of views on the margin of appreciation can be resolved only by reference to the context of a particular case), and in particular to the applicants\u2019 critical medical condition and the available prognosis.",

In my view, in the case of the applicants \u2013 terminally ill patients \u2013 this generalised solution is unnecessarily restrictive and exceeds the State\u2019s margin of appreciation in this domain, for two reasons. The first reason concerns the manner in which the solution was arrived at (see, mutatis mutandis, Hatton and Others, cited above, \u00a7 99). There is no evidence that when adopting the regulations at issue, or those that succeeded them, the Minister of Health sought to weigh the competing interests or to assess the proportionality of the restriction (see, mutatis mutandis, Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, \u00a7\u00a083\u00a0in\u00a0limine, ECHR 2007V) by, for instance, carrying out a public consultation process (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Hatton and Others, cited above, \u00a7 128). Moreover, since the bar on access to unauthorised medicinal products which have not been authorised in another country was not embodied in primary legislation, the various competing interests were never weighed, nor were issues of proportionality ever assessed, by the legislature (see, mutatis mutandis, Dickson, \u00a7 83, cited above, and contrast Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2007I).

It is an unfortunate fact of life in the modern world that the development of new medicinal products is a complex endeavour facing scientific, financial and regulatory hurdles, and as a rule taking many years to complete. As a result, terminally ill patients often do not have the time to await the full testing and authorisation of new medicines which may help them mitigate or defeat their disease. A number of , as well as other States and the European Union, are apparently alive to this problem and have for this reason made provision for early access to experimental products which have not yet obtained regulatory approval (see paragraphs 45, 4951 and\u00a05458 of the judgment). It is true that the specific way in which such access is being provided varies among countries. However, it appears that in many of them it embraces products which have not obtained regulatory approval anywhere and are in this sense truly new and experimental. The development of new medicinal products is a field which is constantly impacted by scientific developments and advances in technology. By denying the applicants \u2013 terminally ill patients \u2013 any access to those developments, the Bulgarian authorities effectively disregarded completely their very strong interest in having the opportunity to try treatment which, although involving acceptance of additional uncertainty as to risk, may prove to be the only remaining opportunity for them to attempt to save their lives.",

They could additionally insist that medical practitioners who propose to treat terminally ill patients with an unauthorised product explain in detail the known and unknown risks, so as to allow those patients to make truly informed decisions. They could also require that the use of unauthorised products does not obstruct clinical trials of those products, and remains an option of last resort.

Naturally, the State cannot be required to grant access to such medicines without a regulatory framework. But this framework must allow for a proper balancing exercise of the interests involved. In the present case, however, there is no indication that such an exercise was undertaken, and in fact nowhere does the judgment conclude that the State struck a fair balance. The near uniformity of the reasons given by the Director of the Medicines Executive Agency for rejecting each of the applicants\u2019 requests indicates that those refusals did not flow from relevant considerations, but were entirely based on the blanket prohibition on the compassionate use of products not authorised in other countries.
