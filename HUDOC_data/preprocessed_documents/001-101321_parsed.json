On 22 December 2001 the applicant and an acquaintance, G., stopped a taxi and asked the driver, L., to take them to a destination out of town. According to the applicant, they were planning a robbery and carjacking. The applicant had a knife hidden in his sleeve, which he had prepared in advance, and G. had a rope with him. Once the car reached a forest, the applicant and G. ordered the driver to stop. G. put the rope around the driver's throat while the applicant threatened him with the knife. The applicant got into the driver's seat and drove further into the forest, where they removed L., unconscious by that time, from the car. Later in December\u00a02001 the dead body of L. was found in the forest with multiple stab wounds.",

As to the applicant's guilt, the court based its findings on the confession he had given at the initial stages of the pre-trial investigation, the testimony given by G. during the pre-trial investigation (although retracted by him at the trial as untruthful), according to which the applicant had stabbed L. once, and the testimony of several persons to whom the defendants had tried to sell L.'s car. The court examined the applicant's allegation of ill-treatment and found it to be no more than defence tactics. The police officer responsible for the applicant's arrest was questioned at the hearing and denied having coerced him in any way.

He maintained his allegation of coercion by the police, which he believed had not received due examination by the courts during his trial; the applicant submitted that the trial court had confined itself to questioning the police officer involved, who had denied any coercion. The court had also relied heavily on the prosecutor's refusal to institute criminal proceedings in the matter, and had not verified the thoroughness of the investigation and the accuracy of its findings. As to the weight given to the confession the applicant had made at the initial stages of his detention, he insisted that it had been an essential foundation of his conviction, the only additional evidence being the allegedly inconsistent statements of his co-defendant, in the absence of any direct witnesses or material evidence.",

Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time.

Having regard to the facts of this case, namely, the discovery of both the victim's dead body and his stolen car prior to the applicant's arrest (see paragraphs 6-7 above), the Court considers that at the time of the arrest the investigator had every reason to suspect the applicant of premeditated murder for profit, punishable either by a fixed term of imprisonment or life imprisonment, and thus warranting his obligatory legal representation. Accordingly, the Court does not rule out that, as argued by the applicant, the charges against him were artificially mitigated at that stage with a view to circumventing that legal safeguard. The Court is also mindful of the specificity of the aforementioned ground for obligatory legal representation, which the applicant could hardly have been expected to rely on, since any aggravation of the charges against him would obviously have run counter to his interests. This circumstance demonstrates the vulnerability of the applicant's position and his real need for legal assistance, which was effectively denied because of the way in which the investigator exercised his discretionary power in classifying the crime being investigated (see and compare with Yaremenko v. , no. 32092/02, \u00a7 88, 12 June 2008).",

That waiver cannot therefore be considered as having been attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance.

Although he later retracted this confession, the trial courts relied on it as grounds for their finding of his guilt. It is to be underlined that the extent to which the applicant's initial confession affected his conviction is of no importance. That it irretrievably prejudiced the right of defence is presumed once it is established that it had some bearing on the conviction. While not being the sole basis for the applicant's conviction in the present case, the impugned confession undoubtedly influenced it and was relied on by the courts. It is not for the Court to speculate on what the applicant's reaction or his lawyer's advice would have been had he had access to a lawyer at the initial stage of the proceedings. It considers that, in view of the circumstances, both the safeguards envisaged by the national legislation and the guarantee of fairness enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention required that the applicant should have the benefit of the assistance of a lawyer from the very first stage of police questioning. This did not happen. Moreover, the early restrictions on the applicant's defence right, although having been pointed out by him in the appeal in cassation to the Supreme Court (see paragraph 19 above) and amounting under the domestic criminal procedural legislation to a gross violation calling for a quashing of the verdict (see paragraph 33 above), were ignored by the domestic courts. Nor could this deficiency be remedied by the subsequent legal assistance provided to the applicant, or by the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058, and P\u0142onka v.
