The Court reiterates that recourse to physical force against a person\u00a0which \u00a0has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3. Such a \u201cstrict proportionality\u201d approach has also been taken by the Court in respect of a situation where an individual is already under the full control of the police (see, among others, Klaas v.\u00a0Germany, 22\u00a0September 1993, \u00a7\u00a030, Series A no.\u00a0269; Rehbock v.\u00a0Slovenia, no.\u00a029462/95, \u00a7\u00a7 68-78, ECHR 2000-XII; and Milan c.\u00a0, no.7549/03, 24\u00a0January 2008, \u00a7\u00a068). In this connection, the Court notes that according to the case file material the version of events advanced by the police had never been thoroughly checked from the viewpoint of proportionality and the absolute necessity of the application of force. Furthermore, as submitted by the applicant, such a version of events did not match the ultimate findings of the domestic authorities as to the date of his arrest. Accepting the fact of the applicant's arrest on 10 July 1999, the domestic authorities failed to explain why the withdrawal of items prohibited in detention facilities, which would normally be made upon a detainee's arrival, had been conducted in respect of Mr Lopatin only three days later.",

The investigation did not question the alleged perpetrator G., who, as according to the police, had had a fight with the applicant. Nor did the investigation explain the nature of the injuries on the applicant's wrists and hips, which, according to the forensic report, could have been caused by handcuffs and a truncheon respectively, which hardly corresponds to the explanation of a fight between cellmates.",

The absence of a record of such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee, the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible with the requirement of lawfulness and with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Fedotov v.
