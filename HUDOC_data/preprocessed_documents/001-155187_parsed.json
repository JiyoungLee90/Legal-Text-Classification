In addition, local communities are not considered to be units of local government, but groups of citizens gathered with the aim to of interacting within their immediate area and providing public services in the interest of that community. The Council of the local community was in charge of managing the services needed, while the local community as such was in charge of administrative and financial affairs. With regard to the above-stated, the Government referred solely to a statement of the President of the Sokobanja municipality, who had also held that the financial responsibility of the local communities and liability for their debts was not regulated by the laws on local self-government, and that therefore neither the municipality nor the State could be held liable for such debts.",

Russia (dec.), no. 25867/02, 31 May 2007). In cases of execution of a final court decision rendered against private actors, the State\u2019s obligations to execute a judgment under Article 6 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are, as a general rule, limited to providing the necessary assistance to the creditor in enforcing the relevant court awards, and cannot be interpreted as compelling the State to substitute itself for a private defendant in the event of the latter\u2019s insolvency (see, for example, Kotov v. Russia [GC], no.\u00a054522/00, \u00a7 90, 3 April 2012, and Omerovi\u0107 v. Croatia, no.\u00a036071/03, \u00a7\u00a035, 1 June 2006). In contrast, where a judgment is against the State, its bodies, or equivalent entities that also do not enjoy \u201csufficient institutional and operational independence from the State\u201d, the State must take the initiative to enforce the judgment fully and in due time. The State is directly liable for their debts and cannot cite either the lack of its own funds or the indigence of the debtor as an excuse for the non-enforcement of those decisions (see, among many authorities, R.

The Government have not advanced any other fact, nor have they documented their arguments with relevant regulations or statutes from the relevant period capable of persuading the Court to conclude to the contrary or to depart from its above-mentioned well-established case-law in respect of the attribution of municipal debts to the State. Contrary to the Government\u2019s submission, the legal status of the local communities as separate legal entities cannot be decisive on its own for the exercise of attribution (see, mutatis mutandis, R.

Further, he should have been expected to lodge his application with the Court (a) six months after the date the central Bank had had to enforce the judgment in 2003 (see paragraph 15 above); (b) six months after the ratification date; or at the latest, (c) six months after he learned, in June 2006, that the debtor\u2019s bank account had been frozen (see paragraph 16 above). However, he failed to take any of these steps. The second applicant also failed to initiate a new set of civil proceedings pursuant to the instruction of the Commercial Court (see paragraph 31 above). That being said, and arguing that the alleged violations do not constitute continuing situations, the Government invited the Court to reject the first application for non-observance of the six-month rule and/or both applications for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies available to them.",
