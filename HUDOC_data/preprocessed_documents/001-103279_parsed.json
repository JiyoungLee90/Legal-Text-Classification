The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision (see Ruiz Torija v. Spain, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 303-A, \u00a7 29). Even though a domestic court has a certain margin of appreciation when choosing arguments in a particular case and admitting evidence in support of the parties' submissions, an authority is obliged to justify its activities by giving reasons for its decisions (see Suominen v. Finland, no. 37801/97, \u00a7 36, 1 July 2003). A further function of a reasoned decision is to demonstrate to the parties that they have been heard. Moreover, a reasoned decision affords a party the opportunity to appeal against it, as well as the opportunity to have the decision reviewed by an appellate body. It is only by giving a reasoned decision that there can be public scrutiny of the administration of justice (see Hirvisaari v. Finland, no. 49684/99, \u00a7 30, 27 September 2001).",

The Court of Appeal did not elaborate on the fact that, while Article 119 referred to the works done at one co-owner's expense and with the consent of the other coowners, in the present case the reconstruction was performed at the expense of a third party, who was given a unilateral advance promise of title to the reconstructed premises by one co-owner (the municipality) against the will of the others.
