                        "content": "Fourthly, as found by the majority (see \u00a7\u00a053), the suspicion that the applicant had committed the serious offence may initially have warranted his detention. Therefore, the only question which remains is whether and when the continuation of his detention ceased to be warranted by \u201csufficient\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d reasons. The majority indicates (\u00a7 54) that once \u201cby the beginning of 1996 the trial court had heard evidence from all the defendants and obtained sufficient evidence to confirm the charge against applicant\u201d, the initial justification for detention lost its validity. I am ready to accept this general finding, but I cannot share the majority\u2019s view of the timing. It should be recalled that the main part of the trial (7 hearings) did not end until 9 July 1996. Only after that date was there no longer a risk that the applicant might influence testimonies given by the co-accused or by witnesses. As can be seen from the file, the applicant has never confessed and his wife (who was one of the co-accused in the trial), after having confessed during the initial investigation her (and his) involvement in the drug business, changed her testimony when heard by the court. Thus, as long as the evidence had not been fully presented to the trial court, there was a real risk that the applicant might attempt to interfere with the proper course of the proceedings. That is why, in my opinion, the reasons which had initially warranted the detention ceased to exist only after 9 July 1996 and not already \u201cby the beginning of 1996\u201d, as stated by the majority. The application for release was dealt with (and rejected) separately by the trial court on 9 July 1996 and, three weeks later, after hearing J.G.\u2019s appeal, the appellate court ordered his release. This sequence of events demonstrates that there was no unreasonable delay in terminating the applicant\u2019s detention.",

Once more, it should be noted that the majority does not question the reasonableness of the detention until the beginning of 1996. Since, in my opinion, the date of 9 July 1996 seems more appropriate in this respect, the alternative measures were adopted promptly afterwards: the detention was replaced by the obligation to report weekly to the police station and to surrender his passport to the court (see \u00a7 29).",

I am not convinced that such an infringement could be attributed to the domestic courts in the applicant\u2019s case. ",

I agree with most of the arguments raised in this matter by Judge Maruste. In addition, I would like to stress that Article 41 provides that just satisfaction shall be afforded \u201cif necessary\u201d. The decision concerning just satisfaction must always be taken in accordance with the particular circumstances of the case. In the present case, a decision that the finding of a violation constituted in itself sufficient just satisfaction would better correspond to the nature of the offences committed by the applicant.",
