Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 99). The inherent improbability of the theory that, while in police custody and while temporarily left alone during his interrogation by Lt. F, Mr. \u0160ari\u0161sk\u00fd would compose a suicide note and on Lt.F's return seize his pistol from his belt and use it to shoot himself in the abdomen gives serious cause to doubt that the authorities have discharged the burden imposed on them under the Convention. However, the Court does not consider that it is necessary to reach any final determination of this issue. Even if the Court were to accept that Mr\u00a0\u0160ari\u0161sk\u00fd committed suicide as alleged, it notes that the obligation to protect the health and well-being of persons in detention clearly encompasses an obligation to take reasonable measures to protect them from harming themselves (Keenan v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 97). Although there is insufficient evidence to enable the Court to find that the authorities either knew or ought to have known that Mr \u0160ari\u0161sk\u00fd was a suicide risk on the night of his death, the Court notes that there are certain basic precautions which police officers and prison officers should be expected to take in all cases in order to minimise any potential risk. First, the Court would observe that compelling reasons must be given as to why the interrogation of a suspect is entrusted to an armed police officer. For the Court, the facts of the present case disclose no justification whatsoever for allowing Lt. F. to remain in possession of his firearm during the interrogation of Mr \u0160ari\u0161sk\u00fd, a young man who had been arrested on suspicion of bicycle theft. Secondly, at the time of Mr \u0160ari\u0161sk\u00fd's death there were regulations in force which required police officers to secure their service weapons in order to avoid any \u201cundesired consequences\u201d. The\u00a0domestic courts held that Lt. F's failure properly to secure his service weapon amounted to negligence which resulted in the death of Mr \u0160ari\u0161sk\u00fd. Consequently, the Court finds that even if Mr \u0160ari\u0161sk\u00fd committed suicide in the manner described by the Government and the investigative authorities, the authorities were in violation of their obligation to take reasonable measures to protect his health and well-being while he was in police custody.",

This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy providing a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (see, for example, Salman, cited above, \u00a7 106; Tanr\u0131kulu v.

If the investigators had brought the necessary equipment to the police station, samples of gunpowder residue could have been taken from Lt. F.'s hands in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. If such samples had been taken, it might have been possible either to exclude or confirm that he pulled the trigger. Instead, samples were not taken until the following day. Although the Government submitted that Lt. F. remained under the supervision of a police guard until the samples were taken, the Court has concerns about the independence of the guard, who was most likely a police officer from Lt. F.'s department (see paragraph 98). Consequently, the result of the gunpowder residue test cannot be relied on. Although a ballistics test later confirmed that Mr \u0160ari\u0161sk\u00fd \u201cmost probably\u201d shot himself, if conducted properly the gunpowder residue test could have been conclusive. Thus, there was a failure by the investigators to take reasonable steps to secure evidence concerning the incident which in turn undermined the ability of the investigation to determine beyond any doubt who was responsible for Mr \u0160ari\u0161sk\u00fd's death.",

Discrimination on account of, inter alia, a person's ethnic origin is a form of racial discrimination. Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy's vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment (Nachova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a0145, ECHR 2005-...; and Timishev v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, \u00a7\u00a056, ECHR 2005-...).

The Court adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties' submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.

The Court has held that when investigating violent incidents and, in particular, deaths at the hands of State agents, State authorities have the additional duty to take all reasonable steps to unmask any racist motive and to establish whether or not ethnic hatred or prejudice may have played a role in the events. Failing to do so and treating racially induced violence and brutality on an equal footing with cases that have no racist overtones would be to turn a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention (see,\u00a0mutatis mutandis, Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2000-IV). In order to maintain public confidence in their law enforcement machinery, Contracting States must ensure that in the investigation of incidents involving the use of force a distinction is made both in their legal systems and in practice between cases of excessive use of force and of racist killing (Nachova and Others v.

Thus, the authorities were, in my view, under the obligation to conduct an investigation as to whether racist motives played a part in Mr. L'ubom\u00edr \u0160ari\u0161sk\u00fd's death.
