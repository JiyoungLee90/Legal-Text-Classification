That Office carried out a inquiry, in the course of which it took statements from the applicant, her former husband, and their two daughters.

It also observed that in both Karlukovo and Byala acute and chronic patients were not duly separated (paragraph 142). Concern was also expressed about the low number of staff present in the wards, especially at night, which increased the risk of interpatient violence (paragraphs 129 and 145).",

Bulgaria, no. 54659/00, \u00a7 93, 6 March 2008). However, Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation), as in certain instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting allegations. A failure on their part to submit such information without a satisfactory explanation may therefore give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the wellfoundedness of the applicant's allegations (see Timurta\u015f v.

In the proceedings before it, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or predetermined formulae for its assessment. The Court adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties' submissions.

She did not submit statements by codetainees (contrast Khudoyorov, \u00a7\u00a7 71 and 113, and Gavazov, \u00a7\u00a7 59 and 94, both cited above), or by other persons who might possess relevant information, such as the friend who visited her less than a month after her admission in the hospital (see paragraph 24 above).

Bulgaria, no. 47823/99, \u00a7 64, 15 December 2005 and contrast Staykov, cited above, \u00a7 41). In the specific circumstances of the case, the Court must treat the applicant's assertions with certain caution, for two reasons. Firstly, it may sometimes be unreasonable to expect mentally disturbed persons to give a detailed or coherent description of what they have experienced during their detention (see Aerts v. , 30 July 1998, \u00a7 66, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998V). Secondly, the applicant might have a tendency to exaggerate the inadequacy of the conditions in the hospital partly because she had a negative attitude towards an establishment in which she considered she should have never been detained (see B. v. the United Kingdom, no. 6870/75, Commission's report of 7 October 1981, Decisions and Reports (DR) 32, p. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 174 and 175).

Bulgaria, no. 41211/98, \u00a7 130 in limine, 2 February 2006, and Todor Todorov v.

By contrast, the report of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, which, while relating to a period which predates the applicant's stay in Radnevo by almost two years, did make specific findings in respect of that hospital (see paragraph 32 above). It identified problems with heating and hot water, with the arrangements made for drying patients' clothes, and, to a certain extent, with the quality and quantity of food (see paragraph 33 above). However, the Court is not persuaded that those matters \u2013 which are in stark contrast with the findings that the report makes in respect of one of the wards of the hospital in Karlukovo (see paragraph 34 above) and fall far short of the very serious allegations made by the applicant (see paragraph 20 above) \u2013 were sufficient for the conditions of her detention to be described as inhuman and degrading.",

Second, while in the hospital she could not consult with a lawyer and did not have pen and paper to draft a request for release. Third, the law did not lay down any procedure or timelimits for transmitting such a request from the hospital to the court.

With regard to the second of those conditions, the Court observes that the persons mentioned in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) may be deprived of their liberty in order to, inter alia, be given medical treatment, that is, not only because they are a danger to the public but also because their own interests may necessitate their detention (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, \u00a7\u00a098 in fine, Series A no. 39; Witold Litwa v. Poland, no. 26629/95, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2000III; Koniarska v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 33670/96, 12\u00a0October 2000; and Gorshkov v. Ukraine, no. 67531/01, \u00a7 37, 8\u00a0November 2005). That said, detention is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less severe, measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or the public interest (see Varbanov v. Bulgaria, no. 31365/96, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2000X). However, while the Court undoubtedly has jurisdiction to verify the fulfilment of those conditions, the logic of the system of safeguard established by the Convention places limits on the scope of this control. Since the national authorities are better placed to evaluate the evidence adduced before them, they are to be recognised as having a certain discretion in the matter and the Court's task is limited to reviewing under the Convention the decisions they have taken (see X v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 43, and Wassink v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 27 September 1990, \u00a7 25, Series A no. 185A).",

However, while the Court is competent to satisfy itself as to compliance with this law, the scope of its task in this connection is also subject to limits inherent in the logic of the European system of protection, because it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Bozano v.

On this point, the Court observes that the court examining the proposal for her compulsory confinement first heard from a psychiatric expert, who considered that she was suffering from such a disorder, but that further expert assessment was necessary for a definite conclusion. The court then ordered two medical expert reports, both of which concluded that the applicant was suffering from a mental disorder (see paragraphs 913 above). Those reports were criticised by the applicant as predominantly based on the allegations of her former husband and their daughter. However, the Court notes that before drawing up each of the two reports the experts examined the applicant in person (see paragraphs 10 and 12 above). Both levels of court specifically found that these examinations had been the decisive factor in the experts' assessment (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above). It is true that in the light of the fresh information supplied by the applicant on 16 October 2006 the firstinstance court felt that it could not unconditionally rely on the initial report and needed to obtain the opinion of other experts (see paragraph 11 above). However, these experts arrived at the same conclusions as the first one, Dr I.D. While the applicant tried to undermine their credibility, alleging that they were his subordinates, the Court observes that in reply to a question from her counsel those experts made it clear that Dr I.D. was not their direct superior (see paragraph 13 above). Moreover, it cannot be overlooked that the court eventually came to rely on both reports (see paragraph 14 above). In any event, the Court sees no reason to doubt that the experts were fully qualified and had grounded their conclusions on their best professional judgment, informed by the entirety of the relevant information. In view of these considerations, and noting that the national courts were in a far better position to assess the probative value of the expert reports and, more generally, to determine the factual issue as to whether or not the applicant was suffering from a mental disorder, the Court finds no grounds to interfere with their assessment on this point, or to impugn the appellate court's refusal to order a fresh expert report (see paragraph 16 above).",

However, provision should always be made for subsequent review to be available at reasonable intervals, in as much as the reasons initially warranting confinement may cease to exist (ibid.). Thus, persons of unsound mind detained for an indefinite or lengthy period are entitled, where there is no automatic periodic review of a judicial character, to take proceedings at reasonable intervals before a court to put in issue the lawfulness \u2013 within the meaning of the Convention \u2013 of their detention, whether it was ordered by a court or by some other authority (see X v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 52 in fine, and, more recently, Shtukaturov v.

All that was required under Article 5 \u00a7 4 in these circumstances was for her to have at her disposal the opportunity of subsequent review of the continued validity of her detention at reasonable intervals. The length of the applicant's confinement is thus of some importance, because, in the context of compulsory confinement of persons of unsound mind, the Convention organs, without specifying exactly what amount of time can be considered a \u201creasonable interval\u201d, have accepted periods of up to six and nine months and even a year (see Megyeri v. Germany, 12 May 1992, \u00a7 26, Series A no.\u00a0237A; Herczegfalvy v. Austria, 24 September 1992, \u00a7 77, Series A no.\u00a0244; X v.

By contrast, the length of the applicant's confinement was only two months. It could not be extended without a further judicial order, and if extended for more than three months it would have periodically been subject to automatic judicial review attended by the full panoply of safeguards required under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a04 (see paragraph 30 above and contrast Gorshkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 43).
