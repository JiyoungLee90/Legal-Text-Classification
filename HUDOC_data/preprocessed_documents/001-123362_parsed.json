Proceedings that can only result in the award of compensation to be paid by the State, but not in the punishment of those responsible for the ill-treatment, cannot be considered as satisfying the procedural requirement of Article 3 in cases of wilful ill-treatment of persons who are within the control of agents of the State (see Krastanov v.

In this regard, it is of importance, for instance, whether there is reason to believe that the person concerned would resist arrest or abscond, cause injury or damage, or suppress evidence (see Raninen v.

Publicity may be a relevant factor in assessing whether a treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, but the Court does not consider that absence of publicity will necessarily prevent a given treatment from falling into that category: it may well suffice that the victim is humiliated in his own eyes, even if not in the eyes of others (see Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, 25 April 1978, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 26). Application of measures of restraint to an applicant in a non-public setting may still give rise to a\u00a0violation of Article 3 in a situation where no serious risks to security could be proved to exist (see Ashot Harutyunyan v.

However, the parties agree on the ensuing nature of the restraints used on the applicant. First, one hand was shackled to an iron ring in order to prevent him, according to the Government, from kicking the door, which he had damaged. Later, as the applicant was still agitated, his other hand was also shackled to an iron ring on the opposite wall. This stretched position was later changed when the applicant\u2019s hands were secured behind his back and handcuffed to one of the iron rings. Lastly, his legs were tied with a leather strap to prevent him from kicking the cell door. This treatment lasted for about fifty minutes. As a result of his stay in the cell, the applicant sustained injuries to his back, neck, head and chest, and bruises on his wrists, which prevented him from working for sixteen days.",

The Court cannot accept the argument that the small hole which the applicant made in the cell door constituted serious damage to property, justifying the use of restraints to such an extent (see, mutatis mutandis, the European Prison Rules, paragraph 68.2). In this context, it is crucial to note that the applicant\u2019s banging on the door was not a wilful act of destruction. Rather, as noted by the Ombudsman, it was the only way in which the applicant could call for assistance, given that his access to the bell was blocked when the police officers closed the door in addition to the iron grille. Furthermore, instead of ensuring that the applicant would be subjected to the least intrusive measure available in the circumstances (see Julin v. Estonia, cited above, \u00a7 127), he was increasingly restrained: in the end, both his hands were tied behind his back and shackled to an iron ring, and his legs were tied together with a leather strap.",

Unlike in that case, however, here the restraints were applied in an environment that was already secure and were far more intrusive. The police officers in the present case, in breach of the domestic law (see paragraphs 30, 33 and 34 above), placed the applicant, who due to his drunkenness was in a vulnerable state, in a cell with no possibility of asking for assistance other than by banging on the door. When he did so, he was handcuffed to an iron ring. As the applicant did not calm down, the police officers continued to apply increasingly intrusive restraints.
