The defendant knew the identity of the witnesses and who had testified against him and he might have reacted accordingly.

The Constitutional Court found that the measure in question had been accompanied by adequate procedural safeguards and had thus been proportionate: the Czech police officers had been heard directly in the courtroom, in the presence of the defendants and their defence counsels, who could have asked questions. There had thus been direct contact between the anonymous witnesses and the court and the other procedural parties. The court, the defendants and their counsels had been able to gain an immediate impression as to how the witnesses gave their testimonies and could take part in the questioning. In the case of a Dutch police officer, who used a false name, he had not been present at the courtroom himself but his testimony and all the questions had been transmitted using technical means and the parties had been allowed to react and to put questions to him.

Thus, even though the defence was put in a more difficult position, the degree of the restriction was minimalised. As far as the second requirement was concerned, the courts adduced a large body of evidence and carefully assessed the reliability of particular testimonies.

The B\u0159eclav District Court had merely stated that there had been a legal basis for reading out the records of their testimonies at the hearing and the Brno Regional Court had added that the witnesses were foreign nationals with no ties to the Czech Republic. The applicants also noted that the argument that the drivers had not been summoned because they were always travelling had not been raised by the Government until a later stage. As regards the anonymous witness, the applicants pointed out that the legal requirements set out in Articles 55 \u00a7 2 and 209 of the CCP had not been met as there had been no risk of bodily harm or other serious danger of interference with her fundamental rights when testifying. The offence had not been a serious one (the applicants were charged with accepting bribes of 10 to 25 EUR), the criminal proceedings had not concerned organised crime, and revealing her identity would not have jeopardised her future professional duties. They argued that the Court\u2019s case-law requires the courts to assess whether the defendants might put the agent or people close to her at risk (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23\u00a0April 1997, \u00a7\u00a061, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 III).

The courts had failed to ensure that these requirements were met. The reliability of the truck drivers had not been subjected to any scrutiny, for example by interrogating them further or questioning other individuals known to them. As for the police agent, the applicants had known her identity because she had worked with them for two months.

These witnesses usually travelled outside their country of residence and outside the Czech Republic and they became inaccessible to the authorities once they had left the Czech Republic. Ensuring their appearance before the trial court or questioning them through the medium of international judicial assistance would have required considerable time and financial resources and the whole criminal proceedings would have lasted significantly longer. Moreover, despite the existence of a legal framework offering mutual judicial assistance in criminal matters, in reality the procedure was often difficult and the results uncertain. In the instant case, the seriousness of the offences meant that it was necessary to act expeditiously. In relation to the use of an agent pursuant to Article 158e of the CCP, the Government argued that such a measure had been self-evident in terms of the seriousness of the criminal activity in question and the courts had explained the reasons why her identity had not been disclosed. The Government also noted that it had not been commonplace to use video conferencing facilities at the time when the witnesses were heard and the District Court was not technically equipped for such a procedure.",

These witnesses could be considered reliable because their statements had been in line with the adduced documentary evidence.

The Court recalls in this regard that in cases concerning a witness\u2019s absence owing to an inability to contact the witness, the domestic courts must, as a rule, have resorted to international legal assistance where a witness resided abroad and such mechanisms were available (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7121).",

The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see Seton v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a055287/10, \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 59, 31\u00a0March 2016).",

Although their interests \u2012 and indeed those of their families \u2012 also deserve protection under the Convention, it must be recognised that their position is to some extent different from that of a disinterested witness or a victim. They owe a general duty of obedience to the State\u2019s executive authorities and usually have links with the prosecution; for these reasons alone their use as anonymous witnesses should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances (see Van Mechelen and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, 23 April 1997, \u00a7 56, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997\u00a0III). On the other hand, the Court has recognised that, provided that the rights of the defence are respected, it may be legitimate for the police authorities to wish to preserve the anonymity of an agent deployed in undercover activities for his own or his family\u2019s protection and so as not to impair his usefulness for future operations (see L\u00fcdi v.\u00a0Switzerland, 15 June 1992, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 238, and Van Mechelen, cited above, \u00a7 57).",

In this regard the Court is aware of the difficulties inherent in the police\u2019s task of searching for and gathering evidence for the purpose of detecting and investigating offences. To perform this task, they are increasingly obliged to make use of undercover agents, informers and covert practices, particularly in tackling organised crime and corruption (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramanauskas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 74420/01, \u00a7\u00a049, ECHR 2008). The interest of the public in ensuring that corrupt practices are prosecuted is beyond doubt and there is also a legitimate interest on the part of the police authorities in corruption cases in preserving the anonymity of an undercover agent for operational reasons (see, mutatis mutandis, L\u00fcdi, cited above, \u00a7 49).

Moreover, as is apparent from the file, although the truck drivers described the customs officials\u2019 general practice of accepting bribes, they were unable to describe specific individuals.

In this regard the Court reiterates that the assessment of whether or not the evidence is decisive depends on the strength of the supporting evidence (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7 123). Therefore, considering the extent and weight of other evidence and bearing in mind the importance ascribed thereto by the national courts, the agent\u2019s testimony cannot be treated as decisive.

On the other hand, the Court notes that the trial court carried out a rigorous assessment of all the evidence, and weighed up its value and significance to the proceedings. It is also evident that the national courts had before them, additional incriminating evidence supporting the statements made by the truck drivers, as shown above (see paragraph 11). Moreover, the testimonies in question were of a merely corroborative nature as none of the depositions could directly incriminate any of the customs officers and, if anything, showed only certain patterns of behaviour at particular a customs office.

The first and the second applicants excused themselves and their defence counsel authorised a substitute representative to attend the hearing. At the hearing, the third applicant made one comment and asked one question. The representative of the first and the second applicants was inactive. It must therefore be stated that, as far as the first and the second applicant are concerned, they did not attempt to conduct any confrontation with the intention of comparing their stories with the statements of the undercover agent or casting doubt on her credibility. The Court thus considers that, in substance, they may be considered to have waived their right to cross-examine the witness (see, mutatis mutandis, Poletan and Azirovik, cited above, \u00a7 87).",

Therefore, as is not unusual in practice, some disclosure took place in the form of a material used in the course of cross\u2011examination. As the Court already noted, the extent of the disclosure has an impact on the extent of the handicap under which the defence is labouring (see Ellis and Simms v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46099/06, 10 April 2012). In the present case, the defence were able to challenge the reliability of the evidence of the undercover police agent and undermine her version of events, in particular, as the transcript of the court hearing shows, knowing the work-station at which and timeframe during which she had worked at the customs office, the defence argued that she could not physically have seen the customs officers taking bribes.",

The Court also notes in this regard the fact that it had apparently not been commonplace to use video conferencing facilities at the time when the witnesses were heard.

Germany ([GC], no.\u00a09154/10, ECHR 2015).

Indeed, in Schatschaschwili (ibid., \u00a7 120) the Court confirmed that in cases concerning a witness\u2019s absence owing to unreachability, the trial court was required to have made all reasonable efforts to secure the witness\u2019s attendance (see Gabrielyan v.\u00a0Armenia, no. 8088/05, \u00a7\u00a078, 10\u00a0April 2012; Tseber v. the Czech Republic, no. 46203/08, \u00a7 48, 22\u00a0November 2012; and Kostecki v.

For the national authorities, the fact that the witnesses were foreign nationals seems to have been a good enough reason to not even try to locate them. The majority are rather inconclusive as to this point (see paragraph 61 of the judgment). We respectfully disagree. In our opinion, \u201cdifficulties encountered by the authorities\u201d and the \u201cfact that it had apparently not been commonplace to use video conferencing facilities at the time when the witnesses were heard\u201d should not serve automatically as carte blanche allowing the national authorities to not even think about trying to locate witnesses and ensure their appearance at the trial.
