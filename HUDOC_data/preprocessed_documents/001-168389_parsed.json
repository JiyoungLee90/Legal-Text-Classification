The Court does not agree with the Government\u2019s argument that that sum should be reduced to account for the fact that the applicant himself received a bigger flat in 1996, noting that the two properties were distinct, and were allocated initially to different persons; if it so happened that after the death of his parents the applicant remained the sole person entitled to claim the flat allocated to his father, he should not be penalised for this fact. Moreover, it has never been argued at the domestic level that the provision of a bigger flat to the applicant meant that the authorities\u2019 obligation to deliver another flat had been partially discharged.",
