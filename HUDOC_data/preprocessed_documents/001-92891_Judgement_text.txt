The case originated in an application (no. 49128/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Stanisław Krawiecki (“the applicant”), on 13 November 2006.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 23 May 2008 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Lubiąż.
On 6 January 2006 the applicant was remanded in custody. The grounds for this decision are unknown, since the applicant has not produced a copy of the order.
On 7 November 2006 the Swiebodzin District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) extended the applicant’s detention. On the same day the court decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against him. The court held that the applicant at the time of the commission of the offence had been incapable of recognising its significance or controlling his conduct because of his mental illness. The applicant had been diagnosed with schizophrenia (paranoid subtype).
On 1 October 2007 the applicant was placed in a mental hospital.
On 22 April 2008 the Świebodzin District Court decided to extend the applicant’s detention at the mental hospital. The court held that he was still suffering from severe schizophrenia.
On 22 July and 20 November 2008 the Świebodzin District Court decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant due to his mental illness. The applicant’s state of health was confirmed by a medical certificate of 1 October 2008.
In the light of the applicant’s submissions, it is impossible to establish the facts relating to his detention.
On 4 December 2006 the Court received a letter from the applicant dated 23 November 2006. The letter was sent while the applicant was detained in the Szamotuły Remand Centre (Areszt Śledczy). It bears the following stamp: “District Court in Świebodzin, censored” (Sąd Rejonowy Świebodzin, Cenzurowano), a handwritten date: “28.11.06” and an illegible signature.
The relevant domestic law concerning censorship of detainees’ correspondence is set out in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kliza v. Poland, no. 8363/04, §§ 29-34, 6 September 2007.
