The applicant agreed to the offer and handed over to S. a sample of amphetamine which he had stored in a drawer of his garage.

He was a member of the motorbike club \u201cMC Bandidos, Chapter Kaiserslautern\u201d, which was well-organised worldwide and known for violent, ruthless acts against persons considered as traitors. Members of the motorbike club were currently suspected of involvement in homicides. The applicant, on whose premises a considerable number of firearms had been found, had himself offered S. EUR 1,000 for assaulting a former member of the motorbike club who was suspected of having deceived the club in the course of business transactions. Further perpetrators who had been involved in the drug deal might equally possess firearms and had not been arrested yet.

The Ministry also rejected the Regional Court\u2019s proposal to have S. questioned by a commissioned judge outside the main hearing as the applicant\u2019s lawyers would be present during such a hearing and might pass on information to the applicant allowing the latter to detect S.\u2019s identity.

The applicant had already been involved in drug trafficking and been predisposed to sell drugs prior to his meeting with the police informer. This was proven, in particular, by the fact that he had supplied S. with an amphetamine sample already when they discussed drug transactions for the first time. Moreover, he had indicated on that occasion that he could supply S. with larger amounts of drugs. The Regional Court found in that context that the price offered by S. to the applicant (EUR 4,000) was the average price for a kilogram of amphetamine of average quality in the region. Furthermore, the applicant had previously been convicted of drug trafficking. As his offences had not therefore been the result of unlawful police incitement, there was no ground for mitigating the sentence on that account.",

First, there must be a good reason for the nonattendance of a witness (ibid., \u00a7 119). In case of a witness\u2019s absence owing to fear, the Court considered that when the witness\u2019s fear is attributable to threats or other actions of the defendant or those acting on his behalf, it is appropriate to allow the evidence of that witness to be introduced at trial without the need for the witness to give live evidence or be examined by the defendant or his representatives. A defendant who has acted in this manner must be taken to have waived his rights to question such witnesses under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 122-123). When the witness\u2019s fear of testifying is not directly attributable to threats made by the defendant or his agents, but to their notoriety, the trial court must conduct appropriate enquiries to determine first, whether or not there are objective grounds for that fear, and, second, whether those objective grounds are supported by evidence (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 122 and 124 with further references). Finally, when a witness has not been examined at any prior stage of the proceedings, allowing the admission of a witness statement in lieu of live evidence at trial must be a measure of last resort. Before a witness can be excused from testifying on grounds of fear, the trial court must be satisfied that all available alternatives, such as witness anonymity and other special measures, would be inappropriate or impracticable (ibid., \u00a7 125).",

However, the applicant had already threatened S. with a loaded revolver during one of the drug transactions, accusing him of being a traitor.

It notes in this context that the trial court examined alternative measures allowing the examination of the witnesses in person, notably having the witnesses questioned by a commissioned judge outside the main hearing in the presence of the applicant\u2019s lawyers or via a video conference including acoustic and optical shielding. It considered that there was not only a risk of the witnesses\u2019 identification by their figure, gestures or language \u2013 which were known to the applicant, but not to other persons present on his behalf \u2013 but also a risk of disclosure of details in the course of questioning by the defence permitting the detection of their identity. The Court accepts that the trial court could consider these alternatives as insufficient to protect the witnesses in the circumstances. It recalls, in this context, that allowing notably police informers to provide information anonymously is a vital tool in prosecuting, in particular, organised crime (see Donohoe v.

Police incitement occurs where the officers involved or persons acting on their instructions do not confine themselves to investigating criminal activity in an essentially passive manner, but exert such an influence on the subject as to incite the commission of an offence that would otherwise not have been committed, in order to make it possible to establish the offence, that is, to provide evidence and institute a prosecution (see Ramanauskas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 74420/01, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2008 with further references; and Bannikova, cited above, \u00a7 37; compare also Pyrgiotakis v. Greece, no. 15100/06, \u00a7 20, 21 February 2008).

Furthermore, as regards the applicant\u2019s argument that he had been incited to sell drugs by having been offered an exceptionally high purchase price at the upper end of what was usual, the Court notes that according to the Trier Regional Court\u2019s findings (see paragraph 26 above), which have not been substantially challenged by the applicant, the price offered by the police informer was the average price for that amount and quality of amphetamine in the region. Moreover, the Court is not convinced by the applicant\u2019s argument that he had been incited to conclude a drug transaction in order to facilitate the sale of a motorbike. It has not been shown that the police informer had linked the drug transactions in any way to the possible purchase of a motorbike from the applicant. As to the applicant\u2019s argument that the police investigators had enhanced the quantity of drugs ordered, thus inciting him to traffic in larger amounts of drugs, the Court notes that the police informer indeed asked the applicant prior to the third drug transaction whether he could supply him with larger amounts of drugs. However, the exact quantity of drugs ordered was only fixed at 6.5\u00a0kilograms by the informer after the applicant had explained that he could supply the informer with as much drugs as the informer wanted, five or ten kilograms (see paragraph 11 above).
