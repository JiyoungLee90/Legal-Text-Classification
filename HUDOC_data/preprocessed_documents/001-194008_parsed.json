It has clarified in this context that the authorities must ensure that diagnosis and care are prompt and accurate (see Pokhlebin v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a035581/06, \u00a7 62, 20 May 2010, and Gorbulya v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a031535/09, \u00a7 62, 6\u00a0March 2014, with further references) and that \u2012 where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition \u2012 supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at successfully treating the detainee\u2019s health problems or preventing their aggravation (see, inter alia, Ukhan v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 30628/02, \u00a7\u00a074, 18\u00a0December 2008, and Kolesnikovich v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a044694/13, \u00a7\u00a070, 22\u00a0March 2016, with further references). The Court stresses that medical treatment within prison facilities must be appropriate and comparable to the quality of treatment which the State authorities have committed themselves to providing for the entirety of the population. Nevertheless, this does not mean that each detainee must be guaranteed the same level of medical treatment that is available in the best health establishments outside prison facilities (see Konovalchuk v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a031928/15, \u00a7\u00a052, 13\u00a0October 2016, and Sadretdinov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a017564/06, \u00a7\u00a067, 24\u00a0May 2016, with further references).",

She received certain medication and underwent a number of examinations. However, the Court cannot subscribe to the Government\u2019s argument that the level of medical care provided to her was timely and sufficient. It further observes that the applicant\u2019s treatment started with delay, it was provided only in part and apparently did not correspond to the national guidelines of treatment. Thus, having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court has identified the shortcomings in the applicant\u2019s medical treatment, which are noted above and listed in the appended table. The Court has already found a violation in respect of issues similar to those in the present case (see\u00a0Nevmerzhitsky\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a054825/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0103-05, ECHR 2005II (extracts); Melnik v.\u00a0Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0104-06; Logvinenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a013448/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a068-78, 14\u00a0October 2010; Sergey Antonov v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a040512/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a076-90, 22\u00a0October 2015; and Pivovarnik v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a029070/15, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-46, 6\u00a0October 2016).
