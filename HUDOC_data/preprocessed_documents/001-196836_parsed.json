The CPS pointed out that it had jurisdiction to order final discharge under the Compulsory Confinement Act, which laid down a number of conditions: in particular, the [individual\u2019s] mental health had to become sufficiently stable and he or she had to have successfully completed a minimum three-year period of conditional discharge. The CPS could do no more than apply the law, which provided for no other legal basis for definitive release. As a subsidiary consideration, the CPS noted that the legislature had not in any event wished to give retrospective effect to the \u201cmore lenient\u201d law in relation to compulsory confinement decisions imposed on the basis of the previous Social Protection Act (1930). This was clear from the parliamentary drafting history. The Minister of Justice had merely suggested that those CPS which had jurisdiction in such cases were to review decisions on maintaining individuals in compulsory confinement with the necessary clemency. Thus, the Antwerp CPS considered that, irrespective of whether the punishable offences which had justified the applicant\u2019s placement in compulsory confinement in 2007 could still be considered as a ground for compulsory confinement under the new Act, the applicant could not be released definitively, having regard to his current mental condition and the fact that he had not completed the period of conditional discharge provided for by law.",

Secondly, he submitted that there had been a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article\u00a013 of the Convention, arguing that those provisions required that any person whose detention was no longer lawful was entitled to have access to a court which could order his or her immediate release.

P.17.0125.N), the Court of Cassation dismissed the first applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law. With regard to the argument alleging a violation of Articles 5\u00a0\u00a7 1 and 7 of the Convention, the Court of Cassation considered that Article\u00a07 of the Convention was applicable only to penalties, and not to preventive measures such as compulsory confinement. For the remainder, Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention did not prevent a compulsory confinement order, imposed by a decision which had acquired legal force, from becoming final in its turn and subsequently giving rise to an execution phase, which was not governed by the same rules as those in force when imposing the order. It followed that Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7 1 did not mean that a confinement measure, imposed in proceedings which had become final, was no longer lawfully or legally imposed because the legislation had changed during the execution phase, and thus meant only that this particular measure could no longer be imposed in the future for the offence for which the applicant had already been placed in confinement. Assessment of a detainee\u2019s mental condition and the resulting danger to society was not made solely on the basis of the offence for which he or she had been placed in confinement, but also in the light of a range of risk factors which were submitted to the CPS for consideration. In so far as this argument was based on another legal premise, it was lacking in legal merit. As to the allegation of violations of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 and Article\u00a013 of the Convention, the Court of Cassation noted that, under section 66 of the Compulsory Confinement Act, final discharge was in principle subject to completion of a probationary period. This condition did not imply that an individual placed in compulsory confinement did not have access to a court or to an effective remedy as required by the Convention. This argument, derived from another legal premise, lacked legal merit.",

In reply to a question posed by members of the Committee, the Minister of Justice indicated that, legally speaking, the provisions amending the scope of the Compulsory Confinement Act could not be considered as criminal-law provisions. In consequence, the principle of the retrospective application of the more lenient criminal law was not applied and the Compulsory Confinement Act did not, in principle, affect decisions in respect of persons suffering from mental disorders who had committed offences capable of giving rise to compulsory confinement under the Social Protection Act of 1930, but for whom compulsory confinement would no longer be possible under the new legislation (page 46).",

In consequence, they alleged that their deprivation of liberty no longer had a legal basis, which amounted to a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\u00a0They argued that the Compulsory Confinement Act provided that the offences they had committed did not justify the imposition of a confinement measure and that the Minister of Justice had indicated that the new legislation was intended to avoid \u201cimproper use\u201d of compulsory confinement. In addition, before the new legislation entered into force, the Ghent Social Protection Board had reportedly granted final discharge to all persons in compulsory confinement who had committed offences that would no longer be considered grounds for confinement under Compulsory Confinement Act. The applicants in the present case were in an identical situation to those persons. It was thus clear that the continued imposition of compulsory confinement measures against them was not lawful.",

Both applicants had been placed in compulsory confinement in compliance with the legal procedure in force at the material time and therefore \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1. With regard to the lawfulness of extending the compulsory confinement measures in spite of the fact that, under the Compulsory Confinement Act, the applicants were no longer liable for confinement on the basis of the offences they had committed, the Government drew attention to the Court\u2019s case-law on Article 7 of the Convention, to the effect that the courts are obliged to apply the law whose provisions are most favourable to the defendant only where he or she has been the subject of a final decision that has not acquired the force of res judicata (they referred to Scoppola v.\u00a0Italy\u00a0(no.\u00a02) [GC], no.\u00a010249/03, \u00a7\u00a0109, 17 September 2009). In the present case, however, the orders imposing compulsory confinement in respect of the applicants had been taken many years previously, had acquired the force of res judicata and had become final.

Since the entry into force of the Compulsory Confinement Act, section 9 of that Act now provides that compulsory confinement can only be imposed where a crime or serious offence has been committed which harms or threatens to harm the physical or psychological integrity of another person (see paragraph 33 above). Thus, the Court notes, and this is not disputed by the Government, that the offences of robbery and attempted burglary committed by the applicants in the present case could no longer, as things stand, constitute a ground for an individual\u2019s compulsory confinement, irrespective of his or her mental health, under the Compulsory Confinement Act.",

This interpretation by the Court of Cassation in the applicants\u2019 case seems to be compatible with the parliamentary proceedings, which indicate that the Compulsory Confinement Act was not in principle intended to affect decisions in respect of persons suffering from mental disorders who had committed offences capable of giving rise to confinement under the 1930 Social Protection Act, but for which confinement would no longer be possible under the new legislation (see paragraph 34\u00a0above).

Thus, the Court notes that in the applicants\u2019 case, the condition of having served a three-year probationary period was only a supplementary ground among the various reasons given by the social protection bodies for refusing their immediate and final discharge. Indeed, the social protection bodies also considered, on the basis of recent psychiatric and psychological reports, that the applicants\u2019 mental health did not allow for their release (see paragraphs\u00a015 and 26 above). Furthermore, the applicants did not argue, before the Court of Cassation or before the Court, that the psychiatric disorders which had justified their compulsory confinement were no longer present, or that their mental-health conditions had improved to a sufficient level. Thus, they did not meet the other conditions provided for in section 66 of the Compulsory Confinement Act in order for final discharge to be ordered. It follows that in their cases the contested legal condition had no effect on the national courts\u2019 power of appreciation.",
