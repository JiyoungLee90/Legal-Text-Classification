The case originated in an application (no. 75975/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mrs Valentina Drăguţă (“the applicant”), on 16 July 1999.
2  The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V. Pârlog.
The applicant complained that the failure to enforce the judgments of 10 October 1995 and of 29 September 1998 violated her right to have her civil rights determined by a court within a reasonable time, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, and her right to peaceful enjoyment of her possessions, as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 8 October 2003 a Chamber of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Chişinău. She is an invalid (second degree).
The applicant and her family (her husband and three children, two of whom were minors at the relevant time) rented an apartment from the State. In 1994 the apartment was seriously damaged due to leakage from water pipes. Two special commissions of the  confirmed the damage to the apartment and found that it was not habitable and was in imminent danger of collapse. The applicant’s requests to be offered alternative accommodation as required by law were rejected by the Municipality due to the lack of available apartments. The applicant and her family continued to live in the apartment until December 2000 when they moved to a rented room.
In April 1995 the applicant brought a civil action against the Municipality claiming the right to receive a new apartment. On 10 October 1995 the Chişinău District Court found for the applicant and ordered the Municipality to provide accommodation for her five-person family (“the 1995 judgment”). The court issued an enforcement warrant no. 2-383/95. On 21 October 1995 the applicant requested the bailiff and the court to enforce the order.
Because the Municipality refused to comply with the judgment of 10 October 1995, the applicant requested the court to change the means of enforcing the judgment, claiming the monetary value of the apartment.
On 29 September 1998 the Chişinău District Court issued a new judgment, obliging the Municipality to pay the applicant 146,440 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 24,000 United States dollars at the time) representing the market value of a four-room apartment in Chişinău (“the 1998 judgment”). The court issued a new enforcement warrant under the same number as that issued in 1995 (no. 2-383/95).
On 27 October 1998 the  upheld that judgment. There was no further appeal and the judgment became final.
The applicant obtained an enforcement warrant which the bailiff did not enforce. Following the applicant’s request, the Chişinău District Court froze the Municipality’s bank account on 13 November 1998, but there was apparently no money on that account. On 9 June 1999 the applicant wrote a letter to the Ministry of Justice, complaining about the non-enforcement of the 1998 judgment. The Ministry of Justice forwarded the letter to the Chişinău District Court.
Following the applicant’s request one of the Municipality’s buildings was seized for sale at a public auction. However, it was not sold.
According to the applicant, the 1998 judgment was enforced on 11 January 2002. According to the Government, the date of enforcement was 26 December 2001.
The relevant domestic law has been set out in this Court’s judgment in the case of Prodan v. , no. 49806/99, ECHR 2004III (extracts).
In addition, the relevant provisions of the Law no. 824 of 24 December 1991 on index-linking of population income read as follows:
“Article 1
Index-linking of population income means the complete or partial recovery of the losses to the population income caused by the increase in prices and tariffs for goods and services and constitutes a permanent mechanism for automatic correction of the level of population income. ...
Article 3
There shall be an index-linking of all financial income of citizens in the form of wages of persons employed by State organisations, as well as enterprises which sell their products at fixed prices, pensions, stipends, social assistance payments and other income which does not have a one-time character, as well as deposits of the population in banks and credit institutions”.
