The best solution in absolute terms is prevention. A remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy (S\u00fcrmeli v.

In either case, by availing himself of the remedy under Article 239a, the accused person effectively brings about the end of the preliminary investigation and, in some cases, of the criminal proceedings.
