The reasonableness of such delay is to be determined having regard in particular to the complexity of the enforcement proceedings, the applicant\u2019s own behaviour and that of the competent authorities, and the amount and nature of the court award (see Raylyan v. Russia, no. 22000/03, \u00a7 31, 15 February 2007).While the Court has due regard to the domestic statutory time-limits set for enforcement proceedings, their non-respect does not automatically amount to a breach of the Convention.

In such cases, the defendant State authority must be duly noti\ufb01ed of the judgment and is thus well placed to take all necessary initiatives to comply with it or to transmit it to another competent State authority responsible for execution.

In so far as they may be understood to submit that the delay of execution was to be calculated as from the date of the latest submission of the writs to the Ministry of Finance in early 2012, the Court is unable to accept that argument. It is uncontested between the parties that the four judgments, once they had become final and binding, had remained without execution for the periods ranging between eight years and nine months and six years and eleven months. Moreover, in 2003-2009 the applicant had on several occasions submitted the writs to that very Ministry.
