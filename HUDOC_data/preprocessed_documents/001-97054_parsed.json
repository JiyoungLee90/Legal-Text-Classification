The agreement reached in the negotiations, in particular in respect of the categories of persons who were eligible and the establishment of the German Foundation as a means of providing funds to victims, was subsequently incorporated in the German Foundation Act of 2 August 2000. Section 10 of the Act stipulated that partner organisations, including the Polish Foundation, were entrusted with evaluation of claims and disbursement of payment to eligible claimants. The same provision stipulated that the German Foundation was neither authorised nor obligated in respect of the approval and disbursement of payments by the partner organisations. The particular feature of the second compensation scheme was that the eligibility conditions had been specified in the GFA, while at\u00a0the same time the examination of the relevant applications was to\u00a0be\u00a0carried out by the partner organisations, including the Polish Foundation. The Court considers that for all practical purposes, decisions to\u00a0qualify applicants as coming under a particular eligibility category and to\u00a0grant payments in respect of the claimants who resided in Poland were taken by the Polish Foundation (see Wo\u015b v.

In any event, there is no evidence that the decisions in respect of the applicant\u2019s claims were reviewed or altered by the German Foundation.",

It follows that while processing the applications the Polish Foundation was bound to follow the substantive criteria as specified in the GFA and had no power either to review its reasonableness or to unilaterally modify or extend them. Thus, the Polish Foundation and, a fortiori, the Polish State cannot bear responsibility in\u00a0cases where an applicant, due to the scope of the substantive eligibility conditions as such, was not included in the group of persons entitled to\u00a0certain benefits. The Court emphasises that the Polish Foundation exercised only a certain measure of discretion when assessing the facts of\u00a0individual cases and the evidence submitted by the claimants. Its assessment of those elements was decisive for the outcome of\u00a0the\u00a0proceedings before the Foundation. The Court considers that the responsibility of the  may be engaged exclusively as regards those cases where the dispute concerns the application of the eligibility conditions to the facts of individual cases in the area falling within the Foundation\u2019s margin of discretion. Accordingly, in each case it is necessary to determine whether a claimant challenges the eligibility conditions or the assessment of facts and evidence by the Polish Foundation and whether that assessment remained within the Polish Foundation\u2019s margin of discretion.",

The Court notes that the applicant claimed that his daughter had been born on 30 April 1945 and thus was entitled to receive benefits under the so-called openness clause on account of her birth during the period in which her parents were subjected to forced labour in . The applicant submitted that upon his return he had registered his daughter as being born in  on\u00a013\u00a0May\u00a01945 for fear of possible negative consequences of disclosing the true date.

In the present case the thrust of the applicant\u2019s complaint is directed against the Polish Foundation\u2019s erroneous assessment of the facts underlying his daughter\u2019s claim and the resultant flawed application of the eligibility conditions to the case (compare and contrast Jakowicz v. Poland (dec.), cited above, \u00a7 80). In the case of Jakowicz the Foundation dismissed the applicant\u2019s claims, which went beyond the scope of the substantive eligibility conditions and as such were outside the Foundation\u2019s remit. By contrast, in the present case the Polish Foundation refused the applicant\u2019s claims while exercising its discretion as\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0assessment of the relevant facts which had a direct bearing on the determination of the applicant\u2019s eligibility status. Thus, the present case can be distinguished from the Jakowicz case on the ground that it concerned a\u00a0dispute as to the assessment of relevant facts and not a challenge to the substantive eligibility conditions. Accordingly, the Court finds that the dispute arose between the applicant and the Polish Foundation as regards the application of the eligibility conditions to his case.",

Such claims could be established exclusively through domestic law, and in such a case the legislator enjoys a\u00a0wide margin of discretion, as noted above. In this respect the Court observes that the conditions and procedures with which a claimant had to\u00a0comply before a payment could be awarded by the Polish Foundation were first agreed in the course of multilateral negotiations, then laid out in\u00a0the GFA and subsequently transposed into the regulations binding on the Foundation via the Partnership Agreement of 16\u00a0February 2001 and any subsequent agreements concluded in the framework of the so-called openness clause. The Polish Foundation\u2019s statutes were subsequently amended with a view to implementing the provisions of the GFA and the Agreement of 16\u00a0February 2001. Thus, the Foundation\u2019s regulations stipulated the conditions which had to be fulfilled by a person seeking benefits. It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court in its Resolution of\u00a027\u00a0June 2007 found that the basis of the rights of a person seeking payment from the Polish Foundation were the Foundation\u2019s statutes, the rules of the Verification Commission and the relevant provisions of the GFA. The Court is mindful of the particular character of the legal regime governing the second compensation scheme which defined the categories of\u00a0eligible claimants. Nevertheless, it finds that the Polish Foundation\u2019s regulations could be considered to create a right for a claimant arguably fulfilling the relevant eligibility conditions to claim compensation from the Foundation (see, mutatis mutandis, Wo\u015b v. Poland (dec.), cited above, \u00a7\u00a083).",

Sweden, 1 July 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports 1997IV and Wo\u015b v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 75). The Court points out that in\u00a0the somewhat similar area of social security and welfare benefits, many domestic legal systems provide for those benefits to be paid - subject to the fulfilment of the conditions of eligibility - as of right (see Stec and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.)

In their view, this assertion was further confirmed by the Supreme Court\u2019s Resolution of 27 June 2007. The Court observes, however, that the Supreme Court in its authoritative decision given by a panel of\u00a0seven judges stated firmly that, prior to its Resolution, interested persons had been deprived of a possibility to challenge the Foundation\u2019s decisions in\u00a0a court. The Supreme Court found that the prevailing trend in the case law of the civil courts was the exclusion of judicial review in respect of\u00a0those decisions. It noted that the Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of\u00a014\u00a0January 2005 and the Szczecin Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of\u00a012\u00a0July\u00a02006 took a different approach.

Accordingly the Court finds that prior to\u00a027\u00a0June 2007 the availability of judicial review in respect of the Foundation\u2019s decisions had not been sufficiently established and the applicant could not be reproached for failing to institute civil proceedings against the Foundation (see Wo\u015b v.

More importantly, the Court points out that a constitutional complaint could be\u00a0recognised as an effective remedy only where the individual decision which allegedly violated the Convention had been adopted in direct application of an unconstitutional provision of national legislation (see\u00a0Szott-Medy\u0144ska v. Poland (dec.), no. 47414/99, 9 October 2003, and Pachla v. Poland (dec.), no. 8812/02, 8 November 2005). However, at the heart of the present case lies the judicial interpretation of the relevant legislative provisions on court jurisdiction, which resulted in a finding that neither the civil nor the administrative courts could hear claims against the Foundation (see Wo\u015b v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 95). As stated above, that problem of judicial interpretation was eventually resolved by the Supreme Court\u2019s Resolution of 27 June 2007. The Court notes that the issue of\u00a0whether civil or administrative courts should hear such claims was also debated by legal writers.",

SK 26/02, \u00a7 5.3, with further references). However, it is not satisfied that the prerequisites for lodging such a constitutional complaint were met in the present case. Lastly, the Court notes that the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 14 November 2007 in case no. SK 53/06 was given after the present application had been lodged. For the above reasons the Court considers that a constitutional complaint cannot be regarded with a sufficient degree of certainty as\u00a0an\u00a0effective remedy in the applicant\u2019s case.",

To this end the Polish Foundation had to allow the German Foundation access to the relevant documents at any time. If grossly incorrect decisions were discovered during such inspection, the Polish Foundation had to reopen the procedure and remedy the issue in a new decision. Furthermore, the German Foundation could quash decisions of the Polish Foundation and reopen a case. The Government stressed that the German Foundation could have ordered an audit of the Polish Foundation. Therefore, it was the German Foundation which exercised real control over the Polish Foundation. The Foundation\u2019s bodies operated under the accessible provisions of law determined in the Partnership Agreement and the rules of procedure of the Appeal Commission were approved by the German Foundation.

Malta, 27\u00a0August 1991, \u00a7\u00a039, Series A no. 210; and Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a025781/94, \u00a7\u00a0233, ECHR 2001IV). In the present case, as regards structural guarantees, the Court notes that the members of the Verification Commission and the Appeal Commission were appointed and dismissed by\u00a0the Foundation\u2019s management board and, in respect of the latter, in\u00a0consultation with the Foundation\u2019s supervisory board. The Foundation\u2019s statutes also specified that the rules governing the operation of the Foundation\u2019s adjudicating bodies were to be set out in the regulations drafted by the management board and adopted by the supervisory board. The Foundation\u2019s governing bodies were in turn appointed and dismissed by the Government Minister at his or her full discretion (see paragraph 13 above). Furthermore, a degree of control and supervision over the Foundation was exercised by the Government Minister. Furthermore, it\u00a0appears that the members of the Verification Commission and the Appeal Commission did not have tenure. Thus, the Court considers that the independence of the Foundation\u2019s adjudicating bodies, despite the Government\u2019s arguments to the contrary in respect of the Appeal Commission, was open to serious doubt. As regards procedural guarantees, it appears that the adjudicating commissions had no clear and publiclyavailable rules of procedure (see H v. , 30 November 1987, \u00a7 53, Series A no. 127B) and did not hold public hearings. For these reasons, they cannot be regarded as tribunals within the meaning of\u00a0Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1.",

However, the Court notes that until June 2007 the domestic courts\u2019 prevailing position, as confirmed in the Supreme Court\u2019s Resolution of 27 June 2007, was that judicial review by either administrative or civil courts in respect of the Foundation\u2019s decisions was excluded (see\u00a0paragraphs 31-32 and 34 above). At this juncture, the Court observes that the Government also criticised the applicant for having failed to\u00a0institute judicial proceedings against the Foundation in the civil courts prior to the adoption of the Supreme Court\u2019s Resolution. It notes, however, that the applicant was not obliged to pursue his claims before the courts, as\u00a0such action would obviously have been futile, having regard to the settled case-law of the domestic courts at the relevant period.",

Accordingly, the civil courts had jurisdiction to examine such claims. The Court very much welcomes such a positive development in the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law which, at least in part, was prompted by its judgment in\u00a0the Wo\u015b case.
