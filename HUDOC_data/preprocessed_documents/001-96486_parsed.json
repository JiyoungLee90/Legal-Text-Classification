Belgium, 6 November 1980, \u00a7 35, Series A no.\u00a040). This means amongst other things that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see Akdivar and Others v.

In this connection, the Court observes that the decisive question in assessing the effectiveness of a remedy concerning a complaint of denial of access to court is whether the applicant could have raised that complaint before the Constitutional Court in order to obtain direct and timely redress, and not merely an indirect protection of the rights guaranteed in Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. The remedy can be either preventive or compensatory in nature (see, among other authorities, Koval v. , no.\u00a065550/01, \u00a7\u00a094, 19 October 2006). The Court notes that the Government did not explain how a complaint to the  could have offered the aforementioned preventive or compensatory redress or both for allegations of denial of access to a court which had been contrary to Article 6 of the Convention. Furthermore, they did not indicate whether the applicant could have directly lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court, without the formal institution of the proceedings being dependent on a preliminary examination of the complaint by the Secretariat of the Constitutional Court, whether the Constitutional Court had the jurisdiction to quash the decision of the court of general jurisdiction and to examine the merits of the applicant's action and whether the Constitutional Court's finding of a violation of the applicant's rights could have given rise to a retrial directly, without the applicant being obliged to lodge an application for a retrial with a competent judicial authority (see Feldek v. the Slovak Republic (dec.), no. 9032/95, 15 June 2000, in which the Court, on the basis of the Government's negative answers to all those questions, found that the Constitutional Court could not be considered an effective domestic remedy). Accordingly, the Court does not find that the Government have discharged the burden upon them of proving that a complaint to the  was accessible to the applicant and capable of providing redress in respect of her Convention complaint.",

Russia (dec.), no. 47033/99, 22 June 1999, and, more recently, Gusinskiy v. Russia (dec.), no. 70276/01, 22 May 2003). In particular, the Court held that under the RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure, in force at the material time, the power to institute supervisory-review proceedings was discretionary, that is to say it was solely for the State official concerned to decide whether or not a particular case warranted a supervisory review (see Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2003IX). It follows that supervisory-review proceedings could not have been set in motion by a party and that that \u201cremedy\u201d was not accessible to applicants (see, for similar reasoning, Russian Conservative Party of Entrepreneurs and Others v. , nos. 55066/00 and 55638/00, \u00a7 88, ECHR 2007I). The Court sees no reason to depart from that finding in the present case and rejects this aspect of the Government's non-exhaustion objection.",

At the same time the applicant, without disputing the effectiveness of that \u201cremedy\u201d per se, argued that she had had no reason to make use of that avenue when she had still been able to employ it, that is within ten days after the decision of 13\u00a0August 2002 had been issued.

The Court subscribes to the general assumption that domestic courts are better schooled in and more able to interpret complex and rather technical legal rules defining the jurisdictional limits of their judicial power. In such a situation it is not surprising that the applicant did not lodge an appeal against the decision of 13 August 2002, seeing no reason to doubt the correctness of the District Court's finding and consenting to the transfer of the case, particularly so when she was faced with a dilemma: either to proceed with her action in another court or to endure the closing of the proceedings (see paragraph 8 above). In reaching this conclusion the Court attributes particular weight to the fact that the District Court grounded its decision of 13 August 2002 on interpretation of the legal act which had entered into force only a week before (see paragraph\u00a08 above).\u00a0Furthermore, the Government did not argue that the District Court's interpretation of the jurisdictional parameters of its powers had been so manifestly incorrect that it had become absolutely evident to the applicant that the transfer of her case to the Commercial Court would result in the discontinuation of the proceedings (see, for similar reasoning, Hajiyev v. Azerbaijan, no. 5548/03, \u00a7 43, 16\u00a0November 2006).

However, by that time the avenue of appeal against the decision of 13 August 2002 was no longer open to her as the ten-day time-limit envisaged for institution of appeal proceedings had expired. The Court is mindful of the fact that in these circumstances the applicant still tried to avail herself of the judicial protection. She appealed against the 's decision of 17 October 2002 to a higher-ranking court and subsequently, being unsuccessful in her appeal, challenged the latter court's decision. In these circumstances the Court finds that the applicant cannot be said to have failed to exhaust domestic remedies by not bringing a formal appeal against the decision of 13\u00a0August 2002.

It reiterates that Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his or her civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. The Court observes that it would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to parties in a pending lawsuit without also protecting the right of access to a court which makes it in fact possible to benefit from such guarantees. The fair, public and expeditious characteristics of judicial proceedings are of no value at all if there are no judicial proceedings (see Golder v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 21\u00a0February 1975, Series A no. 18, \u00a7\u00a7 31-39). The Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective. This is particularly true of the right of access to the courts in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial (see Airey v.\u00a0Ireland, 9\u00a0October 1979, Series A no. 32, \u00a7\u00a024). A restrictive interpretation of the right of access to a court guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 would not be consonant with the object and purpose of the provision (see De Cubber v.\u00a0Belgium, 26 October 1984, Series A no.\u00a086, \u00a7\u00a030).",

At the same time, these limitations must not restrict or reduce a person's access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Lastly, such limitations will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if they do not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Levages Prestations Services v.
