The case originated in an application (no. 53339/09) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Andrzej Siermiński (“the applicant”), on 29 September 2009.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs J. Chrzanowska of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 18 September 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Kadzidło.
The applicant’s parents owned land within the administrative borders of Warsaw. It was expropriated by way of an administrative decision issued on an unspecified date under the provisions of the Decree on Ownership and Use of Land in Warsaw of 26 October 1945. In February 1949 the applicant’s legal predecessor requested to be granted a right of perpetual use (użytkowanie wieczyste) for another plot of land situated in Warsaw as compensation provided for by the provisions of the 1945 Decree. His request was dismissed by way of an administrative decision given in 1961 and ultimately upheld in 1968.
A judicial decision given in 1975 confirmed that the applicant was his parents’ general heir.
On 16 July 1993 the applicant requested that the decision given in 1961 be declared null and void.
On 20 September 1994 the Minister of Construction and Land Planning (Minister of Gospodarki Przestrzennej and Budownictwa) gave a decision. It noted that in 1961 the authorities had failed to examine whether the substantive conditions for granting the owners the right of perpetual use of the land specified in section 7 of the 1945 Decree (see paragraph 46 below) had been met at that time. He declared, referring to Article 156 § 1 item 2 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (CAP) (see paragraph 39 below), that decision null and void in so far as it related to the part of the land concerned which was used as family gardens. In so far as this decision related to the part of the land which had already been used for construction purposes, he considered that the contested decision had given rise to irrevocable legal consequences within the meaning of Article 156 § 2 of the CAP (see paragraph 41 below). Therefore under Article 158 § 2 he could merely declare that it had been issued contrary to law within the meaning of this provision.
The municipality of Warsaw did not lodge an appeal against this decision. It accordingly became final within thirty days after its service on the applicant.
The applicant instituted three separate sets of proceedings, seeking compensation for damage caused by the expropriation decision.
On 10 October 1994 the applicant, referring to the decision of 20 September 1994, requested the authorities to re-examine the original motion submitted in 1949 to be granted a right of perpetual use in respect of the land covered by the part of the expropriation decision declared null and void (see paragraph 7 above). On 28 October 1994 the Land Planning Division (Wydział Gospodarki Przestrzennej) of the Warsaw City Hall requested the Warsaw-Mokotów Town Hall to provide certain information concerning the land concerned.
On 3 March 1995 the applicant complained to the Minister of Construction and Land Planning about the authorities’ failure to give a decision in his case.
On 7 September 1995 the Minister of Minister of Construction and Land Planning stayed the compensation proceedings instituted by the applicant under Article 160 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (see paragraphs 29-33 below). He observed that the decision given on 20 September 1994 (see paragraph 7 above) made it necessary in law to reexamine the former owners’ request for grant of the right to perpetual use submitted in 1949 and that it created a compensation claim for the applicant. It referred to the applicant as “the claim’s owner” (właściciel roszczenia).
In March and May 1996 the applicant complained to the Minister of Construction and Land Planning about the authorities’ failure to give a decision in the case.
On 25 November 1996 the Supreme Administrative Court gave a decision obliging the Mayor of Warsaw to whom the case had meanwhile been transmitted to give a decision on the merits of the case within one month.
On 24 February 1997 the Mayor of Warsaw refused to allow the application submitted in 1949 and joined by the applicant (see paragraph 5 above). The applicant appealed.
On 19 July 1997 the Local Self-Government Board of Appeal (Samorządowe Kolegium Odwoławcze) set the first-instance decision aside and remitted the case.
On 31 December 1997 the Mayor again refused to allow the applicant’s application. The applicant appealed. On 21 January 1999 the Board of Appeal set the first-instance decision aside and remitted the case. An exchange of correspondence between the applicant and the authorities ensued.
In January 2004 the Mayor of Warsaw informed the applicant that he had instituted proceedings with a view to having the decision given in 1994 that created for the applicant an entitlement to compensation (see paragraphs 7 and 12 above) declared null and void. In September 2004 the Minister of Construction refused to grant the Mayor’s application, finding that the contested decision was lawful.
On 13 December 2004 the Warsaw Town Hall (Urząd m. st. Warszawy) informed the applicant that the Mayor could not give a decision on the merits of the case unless the applicant indicated, by way of an initial request to obtain a construction permit, how he intended to use the land in question.
In September 2006 the applicant complained about the authorities’ failure to give a decision on the merits of the case. On 15 November 2006 the Board of Appeal obliged the Mayor to issue a decision by the end of February 2007.
On 15 March 2007 the applicant again complained about the administrative authorities’ failure to examine his case within a reasonable time.
On 24 April 2007 the Mayor refused to allow the applicant’s application. The applicant appealed. On 30 July 2007 the Board of Appeal quashed the decision, finding that it was unlawful both on procedural and substantive grounds, and remitted the case.
On 15 January 2008 the applicant again complained about the administrative authorities’ failure to give a decision. On 29 August 2008 the Board of Appeal found in a decision that his complaint was ill-founded as the file of the case had been forwarded to the civil court and the administrative authorities could not deal with the case. The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with the Supreme Administrative Court.
On 28 October 2010 the Supreme Administrative Court obliged the Mayor of Warsaw to give a decision on the merits of the case within a twomonth time-limit.
On 3 June 2011 and on an unspecified later date the applicant complained to the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court about the Mayor’s failure to give a decision on the case in compliance with the judgment of that court obliging her to do so. On 14 July 2011 and 27 September 2012, respectively, the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court rejected his complaints for failure to comply with the applicable procedural requirements. It noted that the applicant was obliged, under Article 154 para. 1 on the Law of Proceedings before Administrative Courts, to call upon the Mayor to comply with the judgment obliging her to give a decision prior to lodging another complaint about her inactivity with the administrative court.
On 22 June 2011 the Mayor of Warsaw stayed the proceedings, pending a physical delimitation of the land concerned by a land surveyor. The applicant appealed against this decision.
On 13 September 2012 the applicant called upon the Mayor, under Article 154 para. 1 of the Law of Proceedings before Administrative Courts, to give a decision in compliance with the judgment of 28 October 2010. There was no reply to his request.
The proceedings are pending.
On 10 October 1994 the applicant instituted proceedings under the then applicable Article 160 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, seeking compensation for damage allegedly caused by the unlawful decision given in 1961.
On 7 September 1995 the Minister of Construction stayed the proceedings, considering that the outcome of the use of land proceedings described above (see paragraphs 10 – 28 above) was decisive for the proceedings under Article 160 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (see paragraph 12 above). The applicant appealed.
On 17 April 1997 the Supreme Administrative Court allowed the applicant’s appeal against the decision to stay the proceedings, holding that the other set of proceedings had no incidence on the issue of compensation for damage caused by the original expropriation decision.
In September 1997 the applicant complained about the Minister’s inactivity.
Ultimately in 2001 the President of Housing and Urban Development Office (Prezes Urzędu Mieszkalnictwa i Rozwoju Miast) refused to award compensation to the applicant.
In June 2001 the applicant and other legal successors of the former owners of the land expropriated in 1961 lodged a claim with the Warsaw Regional Court for compensation for damage caused by that decision.
By a judgment of 9 December 2008 the Warsaw Regional Court awarded compensation to the applicant and other plaintiffs. The State Treasury represented by the General Attorney Office (Prokuratoria Generalna) appealed.
On 8 July 2009 the Warsaw Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, amended the contested judgment and dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim.
On 14 October 2010 the Supreme Court refused to entertain the applicant’s cassation appeal.
Under Polish law no special provisions have been enacted whereby redress may be obtained for wrongs relating to expropriations carried out in the past. There is therefore no specific legal framework to mitigate the effects of certain infringements resulting from the deprivations of property.
However, it is open to persons whose property was expropriated or their legal successors, to institute, under Article 156 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (“the CAP”) (Kodeks postępowania administracyjnego), administrative proceedings in order to claim that the expropriation decisions should be declared null and void as having been issued contrary to law.
Article 156 § 1 of the CAP, which sets out grounds on which a final administrative decision is subject to annulment, states:
“1. A public administration authority shall declare a decision null and void if:
1) it has been issued in breach of the rules governing competence;
2) it has been issued without a legal basis or in flagrant breach of the law;
3) concerns a case already decided by means of another final decision;
4) it has been addressed to a person who is not a party to the case;
5) it was unenforceable on the date of its issuance and its unenforceability is of a permanent nature;
6) it would give rise to a punishable offence in the event that it has been enforced;
7) it has a flaw making it null and void by the force of law.
There is no time-limit for a party’s request to have an administrative decision declared null and void under Article 156 § 1 (see Ogórek v. Poland (dec), no. 28490/03, § 50, 18 September 2012). If the challenged decision had been given without a legal basis or in flagrant violation of law, the administrative authority shall declare it null and void (Article156 § 1 (2)).
“A decision shall not be declared null and void on the grounds listed in paragraph 1 (1), (3), (4) and (7) if 10 years have expired from the date of its service or promulgation, as well as if the decision has produced irreversible legal effects.”
Article 158 reads as follows:
“1.  A ruling on annulment of a decision shall be given by means of a decision.
If it is impossible to declare a decision null and void because of the circumstances referred to in Article 156 § 2, a public administration authority shall only declare that the contested decision has been issued contrary to the law and indicate circumstances because of which it has not declared the decision null and void.”
Article 160 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, as applicable prior to 1 September 2004, read in its relevant part:
“A person who has suffered a loss on account of the issuing of a decision in a manner contrary to Article 156 § 1 or on account of the annulment of such a decision shall have a claim for compensation for actual damage, unless he has been responsible for the circumstances mentioned in this provision.”
Article 417 § 1 of the Civil Code provides:
“The State Treasury, or [as the case may be] a self-government entity or other legal person responsible for exercising public authority, shall be liable for any damage (szkoda) caused by an unlawful act or omission [committed] in connection with the exercise of public authority.”
Article 417 1 § 2 of the Code, which entered into force on 1 September 2004, provides that when damage had been caused by way of an unlawful and final decision, a compensation claim in respect of damage caused by such a decision can be made after the unlawfulness of such decision has been declared in separate proceedings.
The Decree on Ownership and Use of Land in Warsaw of 26 October 1945 expropriated owners of real property located in Warsaw and transferred the ownership of land to the municipality of Warsaw. The 1945 Decree provided, in so far as relevant:
“Section 7. (1) The owner of a plot of land ... can within six months after the taking of possession of the land by the municipality file a request to be granted ... the right to a perpetual lease (wieczysta dzierżawa) with a peppercorn rent (czynsz symboliczny). ...
(2)  The municipality shall grant the request if the use of the land by the former owner is compatible with its function set forth in the development plan. ...
(4)  In case the request is refused, the municipality shall offer the person entitled, as long as it has spare land in its possession, a perpetual lease of land of equal value, on the same conditions, or the right to construct on such land.
5)  In case no request, as provided for in paragraph (1), is filed, or the former owner is for any other reasons not granted a perpetual lease or the right to construct, the municipality is obliged to pay compensation pursuant to Article 9.
Section 8. In case the former owner is not granted the right to a perpetual lease or the right to construct, all buildings located on the land shall become the property of the municipality, which is obliged to pay, pursuant to Article 9, compensation for the buildings which are fit to be used or renovated.
Section 9.
...
(2)  The right to compensation begins to apply six months after the day of taking the land into possession by the municipality of Warsaw and expires three years after that date. ...”
Pursuant to Article 33 § 2 of the Act on Local State Administration of 20 March 1950, the ownership of land located in Warsaw was assigned to the State Treasury. According to the Section 5 § 1 of the Law of 10 May 1990 the ownership of the land which had previously been held by the State Treasury and which was within the administrative territory of municipalities, was transferred to the latter.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of administrative proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the Code of Administrative Procedure and the 2002 Act on Proceedings before Administrative Courts (“the 2002 Act”), are described in the cases of Grabiński v. Poland no. 43702/02, §§ 60-65, 17 October 2006; Koss v. Poland, no. 52495/99, §§ 21-25, 28 March 2006; and Kaniewski v. Poland, no. 8049/02, §§ 22-28, 8 November 2005.
In particular, under section 3 § 2 (8) of the Law of 30 August 2002 on Procedure before Administrative Courts which entered into force on 1 January 2004, a party to administrative proceedings can lodge with an administrative court a complaint about inactivity on the part of an authority obliged to issue an administrative decision. Under section 149, if a complaint is well-founded, an administrative court shall oblige the authority concerned to issue a decision, or to perform a specific act, or to confirm, declare, or recognise a right or obligation provided for by law. Section 154 § 1 provides for a possibility of requesting that a fine be imposed on the administrative authority by the administrative court for noncompliance with a judgment given under section 149 of the 2002 Act, following a prior request submitted to that authority to comply with that judgment.
In a number of judgments the administrative courts held that the two-month time-limit for lodging an appeal against an administrative decision laid down by section 53 of the 2002 Act is not applicable to situations where the party to administrative proceedings wishes to have recourse to the length complaint provided for in section 154 of that Act (e.g. the Supreme Administrative Court, 20 November 2012, II OSK 2712/12; 23 February 2006, II OSK 52/06; 16 May 2013, II OSK 1073/13; 19 March 2013, II OSK 540/13).
