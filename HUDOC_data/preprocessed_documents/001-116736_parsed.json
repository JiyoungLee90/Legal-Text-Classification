Moreover, the Government have failed to provide any information showing that the intervention of the security forces was properly regulated and organised in such a way as to minimise to the greatest extent possible any risk of bodily harm to the demonstrators (see G\u00fcler and \u00d6ngel v. , nos. 29612/05 and 30668/05, \u00a7\u00a029, 4\u00a0October 2011).

Having examined the case file, the Court notes firstly that the public prosecutor made no attempt to clarify whether the applicant had been amongst the demonstrators that had resisted and attacked the police officers. In this regard, it appears that the public prosecutor failed to secure the testimony of eyewitnesses, such as the university lecturers who subsequently testified during the criminal proceedings initiated against the applicant. Furthermore, although there was a difference between the two medical reports issued on 27\u00a0December 2005, it seems that the public prosecutor never sought to clarify this issue. Indeed, the Court notes that while the first report stated that the applicant had erythematous lesions on the right side of his forehead and above his right eyebrow, the second report revealed that the applicant also had grazes on his left eyebrow, an erythematous lesion measuring 2 x 2 cm on the left temple area and a bruise and grazes on his right knee.",
