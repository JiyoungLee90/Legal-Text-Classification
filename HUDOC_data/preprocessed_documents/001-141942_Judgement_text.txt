The case originated in an application (no. 40478/10) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Csaba Rakssányi (“the applicant”), on 14 July 2010.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 5 April 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Hévíz.
It appears that in 2001 an action was brought against the applicant before the Keszthely District Court. The plaintiff sought the payment of some outstanding fees.
After a first- and a second-instance judgment, on 20 January 2011 the Supreme Court gave final decision in the case.
