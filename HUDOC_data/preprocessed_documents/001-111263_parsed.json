In this connection, Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f) provides a different level of protection from Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c): all that is required under sub-paragraph (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d. It is therefore immaterial, for the purposes of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 (f), whether the underlying decision to expel can be justified under national or Convention law (see \u010conka v. , no.\u00a051564/99, \u00a7\u00a038, ECHR 2002I, and Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15\u00a0November 1996, \u00a7 112, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V).",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Amuur v.

In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the \u201cquality of the law\u201d, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. \u201cQuality of law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Khudoyorov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a06847/02, \u00a7 125, 2005X (extracts); J\u0117\u010dius v.

In this connection, the Court observes that Turkish law does not provide for any specific rules regarding extradition. It was therefore Article\u00a09 of the former Criminal Code (no. 765) which governed the application of a measure of restraint pending a decision on the applicant\u2019s extradition. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s initial placement in custody was ordered on 12 August 1994 by the Edirne Magistrates\u2019 Court on the basis of Article 9 of the former Criminal Code and Article 16 of the European Convention on Extradition. However, although by virtue of Article 90 of the Constitution the terms of the European Convention on Extradition should be considered as forming an integral part of the domestic law, in the present case the domestic courts failed to take into account the forty day time-limit which was set by Article 16 of the said Convention. It is observed in this connection that the decision to place the applicant in provisional detention did not set a time-limit for his detention. Nor did the Government provide an explanation as to the legal basis for the applicant\u2019s provisional detention, which lasted for more than five years. The Court is also struck by the fact that although on 11 April 2002 the  had informed the Ministry of Justice that the applicant could be extradited (see paragraph\u00a015 above), he was kept in detention for a further ten months until his extradition.\u00a0The Court observes therefore that in the present case, the applicant fell in a legal lacuna in the absence of clear and specific regulations governing extradition.",
