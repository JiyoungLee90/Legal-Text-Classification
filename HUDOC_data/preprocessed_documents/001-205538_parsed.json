Moreover, despite the first applicant\u2019s specific procedural requests, the investigating authorities did not examine whether he had been temporarily transferred to another cell, where he had allegedly been attacked by two plainclothes persons nor did they compile a list of people who had allegedly entered the detention facility on the date of the alleged ill-treatment (see paragraph 17 above).",

The second applicant did not comment on that particular issue. The medical certificate in question does not contain any information on the causes and timing of the alleged injury.

According to the Sabail district prosecutor office\u2019s decision of 15\u00a0April 2011 not to open a criminal case, the second applicant had been handcuffed in order to prevent him from continuing his alleged attack against the police officers.

Accordingly, the information made available to the Court by the parties is rather scant and lacks detail, as a result of which it is difficult to establish the precise circumstances surrounding the second applicant\u2019s handcuffing, in particular, when and for how long the second applicant remained handcuffed.",

The medical record established the existence of a large violet bruise on the upper third portion of the inner side of his left thigh. That record also contained a comment made by the fifth applicant that he had been beaten during his arrest and while in police custody on 11 August 2014. That document was not relied on by the investigating authorities in the domestic proceedings concerning the fifth applicant\u2019s complaint of ill-treatment and was obtained by the fifth applicant independently following the decision not to open a criminal case in respect of his ill-treatment claims (see paragraph 81 above). In their observations, the Government did not comment on that document, nor did they dispute its authenticity. Admittedly, that certificate was not issued by a forensic expert and did not provide a detailed forensic description of the injuries or attempt to determine their cause using forensic methods.

The applicant underwent forensic examination. However, the Government failed to provide the Court with the case file materials, including a copy of the forensic report of 5 September 2014, which reportedly found no bodily injury on the fifth applicant\u2019s person. It is unclear when the forensic examination was ordered and carried out. The Court notes in this respect that prompt forensic examination is crucial, as signs of injury may often disappear rather quickly and certain injuries may heal within weeks or even a few days. It is for this reason that the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s arguments based on the forensic report of 5 September 2014. The Government did not submit any comments concerning the medical record of 15 August 2014 and did not put forward any satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing any evidence likely to cast doubt on the fifth applicant\u2019s account of events. It is undisputed that the police arrested the fifth applicant and took him to the Sabirabad district police station on 11 August 2014. In view of the above, the Court considers that the medical record of 15 August 2014, despite certain shortcomings, constitutes more reliable medical evidence than the forensic report of 5\u00a0September 2014 and that, for the purposes of the present complaint, its content is sufficient to conclude that the fifth applicant suffered an injury to the left thigh.",
