The court found it established that the applicant had been aware of the orders of the police to leave the scene but had decided to ignore them. It appeared from the witness statements given before the court that the applicant had not told or indicated the arresting police officer that he was a journalist. According to the arresting officer, this fact only became known to him when the relevant magazine appeared. It appeared also from the witness statements that two other photographers, who had been in the sealed-off area, had been able to leave the scene without consequences just before the applicant was arrested. The court found it further established that the police orders had been clear and that they had clearly concerned everybody. The court balanced the Article 10 right against other interests, finding that the police had had the right to ask the applicant, among others, including the former Member of Parliament, to leave the scene. The interference with the applicant\u2019s right to exercise his freedom of expression had thus been based on law, and it had fulfilled the legitimate aim of preventing disorder. The interference had been necessary in a democratic society in order to put an end to a violent situation. However, relying on Chapter 6, section 12, of the Penal Code, no penalty was imposed as the offence was excusable. The court found that the applicant who, as a journalist, was confronted with contradictory expectations, stemming from obligations imposed on the one hand by the police and on the other by his employer.",

The applicant was a journalist and that he had not participated in the demonstration or caused any disorder.

It is surprising that it should have been thought that it could also apply to a journalist who was lawfully present and covering the event in the context of his media duties and that it could lead to his arrest.",

The domestic court, having briefly considered Article 10 of the Convention, found that there had been an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression; that the interference had a lawful basis and pursued a legitimate aim, namely, preventing disorder; and that the interference had been necessary for the purpose of putting an end to a violent situation. Still, it may be noted that the situation had already been effectively dealt with by the time the applicant was arrested. The court found the applicant guilty as charged. However, it did not impose a sentence. It regarded the offence as excusable because it considered that the applicant, as a journalist, must have faced a dilemma between his duty to his employer and the obligation imposed on him by the police order. Consequently, by law, the conviction was not to be entered on the applicant\u2019s criminal record.",

In the domestic court\u2019s view, all of that had been right and proper and well deserved, but on the other hand, the applicant would suffer no further consequences because the offence was excusable.

                        "content": "It seems to me that it was only natural that the situation, as it developed, would heighten journalistic interest. There was nothing improper about that. Where a demonstration is peaceful, the journalist\u2019s function is essentially one of collecting and transmitting information and, quite often, adding comment. But when tension builds up and violence breaks out, whereupon the authorities resort to suppressive control measures, the journalist assumes the role of \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d and his task then acquires even greater significance: as to this role of the press, see, for example, Barthold v.\u00a0Germany, 25 March 1985, Series A no. 90. He is entitled to be in the very thick of things until the very end, and sometimes does so at considerable risk to himself. The reason is because in a democratic society the public have the right to know what happens during such difficult times. This right forms one of the basic safeguards of democracy. Hardly a day passes by when we are not made aware, in one way or another, of the need for journalistic freedom to perform that kind of role. The domestic court\u2019s view that the applicant was inevitably faced with a dilemma as to where his loyalty lay, and that this dilemma could only be resolved by giving precedence to the law, quite misses the point. It does not, in my respectful view, reflect the true nature of the situation in which the applicant found himself. He was not one of the demonstrators. He was a journalist-photographer covering what the Government themselves have described as an event of considerable public importance.",

As to whether he was wearing his media badge and whether he made his identity known to the police in good time, I have already referred to the controversy on this point. The domestic court made no finding on the matter. But, as I have noted, it was accepted that his identity was established before he was put on the police bus to the police station; and, further, one might ask whether the applicant, while locked up, had not asserted his identity and remonstrated about spending the night in a cell. There is a nagging question and it is this: Did the police really care whether the applicant was a journalist or not? The fact that he was prosecuted tends to suggest that they did not. It may also be added that if the police or the courts were to have taken the view that the applicant\u2019s prosecution should have been disconnected from his arrest and detention, they would have been expected to look at these aspects separately and to give relevant explanations. But they did not.",

This aspect is seen as connected with the question of necessity. The majority say (paragraph 44) that: \u201cSince these legal and legitimate orders were not obeyed, the police were entitled to arrest and detain the disobedient demonstrators\u201d. But the applicant was not a demonstrator and no one has ever suggested that he was. The majority seem to be saying that since the applicant chose \u201cto stay among the demonstrators\u201d and not to use the area reserved for the press he should accept the same fate (see paragraphs 42 and 45). Again, referring to the question of necessity, the majority say (see paragraph 52) that: \u201cAs to the necessity, the court found that it had been necessary to disperse the crowd because of the riot and the threat to the public safety, and to order people to leave. Thus the restrictions on the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression were justified\u201d.",

The majority speak of an analysis of Article 10 of the Convention carried out by the domestic court. My own understanding is that, at least in the case of the applicant, there was no real analysis at all and that the domestic court\u2019s judgment was more by way of declaration than based on reasoning. It has not been substantiated why it was necessary in a democratic society to equate a professional journalist, operating within recognised professional limits in covering the demonstration, with any of the people taking part in the demonstration and to impose drastic criminal restraints on him.",

I also consider that if the domestic courts were unable to adopt such an interpretative approach, they were bound, in applying Article 10 of the Convention, to balance the competing interests involved, yet they failed to do so. It is incumbent on the national authorities to convincingly establish, by relevant and sufficient reasons, that curtailing press freedom is necessary in the sense that it meets a \u201cpressing social need\u201d: see, among many authorities, Cump\u0103n\u0103 and Maz\u0103re v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088-91, ECHR 2004-XI. The Court\u2019s case-law concerning the protection of journalistic sources illustrates the Court\u2019s concern in this regard: see Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, 27 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1995-II, and subsequent cases, such as Tillack v. Belgium (no.\u00a020477/05, 27 November 2007) and Voskuil v. the Netherlands (no.\u00a064752/01, 22 November 2007), which are particularly instructive. In the latter case a journalist, who was called as a witness in criminal proceedings, refused to name his source even when the judge ordered him to do so. He was punished by detention for non-compliance. The Court found a violation of Article 10. It held that the judicial order was not justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest and so, in balancing the competing interests, \u201cthe interest of a democratic society in securing a free press\u201d had to prevail. There is no indication that any such balancing exercise was carried out in the present case. On the contrary, the case reveals a one-sided attitude on the part of the authorities, one likely to create a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on press freedom.",
