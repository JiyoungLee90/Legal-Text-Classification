His article, which was entitled \u201cIf the pashas [the generals] refuse to obey\u201d, contained criticisms of high-ranking officers who were about to retire. He hinted that some generals in the armed forces were wont to sound false alarms concerning an alleged advance of fundamentalism and anti-secularism, which they then used as a pretext for interfering in the country\u2019s general politics, and that they appeared to have links with certain business circles, the media, senior civil servants and even the Mafia, endeavouring to create a political atmosphere that tallied with their worldview. He suggested that the high-ranking officers in question should set up a political party on retirement and present their political projects to the people, instead of \u201cdeciding on the future of the nation on their own, in the name of the nation\u201d.

In its reasoning the Court of Cassation mentioned the need to reclassify the facts and to assess them under Article 95 \u00a7 4 of the Military Criminal Code. It specified that the provisions of Article 95 \u00a7 4 of the Military Criminal Code and (the former) Article 159 of the Criminal Code shared the same substantive and moral elements, but differed in providing protection for individuals (Article\u00a095 \u00a7\u00a04) and the Institution itself (Article 159), respectively. The Military Court of Cassation held that even though the applicant\u2019s article had comprised elements of both the aforementioned criminal offences, the general tenor of the impugned article had apparently concentrated on the behaviour of two specific Generals rather than the overall armed forces. Therefore, the accusation that the officers were disobedient, that is to say that they lacked discipline, was liable to undermine the lower ranks\u2019 confidence in them and thus damage hierarchical relations within the armed forces.",

Clearly, the national authorities are primarily responsible for assessing whether there is any \u201coverriding social need\u201d capable of justifying the restriction, for which exercise they have a certain margin of appreciation, but this goes hand in hand with a European supervision, covering both the law and the decisions applying it, including decisions taken by independent courts (see, for example, Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2), 26 November 1991, \u00a7\u00a050, Series\u00a0A no. 217). Furthermore, where the media are concerned, as in the present case, the margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of democratic society in ensuring and maintaining a free press. Similarly, that interest will weigh heavily in the balance in determining, as must be done under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, whether the restriction was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, \u00a7 45, ECHR 1999I), in the framework of extremely careful scrutiny on the part of the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 51). Moreover, the dominant position occupied by State bodies requires them to show restraint in their recourse to criminal law, especially if they have other means of replying to unjustified media attacks and criticisms (see, among other authorities, Nedim \u015eener, cited above, \u00a7 114, and \u015e\u0131k, cited above, \u00a7 103).",

This punitive logic equates criticism of the State with the crime of lese-majesty, because the \u201csentiment\u201d of the \u201cTurkish\u00a0nation\u201d is identified with the established authority itself as embodied in the policies conducted by the State and in the acts of its political and military bodies; and any criticism of that policy and those acts can be construed as an assault on the \u201cnational\u00a0sentiment\u201d. This \u201cnational\u00a0sentiment\u201d therefore implies subordination to the constituted authority, as if only obedient Turks submissive to the political and military authorities were \u201cgood\u201d Turks and reformist Turks critical of the powers that be were \u201cbad\u201d Turks, \u201cbetrayers of the nation\u201d.",

The Minister of Justice thus dons the mantle of interpreter of the legal interest protected by the criminal provision: the criminal prosecution depends on his or her value judgment of the extent of the assault on the \u201cnational sentiment\u201d. This makes it clear that it is the political and military authorities, as such, which the legal provision is intended to protect from any criticism from the Turkish intelligentsia and people. Not only intellectuals but also ordinary people have good reason to fear the broad discretionary scope of this criminal provision. The criminal proceedings against the applicant for denigration of the armed forces amply prove that such a fear is not unreasonable.",

In legal terms the clause is a truism, merely stating that the scope of every \u201cutterance offence\u201d (\u00c4usserungsdelikt) is limited by the constitutional principle of freedom of expression and that \u201ccrimes against the emblems of State sovereignty and against the honour of State bodies\u201d are subject to the same limitation. Article 301 retained that clause, but judicial practice is still oblivious to its real scope. Impunity must apply not only to the authors of fairly banal expressions of dissatisfaction with the public and State authorities but also to persons expressing forceful, mordant, incisive and provocative criticism attracting the attention of the general public. That also demonstrates that criticism of the public authorities, especially of high-ranking army officers, for statements which they have made in public on the general politics in the country, is not tolerated. Citizens remain at the mercy of an unjust law and are liable to be punished just for expressing an opinion. In other words, it transpires from the present case that criminal law is being hijacked for political purposes and used to protect a certain political/military elite from any form of legitimate criticism.",

However, in some countries there may be an overriding social need to defend democracy (wehrhafte Demokratie) with an additional criminal-law option. If such an approach is to be strictly compatible with the requirements of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, that is to say with the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality, the provision criminalising attacks on the reputation of State bodies can only be conceived as a bulwark against a clear and imminent threat to national security (konkretes Gef\u00e4hrdungsdelikt), as abstract danger (abstraktes Gef\u00e4hrdungsdelikt) is clearly insufficient to justify criminalising such expression of opinion. In the context of democratic processes, protecting the reputation of State institutions by criminal-law measures is no longer acceptable as a means of defending the mythologised, monistic \u201cideal personality of the State\u201d (devletin manevi sahsiyeti), but only as a wholly exceptional measure bound up with a criminal-law policy to protect a demythologised pluralistic State (Staatsschutzstrafrecht).",

It is inacceptable in a free, democratic society for an individual to remain for six-and-a-half years, two-and-a-half of them in the military courts, under threat of the imposition of vague and disproportionate criminal provisions, for having written an article criticising interference by certain army Generals in the country\u2019s general politics. Even if the criminal proceedings were declared statute-barred, the applicant was nonetheless subjected to the direct effects of those provisions: he was the subject of criminal proceedings, with all the inevitable consequences for his personal, social and professional life, particularly in terms of changing his professional conduct. The effect of censoring divergent opinions on and criticisms of the political and military authorities has been in no way hypothetical but very real and effective, and it has spread through an entire social and professional stratum, which can at any time suffer the effects of the sword of Damocles wielded in Article 310 and Article 159. Indeed, inasmuch as the applicant, Mr Dilipak, represents a whole category of persons \u2013 writers, journalists and political columnists, or a fair section of the Turkish intelligentsia \u2013 the criminal proceedings brought against him also posed a threat to that professional category.",

Such reluctance is very comprehensible, on account not only of the highly unjustified nature in concreto of the criminal charge brought against the applicant, who had acted in accordance with the public interest of Turkish society, but also of the problematical nature in abstracto of the applicable criminal provisions. The extensible scope of the provisions of Article\u00a0159 of the former Criminal Code and Article 301 of the new Criminal Code and the vague definition of the legal interest (\u201cnational sentiment\u201d) which they were intended to protect removed any kind of accessibility and foreseeability from domestic law.
