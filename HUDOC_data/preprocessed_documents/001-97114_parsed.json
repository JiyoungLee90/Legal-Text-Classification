Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court does not see a reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case. In particular, it notes that the criminal proceedings against the applicant remained pending for more than eleven years, during which the investigative authorities remained completely inactive: they did not take any investigative steps and did not bring charges or file an indictment (see paragraph 9 above). This whole delay was therefore attributable to the authorities. Furthermore, the Pazardzhik Regional Investigation Service failed to comply with the Pazardzhik regional public prosecutor's office's express instructions, given on numerous occasions in the course of many years, to close the applicant's case (see paragraph 10 above).",
