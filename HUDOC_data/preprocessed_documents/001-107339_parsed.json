France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II). Special diligence to administer justice expeditiously is required from the domestic courts when the applicant is held in custody during the proceedings (see, for instance, Yurtayev v. , no. 11336/02, \u00a7 37, 31\u00a0January 2006).",

It thus considers that the complexity of the case alone cannot explain the overall duration of the proceedings. Nor does the conduct of the applicant, who somewhat contributed to the length of the proceedings (see paragraph 11 above), explain such duration. On the other hand, the Court is of the view that the proceedings were delayed mainly by the lengthy examination of the case by the District Court (see paragraphs 6 and\u00a07 above) and by thirty two adjournments of the hearings (see paragraph\u00a011 above). In the latter respect, the Court notes that, even though on a number of occasions the courts applied compulsory summonses on the persons failing to appear (see paragraph 11 above), they also had at their disposal other effective mechanisms to ensure those persons\u2019 presence, including administrative penalties (see Kobtsev v. Ukraine, no. 7324/02, \u00a7\u00a031, 4 April 2006). It was not suggested by the Government that the courts had ever considered applying them. Nor did the majority of the compulsory summonses seem to have any effect (see Kobtsev v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a071). The Court concludes, therefore, that the main responsibility for the protracted length of the proceedings rested with the domestic courts.",
