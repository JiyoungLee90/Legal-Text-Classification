Such a waiver could be implicit, resulting for example from conduct incompatible with the intention of exercising procedural rights and the right to appear as enshrined in domestic legislation. The Government referred in that connection to the Medenica v. Switzerland judgment (no. 20491/92, ECHR 2001-VI), in which they claimed that Court had laid down the principle that absconding amounted to a waiver of the right to appear at the hearing.",

In the Government's submission, the mere absence of official notification did not in itself constitute sufficient proof that an applicant had acted in good faith; further evidence of negligence on the part of the authorities was required. It would, moreover, be manifestly incompatible with the effectiveness of the criminal-justice system and with the Court's case-law to consider that even a person who had consciously evaded justice had not waived his right to appear in court and should be granted a new trial. If that were the case, the accused would have sole power to review the validity of their own trial, and the guilty would be in a more favourable position than the innocent.",

The unjustified hindrance of the applicant's right to a fresh determination by a court of the merits of the charge against him was not prompted by an isolated incident and is not attributable to the particular turn of events in his case, but was rather the consequence of the wording of provisions of the CCP on the conditions for applying for leave to appeal out of time. Moreover, violations similar to the one in the present case have been found by the Court, either in relation to the former CCP (see Colozza, T. v. Italy and F.C.B. v. Italy, cited above) or after the entry into force of the new CCP (see Somogyi v. Italy, no.\u00a067972/01, ECHR 2004-IV), and it should be noted that the United Nations Human Rights Committee has expressed the view that Italy breached Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights where a person had been convicted in absentia without having been officially and personally informed of the proceedings against him (see the opinion of 27 July 1999 in the case of Ali Malaki v. Italy). The Court concludes that the facts of the case disclose the existence, within the Italian legal order, of a shortcoming as a consequence of which anyone convicted in absentia who has not been effectively informed of the proceedings against him may be denied a retrial. It also finds that the deficiencies in national law and practice identified in the applicant's particular case may subsequently give rise to numerous well-founded applications.",

The Committee of Ministers' practice has extended the scope of the respondent State's obligations in such matters, requiring, in addition to measures concerning the applicant's individual situation, the adoption of general measures designed to prevent the recurrence of similar violations. In view of the systemic situation which it has identified, the Court would observe that general measures at national level are undoubtedly called for in the execution of the present judgment (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 193-194). The measures must be such as to remedy the systemic defect underlying the Court's finding of a violation, so that persons in a comparable situation to Mr Sejdovic do not have to suffer a similar breach of their rights under Article 6 of the Convention.",
