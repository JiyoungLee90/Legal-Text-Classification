On 19 June 2015 the Tomsk Regional Court held an appeal hearing and heard the applicant and his lawyer. The appellate court noted that the available evidence did not confirm that the applicant had been the event organiser; however, he had still been a participant in the public assembly, an assembly of which the authorities had not been given notice. The court therefore reclassified his actions, found him guilty under Article 20.2 \u00a7 5 of the CAO and reduced the fine to RUB\u00a010,000 (about EUR 165 at the time).",

The applicant, who was not detained at the time, has not claimed that she was not afforded an opportunity to have access to this record or other documents in the administrative case file on that date or over the course of the following days. Nor has she argued, for instance, that it was impossible to make copies of the case file before the case was sent to the trial court or that she did not receive a copy of the administrative-offence record. It is further noted that the applicant was notified of the details of the scheduled hearing on 3 March 2015, about three hours before it began. However, while her application to adjourn the hearing was dismissed, she was afforded an hour to study the case file. It is uncontested that her lawyer, who attended later, requested only fifteen minutes to study the case file. The Court further observes that the applicant, who was assisted by the lawyer at the hearing, availed herself of her right to lodge applications, particularly applications to examine defence witnesses, which were granted by the court. In such circumstances and in view of the scope of the applicant\u2019s grievance, the Court is not convinced that the first applicant was unduly restricted in her opportunities to familiarise herself properly with and adequately assess the charge and evidence against her, and to develop a viable legal strategy for her defence (contrast with Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, \u00a7\u00a7 86-87, 15 November 2007, and Gafgaz Mammadov v. Azerbaijan, no. 60259/11, \u00a7\u00a7 76-82, 15\u00a0October 2015).",

It is unclear how much time the applicant, who was not deprived of his liberty at the time, was given to review the administrative-offence record or other administrative case material, including the written statements by police officers. Even if it is accepted that his case was not a complex one, the Court is not satisfied that the second applicant was afforded adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence, especially in view of the fact that he had no legal assistance during the first-instance trial (see, mutatis mutandis, Vyerentsov v. Ukraine, no. 20372/11, \u00a7 76, 11 April 2013). Before the Court, the Government have not put forward any argument to the contrary.

In the Court\u2019s view, the intended statutory purposes of such a notification procedure (such as affording the authorities an opportunity to take timely and adequate measures to ensure the requisite order for running a particular civic initiative and to secure public safety and the protection of the rights of event participants and others) would normally be fully attainable through the reasonable application of a distance requirement, without there being any \u201cpressing social need\u201d \u2013 relating to the pursuance of any particular legitimate aim \u2013 to apply the \u201creclassification rule\u201d and enforce the relevant prior notification procedure.",

The Court also does not doubt that the applicant\u2019s expressive conduct was peaceful and non-disruptive. The domestic courts considered the situations as a series of group events held in the form of static demonstrations. However, no compelling considerations relating to public safety, the prevention of disorder or the protection of the rights of others were at stake or were relied upon when using this factual assertion to convict the first applicant specifically for not observing the notification procedure and attribute an active role to her (see paragraphs 9, 12 and 13 above). The only relevant consideration was the need to punish the unlawful conduct arising solely from the non-compliance with the notification procedure. In the absence of any aggravating element, this was not sufficient to justify the interference with the first applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression in the circumstances of the case.",

It is also notable that no element of interference arises in relation to any further coercive action such as pretrial arrest or detention, as no such measures were applied to the second applicant in the present case. Thus, the sole element of interference concerns his conviction for an administrative offence which resulted in his being sentenced to a fine. In this respect, the present case is different from many other cases normally involving a combination of at least two elements of \u201cinterference\u201d.",

It is important for associations and others organising demonstrations, as actors in the democratic process, to abide by the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force, in particular those relating to the prior notification procedure (see\u00a0Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2006XIII, and\u00a0Barraco v. France, no. 31684/05, \u00a7 44, 5 March 2009). States may impose sanctions on those who do not comply with this procedure. At the same time, as regards the participants in rallies in particular, the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that a person cannot be subject to a sanction \u2013 even one at the lower end of the scale of, for instance, disciplinary penalties \u2013 for participation in a demonstration which has not been prohibited, so long as that person does not himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, \u00a7 53, Series A no. 202, and, as a recent authority, Kudrevi\u010dius and Others v.\u00a0Lithuania [GC], no.\u00a037553/05, \u00a7 149, ECHR 2015, with the cases cited therein). More generally, it is normally not sufficient that the \u201cinterference\u201d was imposed because its subject matter fell within a particular category or was caught by a legal rule formulated in general or absolute terms; instead, what is required is that the \u201cinterference\u201d was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d in the specific circumstances of a given case (see Perin\u00e7ek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, \u00a7 275, ECHR 2015 (extracts), and The Sunday Times v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, \u00a7 65 in fine, Series A no. 30; see also Novikova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 199). In other words, an unlawful situation, such as the staging of (or participation in) a demonstration without prior authorisation, does not by itself justify an interference with a person\u2019s right to freedom of assembly; the absence of prior authorisation and the ensuing \u201cunlawfulness\u201d of the action do not give carte blanche to the authorities, who remain restricted by the proportionality requirement of Article 11 (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a015051).",

For instance, nothing indicates that the applicant refused to comply with any lawful orders by the police. In fact, there is nothing to suggest that any such orders (for instance, an order to disperse) were given during the disputed demonstration. It is noted in this connection that the Plenary Supreme Court of Russia has indicated that the prosecution of participants for being present during a group event of which no notice has been given is admissible where they do not comply with the specific obligations listed in section 6(3) and 4 of the PEA, namely the obligation to comply with orders given by the police (see paragraph 25 above).",

Thus, with due regard to the presumption of innocence, in this context it was incumbent on the prosecuting party (who was not present in this case) to substantiate that the applicant had knowingly taken part in an assembly of which no notice had been given and had refused to cease participating in it, despite clear and reiterated orders from the police or another public official.
