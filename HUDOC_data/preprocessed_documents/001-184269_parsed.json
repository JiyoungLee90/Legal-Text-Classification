The explanatory note attached to the first of the bills proposing these amendments justified them with reference to the rule of law and the \u201cforeseeability of business activities and legal transactions\u201d, and criticised the manner in which section 646(2) had been applied by the national courts, namely without any assessment of whether a contested payment had reduced the insolvency estate or otherwise damaged the interests of the bankruptcy creditors (see paragraph 27 above). The second note also stated that section 646(2), as applicable at that time, could undermine legal certainty and that it did not offer sufficient protection to persons in a situation such as the applicants\u2019. It criticised the existing risk of indefinitely lengthy \u201csuspect periods\u201d (see paragraph 28 above). The amendments to section 646 introduced in 2013 remedied these deficiencies, most notably by allowing the courts discretion in deciding whether a payment should be considered voidable, by limiting the maximum duration of the \u201csuspect periods\u201d, and by excluding payments made within the insolvent company\u2019s \u201cusual business activity\u201d and for which equivalent goods or services had been received (see paragraphs 25-26 above).",

Russia [GC], no. 54522/00, \u00a7 131, 3 April 2012), it cannot but conclude that, in the circumstances of the present cases, through the application of the original version of section 646(2) of the Commerce Act, the applicants were placed in a particularly disadvantageous position. Factors which appear relevant for a fair balance exercise, such as the fact that the applicants had delivered to company K. the goods for which they had received payment, that this had been done in the course of the normal line of business of those companies and that there was absolutely no evidence of bad faith on the part of the applicants, were not taken into consideration by the domestic courts. Instead, in line with the effective domestic legislation at the time, the applicants were automatically, namely without the national courts having any discretion on the matter, ordered to return the money they had received from company K. As accepted by the domestic courts (see paragraph 17 above concerning the proceedings against the second applicant), the payments at issue had not reduced the insolvency estate or damaged the interests of the bankruptcy creditors. Finally, no evidence has been presented that at the time when they accepted K.\u2019s payments the applicants were or could have been aware of its inability to meet its debts, or that the nature of the transactions they had entered into was such as to damage the interests of the creditors of K.",

The Court notes in that respect that at no point in the domestic proceedings or in the proceedings before it was it argued that it was possible for the applicants to request the return of the goods delivered to K. It is true that the Government argued that it was possible for the applicants to join the insolvency proceedings and claim the money they had lost. However, their arguments in that regard were general (see paragraph 35 above), and they did not contest the applicants\u2019 specific calculations, showing that in their particular case the procedure provided for under section 648 would have been of little, if any, use to them (see paragraph 38 above). Thus, the Court concludes that after the applicants were ordered to pay back the sums they had received from K. \u2212 under a provision that breached the principle of legal certainty and failed to protect their rights satisfactorily (as acknowledged by Parliament) \u2212 they had had no effective means at their disposal to make good their losses.",

The interest rate applied, which is intended to compensate for loss of value of the award over time, should therefore reflect national economic conditions, such as levels of inflation and rates of interest during the relevant period (see Runkee and White v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, \u00a7 52, 10 May 2007, and Vaskrsi\u0107 v.
