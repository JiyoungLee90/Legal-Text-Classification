The Court, like the Commission, notes that the Stockholm District Court did not hear Mr. McGoff in person when it issued a warrant for his arrest in October 1977 and that his detention began more than two years later.

However, fifteen days elapsed between the time when Mr. McGoff was placed in custody in  (24 January 1980) and when he was brought before the District Court (8 February 1980). An interval of this length cannot be regarded as consistent with the required \"promptness\". By way of comparison, reference may be made to the de Jong, Baljet and van den Brink judgment of 22 May 1984 where the Court held that, six days after arrest, the limits laid down by the Convention had already been exceeded (Series A no. 77, p. 25, para. 53).",
