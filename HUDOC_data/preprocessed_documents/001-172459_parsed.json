According to the certificate the applicant had visited the hospital on 10\u00a0March 2007 and had complained of neck and back pain, swelling of the face, dizziness, pain in the testicles and palpitations. It gave the applicant\u2019s blood pressure upon examination at\u00a0140/90 and his pulse at 115 bpm. It indicated that the applicant had \u201cfacial oedema/puffiness; bruises on wrist; testicles tendon, no obvious cut or fracture; thigh myalgia and bruises\u201d. The applicant was prescribed tablets. According to the certificate the applicant had returned to the hospital on 11\u00a0March 2007 because of \u201cpainful loose teeth and jaw\u201d. He was referred for a dental examination and told to rest for four days. The medical certificate is signed and was also stamped by the hospital\u2019s superintendent and certified by a notary on 10 June 2010. There is another signature dated\u00a015 June 2010 but there is no indication whose it is.

The president of the IAIACAP was provided with a police report and open statements by the two immigration officers who had accompanied the applicant throughout the deportation process. Despite the statements made by the police that they had not ill-treated the applicant, IAIACAP\u2019s president concluded that an investigation was called for (see paragraphs 37-39 above). No further steps were taken at that stage following the letter of 28 July 2008 by a lawyer at the Attorney General\u2019s office informing the IAIACAP that the complaint could not be investigated because the applicant had left Cyprus (see paragraph 40 above). That was despite the clear instructions issued by the Attorney General on\u00a05\u00a0December 2007 (see paragraph 123 above). That also resulted in the applicant\u2019s complaint being dismissed by the Ombudsman, who relied on the difficulty of the applicant being abroad and on the limited evidence from the preliminary investigation (see paragraph 35 above). Consequently, an official investigation into the applicant\u2019s complaint was not launched until\u00a014\u00a0July\u00a02009, following communication of the application by the Court, that is, more than a year after the applicant\u2019s alleged ill-treatment had first been brought to the attention of the IAIACAP and the Attorney General\u2019s office. The Court reiterates that regardless of the difficulties in obtaining a statement from the applicant, the State had an obligation to investigate his complaint promptly. It is not an adequate justification to say that the delay was due to internal failures of communication. When the investigator took statements from the applicant and the officers concerned, more than three years had passed since the events in question.",

The Court notes that Po.P. and T.C. stated in their earlier evidence that the applicant\u2019s deportation had gone smoothly, that the applicant had been calm and that they had offered him coffee in the passenger waiting area (see paragraph 37 above).

According to these, when the personal space available to a detainee falls below 3\u00a0sq.\u00a0m of floor surface in multi-occupancy accommodation in prisons, the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 arises. The burden of proof is on the respondent Government which could, however, rebut that presumption by demonstrating that there were factors capable of adequately compensating for the scarce allocation of personal space (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 136-138 and also \u00a7\u00a0114, on the methology of the calculation). The strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 will normally be capable of being rebutted only if the following factors are cumulatively met: (1) the reductions in the required minimum personal space of 3 sq. m are short, occasional and minor: (2) such reductions are accompanied by sufficient freedom of movement outside the cell and adequate out-of-cell activities; (3) the applicant is confined in what is, when viewed generally, an appropriate detention facility, and there are no other aggravating aspects of the conditions of his or her detention (ibid.).",

The Court has already ruled that police stations and other similar establishments which, by their very nature, are places designed to accommodate people for very short durations, are not appropriate places for the detention of people who are waiting for the application of an administrative measure, such as deportation (see, among a number of authorities, T. and A. v. Turkey, no. 47146/11, \u00a7 96, 21 October 2014; Horshill v. Greece, no. 70427/11, \u00a7 47, 1 August 2013 and Efremidi v.\u00a0Greece, no. 33225/08, \u00a7 41, 21 June 2011). On that point, the Court notes that the Cypriot authorities\u2019 practice of placing aliens subject to deportation procedures in police establishments for long periods, including in Block 10, was explicitly mentioned by the CPT in its reports in 2008 and 2012 and in the Ombudsman\u2019s report in 2005, describing such establishments as \u201cinherently unsuitable\u201d for detaining people under immigration legislation for long periods (see paragraphs 105 and 106-109 above). It is true that the CPT\u2019s first visit in 2004 took place almost a year before the applicant\u2019s detention in Block\u00a010, while the second visit in 2008 took place more than a year after his release. However, there is nothing to suggest that the material conditions in Block 10 changed dramatically between 2004 and 2008. This is especially evident in the CPT\u2019s remarks in 2008 that whatever efforts were made for improvement, the unsuitability of police establishments in Cyprus for long-term detention purposes was unlikely to be addressed. The CPT also said in the report of 2012, after several improvements made over the years in police establishments, that it still considered that the situation in such establishments remained unsatisfactory and that such premises were inadequate for detention for long periods of time (see paragraph 109 above).",

The Government submitted that the applicant had been detained in a furnished cell measuring 5.46 sq. m, and that it was likely that he had shared his cell with another detainee (see paragraph 83 above). He had therefore had 2.73 sq. m of personal space. That is also supported by the description of the cells provided to the IAIACAP (see paragraph 89 above). It is therefore clear that the applicant\u2019s personal space in his cell at Block 10 fell below the acceptable minimum standard.",
