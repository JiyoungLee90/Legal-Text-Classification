Moreover, it cannot be argued that the proceedings are still pending only formally, that is, as a mere procedural safeguard enabling the applicant to secure the seizure of any assets, of an otherwise insolvent debtor, which may potentially arise in the future (see, by converse implication, Bal\u00e1zs v. Hungary (dec.), no. 63673/00, 25\u00a0January 2005). To the contrary, as it appears from the case-file, the debtor owns several cars and runs a car mechanic business, which has been registered on his name since at least 1996. Therefore, the failure to enforce the court settlement and the judgment against him until now can hardly be attributed to his lack of means.",

The Court recalls that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position she would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012; and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no.\u00a053431/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 23 October 2003). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violation found. It therefore considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the in-court settlement of 28 May 1986 and the judgment of 9\u00a0January 1989, as modified by the writs of execution issued in the respective enforcement proceedings.",
