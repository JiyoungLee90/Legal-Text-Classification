However, prisoners cannot simply be left to languish for weeks, possibly months, locked up in their cells, and this regardless of how good material conditions might be within the cells.

In fact, the likelihood that a place of detention is very overcrowded but at the same time well ventilated, clean and equipped with a sufficient number of beds is extremely low.

The overall prison population of Croatia has increased by 1,200 inmates to 5,400 (i.e. more than 25%) since the CPT\u2019s last visit in 2007, while the official capacity of the prison estate has risen by only some 400 places to 3,771. Overcrowding is thus becoming more acute within the prison system. The delegation observed the negative impact of prison overcrowding on many aspects of prison life in the establishments visited, notably in Zagreb and Sisak County Prisons. Originally conceived as prisons (zatvori) for remand prisoners and persons serving sentences of up to six months\u2019 duration, 50 percent of the population now held in these establishments are convicted prisoners serving sentences of up to five years. At Zagreb County Prison, the resultant increase in the number of prisoners has meant, for example, that rooms previously assigned for common activities have been converted into cellular accommodation.",

It also envisages a set of additional measures, such as recruiting more staff and enhancing the initial and in-service training provided to staff. The delegation visited the recently inaugurated building at Glina State Prison which can accommodate up to 420 inmates and was shown the building site of a new section of Zagreb County Prison which, once completed in 2016, will raise the capacity of the prison by 382 places. Representatives of the Ministry of Justice informed the delegation that the extension had been funded with the assistance of a loan from the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) and that another loan application with the CEB had been completed for the construction of the new State Prison in \u0160ibenik with a proposed capacity of 1,270 places.",

However, as already stressed by the CPT in its previous reports to the Croatian authorities, providing additional accommodation cannot offer a lasting solution to the problem of prison overcrowding, at least not without adopting, in parallel, policies designed to limit or modulate the number of persons sent to prison. In this respect, the Committee takes note of the efforts invested by the Ministry of Justice since 2007 in elaborating a legal framework and putting into place a probation system at the national level, which includes the possibility for State Prosecutors, Courts and Probation Offices to enlarge the scope and number of persons subject to alternative measures such as community work and protected supervision. At least 15\u00a0percent of the current convicted prison population (i.e. those inmates serving sentences of up to one year) could potentially benefit from non-custodial measures once the new Law on Probation is adopted.",

The first, in Rule 18.3, is intended to compel governments to declare by way of national law specific standards, which can be enforced. Such standards would have to meet wider considerations of human dignity as well as practical ones of health and hygiene. The CPT, by commenting on conditions and space available in prisons in various countries has begun to indicate some minimum standards. These are considered to be 4 m2 for prisoners in shared accommodation and 6 m2 for a prison cell. These minima are, related however, to wider analyses of specific prison systems, including studies of how much time prisoners actually spend in their cells. These minima should not be regarded as the norm. Although the CPT has never laid down such a norm directly, indications are that it would consider 9 to 10 m2 as a desirable size for a cell for one prisoner. This is an area in which the CPT could make an ongoing contribution that would build on what has already been laid down in this regard. What is required is a detailed examination of what size of cell is acceptable accommodation of various numbers of persons. Attention needs to be paid to the number of hours that prisoners spend locked in the cells, when determining appropriate sizes. Even for prisoners who spend a large amount of time out of their cells, there must be a clear minimum space, which meets standards of human dignity.",

For instance in Europe standards ranged from 4 sq. m in Albania to 12 sq. m in Switzerland. Moreover, some jurisdictions prescribed greater space for pre-trial detainees, others specified greater space requirements for women (for example, Iceland, Poland and Slovenia), and others still differentiated between adults and juveniles (for example, Hungary and Latvia).",

For the multi-occupancy accommodation of prisoners this recommendation was 3.4\u00a0sq. m per person, including bunk beds and toilet facilities. The ICRC emphasised, however, that this was a recommended specification and not a standard. It stressed that in practical terms the amount of space required by a detainee could not be assessed only on the basis of a specific area measurement. A number of other factors contributed to the assessment of space requirements, including management factors and the facilities and services available in the prison. According to the ICRC, this reflected a comprehensive approach that provided a more accurate picture of the reality for detainees.",

The ICRC\u2019s initial indication that in such situations 2 sq. m per prisoner should be provided had been subsequently criticised by the experts. The emphasis was thus placed not on the indication of minimum requirement of personal space but the necessity of returning a prison to normal conditions (including minimum space specifications) as soon as possible. In particular, it was emphasised that in such instances it is necessary to avoid a situation in which the restrictions introduced to deal with the emergency situation developed into a chronic deficiency.",

In reality, throughout his stay in Bjelovar Prison, he had had on average only 2.25 sq. m of personal space. The applicant also argued that he had not been provided with sufficient recreational and educational activities or a possibility to work in Bjelovar Prison. The only possibility of movement outside his cell had been for three hours per day, in the period between 4 and 7 p.m. The applicant therefore considered that, in view of his personal circumstances and his young age, the reduction in his personal space had not been adequately compensated for, which had made him feel humiliated and debased.",

They included photographs of some of the cells where he had not been accommodated. Moreover, the applicant referred to a complaint made by other detainees and to an interview given in November 2010 by the Prison Director who had stressed that while the prison administration had managed to increase the number of places in Bjelovar Prison from the original capacity of fifty-three to seventy-nine, at times up to 129 prisoners had been accommodated there. At the same time, the applicant considered that the Government had failed to provide sufficient evidence of strong counterbalancing factors that could have alleviated the extreme lack of personal space.",

The sentence-execution judge had not found a violation of his right to adequate conditions of detention. These findings had been reviewed and upheld by a three-judge panel of the Bjelovar County Court and the Constitutional Court. Likewise, the Ombudsperson had examined the applicant\u2019s complaints and noted that they principally concerned matters related to his transfer to a prison closer to his family. The Ombudsperson also noted that Bjelovar Prison had been recently renovated. Moreover, in the case of Pozai\u0107 v. Croatia (no. 5901/13, 4 December 2014), raising an issue of conditions of detention in Bjelovar Prison dating from the same period in which the applicant had been detained there, the Court had also found no violation of Article 3 of the Convention.

This approach could moreover dissuade States from developing and implementing various measures aimed at improving the quality of life for prisoners. This could be observed in the case of Croatia where, despite the standard of 4 sq. m set out in the relevant domestic law, the overall flexible approach to the question of conditions of detention had allowed for some important steps to be taken in reducing and solving the problems related to the level of prison overcrowding in recent years. The Croatian prisons were at present at eighty-five percent of their full capacity. Moreover, the automatic approach would run counter to the basic principles of the Court\u2019s case-law and, although appearing to be a simple solution, would not secure effective protection of the rights of prisoners. Thus, in the Government\u2019s view, a possibility to rebut the presumption should exist and it should operate in a realistic and practical manner.",

The central factor in this respect would be sufficient freedom of movement within the prison facility and it would be for the domestic authorities to demonstrate that the scarce allocation of personal space was adequately compensated for. On the other hand, the interveners stressed that when the personal space allocated to a detainee fell below 3 sq. m, that should be considered so severe that it should lead to an irrebuttable presumption of a violation of Article 3, and such a situation could not be compensated for or mitigated by other factors.",

Indeed, in the Orchowski pilot judgment the Court applied the same standards for the assessment of minimum personal space under Article 3 with regard to prisons and remand centres (see Orchowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0124), and the same standard was applicable in other pilot judgments relevant for the conditions of detention of remand prisoners (see Ananyev and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 143-148) and serving prisoners (see Torreggiani and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65-69).

In the Court\u2019s view, the strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 arising from the allocation of less than 3 sq. m in multi-occupancy accommodation will normally be capable of being rebutted only where the requirements are cumulatively met, namely where short, occasional and minor reductions of personal space are accompanied by sufficient freedom of movement outside the cell and adequate out-of-cell activities and confinement in what is, when viewed generally, an appropriate detention facility (see, mutatis mutandis, Varga and Others, cited above, \u00a7 77; and Mironovas and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0122).",

Indeed, according to the relevant international standards prisoners should be able to spend a reasonable part of the day outside their cells, engaged in purposeful activity of a varied nature (work, recreation, education). Regimes in establishments for sentenced prisoners should be even more favourable (see further paragraphs 48, 53, 55 and 59 above).",

The standard of 3 sq. m per prisoner means in practice that the inmates constantly breach their so-called personal distance and often enter into the so-called intimacy zone. Numerous studies show that such proximity has a detrimental effect on the personality of detainees. Those who may have doubts about this can easily test on themselves the quality of life in 3 sq. m of personal space. Prison overcrowding not only entails strong psychological suffering but also undermines the aims of the punishment, making the whole resocialisation effort much less effective. In such conditions life in prison easily becomes completely devoid of any sense. Adequate space in prison is one of the preconditions for effective resocialisation. Resocialisation of prisoners living in 3 sq. m per person or less cannot be effective.",

However, the measures taken do not seem to exceed what should be the norm in prisons where the 4 sq. m standard is observed.

This tension between retrospective relief \u2013 the awards \u2013 and prospective relief \u2013 improving the conditions in prisons \u2013 is very real. In an ideal world, awards of damages should prompt governments to respond with measures addressing the underlying issues of inhuman prison conditions, but in the real world that link is far from being so direct and immediate.

Such injunctive relief could cover numerous areas of the daily management of a prison establishment, going well beyond the question of occupancy levels, into areas such as personnel recruitment, training and complaints mechanisms. It is also noteworthy that, unlike the outcome of classical litigation, such injunctive orders usually take years to be implemented and are monitored on a continuous basis by the courts.

It is our view that in order to deliver the best response, the Court should first focus, through the prism of Article\u00a046, on the structural response needed in the specific circumstances of the case before it. It should take special care to identify the underlying causes of the inhuman prison conditions it has established and, where possible, indicate specific policy measures, the implementation of which would then fall within the sphere of competence of the other actors in the field.

In doing so, the Court has disregarded the need for a coordinated, synchronised approach at the international level. The Court has advanced two principal arguments in this respect: the need for a holistic assessment under Article 3 of the conditions of detention, and the difference between the functions of this Court and those of the CPT. We find neither argument sufficiently convincing. Setting the standard that triggers closer scrutiny at 4 square metres clearly does not exclude a holistic approach in evaluating all relevant aspects of the conditions in a specific prison or, indeed, even in a specific wing of a prison. As to the second argument, we find this even more difficult to accept. While the Court and the CPT clearly have different functions, it is perfectly possible, and in our view highly necessary, for those two institutions to use the same standards, in this case the same measurement of 4 square metres of minimum personal space, if they are to achieve the complex tasks they have before them.",

While certain additional activities provided within the prison facility might be such as to alleviate the lack of cell space, the primary factor to compensate for the scarce allocation of personal space in the cell is still the existence of additional space in the common areas. To hold otherwise would imply diminishing the importance of space as a key factor in the Article 3 analysis. Taking this into account, we do not consider that in the present case those counterbalancing factors were sufficient. The extra space available to the prisoners, namely the corridors connecting the cells and the common room, which were accessible during the hours when the cell doors were open, did not significantly increase the overall space available to prisoners. Neither did the two hours allowed for use of the outside yard go significantly beyond the minimum requirement of one hour of outdoor activities. These factors, taken as whole, did not sufficiently compensate for the lack of personal space with respect to the periods during which the applicant had less than 3 square metres of personal space in the cell. However, they were sufficient, to our mind, in order to compensate for the lack of personal space with respect to the periods during which he had less than 4 square metres of personal space.",

The data above show that the applicant spent 29.1% of his detention time with 4 sq. m or more of personal space in the cells and 70.9% with less than that. Of the total amount of days in detention, 20.8% were spent with less than 3 sq. m of personal space in the cells. It is beyond my understanding how the majority can argue that 20.8%, i.e., one fifth of the applicant\u2019s detention days, represents a \u201cshort, occasional and minor\u201d reduction of the required minimum personal space. With such a statistically odd evaluation, the majority totally dilute the common meaning of these adjectives. This is particularly grave in view of the additional flagrant breach of national law, which was aligned with the Council of Europe\u2019s 4 sq. m standard. In fact, the same white-washing exercise had already been performed by the Constitutional Court, which used some Strasbourg case-law to bluntly disregard national law.",

The majority\u2019s decision seems to me to be out of step with the longstanding reform efforts made by the Council of Europe and in the rest of the world in the field of prison law. The EPR are intended to \u201ccompel Governments to declare by way of national law specific standards, which can be enforced\u201d, and these enforceable standards include certain European \u201cminimum standards\u201d: \u201cthere must be a clear minimum space\u201d. The circular nature of the majority\u2019s redundant argument is obvious: when the lack of personal space is justified by an impressionistic image of the general situation of the detention facility, the offsetting exercise becomes a question-begging masquerade to cover up a downgrading of the general level of human rights protection of prisoners.",
