They further submitted, without further details, that \u201ca criminal offence committed by the officers of the military commissariat of the Rostov Region constituted an exceptional circumstance which had prevented the respondent authority from making use of an ordinary appeal in good time.\u201d The Justice of the Peace manifestly failed to apply the amount of the food allowance specified in the domestic law which had amounted to an abuse of power. Therefore, the first-instance proceedings had been tarnished by a fundamental defect, and the supervisory review had been justified, because it aimed at remedying a fundamental error in interpretation of the material law by the lower court (see Luchkina v.

In the present case, it was not demonstrated that the subsequent proceedings for recalculation of the pension was a remedy to exhaust in respect of the legal certainty complaint (see Klimenko and Ostapenko v.

Romania [GC], no.\u00a028342/95, \u00a7 62, ECHR 1999-VII, and Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a056-58, ECHR 2003IX). Departures from that principle are justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Kot v. Russia, no. 20887/03, \u00a7 24, 18 January 2007). The Court further recalls that it has already found numerous violations of the Convention on account of the quashing of binding and enforceable judgments by way of supervisory review in virtually identical circumstances involving retired servicemen from Novocherkassk (see, among others, Zvezdin v. Russia, no. 25448/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030-32, 14 June 2007, and Streltsov and other \u201cNovocherkassk military pensioners\u201d cases v.

As concerns the Government\u2019s submissions that the respondent commissariat\u2019s failure to lodge an ordinary appeal was a result of a serious criminal offence committed by unnamed military officers, the Court notes, first, that such argument was only advanced in the Government\u2019s observations but was in no way addressed in the domestic decisions submitted to the Court by the parties. Second, in the absence of any documentary evidence in support of the Government\u2019s position or any information on the exact scope of the military prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s inquiry, it was not demonstrated that the inquiry in question had actually revealed any evidence of a criminal offence in the applicant\u2019s particular case.

In particular, it was established in identical circumstances that in the absence of a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings a party\u2019s disagreement with the assessment made by the lower courts is not a circumstance of a substantial and compelling character warranting the quashing of a binding and enforceable judgment (ibid.).
