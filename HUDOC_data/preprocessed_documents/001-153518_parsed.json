Bulgaria, no.\u00a046390/10, \u00a7 131, 11 October 2011).

The proceedings in question comprised two parts with different objects and purposes, consisting on the one hand of ascertaining whether the formal requirements for extradition had been met, and on the other of examining whether the criteria justifying the adoption of the precautionary measure remained valid and sufficient. The fact that domestic law has entrusted the same appellate court with this two-fold task constitutes a legitimate choice on the part of the State, but a choice which cannot be relied upon to justify considerable delays in examining the merits of the case. In any event, the Court fails to see how the applicant\u2019s repeated requests, which were justified in principle, since his detention was extended in the absence of any hearing on the merits, prevented the Court of Appeal from scheduling such a hearing at an earlier date (see, mutatis mutandis, Quinn, \u00a7 48). The Court of Appeal\u2019s decisions were based exclusively on the documents at its disposal, were adopted in private in compliance with the adversarial principle (see paragraph 27 above) and mainly concerned the examination of the requirement of maintaining the applicant in custody on account of the risk of his absconding (see paragraph 18 above).",

The Court of Appeal\u2019s task was confined to verifying that the extradition request had been submitted in accordance with the European Convention on Extradition; that the ne bis in idem and the double-criminality principles had been complied with; and that the criminal proceedings were not motivated by discriminatory or political reasons. The court was not entitled by law to assess whether there were any serious indications of guilt (gravi indizi di colpevolezza \u2013 see paragraph 28 in fine above) and no inquiries or investigative activity were necessary (see paragraph 15 above).",
