She was acquitted of cheating (Article 274). The applicant was sentenced to four years\u2019 imprisonment, banned from State service for five years, and had her property confiscated. The court based the conviction mostly on the recordings made by S\u0160 when implementing the model, finding that she had promptly accepted a bribe from him of USD 10,000 on 17 June 1998 and then a further USD 500 on 28 September 1998.

It was established that, in return for the bribe, the applicant had drafted S\u0160\u2019s civil claim (as of the evening of 17 June 1998), had made the necessary arrangements to be appointed as the judge in his case, and had started examining it. The court did not find that the USD 4,000 obtained by the applicant from S\u0160 on 9 October 1998 had been used for any criminal purpose. She was therefore acquitted of any offence in respect of this money.",

The applicant, albeit not eagerly, agrees to take the case, asking [S\u0160] to sell her car. [S\u0160] presented this recording to [the STT] together with his application, stating that [the applicant] demands a bribe ... This was the initial information about the preparation of the offence (Article 4 paragraph 1 of the Operational Activities Act, hereinafter the OAA). Since that [information] was insufficient to undertake operational steps, the STT officers decided to verify it (Article 4 paragraph 2 (2) of the OAA). For this purpose, on 16 June 1998 [S\u0160] was given a recorder to tape secretly his [next] conversation with [the applicant]. It was established during the verification that the applicant has for some time intended to get a newer car ... She ... asked [S\u0160] to sell the car in her possession, and buy a newer car with the money received. [S\u0160] explained to the applicant [the] difference between the value of her present car and the desired car ... [whilst] offering to cover the price difference with his own money, in return for [the applicant] admitting his civil action ... and deciding it in his favour ... The applicant agreed with this proposal, i.e. the preliminary information on [the applicant\u2019s] readiness to accept a bribe was confirmed. The cassation arguments that [the applicant] was provoked into commit the crime are unsubstantiated. The above circumstances confirm that [the applicant] had wanted to take a bribe, in that she immediately accepted the offer without any outside pressure. The recordings also confirm that on 16 June 1998 [S\u0160 and the applicant] agreed upon the specific object of the bribe, a car ... costing 10,000 US dollars. The specific agreement about the bribe corresponds to the preparatory stage of a crime provided for in Article 282 of the Criminal Code. The criminal conduct simulation model was only approved the next day, on 17 June 1998. Therefore [the authorities] \u201cjoined\u201d the crime already being committed, in conformity with the decision of the Constitutional Court of 8 May 2000. ... [While the interests of S\u0160] in applying to file the action ... to a familiar judge was unlawful, ... this fact does not invalidate the criminal conduct simulation model, which served to protect the more important general interest of preventing someone who has accepted a bribe to work as a judge ... . An offer to accept a bribe cannot be considered to be active pressure to commit an offence, which is not allowed by Article 8 paragraph 1 (3) of the OAA, and which would contradict the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 8 May 2000 ... The criminal conduct simulation model [as authorised in this case] confirms that its limits were defined not by a number of actions, but by specifying the Articles of the Criminal Code establishing criminal responsibility for the simulated offences ... On 17 June 1998 the STT officers could not discontinue the execution of the model because it was necessary to establish if the applicant would keep her word - if she were to admit [S\u0160\u2019s] action [on her case docket] and decide it in favour of the plaintiff. The qualification of [the applicant\u2019s] actions depended on her future conduct: had [she] refused to examine the case, her act would have been classified not under Article 282 paragraph 2, but under Article 274 paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code (obtaining property in large amounts by deception). Nor were the confines of the model exceeded in terms of time, in that [it] had been authorised for a year ... The evidence collected in the course of executing the model ... confirm that [the applicant] was indeed trying to keep the promise given to [S\u0160]: she accepted (without the knowledge of the court president) and rectified [his] draft civil claim, gathered favourable evidence, consulted her mother [a lawyer] on this question, and discussed the questions raised by [S\u0160\u2019s] civil case even during her holidays.\u201d",

Furthermore, the inducements provided by the model had not been properly structured, in that the initial payment and acceptance by her of USD 1,000 would have been enough to arrest her and discontinue her unlawful actions as indicated in the model.
