Such a request for an interview amounts to collection of evidence, which should be the function of the parties to the case.

In such cases a certain encroachment upon the principle of adversarial procedure is acceptable since it is related to the protection of one\u2019s rights and freedoms against an action or inaction by a public authority. As a rule, it would be questionable whether a court should be allowed to remedy defects or supplement lacunae in the public authority\u2019s effort to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt. The court\u2019s assistance in adducing proof is only acceptable in a limited number of situations prescribed by law, namely at the request of a party that is deemed to be the weaker one, as in disputes with public authorities.

This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive.

The Court rejects the Government\u2019s argument that Article 29.4 of the CAO provides a trial court with the possibility of requiring the presence of a prosecutor. That provision contains an exhaustive list of people whose presence could be required (see paragraph 33 above), and a prosecutor was not among them at the relevant time.
