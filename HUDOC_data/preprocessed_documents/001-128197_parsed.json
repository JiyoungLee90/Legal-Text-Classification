The record of this action made by the bailiff stated that the judgment could not be enforced because of a violent protest by around 300 Orthodox villagers and the refusal of the head of the Orthodox Parish to unlock the church. It concluded that the head of the Orthodox Parish had been informed that refusing to enforce a court judgment was punishable in law. According to the applicant parish, the presence of the protesting Orthodox villagers each time an attempt to enforce the court judgment took place was due to continual incitement by the head of the Orthodox Parish.",

Greece, 19 March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II). However, a delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances (see Burdov v. Russia, no. , \u00a7\u00a035, ECHR 2002III) and the right of \u201caccess to court\u201d does not impose an obligation on a State to execute every judgment of a civil character without having regard to the particular circumstances of the case (see Sanglier v.\u00a0France, no. , \u00a7 39, 27\u00a0May 2003). The Court notes that State responsibility for enforcement of a judgment against a private party extends no further than the involvement of State bodies in the enforcement process.

Hence, the Court notes that the applicant parish has been requesting enforcement of the judgment in question since 1998. In the initial phase the enforcement was delayed for two years by an extraordinary appeal lodged by the General Prosecutor and which was ultimately dismissed by the courts as ill-founded (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above). Subsequently, in January 2001 an enforcement file was opened by an enforcement officer in respect of the said judgment, at the request of the applicant. However, the enforcement attempts made in the presence of the applicant parish by the bailiff and representatives of the police on 26 September and 8 October 2002 and 26 January 2006 were unsuccessful because of violent protests by Orthodox villagers and the refusal of the Orthodox priest to hand over the keys to the church (see paragraphs 18, 19 and 26 above). The enforcement attempts were continued by the bailiff even after 2006, and were stopped in 2009 with the conclusion that the execution could not be accomplished because of the refusal of the Orthodox priest of the village to abide by any of the obligations set out in the final judgment (see paragraphs 27-29 above).",

In this respect the Court observes that, although present at every enforcement attempt, the police and the gendarmes did not take any action. Nor did they attempt to investigate the ultimate offence of non-observance of court judgments. On this point, and in reply to the Government\u2019s allegation that the applicant parish had failed to submit a proper criminal complaint against the Orthodox priest, the Court notes that the applicant parish did indeed send a proper complaint to the competent prosecutor, although the law does not require a prior complaint for an investigation of the above-named offence to be launched, but that it received no reply (see paragraph 21 above).",

The Court also notes that the domestic law allowed the applicant parish to submit its demands to the courts, who granted its request by way of a final judgment. The obligation to assist the applicant parish in the enforcement of a final judgment does not belong to the special commission set up by Decree no. 126/1990, but to the enforcement authorities. Therefore, under the specific circumstances of this case, and also taking into account the general situation in respect of requests submitted under the special procedure provided by Decree no. 126/1990 by the Greek-Catholic Church, as described in the case of S\u00e2mb\u0103ta Bihor Greek-Catholic Parish (cited above), the Court holds that this procedure could not have constituted an effective remedy allowing the applicant parish to obtain enforcement of the judgment in the current case.",
