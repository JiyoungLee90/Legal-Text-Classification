The Court recalls that in the Loizidou case ((merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 46) it held that it could not attribute legal validity for the purposes of the Convention to the provisions of Article 159 of the \u201cTRNC\u201d fundamental law, concerning the acquisition to the \u201cTRNC\u201d of the immovable properties considered to be abandoned on 13 February 1975. It furthermore considered that Greek-Cypriots who, like Mrs Loizidou, had left their properties in the northern part of the island in 1974 could not be deemed to have lost title to their property.
