The offence for adjudication in connection with the judgment of 9 November 2010 delivered in appeal proceedings was committed in the probation period of the first suspended expulsion order. The nature and seriousness of the offences in combination with the previous sentences for similar offences and the fact that the defendant has now failed to observe the conditions of two suspended expulsion orders is deemed by the Court to provide weighty reasons why the defendant should now be expelled. The fact that a number of the judgments relate to offences committed after the defendant has come of age also makes expulsion appropriate. Against this background, the Court finds that altogether such very serious reasons exist that the defendant must be expelled and permanently banned from re-entry as set out in section 22, subsection 1(vi), section 26, subsection 2) and section 32, subsection 2 (v) of the Aliens Act, in which connection it is observed that the expulsion order is deemed not to be contrary to Denmark\u2019s international obligations.\u201d",

In making an overall assessment, they had attached significant weight to the two robberies committed, one in a private home and one a bank robbery, and to the circumstance that the applicant had prior convictions for robberies, including two convictions after he had attained the age of 18 (see also Boujlifa v.

They also referred to so-called anti-gypsyism in Denmark in recent years and its link to the entry, stay, and expulsion of Roma, and found it crucial for the Court to be particularly alert to stereotypes about Roma, notably if domestic authorities and courts have failed to recognise the right of a Roma as an EU citizen.",

The Convention does not guarantee the right of an alien to enter or to reside in a particular country and, in pursuit of their task of maintaining public order, Contracting States have the power to expel an alien convicted of criminal offences.

However, if a Member State\u2019s decision to expel a settled migrant, lawfully residing in the State in question, interferes with his or her family or privacy rights, protected by paragraph 1 of Article 8, the national authorities are under a duty, provided by paragraph 2 of the same provision, to evaluate the individual situation of the migrant in accordance with the criteria set out in the Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraph 36 above). In the application of these criteria, the Court has not qualified the relative weight to be accorded to each criteria in the individual assessment, as this analysis is, in the first place, for the national authorities subject to European supervision. However, in Maslov (cited above,\u00a0\u00a7 75), the Court made clear that when a case concerns a settled migrant, who has lawfully spent all or major part of his or her childhood and youth in the host country, \u201cvery serious reasons are required to justify expulsion\u201d. It is clear that in the light of the facts in the present case, the Court is called upon to examine whether such \u201cvery serious reasons\u201d were adequately adduced by the national authorities when assessing the applicant\u2019s case and, if so, whether the Court considers itself in a position to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts.",

It was fully aware that very strong reasons are required to justify the deportation of settled migrants (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a075). It found, making an overall assessment, that although the applicant had no ties to Croatia, due to his criminal past, which included two convictions for three robberies committed when he was an adult, the nature and seriousness of the crimes committed, namely a robbery in a private home and an armed bank robbery, both committed during the probation period for the most recent suspended expulsion order, and the fact that the applicant had twice violated the conditions for suspended expulsion orders, there were such very serious reasons justifying expulsion.",

He has also been convicted of other offences against property. In the Court\u2019s view, when assessing the \u201cnature and seriousness\u201d of the offences committed by the applicant, the national authorities were thus entitled to take the view that they attained a level of gravity warranting expulsion unless other counterbalancing criteria militated against imposing that measure in the light of the Court\u2019s case-law. In this regard, the Court\u00a0attaches particular weight to the fact that the expulsion of the applicant did not interfere with his family rights as he is an adult and has not made any arguments to the effect that there are additional elements of dependence between himself and his parents or siblings (see paragraph\u00a035 above). Therefore, the interference with the applicant\u2019s Article\u00a08 rights was limited to his right to privacy. Furthermore, the applicant has no children, thus obviating the need to take into account weighty reasons directed at protecting a child\u2019s best interests. Moreover, and importantly, the\u00a0Court recalls that under its case-law, the evaluation of the applicant\u2019s \u201csocial\u201d and \u201ccultural ties\u201d with the host country, here Denmark, is a criteria to be included\u00a0in the analysis (see paragraph\u00a036 above). On this basis, the Court considers it of importance that the City Court examined the particular situation of the applicant and found that although he has lived most of his life in Denmark he \u201cmust be considered very poorly integrated into Danish society\u201d. In fact, it can be readily deduced from the file that\u00a0the applicant has primarily lived a life of crime and consistently demonstrated a lack of will to comply with Danish law. The Court makes clear that unlike in Maslov (cited above), the national authorities based their decision to expel the applicant not on crimes perpetrated when the applicant was a juvenile.",

Ascertaining whether \u201cvery weighty reasons\u201d justify the expulsion of a settled migrant, like the applicant, who has lived almost all his life in the host country, must inevitably require a delicate and holistic assessment of all the criteria flowing from the Court\u2019s case-law, an assessment that must be carried out by the national authorities under the final supervision of the Court. Taking account of all of the elements described above, the Court concludes that the interference with the applicant\u2019s private life was supported by relevant and sufficient reasons. There are no indications whatsoever that the domestic authorities may have based their decisions on stereotypes about Roma, as it appears to be alleged by the third party intervener, and the applicant never made such a complaint. The Court is also satisfied that the applicant\u2019s expulsion was not disproportionate given all the circumstances of the case. It notes that the City Court and the High Court explicitly assessed whether the expulsion order could be deemed to be contrary to Denmark\u2019s international obligations. The Court points out in this respect that, although opinions may differ on the outcome of a judgment, \u201cwhere the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s caselaw, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts\u201d (see, Ndidi v. the United Kingdom (no. , \u00a7 76, 14\u00a0September 2017; and, mutatis mutandis, Von Hannover v.
