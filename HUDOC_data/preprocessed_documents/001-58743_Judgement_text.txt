The case originated in an application (no. 38971/97) against Greece lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Greek nationals, Mrs Patra Protopapa and Mrs Anna Marangou (“the applicants”), on 17 October 1997.
The applicants were represented by Mr K. Horomides, a lawyer practising in Thessaloniki. The Greek Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr A. Komissopoulos, President of the State Legal Council.
The applicants alleged that they did not have a hearing within a reasonable time in the proceedings they instituted before the Council of State on 16 August 1993.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber called upon to examine the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted according to the provision of Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 24 August 1999, the Chamber declared the application partly admissible.
The applicants are the owners of a 50% share in a plot of land situated in Rhodes in the area of Ayios Stephanos (Monte Smith).
On 8 November 1971 the Ministers of Finance and Culture and Sciences decided to expropriate the plot in question considering that it was of archaeological interest.
The owner of the other 50% share accepted the expropriation and received compensation.
On 19 October 1988 the applicants requested the two Ministers to revoke the above-mentioned expropriation decision because, as they alleged, the property was not situated within the archaeological zone of Ayios Stephanos (Monte Smith) and because the expropriation of their share had not been completed within the time-limit provided for in domestic law. Having received no reply within the time-limit provided for in domestic law, on 2 February 1989 the applicants lodged an application for judicial review (etisi akiroseos) before the Council of State (Simvulio tis Epikratias) challenging the implied refusal of the Ministers to revoke their decision of 8 January 1971.
On 16 November 1989 the Ministers of Finance and Culture and Sciences adopted another decision expropriating the applicant’s share in the plot of land.
The applicant's judicial review application of 2 February 1989  which concerned the first ministerial decision of 1971  was set for hearing by the Fourth Section of the Council of State on 6 November 1990. However, on that date the hearing was adjourned until 22 October 1991. Prior to that date, on 2 October 1991, the applicants filed a document with additional arguments (dikografo prostheton logon akirosis). On 22 October 1991 the hearing was again adjourned until 17 March 1992. On 17 March 1992 the Fourth Section decided to transfer the case to the Fifth Section. On 5 May 1993 the Fifth Section decided to adjourn the examination of the case until 3 November 1993.
Between September 1992 and April 1993 the lawyers were on strike.
On 10 May 1993 the applicants requested the Ministers of Finance and Culture and Sciences to revoke the expropriation decision of 1971, which had been confirmed in 1989. Having received no reply within the time-limit provided for in domestic law, on 16 August 1993 the applicants lodged a second application for judicial review before the Council of State challenging the second implied refusal of the two Ministers. The applicants requested that their second judicial review application be heard by the Fifth Section, together with the first, on 3 November 1993.
However, on that date the Fifth Section of the Council of State decided to adjourn the hearing of both judicial review applications. Further adjournments were ordered on 9 February 1994, 23 March 1994, 6 April 1994 and 1 June 1994.
Then the applicants withdrew their first application for judicial review. Their second judicial review application was eventually heard on 22 June 1994. No decision has been rendered as yet.
