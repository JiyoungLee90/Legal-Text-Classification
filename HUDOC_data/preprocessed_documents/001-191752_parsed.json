These and other related circumstances led the court to conclude that the applicant, company S. and company V. had in fact entered not into two separate agreements but into a single finance lease agreement (finansin\u0117s nuomos sutartis). The court emphasised that, under domestic law, land and natural resources could not be the object of a finance lease agreement.

It considered that companies S. and V. had deliberately concluded a simulated agreement in order to hide their actual intentions. Furthermore, the applicant had to have been aware of company S.\u2019s intention to transfer the land to company V. because that had been explicitly included in the sale agreement which she had signed.

Accordingly, the Court cannot accept the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the applicant had not acquired her property rights in good faith (see paragraph 13 above). As in previous similar cases, it is not convinced that the applicant should have questioned the actions of the relevant authorities instead of expecting the latter to take all measures to avoid mistakes in applying the legislation, especially taking into account the complexity and technical nature of the legal acts governing the process of restoration of land titles (ibid., and the cases cited therein). The Court therefore considers that, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the applicant should be regarded as having obtained her property rights in good faith, and thus should not have had to bear the burden of remedying the mistakes for which the authorities were solely responsible.",
