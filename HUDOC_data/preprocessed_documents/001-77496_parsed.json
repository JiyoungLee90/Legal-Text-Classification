Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. The Court notes that the proceedings before the court of first instance lasted almost 6\u00a0years and that the first hearing was held after fifteen months. The Court reiterates that in cases relating to civil status, what is at stake for the applicant is also a relevant consideration, and special diligence is required in view of the possible consequences which the excessive length of proceedings may have, notably on enjoyment of the right to respect for family life (see Laino v. Italy [GC], no. 3158/96, \u00a7 18, ECHR 1999-I, Kubiszyn v. Poland, no. 37437/97, \u00a7\u00a034, 30 January 2003). The Court therefore considers that the Warsaw Court of Appeal in dismissing the applicant\u2019s complaint that the length of the proceedings in his case had exceeded a reasonable time failed to apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Majewski v.
