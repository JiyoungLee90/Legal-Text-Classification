These amendments were not included in previous drafts discussed with the OSCE/ODIHR and the Venice Commission. The official start of the campaign period in Article 75.2 has been reduced from 60 days to 28 days prior to election day. This means that the equal access provisions to public media will apply only for a few weeks before election day. It also means that any other legal provision which is intended to create equal campaign conditions for registered candidates will only be applicable for a limited time period. While international practice differs in this respect, an abbreviated official campaign period is troublesome when other legal provisions, such as those creating a \u2018level playing field\u2019 for campaigning, are tied directly to the official campaign period or when the reduction of the official campaign period negatively impacts the rights of voters. In the case of Azerbaijan these amendments are introduced only a few months before the elections. As noted by the United Nations Human Rights Committee: \u2018[T]he free communication of information and ideas about public and political issues between citizens, candidates and elected representatives is essential\u2019. If equal conditions for the communication of information to voters are limited to a few weeks before election day, then the right of voters to receive information is significantly limited. In the context of other amendments (see also paragraphs 11, 16 ...), the reduction of the official campaign period, cannot be considered as positive.",

Article 29.6 has been amended to reduce the deadline for the organization of election constituencies from 115 days to 70 days before voting day. Similarly, other deadlines have been reduced, such as for candidate registration and the transfer of funds to constituency election commissions.

The relevant CEC instruction sets as criteria professionalism, ability to conduct factual and legal analysis, experience in the field of elections and existence of high public confidence in their professional activity. In practice, expert groups were composed of commissioners and in some cases also of administrative staff members. The CEC claimed that they did not opt for external lawyers as it would have been difficult to assess whether they enjoy public confidence. It is questionable whether the expert groups added any fact-finding capacity, as was the stated intention when they were introduced, since they consisted of those already working for the election administration and their advisory opinions did not contain detailed argumentation based on the facts or the law.",

In particular, the Court reiterates that Article 3 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1 enshrines a characteristic principle of an effective political democracy and is accordingly of prime importance in the Convention system. While this Article is phrased in terms of the obligation of the High Contracting Parties to hold elections under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people rather than in terms of a particular right or freedom, the Court has held that it also implies individual rights, including the right to vote and the right to stand for election (see Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 63).",

The Court considers that these cases differ from those where the central issue was alleged inequality of treatment (such as, for example, alleged unequal media coverage) of the candidates during the electoral campaign or inequality of campaigning opportunities available to registered candidates (contrast, for example, Communist Party of Russia and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 29400/05, \u00a7\u00a7 107-29, 19 June 2012, and Oran v. Turkey, nos.\u00a028881/07 and 37920/07, \u00a7\u00a7 69-78, 15 April 2014). In the present cases, the applicants\u2019 ability to campaign was impaired by a time constraint, which was a practical consequence of their late registration. The primary issue, therefore, is not, in and of itself, any inequality of treatment or opportunities during the campaign, but whether the applicants\u2019 late registration adversely affected their individual right to stand freely and effectively for election. The timely registration of candidates is crucial in order for them to be known to voters and to be able to convey their political message during the electoral campaign period in an effort to gain votes and get elected. The free choice of the electorate depends on, inter alia, having information concerning all eligible candidates, and receiving it in a timely manner in order to form an opinion and express it on election day.",

The Court has to satisfy itself that the conditions in which the applicants\u2019 individual electoral rights were exercised did not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness (see Namat Aliyev v.

However, that argument is misplaced in the context of the complaint in the present cases, because the complaint does not concern the applicants\u2019 ineligibility to stand for election, as they were indeed eventually registered as eligible candidates. The complaint in the present case is that the applicants\u2019 late registration denied them the possibility to participate in the elections effectively, in breach of the respondent State\u2019s undertaking to \u201chold free elections ... under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people\u201d.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 was not conceived as a code on electoral matters, designed to regulate all aspects of the electoral process. There are numerous ways of organising and running electoral systems and a wealth of differences, inter alia, in historical development, cultural diversity and political thought within Europe, which it is for each Contracting State to mould into its own democratic vision (see \u017ddanoka v. Latvia [GC], no.\u00a058278/00, \u00a7 103, ECHR\u00a02006IV). Under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the States \u201cenjoy considerable latitude to establish rules within their constitutional order governing parliamentary elections and the composition of the parliament, and ... the relevant criteria may vary according to the historical and political factors peculiar to each State\u201d (see Aziz v. Cyprus, no. 69949/01, \u00a7 28, ECHR 2004V). The Court considers that it is not its task in the present cases to give a general assessment of the compatibility of the domestic electoral legislation with the Convention. Its task is limited to the assessment of whether the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 3 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 were breached in the specific circumstances which obtained in the present cases.",

In particular, in the leading case of Tahirov v. Azerbaijan (cited above) concerning the refusal to register a candidate owing to an allegedly insufficient number of valid supporting signatures, the Court found, inter alia, that there were concerns regarding the impartiality of the electoral commissions, a lack of transparency in their actions and various shortcomings in their procedures (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 60-61); a lack of clear and sufficient information about the professional qualifications and the criteria for the appointment of workinggroup experts charged with the task of examining signature sheets (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a063-64); failure by the electoral commissions and courts to take any further investigative steps to confirm the experts\u2019 opinions on the authenticity or otherwise of signatures (ibid., \u00a7 65); and systematic failure by the electoral commissions to abide by a number of statutory safeguards designed to protect nominated candidates from arbitrary decisions (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a066-68 and 69). Similar findings were made in a number of other cases (see Gasimli and Others v. Azerbaijan [Committee], nos. 25330/11 and\u00a04\u00a0others, 17 December 2015; Vugar Aliyev and Others v.

Having regard to the material in the case files and the parties\u2019 submissions in the present cases, the Court notes that they disclose essentially the same problematic issues in respect of the candidateregistration process \u2013 in particular as they pertain to the process of verifying the authenticity of supporting signatures \u2013 as those examined in the above-mentioned judgments. Even though the applicants in the present cases were eventually registered after a series of appeals, the Court finds, having regard to the material in the case files, that the initial refusals to register the applicants as candidates and the subsequent proceedings, up to the point of the respective decisions granting their appeals, disclosed the existence of the same procedural shortcomings as those summarised above.",

At the electoral commission level, the three-day period for examination could be extended for an indefinite duration (see paragraph 72 above), which was subject to, in the Court\u2019s opinion, well-founded criticism by the OSCE/ODIHR (see paragraph 76 above). With three levels of appeal against a ConEC decision (comprised of the CEC, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court), the electoral appeal proceedings in cases concerning refusals to register candidates could theoretically take up to eighteen days (and sometimes longer, in situations where the appeal period was extended by the CEC or where a case was remitted to a lower instance). Since the decision on refusal to register could be delivered as late as on the eve of the official start of the electoral campaign period (see paragraphs 64-65 above), the examination of appeals against such decision could take place after the start of the campaign period, as happened in the present cases. Thus, under this system, a degree of overlap was possible between the period for examination of appeals against refusals to register (which was of variable length, depending on the number of consecutive appeals which had to be lodged in a specific case and on whether the examination by the CEC was extended) and the electoral campaign period (which was fixed at twenty-two days). Consequently, given the possibility of overlap between the time periods allocated for the above-mentioned stages of the electoral process and the reduced length of the electoral campaign period, it was of utmost importance to conduct the appeal proceedings in a timely manner in order to ensure that, should an appellant be successful, he would have sufficient time before election day to conduct his campaign.",

For example, the first applicant\u2019s appeal against the ConEC decision was examined by the CEC in eight days, after the appeal period was extended for an undefined period of time (see paragraphs\u00a0910 above). While technically this was not in breach of the domestic law because there was a lawful extension decision, the fact that at the material time the law did not provide for a time-limit for the extended period was, in the Court\u2019s view, problematic. Furthermore, it appears that, in the first applicant\u2019s case, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 28 October 2010 following his appeal against the Baku Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment was also delivered belatedly (see paragraphs 12-14 above). In the second applicant\u2019s case, it took six days for the Baku Court of Appeal to decide on his appeal against the CEC decision (see paragraphs\u00a031-32 above). In the third applicant\u2019s case the proceedings were significantly delayed owing to the CEC\u2019s and the Baku Court of Appeal\u2019s incorrect findings that he had missed the deadline for appealing (see paragraphs 47-50 above). Even though their findings were eventually corrected by the Supreme Court, a significant amount of the applicant\u2019s potential campaigning time was irretrievably lost.",
