Poland, no.\u00a023779/02, 23 January 2007).

This approach is justified by the fact that the decision by which the domestic court refuses the requests for exemption or grants partial exemption is followed by the court\u2019s request sent to the applicant to pay the required amount of court fees within seven days. Only if the applicant fails to pay the court fees within the time-limit specified is the statement of claim (or the appeal) returned to the applicant, and it is that which constitutes the final decision in a case.",
