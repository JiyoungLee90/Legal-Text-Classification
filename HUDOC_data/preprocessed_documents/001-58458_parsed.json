I find this formulation unfortunate as it makes the judgment unclear as to the Court\u2019s position. In so far as this formulation is not tantamount to a finding of a violation, it \nintroduces a new form of judgment which rules in favour neither of a violation nor of a non-violation and which yet makes an award of just satisfaction under the Article 41.

The operative part ought to have spelt this out explicitly. In short, in my view, when minded to accept a concession by a respondent State of a violation and to make an award of just satisfaction under Article 41, the Court may leave open for resolution another day a general question of interpretation of the Convention \u2013 provided of course that there are no reasons of public policy dictating otherwise \u2013 but it may not leave open whether there was a violation of the relevant substantive Article(s) in the particular case.",
