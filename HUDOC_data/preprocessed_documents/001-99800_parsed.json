The CPT has objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements in closed prisons and those objections are reinforced when, as is frequently the case, the dormitories in question are found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions ... Large\u00adcapacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives ... All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level; further, in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insufficient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions.",

While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility and assessment of evidence, which are primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see, among other authorities, Khan v. the , no. 35394/97, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2000V). Furthermore, it is not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether a particular piece of evidence is necessary and essential to decide a case (see, for example, Elsholz v.  [GC], no.\u00a025735/94, \u00a7 66, ECHR 2000VIII) or, indeed, whether the applicant is guilty or not. The question which must be answered is whether the alleged defects impaired the fairness of the proceedings, taken as a whole. On the facts of the present case, the Court observes that the applicant was fully able to contest the authenticity and admissibility of the evidence at each stage of the proceedings and the courts addressed these arguments either by rectifying the alleged mistakes or rejecting his arguments as unsubstantiated. Thus, in so far as the applicant complained about the use of evidence obtained through coercion, the Court would note firstly that at the trial the applicant seemed to have complained of threats by the relevant officials, and not of physical force, the latter argument having been raised much later in the application to this Court. Further, the grievance has never been raised by the applicant before a competent domestic authority which could investigate the matter by way of a criminal inquiry (see also the Court's conclusions under Article 3 in paragraph 77 above). To the extent that the applicant raised this argument before the courts in his criminal case, the courts examined and rejected it as unfounded (see paragraph 26) and there is nothing in the case file which would enable the Court to depart from these conclusions. That being so, and having regard to the extensive body of evidence which was presented by both parties and then carefully examined by the courts, the Court cannot conclude that the defects alleged by the applicant, if any, adversely affected the fairness of the proceedings as a whole.",

Belgium, 22 April 1992, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a0235B). The Court observes that the applicant failed to exhaust domestic remedies in this respect, since he never raised this issue before the trial court (see paragraph 27), and in any event did not substantiate, either before the domestic appeal court of before this Court, the necessity of calling this or that particular witness, and that the domestic courts' decisions in this respect do not appear arbitrary or unreasonable. Having regard to the facts as submitted by the applicant, the Court has not found any reason to believe\u00a0that the proceedings did not comply with the fairness requirement of Article 6 of the Convention.",
