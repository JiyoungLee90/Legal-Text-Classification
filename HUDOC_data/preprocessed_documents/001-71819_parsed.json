It took the district court several months to fix hearings.

Between 28\u00a0March and 19 December 2002 no hearings appear to have been listed or held. Another delay of approximately seven months was caused by the transfer of the case from one judge to another, between 14 October 2003 and 5 May 2004. In this respect, the Court recalls that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v. , no. 30546/96, \u00a7 57, 3\u00a0October 2000).

In the Court\u2019s opinion, the domestic authorities failed to take adequate steps in order to ensure their attendance. The defendants defaulted on at least thirteen occasions which resulted in a delay of approximately two years and three months. There is no indication that the court reacted in any way to that behaviour, save for sending warnings. In any case, the Court finds it peculiar that after the defendants had received the courts\u2019 warning they did not attend three subsequent hearings and the district court did not take any measures. Accordingly, the Court considers that, the domestic courts did not avail themselves of the measures available to them under national law to discipline the participants to the proceedings and to ensure that the case be heard within a reasonable time (see, mutatis mutandis, Ku\u015bmierek v. , no. 10675/02, \u00a7 65, 21\u00a0September 2004).
