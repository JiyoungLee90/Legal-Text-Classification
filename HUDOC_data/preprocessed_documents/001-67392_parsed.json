It considers, among other things, that although certain particularly acerbic passages of the article paint an extremely negative picture of the  and thus give the narrative a hostile tone, they do not encourage violence, armed resistance or insurrection and do not constitute hate speech. In the Court\u2019s view, this is the essential factor (contrast S\u00fcrek v.  (no.\u00a01) [GC], no.\u00a026682/95, \u00a7\u00a062, ECHR 1999IV, and Gerger v.

Furthermore, the edition of 31\u00a0May 1995 of Yeni Politika, which contained the inpugned article, was seized at the printing office, before being distributed, thus, preventing the applicant to disseminate his opinions to the readers of the newspaper. The Court also takes into account the nature and severity of the penalties imposed when assessing the proportionality of the interference. ",
