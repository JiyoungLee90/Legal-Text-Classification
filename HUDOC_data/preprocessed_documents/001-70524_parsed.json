In this connection the Court reiterates that the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law as regards the reasonableness of the length of proceedings are, in particular, the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and that of the relevant authorities, and the importance of what was at stake for the applicant in the litigation.",

In the present case the Court notes that the  examined only the period of time after the remittal of the case by the appellate court, i.e. after 13 November 2002. The domestic court did not take into consideration the overall period of the examination of the case by the domestic courts as required by the constant caselaw of the Convention organs. In particular, the  did not consider the period between January 1991, when the proceedings started, and May 2002, when the first-instance judgment was given by the domestic court. Despite the fact that the Regional Court noted that there might have been delays at the earlier stage of the proceedings, nevertheless, it dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint that the proceedings in his case exceeded reasonable time as it established that it was called to examine only the conduct of the court before which the proceedings were pending at the time of examination of the complaint.",

On another occasion, the Court found that the domestic court offered sufficient acknowledgement of the infringement of the right under the consideration, despite the fact that the latter examined separately different stages of the proceedings.
