The deputy prosecutor further found that the police officers had acted lawfully during the applicant\u2019s arrest. The applicant had actively resisted arrest and, as a result, the officers had used physical force on him as provided for under Article\u00a013 of the Police Act. They had not had to give the applicant prior notification that physical force would be used against him, since such notification \u201chad been inappropriate\u201d (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0443\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c) in the circumstances.

The authorities did not verify whether the police officers tried to use non-violent methods before resorting to force, and the assessment in this part was confined to the deputy prosecutor\u2019s statement reiterated by the courts that a prior notification of the use of the physical force \u201chad been inappropriate\u201d.

In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR\u00a03,600 covering costs under all heads, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant. The award is to be paid directly into the bank account of the applicant\u2019s representative, as requested by him. The Court rejects the remainder of the claims under this head.",
