In deciding whether there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular court lacked independence or impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important without being decisive. What is decisive is whether his doubts can be held to be objectively justified (see Findlay v. the United Kingdom, 25 February 1997, \u00a7 73, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I; Incal v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, \u00a7 71, Reports 1998-IV,; Cooper v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a048843/99, \u00a7\u00a0104, ECHR 2003XII).",
