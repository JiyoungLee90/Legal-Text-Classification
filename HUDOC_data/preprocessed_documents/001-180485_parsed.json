The court also gave weight to the statement given by F.S. in the pre-trial proceedings under the pseudonym \u201cVardar\u201d. It disregarded his statement of 1 April 2008 (see paragraph 17 above), finding that it had been given under duress and the threat that he or his family would be killed. In this connection it referred to a police report of 24\u00a0January 2008 according to which F.S. had been visited several times by unknown people who had threatened him and his family about the testimony given in the pre-trial proceedings. The motive for the crime was established on the basis of the statement given by B.H. in the pre-trial proceedings. That witness had not been examined at the trial since he had been untraceable. In that context, the trial court referred to an official note by the police of 9\u00a0January 2008 informing the court that B.H. had fled the respondent State and that an arrest warrant (\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430) had been issued against him. The court did not say anything regarding the applicants\u2019 allegations that B.H. had in fact been in the respondent State and could have been located (see paragraph 19 above). In the court\u2019s view, the evidence produced by the defence witnesses was unreliable and aimed at enabling the accused to avoid criminal responsibility. For this reason it considered it irrelevant to examine the remaining witnesses proposed by the defence. The applicants\u2019 defence that they had been at another location at the relevant time was found to be selfserving.",

Germany [GC], no. 9154/10, \u00a7 103, ECHR 2015).

The underlying principle is that the defendant in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. This principle requires not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of their evidence, by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings.",

Furthermore, given that its concern was to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see also Seton v. the United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, \u00a7 59, 31\u00a0March 2016).",

Thus absent witnesses present the particular problem that their accounts cannot be subjected to searching examination by defence counsel. However, their identities are known to the defence, which is therefore able to identify or investigate any motives they may have for lying. In the case of a fully anonymous witness, where no details whatsoever are known as to the witness\u2019 identity or background, the defence faces the difficulty of being unable to put to the witness, and ultimately to the jury, any reasons which the witness may have for lying. However, in practice, some disclosure takes place which provides material for crossexamination. The extent of the disclosure has an impact on the extent of the handicap under which the defence is labouring. It is unsurprising, given the underlying concern in both types of cases identified in Al-Khawaja and Tahery, that the Court has consistently taken a similar approach in the context of anonymous witnesses to that which it has followed in cases involving absent witnesses (see Ellis and Simms v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 46099/06 and 46699/06, \u00a7\u00a7 74 and 75, 10\u00a0April 2012).",

All three levels of jurisdiction which decided the case relied on the witnesses\u2019 fear as grounds for preserving their anonymity. In this connection the Court recalls that any subjective fear by the witness, which needs not be attributable directly to threats made by the defendant in order for that witness to be excused from giving evidence at trial, will not suffice and the courts must conduct appropriate enquiries to determine, firstly, whether or not there are objective grounds for that fear, and, secondly, whether those objective grounds are supported by evidence (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 124). Whereas the Court cannot establish how the domestic courts assessed the reasonableness of the personal fear of the witnesses vis-\u00e0-vis the applicants, it is nevertheless satisfied, in view of the reasons advanced by the Government, which were not contested by the applicants, that the use of anonymous testimony could reasonably be considered justified in the particular circumstances of the case (see paragraph 29 above).",

However, as to whether that evidence constituted a decisive basis for the applicants\u2019 conviction, the Court notes that both \u201cKorab\u201d and \u201cVodno\u201d were the only eye-witnesses who had identified the applicants as the perpetrators of the crime. No other evidence admitted at the trial pointed directly to the applicants as the assailants. The trial court relied on this evidence in order to establish \u201cthe applicants\u2019 presence at the crime scene, the development and dynamics of events\u201d (see paragraph 20 above). In such circumstances, it is clear that the evidence given by the anonymous witnesses was of great weight and without it the chances of the applicants\u2019 conviction would have been at least significantly reduced. Accordingly, the anonymous testimony of \u201cKorab\u201d and \u201cVodno\u201d is to be regarded as decisive evidence in the present case.",

Indeed, the applicants and their lawyers were not present when these witnesses produced oral evidence before both the investigating judge (the applicants were not officially charged at that time) and the trial judge, unlike the public prosecutor, who attended both examinations. As to the possibility of putting written questions to the witnesses (after receiving the written transcript of their statement) indirectly through the court, in the case of Schatschaschwili the Court stated that such a possibility represented a significant safeguard offered to the defence regarding examination of an absent witness who cannot be questioned at the trial (ibid., \u00a7 219). However, regarding anonymous witnesses the Court has also found that the nature and scope of those questions were considerably restricted by reason of the trial court\u2019s decision that the anonymity of the witnesses should be preserved (see Kostovski v. the Netherlands, 20\u00a0November 1989, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 166).

It further observes that the applicants\u2019 claims for just satisfaction under this head are related to their conviction and imprisonment and not to the alleged violation of their right to a fair trial (see, conversely, Iljazi v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 56539/08, \u00a7 50, 3\u00a0October 2013). The Court notes firstly that in the present case an award of just satisfaction can only be based on the fact that the applicants did not have the benefit of the guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) before the national courts (see Me\u017enari\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 71615/01, \u00a7 43, 15 July 2005). It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings at issue would have been had the breach not occurred (see B\u00f6nisch v. Austria (Article 50), judgment of 2 June 1986, Series A no. 103, \u00a7 11). It therefore finds no causal link between the damage claimed and its finding of a violation of Article 6. Accordingly, the Court makes no award under this head (see Papadakis, cited above, \u00a7 111 and Trampevski, cited above, \u00a7 57).",
