The garages were not situated wholly on the expropriated land and although they were used by private individuals they served the needs of the adjoining housing estate; the fourth garage contained an Enemalta (the only producer and distributor of electricity in ) generator.

Even if parts of the land had eventually been allotted to private individuals this did not render the taking of the property devoid of a public interest purpose. In respect of the amount of compensation, the Constitutional Court held that the estimates provided by the applicants were relatively recent and based on the current market value which was not always decisive according to the Strasbourg case-law, whereas the evaluation of the LAB referred to the real value of the land in 1974, the year when the land had been expropriated. Consequently this claim was manifestly ill-founded. As to the last claim, namely compensation for the length of proceedings, the Constitutional Court noted that, although it appeared that a request for a variation of the compensation awarded had been made in the appeal application, this had not been listed as a ground of appeal.Consequently, it could not take cognisance of the matter.",

Furthermore, the notion of \u201cpublic interest\u201d is necessarily extensive. In\u00a0particular, the decision to enact laws expropriating property will commonly involve consideration of political, economic and social issues.

In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference, and a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No.1 only in exceptional circumstances (see The Holy Monasteries v.

The Court observes that the 's acknowledgment of the excessive length of the proceedings satisfies in substance the first condition. However, as far as the second condition is concerned, the Court observes that the domestic court awarded EUR 700 for a delay of twenty years. Thus, the amount awarded to the applicants is at least thirty times lower than the amount that could have been given in Strasbourg (see, for example, Del Bono and Others v. , no.\u00a052968/99, \u00a7\u00a016, 12 February 2002, and Luciani v. , no.\u00a052919/99, \u00a7\u00a015, 12\u00a0February 2002, where the Court awarded EUR 28,000 with respect to civil proceedings which lasted more than nineteen years before one instance). This factor in itself leads to a result that is manifestly unreasonable, having regard to the Court's case-law. The Court therefore considers that the redress afforded to the applicants was insufficient. As the second condition \u2013 that of appropriateness and sufficiency \u2013 has not been fulfilled, the Court considers that the applicants can still claim to be the \u201cvictim\u201d of a breach of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement in the instant case (see Central Mediterranean Development Corporation Limited, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a029-30).",
