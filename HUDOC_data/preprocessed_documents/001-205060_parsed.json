The decisions dispensing with a criminal investigation in the second applicant\u2019s case were quashed by the prosecutor, with reference to various flaws. However, during the resumed inquiry, the authorities made no genuine attempt to establish the circumstances of the attack on the second applicant and identify the perpetrator (see paragraphs 22-23 above). Moreover, it appears that the applicant learned about the prosecutor\u2019s interventions only when she complained to the courts about the refusals to open a criminal investigation (see paragraph 23 above).

In respect of a person who is deprived of his or her liberty, or, more generally, is confronted with lawenforcement officers, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 100-01).

As to the burden of proof in relation to the alleged ill-treatment inflicted in the context of policing a demonstration, the Court found that the applicants were required to make a prima facie case that their injuries had resulted from the use of force by the police before the burden is shifted to the Government to refute those allegations (see Muradova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 107-08). When the cause of injury was in dispute between the parties the Court attached special importance to the fact that the injury was sustained while the applicant was within the area in which the lawenforcement authorities were conducting an operation during which they resorted to the use of force for the purpose of quelling mass unrest (ibid., \u00a7 109).

Further noting the lack of an effective investigation into the applicants\u2019 allegations, and consequently the absence of any alternative and plausible explanations for the causes of the applicants\u2019 injuries provided by the Government, the Court concludes that the injuries described in the medical certificates were inflicted by the police during the dispersal of the political rally on 6\u00a0May 2012.",

However, the Government have not submitted any explanations as to why force had to be applied in respect of the applicants, who were not arrested and did not engage in any acts of violence. In the light of its finding that the force used in respect of the applicants was unnecessary and excessive and thus contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 74 above), it finds that it was \u201cnot necessary in a democratic society\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a011 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention.
