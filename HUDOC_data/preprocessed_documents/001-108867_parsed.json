At the outset, it is important to point out that the question has arisen in a very particular context. The applicants are 35 clergymen and lay employees of the Romanian Orthodox Church (see paragraph 6). Therefore the main question is whether and in what manner the clergy and other employees of a Church have the right to form trade unions. Secondly, what is the role of the State from the point of view of its obligations under the Convention?",

Their role is to help maintain public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society, particularly between opposing groups (see, for example, Leyla \u015eahin v.  [GC], no.\u00a044774/98, \u00a7 107, ECHR 2005XI). It has also acknowledged that participation in the organisational life of the community is a manifestation of one\u2019s religion, protected by Article 9 of the Convention. For these reasons, the Court has held that under Article 9, interpreted in the light of Article 11, the right of believers to freedom of religion encompasses the expectation that the community will be allowed to function free from arbitrary State intervention in its organisation. The autonomous existence of religious communities is indispensable for pluralism in a democratic society and is thus an issue at the very heart of the protection which Article 9 of the Convention affords. Were the organisational life of the community not protected by Article 9, all other aspects of the individual\u2019s freedom of religion would become vulnerable (see Hasan and Chaush v.  [GC], no. 30985/96, \u00a7 62, ECHR 2000XI; Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others v. Moldova, no.\u00a045701/99, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2001XII; and Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Metropolitan Inokentiy) and Others v. , nos.\u00a0412/03 and 35677/04, \u00a7 103, 22 January 2009). In our view this case raises a relatively new issue for the Court as regards the autonomous existence of the religious community in view of a proposal to establish a trade union by some members of that community.",

We note that in Romania members of the clergy, with some exceptions, have the right to form trade unions and that such unions have indeed been registered (see paragraph 84 of the judgment). Nevertheless, there is a certain procedure that has to be followed. In accordance with the 2007 Statute of the Romanian Orthodox Church, as recognised by Government Ordinance no. 53/2008, members of the clergy have to receive the blessing of the Bishop for the establishment of, or participation in, associations, foundations or other organisations (see paragraph 26). In the present case, the domestic courts took into account the explanations of the Archbishop as regards the requirement of his blessing, as well as explanations about the duties of priests within the hierarchy of the Church, and decided that they could not grant the registration of the trade union since it would be contrary to the requirements of the Statute of the Romanian Orthodox Church.",

In their view, the national courts had not sufficiently proved that the trade union\u2019s constitution was incompatible with democratic society or even represented a threat to democracy (see paragraph 76). Secondly, the majority paid particular attention to the analysis carried out by the domestic courts and considered that they had not made a sufficiently careful analysis of all the pertinent arguments (see paragraph 86). Admittedly, one could see problems in the manner in which the Court of Appeal reasoned. We could agree with the argument that, for example, members of the clergy and lay employees of the Church might need to be distinguished. Certainly, this derives from the wording of the Statute of the Church, which provides for the special procedure only in relation to the clergy. There is also an important question as to what law should apply with respect to this dispute, since the facts of the dispute arose before 2008, when the Government took note of the new Statute of the Church, and whether the applicants were aware of the limitations that might be imposed on their rights before that date. It seems that the Court of Appeal did not pay attention to these aspects. At the same time, the applicants themselves did not argue that the clergy and lay employees should be distinguished as to their rights, nor did they attempt to create two different trade unions. The Government did submit that the national courts had tried to identify the nature of the trade union and that it was a difficult question because of the mixed composition of the group of individuals concerned. Finally, the courts came to the conclusion that the intention was to create a trade union within the Church. This conclusion is not contested by the applicants. Their argument is that the trade union did not have any plans to contradict the religious dogma or structure of the Church. The applicants argued that the main purpose was the defence of their social and economic rights.",

In this text one can read that the trade union plans to ensure that all members of the trade union have work which corresponds to their professional training and skills. Among other things, the constitution also mentions that the trade union will organise and finance religious activities. It naturally talks about the right to strike and states that the Archbishop has to report on promotions, transfers and budgetary issues. We consider that in the light of these elements of the trade union\u2019s constitution the national courts could reasonably consider that its creation would challenge the traditional hierarchical structure of the Church and the manner in which decisions were taken within it. The constitution does not show that the sole purpose of the trade union members was to communicate with the State authorities in view of the fact that they had employment contracts which were in some manner recognised by the State. It also transpires from the various submissions of the parties to be found in the case file that in the background to this case there were disagreements within the Church. If that is the case, the national courts are certainly better placed to assess the facts.",

Unfortunately, the Chamber does not examine the main tension that the facts present, namely the collision between the principle of the autonomous existence of a religious community, as protected by Articles 9 and 11, and the right to form trade unions, as protected by Article 11 (see point 2 above). While we agree with the majority that it is important to find the right balance between, on the one hand, the freedom of religion of the Church and its members, and its autonomy, and, on the other, the protection of fundamental human rights, we do not find that the assessment by the national courts of this very delicate situation was unreasonable. Consequently, we do not find a violation of Article 11 and we do not endorse the just satisfaction awarded.",
