It originated in an application (no. 29202/95) against the Kingdom of the Netherlands lodged with the Commission under former Article 25 by a Netherlands national, Mr\u00a0Herman Olivier Zoon (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 16 June 1995. The applicant alleged that he was not provided with a copy of the complete version of a judgment convicting and sentencing him at a time when he had to decide whether to lodge an appeal. In its report of 4 December 1998 (former Article 31 of the Convention) [Note by the Registry. The report is obtainable from the Registry.], the Commission concluded by seventeen votes to seven that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (b).",
