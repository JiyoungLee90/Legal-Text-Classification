However, as stated above, while this element is to be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 and may justify a longer period of detention than in a case concerning an individual offender, a member of an organised criminal group is entitled to the protection against unreasonably lengthy detention afforded by this provision (see paragraphs 52 and 58 above). As in other numerous similar detention cases, the authorities did not justify the applicant\u2019s continued detention by relevant and sufficient reasons (see\u00a0paragraphs\u00a05357 above). Moreover, as demonstrated by the ever increasing number of judgments in which the Court has found Poland to\u00a0be\u00a0in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in respect of applicants involved in\u00a0organised crime, the present case is by no means an isolated example of\u00a0the imposition of unjustifiably lengthy detention but a confirmation of\u00a0a\u00a0practice found to be contrary to the Convention (see, among many other examples, Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, 4 May 2006; K\u0105kol\u00a0v.\u00a0Poland, no. 3994/03, 6 September 2007; Malikowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a015154/03, 16 October 2007 and also Hilgartner v. Poland, no.\u00a037976/06, \u00a7\u00a7 46-48, 3 March 2009). Consequently, the Court sees no\u00a0reason to diverge from its findings made in Kauczor as to the existence of a structural problem and the need for the Polish State to adopt measures to remedy the situation (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62 ).",
