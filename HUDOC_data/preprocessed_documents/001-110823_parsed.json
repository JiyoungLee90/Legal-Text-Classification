They pointed out that the applicant had been suspected of having committed a serious and particularly serious criminal offence and that, being a police officer, he could have used his professional experience and connections to obstruct the investigation and influence witnesses. The Government referred, in particular, to a witness interview of a certain Ms P., an eyewitness to the incident imputed to the applicant, who stated that police officers had threatened her with violence if she testified against the applicant. In the Government\u2019s submission, at the trial Ms P. had changed the statements incriminating the applicant she had made during the preliminary investigation, instead stating that he had not assaulted the victim. The Government therefore argued that, by keeping the applicant in detention, the authorities had protected other persons involved in the criminal proceedings in that case and avoided a miscarriage of justice. They also pointed out that the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand was then deducted from the term of imprisonment imposed on him by the judgment of 22 November 2004.",

Russia, no. 6847/02, \u00a7 180, ECHR 2005X (extracts)). Although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v. , 26 June 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 207; Ilijkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a081, 26 July 2001; Goral v.

This is particularly true in cases, such as the present one, where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 was determined by the prosecution without judicial review of whether the evidence collected supported a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the imputed offence (see Rokhlina v.\u00a0Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7\u00a066, 7 April 2005).",

The Court reiterates in this respect that it is incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish the existence of concrete facts relevant to the grounds for continued detention. Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina, cited above, \u00a7 67, and Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 84-85).",

They referred, in particular, to statements of a certain witness P., who had alleged that she had been threatened by police officers if she testified against the applicant, and who at the trial had repudiated her statements incriminating the applicant which she had made at the pre-trial stage (see paragraph 24 above). The Court would be prepared to accept that such an argument could be regarded as \u201crelevant and \u201csufficient\u201d in the applicant\u2019s situation. It notes, however, that it was only on one occasion that a domestic court referred to the applicant\u2019s professional status and his ability to influence witnesses if at large, and namely when the applicant\u2019s initial detention on remand was authorised in the decision of 10 September 2003 (see paragraph 7 above). Even on that occasion, the court merely referred to the applicant\u2019s ability to influence witnesses, without going into any details similar to those indicated by the Government. None of the further court orders by which the applicant\u2019s detention was extended ever mentioned the applicant\u2019s professional status as the reason for his continued detention. In fact, on one occasion a domestic court stated in its extension order that the applicant could influence witnesses or obstruct the investigation (see paragraph 8 above), then three times merely stated that the preventive measure applied should remain the same (see paragraphs 1012 above), and on another two occasions referred to the applicant\u2019s personality and suggested that he may obstruct the establishment of the truth in his case because he had pleaded innocent (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above).",

The judiciary never specified why it considered the risk of his absconding or interfering with the witnesses or with the course of justice to exist and to be decisive. Moreover, the preliminary investigation in the present case appears to have ended by 28 November 2003, when the case file was sent to a court for trial, but the applicant remained in detention on remand for another year, until 22\u00a0November 2004. The Court reiterates in this connection that whilst at the initial stages of the investigation the risk that an accused person might pervert the course of justice could justify keeping him or her in custody, after the evidence has been collected that ground becomes less strong (see Mamedova v. , no. 7064/05, \u00a7 79, 1 June 2006).",
