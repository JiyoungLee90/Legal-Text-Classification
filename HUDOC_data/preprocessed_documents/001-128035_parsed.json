When reviewing administrative decisions the courts were bound to quash them if they found that they were inconsistent with the object and purpose of the law, which was exactly her case: the Minister\u2019s decision was inconsistent with the purpose of section 655(3) of the 1991 Act, which was to protect the public interest by disqualifying liquidators who, through a failure to abide by their duties, had imperilled or directly harmed the interests of the participants in insolvency proceedings. The 1991 Act made provision for lighter sanctions in its section 663 (see paragraph\u00a027 below). The sanction envisaged in section 655(3) was the harshest among those capable of being imposed on a liquidator, because its effect was to deprive the person concerned of the capacity to serve as a liquidator of any company, which was clearly disproportionate to the seriousness of the breach imputed to the applicant. It was impermissible to resort to the most severe measure in relation to a mere failure to comply with a non-decisive time-limit that had not harmed anyone\u2019s rights.",

Even where an administrative authority could choose between two or more viable and equally lawful alternatives, its choice had to be consistent with the object and purpose of the law. The corollary of that was that the use of powers for an ulterior purpose would amount to a misuse of powers. Compliance with those requirements was part of the lawfulness of the administrative decision, and that matter was therefore amenable to judicial scrutiny.",

The expediency of that regulatory setup was a matter of legislative policy. Indeed, the three-member and five-member panels of the Supreme Administrative Court had made similar points. It was also important to emphasise that before resorting to that measure, the Minister had to establish the facts and allow the person concerned to make representations and put forward evidence.

The applicant went on to note the discrepancy between the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s ruling that the Minister of Justice enjoyed discretion whether to strike her off that list and the Government\u2019s submission that he had no such discretion. She was of the view that even where an administrative authority had discretion, the courts should have jurisdiction to review all aspects of its decision.

The Court is not a court of appeal from the national courts (see, as recent authorities, Yordanova and Toshev v. Bulgaria, no. 5126/05, \u00a7 65, 2\u00a0October 2012, and Fazliyski v. Bulgaria, no. 40908/05, \u00a7 56, 16 April 2013), and it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by those courts unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Cs\u0151sz v. Hungary, no. 34418/04, \u00a7 33, 29 January 2008, and Fazliyski, cited above, \u00a7 56). It follows that the Court cannot, in the context of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, determine whether the decision of the Minister of Justice to strike the applicant off the list of persons qualified to act as liquidators of insolvent companies was lawful or justified, or whether the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s rulings in relation to that decision were correct in terms of Bulgarian law. The Court\u2019s task is confined to examining whether the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court were fair and otherwise in compliance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1.",

That was in line with that court\u2019s established case-law in that domain, according to which it was competent to verify whether the acts or omissions imputed to the liquidator had in fact taken place and could indeed be characterised as breaches of duty (see paragraph 31 above). It is also clear that that court could have quashed the Minister\u2019s decision on a number of grounds, including if the decision had been reached on the basis of a misconception of fact or law, there had been no proper enquiry or a lack of due reasoning, or on procedural grounds (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above).",

For instance, most recently in Fazliyski (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 56-63) the Court found a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of a refusal on the part of the Bulgarian Supreme Administrative Court to review an assessment, carried out by an expert administrative body and triggering automatic dismissal from work, that a major at the National Security Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs was mentally unfit for work at the Ministry. The Court, noting that under Bulgarian law the decision of the Minister of Internal Affairs to dismiss the applicant from his post had not been a discretionary one, specifically said that the case was not concerned with the intensity with which the domestic courts should scrutinise the exercise of administrative discretion (ibid., \u00a7 58).",

The applicant pleaded the point before both of those panels, raising a number of arguments in that regard (see paragraphs 13 and 18 above). Even though the three-member panel replied to some of those arguments, most notably to the one that any delay on the applicant\u2019s part had not adversely affected the interests of the participants in the insolvency proceedings (see paragraph 16 above), ultimately both the three-member and the five-member panels found themselves unable to review the proportionality of the measure taken against the applicant (see paragraphs 16, 20 and 21 above).",

However, it cannot be overlooked in that connection that section 655(3) did not envisage a range of gradated sanctions \u2013 under its terms the Minister could either strike a person off that list or refrain from taking any action in relation to that person. For the Supreme Administrative Court, the Minister\u2019s decision was in line with the object and purpose of the law. That court also found that the applicable law did not require that the Minister should act only where the breach was \u201cserious\u201d (see paragraphs 16 and 21 above). Nor does it appear that at the relevant time Bulgarian law clearly spelled out a general principle that all administrative decisions have to be strictly proportionate to the aim sought to be attained by their issuing.

Nor had the interference caused the applicant to bear a disproportionate burden, because it had not deprived her of her main professional capacity and clientele as a practising lawyer, and had not had a negative effect on those.",

The applicant had had the legitimate expectation that she would be able successfully to develop her practice as a liquidator. That expectation was based on the fact that in the very beginning of her career she had been able to earn higher than the average income.

Such clientele has, in many respects, the nature of a private right and constitutes an asset and hence a possession within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. This applies for instance to law and other professional practices and their clientele. In cases involving such practices, a restriction on the applicant\u2019s right to practise the profession concerned \u2013 such as a refusal to register an applicant on a professional list \u2013 significantly affects the conditions of his or her professional activities and reduces the scope of those activities. Where, as a consequence of the restrictions, the applicant\u2019s income and the value of his or her clientele and, more generally, his or her business, fall, this gives rise to an interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 89-90, with further references). Goodwill may also be an element in the valuation of a professional practice, but where an applicant refers to the value of his or her business based upon the profits generated by the business, or the means of earning an income from the business, as \u201cgoodwill\u201d, this reference is to be understood as a complaint in substance of loss of future income (ibid., \u00a7 93).",

In order for that Article to apply, it must be established that there was an underlying professional practice of a certain worth that had, in many respects, the nature of a private right and thus constituted an asset. The Court does not consider that this was the case, for two reasons. Firstly, the applicant has not shown that she had built up a clientele or developed a goodwill in relation to her services as a liquidator (contrast Buzescu v. Romania, no. 61302/00, \u00a7 82, 24 May 2005, and Malik, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 97 and 99). The only evidence that she submitted in that regard was a note detailing the remuneration that she had received for her services in relation to company T., and there is no indication that she has ever served as the liquidator of another company. Secondly, it is open to question whether a liquidator, whose appointment in relation to a particular insolvent company is in each case dependent on a judicial decision (see paragraph 26 above), can at all be regarded as having a clientele in the same way as, for instance, a lawyer in private practice. Indeed, it is hardly surprising in this connection that the applicant, apart from practising as a liquidator, had not given up her concurrent practice as a private lawyer. Therefore, although she could validly argue that the Minister\u2019s decision to strike her off the list of persons qualified to act as liquidators of insolvent companies affected her \u201ccivil rights\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 53 above), it does not automatically follow that she can be regarded as having had a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. While it is in the interests of the coherence that those two concepts should be interpreted in a consistent way (see Stec\u00a0and\u00a0Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and\u00a065900/01, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2005-X), they cannot necessarily be regarded as identical in all situations.",

We cannot but note that in issuing his decision the Minister did not indicate any such purpose or object. In fact, he was reacting to a request of the management of the State-owned company T., whereas to our best knowledge the duty of a liquidator to present the list in question to the insolvency court pursues as a matter of principle the protection of the interests of the other parties to the insolvency proceedings \u2013 that is to say, the creditors of that company. In the present case it has not been submitted that the creditors complained of the applicant\u2019s delay or that it resulted in any harm for the public or private interests or for the proper conduct of the insolvency proceedings. Quite to the contrary, the company management\u2019s attempts before the insolvency courts to have the applicant removed were unsuccessful (paragraph 7 of the judgment). While it is true that the domestic courts indicated in abstracto that the legislature pursued legitimate aims in setting certain time-limits, neither the Minister nor the courts examined the extent to which the decision could be seen to pursue any such aims in casu.",

No such objection was raised by the respondent Government and it appears from the domestic law and practice as well as from the binding decisions of the Supreme Court that in reviewing administrative decisions the courts were bound to verify whether they were lawful and consistent with the object and purpose of the law. Where that was not the case, or where the nature of the administrative decision made it impossible for the courts to decide the case on the merits, the courts had to quash the administrative decision and refer the case back to the administrative authority with instructions on the interpretation and application of the law (paragraphs 33 to 38 of the judgment). Even if the argument that no such general principle was explicitly spelled out in the national law were correct (and we believe that it is not), such an argument seems irrelevant for the purposes of examining the compliance of the domestic proceedings with the requirements of Article 6 regarding access to a court for the purpose of the determination of a dispute over the applicant\u2019s civil right.",

While indeed the decisions of the Minister to authorise persons qualified to act as liquidators of insolvent companies may be seen as requiring special knowledge and involving a certain sensitivity, the decision to withdraw the applicant\u2019s name from this list was not based on any findings that she was no longer fit or appropriate to exercise this profession. Moreover, the national law subjected the applicant\u2019s proper conduct as a liquidator to the parallel scrutiny of the insolvency courts (paragraph 27 of the judgment), which were equally competent to sanction or dismiss her in the event of failure to perform her functions, depending on the gravity of such failures. In these circumstances we fail to agree that in the present case the issue of the lawfulness of the Minister\u2019s decision was not amenable to judicial review, or that \u201cthe scope of the control exercised by the courts over the exercise of such administrative discretion may vary according to the subject-matter of the decision under challenge\u201d (paragraph\u00a062 in fine of the judgment). As already indicated, in our understanding the subject matter of the court proceedings was the extent to which the decision in question could be seen as reasonably pursuing any lawful purpose. We fail to see how the executive body can be more competent than the courts established precisely for the purpose of examining this matter.",

However, once this legislation defines the applicant\u2019s right as a civil one within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention and provides for judicial review over acts of the executive which affect it, this legislation cannot in itself be seen as sufficient to limit the applicant\u2019s right to a tribunal for the purposes of determination of the merits of the complaints in examining the dispute over that civil right. If the scope of essential jurisdiction can be whittled down by domestic legislation, or by the choice of the national courts to limit their own competence to a mere and pointless re-examination of the facts of a case, the guarantees provided by Article 6 become worthless.",

While we agree that the applicant had formal access to two instances of court proceedings for the examination of questions of fact, we fail to see how this resulted in a determination of the dispute over the questions of lawfulness raised in the applicant\u2019s appeals.
