The court concluded that the applicant\u2019s transfer had been carried out for factual reasons \u2013 the deteriorating security situation in the war zone which could lead to the applicant\u2019s escape from prison or his death. The court further noted that the applicant had been convicted of murder by which the right to life was violated, and that states have positive obligations to protect this right. It finally held that the lack of procedure for recognition of a foreign judgment was proportionate to the obligation to enforce a prison sentence for murder especially given that the applicant had access to the Constitutional Court which had the power to review the legality of his detention and that he had access to other procedures available to any other prisoner in Serbia, including the procedure for applying for a\u00a0pardon.",

He was then transferred to a Serbian prison to serve his sentence. The Court further notes that the Serbian authorities conducted no proceedings for the recognition of a foreign decision as prescribed by the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code then in force (see\u00a0paragraph 20 above). The Supreme Court of Cassation took the view that the omission of such procedure in the cases substantially similar to the present one was unlawful (see paragraph 22 above). The reasoning of the Constitutional Court with regard to the same issue does not contradict this conclusion since it also found that the relevant procedure was not followed in the applicant\u2019s case. The Constitutional Court, however, took the view that the applicant\u2019s right to liberty was not violated because his detention was \u201cproportionate\u201d to the crime he had committed (see paragraph 17\u00a0above).",

In that respect, the Court notes that detention on the basis of a decision of a foreign court which has not been recognised by Serbian authorities in an appropriate procedure is ipso facto unlawful under the rules of domestic law (compare and contrast Drozd and Janousek v.\u00a0France and Spain, 26 June 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 107 and 110, Series A no. 240). It is clear that, in the present case, the domestic authorities did not implement the appropriate procedure required by domestic law for recognition of a foreign decision in criminal matters. The Court finds that given that the applicant was detained on the basis of a non-domestic decision which had not been recognized domestically, and in the absence of any other basis in domestic law for the detention, the requirement of lawfulness contained in Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 was not met. The Court, therefore, finds that the applicant\u2019s detention between 7 July 2010 and 15 November 2012 was unlawful.",
