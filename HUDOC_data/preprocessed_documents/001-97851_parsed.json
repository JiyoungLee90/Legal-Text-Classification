He did not provide the authorities with any physical or other identifying details of the alleged perpetrators.

The Court is aware that this report lacks details and falls significantly short of the standards recommended by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), which are regularly taken into account by the Court in its examination of cases concerning illtreatment (see, inter alia, Akko\u00e7 v.

All the evidence must normally be produced in the presence of the accused at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. However, the use as evidence of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with paragraph 1 of Article 6, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. On this point, the Court relies on the basic principles laid down in its judgments concerning the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6 (see, in particular, Imbrioscia v. , 24 November 1993, \u00a7 36, Series A no.\u00a0275; \u00d6calan v.

This right presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained by coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Jalloh, \u00a7 100, and Kolu, \u00a7 51, both cited above).

However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, a waiver of the right to take part in the trial must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see Poitrimol v. France, 23 November 1993, \u00a7 31, Series A no.\u00a0277-A). Furthermore, it must not run counter to any important public interest (see H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, 21 February 1990, \u00a7 66, Series A no.\u00a0171-A). The Court has also pointed out that, before an accused can be said to have implicitly, through his conduct, waived an important right under Article 6 of the Convention, it must be shown that he could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be (see Jones v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 30900/02, 9\u00a0September 2003).",

The Court further notes that when the applicant was questioned by two police officers on 13 January 2002 and subsequently by the judge at the Bursa Criminal Court on 14 January 2002 he was informed of his legal rights, including his right to remain silent and his right to legal assistance, which he appears prima facie to have waived. However, prior to that time the applicant had already confessed in circumstances unknown to the Court owing to the absence of a verbatim record, and had as a consequence participated in a number of reconstructions of events during which he made detailed incriminating statements. These statements were later used to convict him. In this connection, the Court is not convinced that the presence of an undated, pre-printed and signed document in the case file demonstrates with certainty that the applicant was properly informed of his right to a lawyer and his right to remain silent (see paragraph 11 above) prior to his confession and subsequent participation in a number of reconstructions of events. In such circumstances it cannot be said, therefore, that the applicant had unequivocally and intentionally waived his rights under Article 6 (see, mutatis mutandis, Seyithan Demir v. Turkey, no.\u00a025381/02, \u00a7\u00a041, 28\u00a0July 2009, and Sava\u015f v. Turkey, no. 9762/03, \u00a7\u00a070, 8\u00a0December 2009).

Neither the assistance subsequently provided by a lawyer nor the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings could cure the defects which had occurred while the applicant was in custody (see, in particular, Kolu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062). In this connection, the Court attaches importance to the fact that, despite the severity of the applicant's sentence and the fact that the information obtained from the applicant during the reconstruction of events served to convict him, there appears to have been no close scrutiny on the part of the domestic courts as to whether it could be said that the applicant had unequivocally waived his right to a lawyer and to remain silent prior to his undocumented confession.",
