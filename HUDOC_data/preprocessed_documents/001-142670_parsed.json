The Court notes that the refusal had a decisive impact on the applicant\u2019s personal situation \u2013 in the absence of the required clearance, he was unable to continue to work in the position in which he had served for seven years, which undeniably had clear pecuniary repercussions for him. The link between the decision not to grant the applicant security clearance and his loss of income was certainly more than tenuous or remote (see Boulois v.

Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question, and secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State\u2019s interest (ibid., \u00a7\u00a062).",

Furthermore, it is evident that the domestic courts did examine the applicant\u2019s claim on the merits (see paragraphs\u00a015-19 above), which attests to the existence of an actionable dispute (see also Dzidzheva-Trendafilova v.

Therefore Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 is applicable in relation to the proceedings in which the applicant sought to challenge the legality of his dismissal from the Border Guard Service.

Neither is this conclusion altered by the principles set down in the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment that was adopted more than a year later (paragraphs\u00a022-28 above; see also Juri\u010di\u0107 v.

In any case, the Court observes that the Government have failed to explain why the applicant\u2019s attempt to challenge the constitutionality of the provisions of domestic legislation at issue in this case was to be disregarded for the purposes of calculating the start date of the six-month period. In several cases brought against Latvia the Government have insisted that the applicants should have challenged the legal provisions invoked in the Constitutional Court. The Court has indeed accepted that this is a remedy for the purposes of the Convention where the applicant calls into question a provision of Latvian legislation or regulations as being contrary, as such, to the Convention, and the right relied on is among those guaranteed by the Latvian Constitution (see, for example, Gri\u0161ankova and Gri\u0161ankovs v.\u00a0Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a036117/02, ECHR 2003II (extracts), and Latvijas Jauno Zemnieku Apvien\u012bba v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a014610/05, 17\u00a0December 2013, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04453).Therefore the constitutional proceedings in question are not an example of \u201cmisconceived applications to bodies or institutions which have no power or competence to offer effective redress\u201d (see Beiere v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a030954/05, \u00a7\u00a038, 29\u00a0November 2011, with further references) and therefore the decision of the Constitutional Court of 23\u00a0April 2003 must be considered as the final decision for the purposes of calculating the six-month time-limit.

In addition, it appears from the way the applicant\u2019s additional submissions were worded that he had not been given an opportunity to comment on allegations that he had links with a former KGB employee, had been involved in the cover-up of illegal activities of border guards, and had brandished a firearm while drunk. From the wording of the Prosecutor General\u2019s decision it appears that it was these allegations, and not the applicant\u2019s rank in the Soviet Army or his prior membership in the Communist Party that served as the reason why his application for security clearance was refused. It has not been disputed by the Government that the applicant was never asked for any further information, either by the director of the SAB or by the Prosecutor General.

This is clear from paragraphs 69 and 70, and then again from paragraph\u00a074, where it is stated that \u201cthe appeal court\u2019s failure to determine the validity of the reasons given for the applicant\u2019s absence from the hearing and the subsequent decision to declare the applicant\u2019s absence unjustified and to hold the hearing in his absence rendered the proceedings as a whole unfair, in that the applicant was unable to benefit, as much as is [recte: was] possible in the specific context of access to State secrets, from an adversarial procedure\u201d.",

It suggests that, had the Riga Regional Court adjourned the hearing of 23 January 2002, thereby allowing the applicant to be present at some subsequent hearing, then in that case there would have been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1. However, as is rightly pointed out in paragraph 71, it is highly speculative to suggest that the applicant\u2019s presence on 23 January 2002 would have made any difference. In other words, even if one takes into consideration the fact that that court, at the hearing of 23 January 2002, \u201cwas the last instance with full jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law\u201d (see paragraph 70), the problem did not really lie with the procedural decision not to adjourn; if \u2013 which I do not believe to be the case \u2013 there was a problem of fairness or of access to a court, this lay elsewhere.",

As pointed out in paragraph 42 of the judgment, the Civil Procedure Law as then in force contained provisions on the non-appearance of parties and on adjournment of proceedings which are similar to those found in many other jurisdictions. If the court considered the reason for the absence of a party justified, then, in accordance with section 209(2), it was obliged to postpone the hearing. It was therefore up to the party alleging that he or she was not able to attend the hearing to prove to the satisfaction of the court that there was a valid reason for staying away \u2013 otherwise parties could deliberately delay proceedings on the flimsiest of excuses. Not only did the certificate provided by the applicant fail to give any reasons why he could not attend the hearing on 23\u00a0January 2002, but there was also nothing to support the applicant\u2019s claim (presumably made in the application for adjournment, to which the certificate was attached) that he had been told \u201cto stay in bed\u201d for a number of days (see paragraph 16). It is true that what was at stake for the applicant in the case before the Riga Regional Court was of considerable importance, but that in itself, if anything, increased the burden upon the applicant to explain properly to the court why he could not attend the hearing \u2013 it was a burden that he could have easily discharged by submitting a medical certificate detailing his medical condition(s) instead of the pre-typed form presumably used for obtaining or registering for sick leave from one\u2019s place of work. There is nothing in the majority judgment to suggest that this was not procedurally possible.",

In short, I am unable to find anything wrong with the way in which the Riga Regional Court proceeded in dismissing the applicant\u2019s application for an adjournment on 23 January 2002. Moreover, even taking the proceedings as a whole, I cannot detect any procedural unfairness. Before the Riga Regional Court the applicant\u2019s arguments \u201chad been fully expressed in his written appeal\u201d (see paragraph 17); that court had re-examined the arguments of both parties (see paragraph 19) and the same had been done by the Senate of the Supreme Court (albeit within the limited competence of this latter court) (see paragraph 20). The applicant, therefore, had been \u201cheard\u201d in the sense that \u201chis observations [had been] properly examined by the courts\u201d (see paragraph 66).",
