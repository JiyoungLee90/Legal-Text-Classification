It considered that the second applicant's return could not be hindered by the fact that the mother was her main person of reference and that returning could cause a massive trauma affecting her development. Otherwise, mothers of small children could easily circumvent the aim of the Hague Convention. As to the mother's allegation that the first applicant regularly masturbated in the presence of the child, the court referred to the expert's statement that such conduct would, in view of the child's tender age, not cause immediate harm. The fact that such conduct, if proved, could in the long run be harmful to the child would have to be assessed in the custody proceedings. Finally, it held that the mother could be expected to return with the second applicant to the United States. ",

However, under Article 13 of the Hague Convention, this question was not to be examined by the court of its own motion but only upon an application by the person opposing the return. Following the service of the enforcement order of 8 May 1996 the mother had submitted, in particular, that she was the second applicant's main person of reference. Because of the lapse of time, the second applicant no longer recognised her father when she was shown his picture. By being taken away from her mother the child would suffer irreparable harm. The court therefore ordered the District Court to examine whether the situation had changed since the return order of 20\u00a0December 1995. It also ordered the District Court to obtain the opinion of an expert child psychologist on the question whether the child's return would entail a grave risk of physical or psychological harm and whether coercive measures were compatible with the interests of the child's well-being.",

Where the abductor of a small child was the latter's main person of reference and refused to return with the child, a serious threat to the child's well-being might arise. Nevertheless, Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention made clear that the child's well-being took priority over the Convention's general aim of preventing child abduction. Reasons of general deterrence or, in other words, the aim of showing that child abduction was not worthwhile could not justify exposing a child to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm.",

The child's abrupt removal from her main person of reference and her return to the United States would cause her irreparable harm. The Supreme Court emphasised that the particularity of the case lay in the fact that, in the main proceedings, the courts had denied that there was any risk of psychological harm (as a result of the alleged sexual behaviour of the first applicant) exclusively on account of the child's tender age. In these circumstances, it could not be excluded that the child, who was now more than two years old and had been living solely with her mother for more than a year, would suffer grave psychological harm in the event of a return to her father. Thus, the Regional Court had rightly found that the question whether the return order could be enforced by coercive measures needed further examination, including an opinion by an expert in child psychology. It might also prove necessary to assess  whether or not the mother's allegations were at all true.",

However, the first applicant had had regular contact with her until 30 October 1995, the date of her abduction. Thereafter they had had no contact at all. Since the return order had been made, a year and four months had elapsed and the first applicant had become a complete stranger to the second applicant. Given that a young child needed a stable relationship with the main person of reference at least until the age of six, the second applicant's removal from her main person of reference, namely her mother, would expose her to serious psychological harm. Having regard to the considerable lapse of time since the return order had been made on 20\u00a0December 1995, the District Court found that there had been a change in the relevant circumstances, in that the second applicant had lost all contact with the first applicant while her ties with her mother and her maternal grandparents had become ever closer.

However, it had its legal basis in section 19 (1) of the Non-Contentious Proceedings Act and Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention and served a legitimate aim, namely the child's well-being. As to the necessity of the interference, the Government emphasised that the Hague Convention did not grant an absolute right to obtain the return of an abducted child but gave priority to the child's well-being. Referring to Nuutinen v. Finland (no. 32842/96, ECHR 2000-VIII), they pointed out that a State could be obliged at the enforcement stage to review whether a given decision was still in the best interests of the child. Consequently, a review of whether the child's return entailed a grave risk of harm for her within the meaning of Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention was not to be excluded at that stage. The Government contended that at the time of the Regional Court's decision of 29\u00a0August 1996 and the Supreme Court's decision of 15\u00a0October 1996, the Oakland Circuit Court had already awarded the first applicant sole custody without hearing the child's mother and without examining the first applicant's ability to take care of the child. Thus, contrary to the situation obtaining when the return order had been made, it could no longer be expected that the mother's accusations raised against the first applicant would be examined in custody proceedings before the United States' courts.",

Moreover, there had not been any unnecessary delays in the proceedings. Unlike in the case of Ignaccolo-Zenide v. Romania, the return of the child had not been delayed by the inactivity of the courts. The Graz District Civil Court had issued an enforcement order on 8 May 1996, one day after it had received the file with the Supreme Court's final decision on the return order, and an unsuccessful attempt to enforce the order had been made on 10 May 1996. No further attempts could be made as the mother had appealed against the enforcement order. Thereafter, no further enforcement attempts had been made in view of the Graz Regional Court's decision of 29 August 1996 to review the question whether the second applicant's return would entail a grave risk of harm for her. The decisions in the appeal proceedings had followed at reasonable intervals. Finally, the enforcement of the return order had been rejected on the basis of comprehensively considered judicial decisions which had weighed all the interests involved and had given priority to the child's well-being. In so doing, the courts had not exceeded the margin of appreciation afforded to them by Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",

Consequently, the \u201call reasonable measures\u201d standard developed in Ignaccolo-Zenide, which referred in turn to the standards laid down in the Hague Convention, in particular in its Articles 7 and 11, had to be applied. In their view, the main point in issue in the case was the Austrian courts' failure to enforce the return order in a timely manner. The review of the return order in the enforcement proceedings - which, in their submission, had been contrary to the Hague Convention and the contracting State's positive obligations under Article 8 - was merely a consequence of this failure and not a justified interference with the applicants' rights under Article 8. In addition, they emphasised that the enforcement of final court orders was generally required by respect for the rule of law.",

Thus, their decisions were in line with the Court's case-law, according to which the State's obligation to reunite a parent with his child is not an absolute one, as the interests of the child's well-being may override the parent's interest in reunion.

However, the national authorities' obligation to take such measures is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with a child who has lived for some time with the other parent may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures to be taken. Any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention.

In contrast to the situation obtaining when the return order had been made, it could no longer be expected that an examination of the mother's accusations regarding the first applicant's harmful behaviour, namely his allegedly masturbating in the presence of the child, would take place in custody proceedings before the United States' courts.

The Government argued that no further enforcement attempts could be made as long as the mother's appeal of 15 May 1996 was pending, while the applicants contested this. The Court is not required to examine which was the position under domestic law, as it is for each Contracting State to equip itself with adequate and effective means to ensure compliance with its positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7 108). At the very least, the courts were under a particular duty to give an expeditious decision on the appeal in question. Nevertheless, it took three and a half months for the Graz Regional Civil Court to decide, on 29 August 1996, to quash the enforcement order of 8 May and to refer the case back to the District Court.",

Relying on this expert's opinion, the District Court found on 29 April 1997 that, given the considerable lapse of time, the removal of the second applicant from her main person of reference, namely her mother, would expose her to serious psychological harm, as her father, the first applicant, had in the meantime become a complete stranger to her. The District Court's decision, which was upheld by the Graz Regional Court and, on 9 September 1997, by the Supreme Court, shows that the case was ultimately decided by the time that had elapsed. Without overlooking the difficulties created by the resistance of the second applicant's mother, the Court finds, nevertheless, that the lapse of time was to a large extent caused by the authorities' own handling of the case. In this connection, the Court reiterates that effective respect for family life requires that future relations between parent and child not be determined by the mere effluxion of time (see W. v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8\u00a0July 1987, Series A no. 121, p. 29, \u00a7 65).",

In this connection, the Court points out that it has refuted such a line of argument in Ignaccolo-Zenide v. Romania, finding that an applicant's omission cannot absolve the authorities from their obligations in the matter of execution, since it is they who exercise public authority (ibid., \u00a7 111).",

The applicant and his wife had established the matrimonial residence in Michigan, USA.  The wife's relocation to Austria, together with the illicitly appropriated child, coerced the applicant into instituting legal proceedings in Austria, which necessitated his presence there to ensure their diligent and successful prosecution.

I believe that, in accordance with the Court's case law, all the losses, costs and expenses \u201cactually and necessarily\u201d incurred by the applicant for the prevention or rectification of a violation of the Convention, ought to have been reimbursed to the victim of that infringement.

Before that instant, nothing is due by Austria.  But, as from then on, the unreasonable delays and the resistance to the enforcement of the final return order (for both of which the majority found the Austrian courts responsible) played a determining conjoint role in infringing the applicant's Convention rights.  This cut-off point, after which the applicant was no longer battling his wife but was contending with the failures of the Austrian system, occurred in April 1996.  It is my view that, from this moment when the state's responsibility was fully engaged, all losses, damages costs and expenses incurred by the applicant to redress the ongoing state of infringement, clearly became the liability of the respondent state.

The Court considered that there is no causal link between the material damages claimed and the violation found (para. 83).  In my view, the bond of causality between the efforts put in by the applicant to obtain redress for the infringement suffered, on the one hand,  and the loss of his job (and various other substantial damages), on the other,  is as compelling as it is overwhelming.  To believe otherwise is also to believe that the applicant could have carried on working industriously in the USA, while engaging in a full-time legal affray in Austria, continually crossing the globe to attend court sittings and conferences with his lawyers thousands of kilometres away.  Not one euro's worth of material damages was recognised and awarded to the applicant by the majority, under any head whatsoever.",

To a person who has had the core of his existence irretrievably gutted by the violation of fundamental rights, to a father who has been irrevocably barred from the covenant with his only daughter, to a victim of atrocity born of the distressed use of the law against him, the majority responded with the award of what, in my view, amounts to an almost offensive trifle.  That is hardly the most eloquent idiom to underscore how hallowed the sanctity of fundamental rights is in the eyes of the Court.  If neutralizing the Convention comes so cheap, states may well find it foolish not to have a brave  try.",
