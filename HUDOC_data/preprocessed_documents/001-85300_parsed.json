Moreover, the court had to order the applicant\u2019s psychiatric observation in a mental institution (see paragraph 7\u00a0above).",

In this regard, it would observe that the proceedings were of considerable complexity, regard being had to the extensive body of evidence, including mechanoscopic and olfactory expert opinions, comparative hair analysis, and an experimental reconstruction of the crime scene (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above). Nevertheless, the hearings in the applicant\u2019s case were held regularly and in short intervals. The course of the proceedings was swift and their length reasonable (see paragraphs 14, 15 and 16 above). The Court therefore concludes that the national authorities displayed diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. It should not be overlooked that, while an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the judges\u2019 efforts to clarify fully the facts in issue, to provide both the defence and the prosecution with all necessary facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their case and to give judgment only after careful reflection on whether the offences were in fact committed and on the sentence to be imposed.",
