Information attesting to other similar cases of disappearances after unacknowledged detention is contained in the investigation file submitted by the Government and in the information submitted by the applicants (see paragraphs 76 and 80-81 above). The Court agrees with the applicants that, in the context of the conflict in , when a person is detained by unidentified servicemen without any subsequent acknowledgment of the detention, this can be regarded as life-threatening. The absence of Ayubkhan Magomadov or of any news from him for over six years supports this assumption. Moreover, the stance of the prosecutor's office and the other law-enforcement authorities after the news of his detention had been communicated to them by the applicants significantly contributed to the likelihood of his disappearance, as none of the necessary steps was taken in the crucial first days or weeks after his detention. The authorities' behaviour in the face of the applicants' well-substantiated complaints gives rise to a strong presumption of at least acquiescence in the situation and raises strong doubts as to the objectivity of the investigation.",

To give an example, a former officer of the VOVD, R., stated on 21 January 2003 that he had taken part in the operation in Kurchaloy during which Ayubkhan Magomadov had been detained at his house on suspicion of being an active member of an illegal armed group. However, the former head of the criminal police of the VOVD, , stated on 11 March 2003 that the VOVD officers had not taken part in Mr Magomadov's detention and that he had been taken to the premises of the VOVD by a group of FSB officers. It does not appear that the investigation took steps to resolve these inconsistencies. It also failed to identify and question the officers of the FSB who had participated in the arrest and questioning. The Court is particularly surprised by the apparent lack of cooperation demonstrated by that office in dealing with the prosecutors' requests. As an illustration of such lack of cooperation, the Court notes the document produced by the Kurchaloy District Department of the FSB, which stated that its office did not keep any archives and was therefore unable to provide any information about the alleged questioning of Mr Magomadov (see paragraph 65 above).",
