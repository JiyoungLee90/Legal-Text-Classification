Applying the above-mentioned principles, it has concluded that it would be sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case of abduction of the missing persons by State agents, thus falling within the control of the authorities, and it would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof, either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, for example, concerning abductions in Dagestan, Alpatu Israilova v. Russia, no. 15438/05, 14 March 2013, and Umarovy v. Russia, no. 2546/08, 12 June 2012). If the Government failed to rebut this presumption, that would entail a violation of Article 2 in its substantive part. Conversely, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Shafiyeva v. Russia, no. 49379/09, \u00a7 71, 3 May 2012).",

Firstly, the abductors, who arrived in a civilian vehicle, acted as an organised group and did not hesitate to open fire and perpetrate the abduction in the street, in daylight and in the presence of witnesses. One of them told the second applicant that they were from the police. Secondly, a group of local police officers arrived at the crime scene shortly after the incident and collected the cartridge cases left by the abductors. Thirdly, the police officers\u2019 visit to the first applicant\u2019s house in Makhachkala looking for Mr Abdurakhman Abdurakhmanov on suspicion of his involvement in terrorist activities, just an hour prior to his abduction in Kaspiysk, provides grounds to believe that these two events were interconnected. Further, the investigators took no meaningful steps to check whether the abduction could have been perpetrated for other reasons, such as a blood feud, ransom, drugs or hostility. No serious steps were taken to verify those hypotheses and no information was obtained that the abductors could have been other than State agents (see, by contrast, Zubayrayev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 67797/01, \u00a7 81, 10\u00a0January 2008). Lastly, the procrastination of the authorities in the investigation into the matter, along with the applicants\u2019 consistent allegations that law-enforcement officers were involved in the incident (see, for example, paragraph 47 above), provide the Court with the grounds to conclude that the applicants have made a prima facie case that their relative Mr Abdurakhman Abdurakhmanov was abducted by State agents. The Government\u2019s statement that the investigators found no evidence that members of lawenforcement authorities were involved in Mr\u00a0Abdurakhman Abdurakhmanov\u2019s disappearance is insufficient to discharge them from the above-mentioned burden of proof. Having examined the documents submitted by the parties and drawing inferences from the Government\u2019s failure to provide another plausible explanation for the events in question, the Court finds that Mr\u00a0Abdurakhman Abdurakhmanov was apprehended on 25 June 2010 by State agents (see, for a similar situation, Askhabova v. Russia, no. 54765/09, \u00a7 135, 18 April 2013).",

These steps were either taken several months later or not at all (see paragraphs 44 and 46-47 above). In spite of the applicants\u2019 request for at least five eyewitnesses to the abduction to be questioned (see paragraph 19 above), the investigators limited themselves to obtaining statements only from three of them and only fifteen days after the receipt of that information (see paragraphs 35 and 36 above). Also, in spite of the applicants\u2019 allegation that after the abduction their relative could have been detained on the premises of the Dagestan CTC (see paragraph 28 above), the investigators did not look into this.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the authorities cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin to request particular lines of inquiry or investigative procedures (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0130lhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, \u00a7 63, ECHR\u00a02000VII): they must show their commitment by taking all steps of their own motion and demonstrating that they have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence.

This failure to act in a timely manner led to unnecessary delays and a loss of time, because steps which could have yielded results were not taken. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that any appeals by the applicant against the investigators\u2019 decisions would have had any prospects of spurring the progress of the investigation or effectively influencing its conduct.
