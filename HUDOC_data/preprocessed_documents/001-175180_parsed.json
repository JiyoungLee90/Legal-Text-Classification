Unfortunately, it appears that there was a major oversight at the very beginning of this important venture. The panel for the selection of the director [of the radio] was created in contravention of the Statute of Br\u010dko District. It is composed of three Serb members, one Croat and one Bosniac. Thus, yet again, the (BD) Statute, which requires proportional representation of the three constituent peoples in public institutions, was disregarded. Parliament established several cases of non-compliance with this principle regarding employment of staff in the public sector, including the BD radio, to the disadvantage of Bosniacs and Croats, and requested that the Governor correct this imbalance. Unfortunately, nothing has been done to correct this. That this is true is confirmed by the unofficial information that Ms M.S. was proposed for the position of the radio\u2019s director by the Serb members of the (selection) panel, who are in the majority, although the former director was Bosniac. This proposal is unacceptable, all the more so because it concerns a person who lacks the professional and moral qualities for such a position.\u201d",

From the submissions of the two witnesses, from whom the appellants received the information presented in the letter (concerning the part of the letter in which it was stated that M.S. \u2018made a point of removing from the wall (and tore to pieces) the calendar with the schedule of religious services during the month of Ramadan and as the editor of the entertainment programme banned the broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value\u2019), the Court of Appeal established that there was an evident inconsistency between what had been said to the appellants and what they had reported in the letter. Furthermore, the statement in the impugned letter that M.S. had given an interview concerning the destruction of mosques was refuted by another witness, who submitted that subsequent verification had revealed that M.S. had not been the author of the said interview. Finally, the appellants failed to prove the veracity of the allegations that M.S. had covered the coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the coat of arms of the Republika Srpska. In view of the above, in the present case the public interest that permits reporting on alleged irregularities in the conduct of public officials cannot be based on manifestly untrue factual allegations which impugn their reputation [and] which cannot be regarded as criticism that they ought to tolerate in view of their function. Accordingly, the court considers that the Court of Appeal correctly concluded that there was \u2018a pressing social need\u2019 in the present case [for the interference with the appellants\u2019 right to freedom of expression].",

The applicants, as Bosniac non-governmental organisations, had acted as lobbyists for the Bosniac candidate for the post of the radio\u2019s director. The letter had served at the time as a means of political pressure, which had led the Management Board of the radio not to appoint any of the prospective candidates, that is neither M.S., as a representative of the Serbs, nor the other candidate, who had been Bosniac.",

They submitted that whistle-blowers who \u201creport\u201d information to the competent authorities should enjoy equal protection to whistle-blowers who \u201cdisclose\u201d information in public. Whistle-blowers who reported alleged irregularities to the authorities by means of private correspondence, as in the present case, should not bear an excessive burden to prove the veracity of the information provided. Relevant legal instruments of the Council of Europe and the Court\u2019s case-law required a low standard of proof of the facts denounced by whistle-blowers, the aim of which was to encourage the revelation of facts of general interest and an inquiry by the State into those facts. In their view, instead of placing the burden on the whistle-blowers to prove the veracity of the facts reported, it was necessary to enable the State to inquire into the facts reported. In this connection they submitted that whistle-blowing was a mechanism for the advancement of democratic accountability designed to encourage the receipt and processing of reports by the persons best placed to resolve the problem concerned.",

In cases where information was reported to the competent authorities, the damage caused to persons or institutions by potentially defamatory allegations was less severe than in the case of public disclosure, in view of the more restricted circle of addressees. The more limited effect of such reporting was a ground for a more indulgent requirement of moderation of expression. Affording a lower level of protection to citizens who reported information to the authorities would have a chilling effect on the freedom of expression and would encourage the leaking of information to the public to the detriment of reporting to the competent authorities.",

It observes that the applicants presented no legal arguments, based on the terms of the national legal provisions or on national case-law, to indicate that their case fell outside the scope of application of the general rule in section 6(1) of the Defamation Act 2003 governing the circumstances in which a person could be held liable for defamation (see paragraph 41 above). In its judgment of 11\u00a0July\u00a02007, the BD Court of Appeal found that the impugned four statements contained in the applicants\u2019 letter (see paragraph 11 above) constituted an expression or dissemination giving rise to an actionable claim in defamation (see paragraph 21 above). The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina also accepted that section 6 of the Defamation Act 2003 applied to the applicants\u2019 private correspondence with the BD authorities (see paragraph 33 above). They accepted accordingly that dissemination did not necessarily entail diffusion through media. While it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among other authorities, Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, \u00a7 140, ECHR 2012; Korbely v.\u00a0Hungary [GC], no.\u00a09174/02, \u00a7\u00a7 72-73, ECHR 2008; and Waite and Kennedy v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, \u00a7 54, ECHR 1999I), the Court finds nothing to suggest that the applicants were not in a position to foresee, to a reasonable degree, the national appellate court\u2019s interpretation and application of section 6 of the Defamation Act 2003 to their case.",

However, it finds that accusing M.S. of being disrespectful in regard to another ethnicity and religion was not only capable of tarnishing her reputation, but also of causing her prejudice in both her professional and social environment (see paragraph 104 below). Accordingly, the accusations attained the requisite level of seriousness as could harm M.S.\u2019s rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Dorota Kania v. Poland (no. 2), no. 44436/13, \u00a7 73, 4\u00a0October 2016, which concerned accusations made against a university rector that he had been a secret collaborator with the communist-era security services).

The applicants, who were not employees of the BD radio station, had no exclusive access to and direct knowledge of that information (see Aurelian Oprea v.\u00a0Romania, no. 12138/08, \u00a7 59, 19 January 2016), but they apparently acted as \u201ca vehicle for communication\u201d (see paragraph 45 above) between the radio\u2019s employees (regarding the alleged misconduct of M.S. in the workplace) and the BD authorities. No information has been submitted to the effect that those employees suffered any repercussions as a consequence of their signalling of the alleged wrongdoing (ibid.). Neither did the applicants argue that their letter had to be regarded as whistleblowing (see, in contrast, Guja, cited above, \u00a7 60; Heinisch, cited above, \u00a7\u00a043; and Aurelian Oprea, cited above, \u00a7 45). In the absence of any issue of loyalty, reserve and discretion, there is no need for the Court to enquire into the kind of issue which has been central in the above case-law on whistle-blowing, namely whether there existed any alternative channels or other effective means for the applicants of remedying the alleged wrongdoing (such as disclosure to the person\u2019s superior or other competent authority or body) which the applicants intended to uncover (compare Guja, cited above, \u00a7 73).",

Both the foregoing principle and the judgments applying it show that the Court has been prepared to assess an applicant\u2019s good faith and efforts to ascertain the truth according to a more subjective and lenient approach than in other types of cases (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard v.

Indeed, the Court has accepted that when an NGO draws attention to matters of public interest, it is exercising a public watchdog role of similar importance to that of the press (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a048876/08, \u00a7\u00a0103, ECHR 2013 (extracts)) and may be characterised as a social \u201cwatchdog\u201d warranting similar protection under the Convention as that afforded to the press (ibid., and Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g v. Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, \u00a7\u00a0166, 8 November 2016). It has recognised that civil society makes an important contribution to the discussion of public affairs (see, for instance, Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, \u00a7\u00a089, ECHR\u00a02005II, and Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g, cited above, \u00a7 166). It is also noteworthy that the Fundamental Principles on the Status of Non-Governmental Organisations cited at paragraph 45 above underline the important contribution of NGOs \u201cto the development, realisation and continued survival of democratic societies\u201d and the need for such societies to \u201cencourage [NGOs] to participate in ... mechanisms for dialogue, consultation and exchange\u201d.",

In the area of press freedom the Court has held that \u201cby reason of the \u2018duties and responsibilities\u2019 inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article\u00a010 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism\u201d (see Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, 27 March 1996, \u00a7\u00a039, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II; Fressoz and Roire v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 29183/95, \u00a7\u00a054, ECHR 1999I; and Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.\u00a0Norway [GC], no.\u00a021980/93, \u00a7 65, ECHR 1999III). Recently, in the above-cited case of Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g, the Court affirmed that the same considerations would apply to an NGO assuming a social watchdog function (\u00a7 159). A similar view is reflected in the Code of Ethics and Conduct for NGOs cited at paragraph 46 above, according to which \u201can NGO should not violate any person\u2019s fundamental human rights\u201d, \u201cshould give out accurate information ... regarding any individual\u201d and \u201cthe information that [an NGO] chooses to disseminate to ... policy makers ... must be accurate and presented with proper context\u201d.",

In balancing the competing interests involved, namely the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression against M.S.\u2019s right to respect for her private life (see paragraph 79 above), the Court finds it appropriate to take account also of the criteria that generally apply to the dissemination of defamatory statements by the media in the exercise of its public watchdog function, namely the degree of notoriety of the person affected; the subject of the news report; the content, form and consequences of the publication; as well as the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity, and the gravity of the penalty imposed (see Von Hannover, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0108-13, ECHR 2012; Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a089-95; and Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s, cited above, \u00a7 93).",

The Court reiterates that civil servants acting in an official capacity are subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than ordinary individuals (see Morice v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a029369/10, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2015). Given the nature of the post which M.S. held at the relevant time (an editor of the entertainment programme), it cannot be said that those limits were as wide as in the case of politicians (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, \u00a7 80; Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, \u00a7\u00a047, ECHR 2001III; and Janowski, cited above, \u00a7 33). However, the Court notes that M.S., by having applied for the post of the radio\u2019s director and bearing in mind also the public interest involved in the information contained in the letter (see paragraph 94 above), must be considered to have inevitably and knowingly entered the public domain and laid herself open to close scrutiny of her acts. The BD Court of Appeal also accepted that M.S. was a civil servant and that the post of the radio\u2019s director was to be regarded as being of a particular public concern (see paragraph 22 above). In such circumstances, the Court considers that the limits of acceptable criticism must accordingly be wider than in the case of an ordinary professional (see, mutatis mutandis, Bj\u00f6rk Ei\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir, cited above, \u00a7 68, and Erla Hlynsd\u03ccttir v.

The allegations cast M.S. in a very negative light and were liable to portray her as a person who was disrespectful and contemptuous in her opinions and sentiments about Muslims and ethnic Bosniacs. The domestic courts held that the statements in question contained defamatory accusations that damaged M.S.\u2019s reputation (see paragraph 28 above). The Court sees no reason to hold otherwise. On the contrary, the nature of the accusations was such as to seriously call into question M.S. suitability not only for the post of director of the BD radio for which she had applied, but also for her role as editor of the BD\u2019s radio entertainment programme in a multi-ethnic public radio station.",

In the context of press freedom, the Court has held that special grounds are required before the media can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals. Whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their sources as reliable with respect to the allegations (see, among other authorities, Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, \u00a7\u00a066; Pedersen and Baadsgaard, \u00a7\u00a078, and Bj\u00f6rk Ei\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir, \u00a7\u00a070, all cited above). These factors, in turn, require consideration of other elements such as whether the newspaper had conducted a reasonable amount of research before publication (see Prager and Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria, 26 April 1995, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 313), whether the newspaper presented the story in a reasonably balanced manner (see Bergens Tidende and Others v. Norway, no.\u00a026132/95, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2000IV) and whether the newspaper gave the persons defamed the opportunity to defend themselves (ibid., \u00a7 58).",

This requirement is inherent in the Code of Ethics and Conduct for NGOs (see paragraphs 46 and 86 above) and it is to be seen in the context of the \u201cresponsibilities\u201d in the operation of NGOs (see paragraph 45 above). That the impugned allegations were communicated to the State authorities by means of private correspondence, albeit an important consideration, did not confer wholly unrestricted freedom on the applicants to submit unverified aspersions. The duty of the authorities to verify such allegations cannot be regarded as a substitute for the ordinary obligation of verification of factual statements that are defamatory, even of public officials. That the applicants were perceived (see paragraph 16 above) \u2013 and, indeed, acted as representatives of the interests of particular segments of the population in the BD \u2013 increased their duty to verify the accuracy of the information before they reported it to the authorities. The Court will analyse whether the applicants complied with this obligation in respect of each of the impugned statements. The reasonableness of the efforts made in this respect must be determined in the light of the situation at the time of the preparation of the letter, rather than with the benefit of hindsight (see, mutatis mutandis, Stankiewicz and Others, cited above, \u00a7 72).",

The Court underlines that the applicants, as NGOs whose members enjoyed a good reputation in society (see paragraph 59 above), were required to present an accurate rendering of the employees\u2019 account, as an important element for the development and maintaining of mutual trust and of their image as competent and responsible participants in public life. Furthermore, the disputed allegations were presented as statements of fact rather than as value judgments. The domestic courts held that that inconsistency was imputable to the applicants.

As explained in the judgment, the applicants are NGOs and not a political party that can influence the voting process. As a result, the content of the letter which relates to Ms M.S. could not in any way influence the process of her selection for the post of director. It remains unclear why the majority attach importance to the Government\u2019s position on this issue instead of the official minutes of the meeting of the Board. In any case the majority misinterpret the minutes of the meeting of the Board. Even though the majority distance themselves from the Government\u2019s line of reasoning, observing that M.S. \u201cwas not appointed to the post of director of the BD radio\u201d (see paragraph 105), they nonetheless refer to false background information submitted by the Government. The real question is why M.S. was not appointed to the post of director. \u201cDue to political pressure and repeated voting\u201d, as noted in the minutes of a meeting of the Management Board. Could this be attributed to the NGOs? Of course not. They are not in a position to take any political decisions.",

The applicants are found to be at fault not for disseminating this information themselves, but for it having been disseminated, because it was the applicants\u2019 letter to persons whom they thought to be the competent authorities that started the process, which until then had been limited to rumours circulating in the city of Br\u010dko (see, for example, paragraphs 101 and 114 of the judgment). They are found to be at fault for the outcome not because they initiated the process with a view to deliberately bringing about that outcome, which was the actual dissemination of the information in question and the ensuing harm done to M.S., but because they triggered the process involved. Though not directly blaming the applicants for the publication of their letter in the media, the majority blame them for \u201copen[ing] a possibility for public debate and aggravat[ing] the harm to M.S.\u2019s dignity and professional reputation\u201d (see paragraph 106 of the judgment).

The applicants considered their letter to be \u201cprivate and confidential\u201d (see paragraph 54 of the judgment). The respondent Government maintained that that letter \u201ccontained no indication that it had been of a confidential nature\u201d (see paragraph 58 of the judgment). The latter assertion is somewhat strange because it contradicts, to a certain extent, even the assessment of the nature of the correspondence by the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which accepted that the applicants\u2019 correspondence with the Br\u010dko District authorities was indeed private. The majority also accepted as much, reiterating their assessment that the information was of a private nature several times throughout the judgment (see paragraphs 33, 71, 83, 90, 91 and 105 of the judgment). Whereas \u201cprivate\u201d may not in all cases amount to \u201cconfidential\u201d, the applicants\u2019 assertion that their letter was not only \u201cprivate\u201d but also \u201cconfidential\u201d deserved a much closer look, especially in view of the fact that it was sent not just to \u201csomeone\u201d, but to the \u201cState officials\u201d of the \u201chighest authorities\u201d of the Br\u010dko District, as acknowledged by the Court (see paragraphs 10 and 105 of the judgment). Their assertion also deserved closer examination in view of the provisions of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, which, being the only Article of the Convention that explicitly underlines the duties and responsibilities of the freedom-holders, allows \u2013 and indirectly calls \u2013 for restrictions of the freedom of expression for \u201cpreventing the disclosure of information received in confidence\u201d, at least where the dissemination of sensitive information may harm personality rights. Unfortunately, the judgment does not contain any analysis as to how the authorities (State officials), to whom the applicants\u2019 letter containing such sensitive information was addressed, should have treated it under the domestic law, or to what they actually had or had not done to prevent the disclosure of that information, which could potentially harm the dignity and reputation of the person concerned. In particular, the telling fact that the person in question admitted that she had \u201clearnt of the letter shortly after it had been sent by the applicants\u201d (see paragraph 15 of the judgment), that is, not after it was published but prior to publication, should have been given due prominence and was not. The majority (like the domestic courts) are satisfied with Government\u2019s submission that \u201cletters sent to the authorities in the respondent State were frequently leaked to the public before the authorities could take any measure with respect to the information received\u201d (see paragraph 60 of the judgment). The third-party interveners rightly warned against a low level of protection to citizens who reported information to the authorities which \u201cencourage[d] the leaking of information to the public to the detriment of reporting to the competent authorities\u201d (see paragraph 63 of the judgment), but this warning went unheeded. Instead, the majority confine themselves to accepting that \u201cthe applicants\u2019 defamatory accusations ... had been leaked to the press\u201d (see paragraph\u00a0106 of the judgment) \u2013 and this to the detriment of the applicants, not the authorities.",

As a matter of principle, it is very difficult to verify the truthfulness of rumours as a very specific form of social communication.
