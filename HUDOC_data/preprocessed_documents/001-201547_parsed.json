His argument to that effect is rather confined to the allegedly incorrect establishment of the facts by the trial court. The Court has no grounds to depart from the trial court\u2019s assessment (see paragraph\u00a048) and accepts that RUB\u00a02,100 had not belonged to the applicant as these were banknotes marked with the special substance given to him during the test purchase operation. As regards the mobile phone and an amount in US dollars, the Court observes that since 2007 no evidence of alleged theft has been established. Notwithstanding the Court\u2019s considerations concerning the quality of the inquiry (see, in so far as relevant, paragraph\u00a063 above), the Court cannot but notice various unexplained inconsistencies of the applicant\u2019s own account of the events, such as the applicant\u2019s failure to mention those items in his explanations or the search record of 10\u00a0January 2007 (see paragraphs\u00a09 and 10 above); or to provide an explanation as regards the phone call of 17\u00a0January 2007 (see paragraph\u00a015 above). Accordingly, the Court does not have sufficient grounds to consider it established that any of the above belongings were taken from the applicant by State agents, and that there has therefore been an interference with the applicant\u2019s rights under Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 on that account.",
