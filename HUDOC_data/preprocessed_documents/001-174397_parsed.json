The Court has already found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the national judicial authorities\u2019 failure to specify the period of an applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention (see, for example, Roman Petrov v. Russia, no. 37311/08, \u00a7\u00a7 42-46, 15\u00a0December 2015; Logvinenko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 44511/04, \u00a7\u00a7 35-39, 17 June 2010; and Fedorenko v. Russia, no. 39602/05, \u00a7\u00a7 52-57, 20 September 2011). Since the applicant\u2019s detention in the present case was governed by the same provisions \u2013 namely Articles 108 and 109 of the CCrP, as in the cases cited above \u2013 the Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case. It therefore considers that the applicant\u2019s detention from 25 September to 19\u00a0November 2010 was not \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in respect of that period.",

The applicant did not put forward any serious arguments that would have prompted the Court to consider that his detention after 19 November 2010 was in breach of the lawfulness requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. There is no evidence that would prompt the Court to conclude that the domestic courts disregarded or misapplied the relevant legislation or that the applicant\u2019s detention during the relevant period was not in accordance with the law.",
