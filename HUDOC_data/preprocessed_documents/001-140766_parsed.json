The ground which was relied on by the Supreme Court to justify the decision in question was of a formal character, namely the failure of the applicant\u2019s lawyer to give the grounds which would justify the examination of his client\u2019s cassation appeal. The Court notes further that the reasons behind the Supreme Court\u2019s decision were exactly the same as reasons relied on by the same court in other case examined by the Strasbourg Court namely in Antoni Lewandowski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 38459/03, \u00a7\u00a025, 2 October 2012, where the Supreme Court refused to entertain the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal. Therefore the Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning adopted in the case of Antoni Lewandowski where the Court found that the applicant\u2019s procedural mistake did not have any material bearing on the effectiveness of his cassation appeal. As noted above, most cassation appeals which had been lodged by applicants with similar cases were considered by the Supreme Court as not deserving substantive examination. Accordingly, the prospects of success of the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal, even if it had been lodged properly, were very little and, therefore, not sufficient for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Antoni Lewandowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a062\u201366).",

As a result of the impugned measure, the applicant was faced, without any transitional period enabling him to adjust to the new situation, with the total loss of his earlyretirement pension, which constituted his only source of income at that time. Moreover, the Court is aware of the potential risk that, in view of his age and the economic reality in the country, particularly in the undeveloped Podkarpacki region, the applicant might have had considerable difficulty in securing new employment. Indeed, after the revocation of his pension the applicant remained unemployed. After more than a year following the revocation of his pension he worked for three months on the basis of a mandate contract. Subsequently, he remained unemployed for more than ten months and it took him more than three years after finding a paid job to earn the equivalent of the amount of his former EWK pension, that is, approximately EUR 350 net per month (see paragraph 27 above).",
