As explained in that report, following the armed conflict in Slovenia in 1991 and the ensuing independence of the country, over 170\u00a0000 of the approximately 200\u00a0000 permanent residents of Slovenia from other ex-Yugoslav countries obtained Slovenian citizenship on the basis of the 1991 citizenship law. This law allowed for a six-month window to apply for citizenship. Of the remaining 30\u00a0000 persons, approximately 11\u00a0000 left  around that time. However, for a number of reasons, including the war between other successor States of the former Yugoslavia, the uncertain situation prevailing in other such States, and the destruction, loss or inaccessibility of personal documents, 18 305 permanent residents did not or could not apply for Slovenian citizenship or applied and were rejected. As mentioned, these persons were struck off the register of permanent residents on 26 February 1992. Many of these persons \u2013 for the most part reportedly persons without good levels of education \u2013 had been living in  for a long time and some of them were even born in the country. However, as a result of the erasure from the registers, they became foreigners without legal status in  from one day to the next, in many cases without being aware of it. Loss of legal status meant for them loss of access to fundamental rights attached to residence, including the right to work and access to healthcare and other social rights, along with the annulation of personal documents and exposure to a risk of deportation.",

The situation as concerns the implementation of the other parts of the decision of the  appears very unclear and uncertain at the time of writing and is a cause for serious concern to ECRI. The issue essentially relates to the enactment of a law to regulate the status of approximately 6\u00a0000 \u2018erased\u2019 who have not yet secured Slovenian citizenship or permanent residence permits and whose current position varies from holders of temporary permits (an estimated 2\u00a0500 persons) and persons still living in Slovenia without legal status to persons who have left Slovenia or have been deported. The Slovenian authorities have reported to ECRI their decision to adopt such a law in the form of a constitutional law. ECRI notes that this decision has been widely criticised both within the Parliament and in civil society for effectively and deliberately leading to non-implementation of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision, inter alia as it entails the use of constitutional means and relative procedures (including the need for a qualified majority in Parliament) in order to deal with matters that should be regulated through primary legislation. ECRI is not aware of the exact content of the law, which is reportedly in the drafting process, nor has it been possible to clarify the envisaged timetable for adoption. In any event, ECRI deplores the fact that, as a result of the non-implementation by the Slovenian authorities of the decision of the Constitutional Court, it is still not possible for approximately 6\u00a0000 people to regain the rights of which they were unlawfully stripped over fifteen years ago.",

Spain (dec.), no.\u00a048335/99, ECHR 2000-XI) were of an eminently personal and non-transferable nature (see V\u00e4\u00e4ri v.

The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s representatives first asked the applicant Mr Makuc\u2019s brother whether he wished to pursue the proceedings before the Court and that the latter was not willing to do so. The Court therefore finds that Ms\u00a0Ban is not one of Mr Makuc\u2019s closest relatives and notes that the inheritance proceedings following the late applicant\u2019s death are still pending and that, as far as the Court is aware, his heirs have not yet been determined. Moreover, the Court finds that the case concerns issues falling primarily under Article 8 of the Convention which are closely linked to Mr\u00a0Makuc\u2019s person. Finally, regard being had to the fact that the application was brought by eleven applicants and that the proceedings before the Court continue in respect of ten applicants, the Court considers that the question of the protection of the general interest necessitating consideration of the applicant Mr Makuc\u2019s complaints is redundant. Therefore, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s cousin does not have a legal interest to pursue the application. It follows that this part of the application is incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7 4.",
