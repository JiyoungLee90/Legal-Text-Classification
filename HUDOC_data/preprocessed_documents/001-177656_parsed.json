By virtue of section\u00a015 of the Labour Courts Act, the courts have transposed the relevant provisions found in the Code of Civil Procedure to the oral and accelerated procedure in labour disputes. However, the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure are found only in sections 178 to 426 of the same Code and they do not refer specifically to section 433, which is the provision that provides for the communication of the appeal of the appellant to the respondent and the right of the respondent party to cross-appeal. In the particular context of appeal proceedings against the decisions of labour courts, it is clear from the established case-law of the Court of Cassation that an appeal by one party would not be communicated to the other party and that the respondent party could not cross-appeal in his or her reply submissions (kat\u0131lma yolu ile temyiz) once the appeal time-limits had passed.

Following this approach the Grand Chamber of the Court of Cassation\u2019s Civil Division (Yarg\u0131tay Hukuk Genel Kurulu) further ruled that the appeal of an appellant must be communicated to the defendant, who may cross-appeal in his or her observations (see E. 2014/9-1438, K. 2015/580, 21 January 2015, and E.\u00a02015/7-2488, K. 2015/2187, 30 September 2015).",

They described in detail the special features of labour disputes, in particular reinstatement proceedings, where time was of the essence for a dismissed employee seeking reinstatement in his or her previous position. They explained that by virtue of the oral and accelerated procedure applicable at the material time, the onus had fallen on the party to keep him or herself informed by checking with the court\u2019s registry to verify whether another party had appealed. In this connection, they drew the Court\u2019s attention to the eight-day appeal time-limit running from the oral delivery of a judgment. At the end of that time-limit the applicant would have de facto known whether or not the defendant company had appealed. The applicant therefore had had the opportunity to keep himself informed of the appeal and to submit observations if he had so wished. The Government noted that during the entire course of the proceedings the applicant had been represented by a lawyer who should have known that under the law and established practice, there had been no such duty to communicate the appeal. In that connection they argued that the failure of the lawyer to check the case file at the court\u2019s registry and to keep himself informed of the stage of the proceedings could not be attributed to any fault or omission of the authorities.",

It further reiterates that the principle of equality of arms requires that each party should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case under conditions that do not place him or her at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his or her opponent (see Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, \u00a7\u00a033, Series A no. 274, and Avoti\u0146\u0161 v. Latvia [GC], no. 17502/07, \u00a7\u00a0119, ECHR 2016). The general concept of a fair trial, encompassing also the fundamental principle that proceedings should be adversarial, requires that all parties to civil proceedings should have the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations submitted or evidence adduced with a view to influencing the court\u2019s decision (see Nider\u00f6st-Huber v.\u00a0Switzerland, 18 February 1997, \u00a7 24, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I). Above all, that presupposes that the person against whom proceedings have been initiated should be informed of that fact (see Dilipak and Karakaya, cited above, \u00a7 77). What is at stake is the litigants\u2019 confidence in the workings of justice, which is based on, inter alia, the knowledge that they have had the opportunity to express their views on every document in the file (see Beer v. Austria, no. 30428/96, \u00a7\u00a018, 6\u00a0February 2001).",

In fact, Article 6 \u00a7 1 is intended above all to secure the interests of the parties and those of the proper administration of justice (see Nider\u00f6st-Huber, cited above, \u00a7 30).

However, the fact that the applicant could have been aware of the institution of appeal proceedings is not in itself sufficient to conclude that he was given a real opportunity to comment on these proceedings. In that connection, the Court disagrees with the Government\u2019s view that the applicant or his representative had a theoretical right of participating in the appeal proceedings by consulting the case file at the court\u2019s registry. Moreover, regard being had to the fact that there were not one but two sets of submissions lodged by the other party on different dates, neither of which was communicated to the applicant (see paragraphs\u00a010 and 12 above), the Court considers in respect of the second submissions that the applicant was placed at a substantial disadvantage with respect to the respondent, as he could have not anticipated when they would be lodged.",

In the absence of an official communication from the relevant court notifying the applicant of the appeal and the manner in which he could submit his replies, the applicant was made to bear a situation of procedural uncertainty. In that respect, although the procedural rules relating to the accelerated labour proceedings were silent on the issue of whether the appeal would be communicated to the other party, the Court considers that nothing prevented the national courts from transposing or drawing inspiration from the related provision in the Code of Civil Procedure calling for the communication of documents submitted by one party to the other, to these proceedings (see paragraph 17). In that connection the Court welcomes the new developments in domestic jurisprudence, according to which the appeal of an appellant in accelerated labour proceedings must be communicated to the defendant, which will ensure effective participation of parties in appeal proceedings (see paragraph 19); however, it notes that they cannot affect the applicant\u2019s situation as the previous practice of the Court of Cassation was applicable in the applicant\u2019s case.",
