That court then ruled that any alleged succession to the applicant\u2019s husband of company O.\u2019s rights had not been based on domestic law (see paragraph 22 above). Following an appeal lodged by the applicant, the appellate court partly changed the lower court\u2019s reasoning, finding that company O., but not the other defendant company, had a contractual obligation to provide the applicant\u2019s family with a flat. However, it had not been established that that company had still existed as a legal entity (see paragraph 24 above). Therefore the claim had to be dismissed as unfounded. The Supreme Court upheld those findings.",

In response to the applicant\u2019s appeal, the appellate court determined with sufficient clarity whether the applicant\u2019s late husband had a right to a flat, who had to ensure such a right and why it had turned out to be impossible to do so in practice. The appellate court specifically focused on the role of each defendant company and explained the different reasons why neither of them could be held liable. Similarly, there is nothing to suggest that the courts failed to examine the question of the succession to company O.\u2019s rights. Both the first-instance court and the appellate court addressed that part of the case. The Court finds no other pertinent argument which was not examined by the domestic courts.",

However, the authorities failed to furnish the list. The first-instance court stated only that its attempts to obtain the list from the authorities had not been successful. It neither explained the reasons for its inability to obtain the document at issue, nor showed that all the necessary measures to secure that evidence had been taken. Despite appeals lodged by the applicant on that point, there is nothing to suggest that the higher courts addressed that issue (see, in that regard, Voloshyn v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7 33). In the meantime, the applicant repeatedly referred to other official documents proving, in his opinion, that his grandmother had not received any share of land. Whether or not those documents confirmed the disputed facts was an important aspect of the case, which, however, had not been duly examined by the courts.",
