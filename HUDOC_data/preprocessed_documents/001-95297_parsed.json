Shortly thereafter a single shot was heard and the Turkish-Cypriot soldier was seen running back in a crouched position to the Turkish ceasefire line holding his rifle in his right hand. UNFICYP soldiers were prevented from reaching the National Guard soldier by Turkish-Cypriot soldiers who fired shots in the direction of the UNFICYP soldiers each time the latter tried to move forward. UNFICYP strongly protested to the Commander of the Turkish forces in  the unauthorised entry of an armed Turkish Cypriot soldier into the buffer zone, the shooting incident and the hostile action, including live fire against UNFICYP. UNFICYP is pursuing with the Turkish forces in  and with the Turkish-Cypriot authorities the question of appropriate action and has requested that UNFICYP police investigating the killing be able to interview the Turkish-Cypriot soldier involved in the incident.

However, the P.F. guard can see the actions of the Turkish soldiers at the YILDIRIM guard post within a radius of 5 metres. At the time of the incident the Turkish guard at the YILDIRIM guard post advanced 10\u00a0metres away from his post in order to observe the GCNG soldier and asked the GCNG soldier to stop and leave the area. When the GCNG soldier insisted in continuing, the patrols who arrived at the scene warned the GCNG soldier and asked the Turkish guard \u2013 a corporal \u2013 to return to his trench. The guard then returned to his guard post. It might have been possible for the P.F. guard to see the Turkish soldier returning to his guard post. The Turkish soldier in Z\u0130YAD guard post, which is at a distance of 20\u00a0metres from the UN 60 guard post, saw the P.F. guard sitting in the UN 60 guard post. Both the P.F. guard and the Turkish guards left their posts after the first shot was fired. The P.F. guard, who is said to have witnessed the incident, then continued to observe the incident. Furthermore, it is not possible to go down to the scene of the incident from the YILDIRIM guard post because the river bed is too steep and is covered with 3 metre-long reeds. Even entering the river bed from another direction would not enable the P.F. guard to see.\u201d",

In this connection, the Court is struck by the fact that it appears from the documents submitted by the Government (see paragraph 21 above) that, in spite of their inconsistency with the statements emanating from official UN sources, the domestic authorities do not seem to have challenged the soldiers' statements that the opening of fire had been preceded by warning shots. It is the opinion of the Court that opening of fire should, whenever possible, be preceded by warning shots (see Paragraph 10 of the UN Force and Firearms Principles, quoted in paragraph 22 above). The circumstances of the present case do not show that it was impossible to give such warning and also for that reason the conduct of the \u201cTRNC\u201d soldiers was hard to reconcile with the requirement of absolute necessity enshrined in Article 2 of the Convention.",

However, it considers that the UN personnel were ideally placed and sufficiently trained to evaluate the dangerousness of the situation and to act in a manner that would have preserved the evidence.

The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances.

The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances (see, for example, Kaya, cited above, \u00a7\u00a087). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (with regard to autopsies, see, for example, Salman v.

As they had raised their son at a considerable cost until the age of 19, the applicants were entitled to expect that, in accordance with local tradition and in the absence of a developed welfare State, Stelios Kalli Panayi would have looked after them in their old age. The loss of financial support due to their son's killing could be calculated at 2,400 euros (EUR) per year for each of them. This sum should be multiplied by 15, the number of years between the age of 63 (at which people retired and/or began to have problems and support needs associated with old age) and the age of 78 (average life expectancy in Cyprus). The applicants therefore claimed EUR\u00a036,000 each for pecuniary damage.",

Poland, 25 March 1998, \u00a7 49, Reports\u00a01998-II). The Court notes that the case was rather complex, involved perusing a certain amount of factual and documentary evidence and required a fair degree of research and preparation (see, mutatis mutandis, Solomou and Others, cited above, \u00a7 104). Moreover, the applicants' representatives have produced a detailed bill of costs indicating the out of pocket expenses and the sums due for attending the meetings with their clients, preparing the full text of the application and of the various submissions. In the light of the above, the Court considers the amount requested in respect of costs and expenses for the proceedings before it (EUR\u00a09,888.30) to be reasonable and sufficiently itemised and decides to award it to the applicants.",
