The most recent period of detention that the Court may examine commenced on 6 March 2001. The Court notes the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s detention after 6 March 2001 did not require a separate legal order and was executed on the basis of a mere requirement of the domestic law in force at the material time.

Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific time-limit would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Khudoyorov v.

He allegedly could have remained in custody merely on the basis of the fact that he was charged with a particularly serious criminal offence. The Court reiterates that it has already examined and found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 in a number of cases concerning the practice of keeping defendants in detention without a specific legal basis or clear rules governing their situation \u2013 with the result that they may be deprived of their liberty for an unlimited period without judicial authorisation (see Baranowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-58, and Je\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-64). It has held that such a practice is incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (ibid.). The Court has repeated this finding in several cases against  (see, for example, Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 147-151, and Korchuganova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a057).",

The Government, however, did not point to any legal provision which permitted an accused to continue to be held once the authorised detention period had expired. The Russian Constitution and rules of criminal procedure vested the power to order or extend detention in prosecutors and courts (see paragraph 34 above). No exceptions to that rule were permitted or provided for, no matter how short the duration of the detention. As noted above, after 21 November 2001 there was no formal decision authorising the applicant\u2019s detention.

Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty. It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the true facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention (see Labita, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0152).",

It must be examined with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding and reoffending or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Letellier v.

In this connection, the Court notes that in 1997 the proceedings were stayed for two months because the applicant underwent treatment in the psychiatric hospital (see paragraph 11 above). The applicant also did not attend two hearings in January 1998 because he was ill. The Government did not indicate any other period when the proceedings were stayed or any other hearing which was adjourned due to the applicant\u2019s or his representative\u2019s conduct.

The Court is not called upon to determine the reasons for the delay in preparation of the expert reports (inability to answer questions, absence of necessary qualification, etc.), because Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v. Austria, no. 30546/96, \u00a7\u00a057, 3\u00a0October 2000).
