He observed that a detainee ought to be released from prison if the term of detention was not extended by a court. On the basis of the above observations, the Ombudsman concluded that certain periods of the applicant\u2019s detention had been unlawful under the domestic criminal procedure. The Ombudsman rejected the prison administration\u2019s arguments that there had been valid court decisions during the overall period of the applicant\u2019s detention and that Article 106 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure authorised the applicant\u2019s continued remand in custody for more than six years, given that the maximum sentence for the most serious offence with which the applicant was charged was 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. The Ombudsman emphasised that this legal provision was incompatible with the right to be brought to trial within a reasonable time guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. The Ombudsman also drew the attention of the Prosecutor General and the Court of Appeal to the fact that the length of the applicant\u2019s remand in custody had been excessive. Finally he addressed the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs, stating that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure \u201cregulating the terms of detention on remand are not clear or logical [because] calculating the terms depends on various circumstances, including access to the case-file and dates when a particular decision becomes effective\u201d. As such circumstances were not foreseeable and could be interpreted in different ways, the Ombudsman suggested amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure.                 ",

While part of the decision, insofar as it concerned the remand in custody, could not be contested by way of an appeal due to the statutory bar as then applicable (former Article 372 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), the decision was open to appeal insofar as it concerned the order for further investigations. The prosecutors availed of their right to appeal the latter part of the decision, but were unsuccessful at the appellate level (decision of \n26 August 1997). They brought a further appeal to the Court of Appeal which executed its jurisdiction at \u201ccassation level\u201d. On 29 January 1998 the Court of Appeal purported to quash the decisions of 23 May 1997 and \n26 August 1997, including the part of the decision of 23 May 1997 concerning the applicant\u2019s detention.

Although a period of detention is, in principle, lawful if it is based on a valid court order (loc. cit., \u00a7 68), the Court considers that the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time may be incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1.",

The Court of Appeal gave no reasons for its decision in this respect and, by reinstating the detention order issued more than a year before, it took no account of the applicant\u2019s current situation. This failure was even more regrettable given that the orders of 3 January and 23 May 1997 had not referred to any reasons for the applicant\u2019s remand in custody, with the result that no ground for the applicant\u2019s detention had been mentioned in a valid detention order since 20 August 1996 (see \u00a7 17 above). In these circumstances, even assuming that on 29 January 1998 the Court of Appeal was competent to decide the question of the applicant\u2019s detention by retroactively reinstating the detention order of 3 January 1997, the handling by the Court of Appeal of the remand matter did not comply with the requirements of clarity, foreseeability, and the protection from arbitrariness, which together constitute the essential elements of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Continued detention may be justified in a given case only if there are clear indications of a genuine public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the right to liberty. It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to examine the circumstances for or against the existence of such an imperative interest, and to set them out in their decisions on the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions, and of the facts established by the applicant in his appeals, that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. The persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. The Court must then establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d to continue to justify the deprivation of liberty (loc. cit., \u00a7 93).

Furthermore, the detention orders of 3 January and 23 May 1997, and the decision of the Court of Appeal of 29 January 1998, did not refer to any grounds for remand (see, in particular, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68 above). While fear of the applicant\u2019s absconding was indicated by the judges as the essential ground for their refusal of his various requests for release in 1997 and 1998, the Court considers that at that time this ground had already become less convincing, given that the applicant had spend almost four years in detention on remand before his conviction was pronounced. It must also be noted that the Ombudsman found that the length of the applicant\u2019s detention had been excessive in terms of domestic law, and that the investigation had been unduly delayed by the authorities (see \u00a7 30). The situation further aggravated following the annulment of the applicant\u2019s conviction on \n30 September 1999, after which he spent more than four months in custody despite the fact that he had already completed the maximum term of punishment for the offence of which he was accused (see \u00a7 49 above).
