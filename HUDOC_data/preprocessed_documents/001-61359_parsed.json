Although subsequently the trial court took some action since it dealt with the applications concerning the enforceability order and exemption from the court-fees, this does not justify the lack of examination of the merits of the applicant's case. Moreover, the Court notes that the examination of the applicant's appeal against a decision to dismiss his application to grant the enforceability order lasted over three years which significantly contributed to the delay in examining the case (see\u00a0paragraph 11 above).",
