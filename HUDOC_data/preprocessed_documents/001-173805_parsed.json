Thus, the \u201cactive electoral right\u201d was not limited to the right to cast a vote freely at the polling station; it also included the process of counting votes and obtaining a correct final result which reflected the real will of the electorate. Voters should have the right to check the validity of the counting process. In addition, the interests of the parties participating in the elections and the voters might be different. The fact that the process of casting votes was secret did not preclude voters from complaining about incorrect recording of the results, since this affected the election process as a whole and could potentially undermine the legitimacy of the elected body. Therefore, it did not matter which party the particular voter had voted for at the elections. The Constitutional Court concluded that voters should have the right to lodge complaints about the process of counting votes (point 2.1 of the judgment).",

The law must introduce rules to prevent competing political forces from abusing the right to bring judicial proceedings and from employing such practices as a tool for political manipulation. The rules of the CCP and the other instruments under examination by the Constitutional Court, as they were formulated at the time, implied that all participants in elections, irrespective of their status and the type and scale of the violation concerned, had equal rights to bring complaints before a court about any violation of their electoral rights. However, such a lack of differentiation was prejudicial to the stability of the democratic system and created an opportunity for abuse. The procedure for judicial review of irregularities in election procedures was unified at all levels of the electoral system; however, the interest of voters in having their vote counted accurately was stronger at the level of the precinct where they voted (as opposed to higher levels of the electoral system).",

The members of the Commission had been informed about the complaints received by the Commission, and that had been enough to satisfy the requirements of the law. In particular, it was perfectly acceptable that all those complaints had been examined by a special working group created within the Commission, and not the Commission itself. The Supreme Court also noted that, in breach of the law, the individuals who had lodged the complaints with the City Electoral Commission had not been invited to be present for the examination of their complaints; however, that was not a sufficient ground for declaring the final decision of the City Electoral Commission unlawful. The Supreme Court also held that the \u201cconsolidated protocols\u201d containing the election results at city level had been approved in accordance with the correct procedure and were therefore lawful. The failure of the City Electoral Commission to notify all interested parties in accordance with section 30(1) of the Basic Guarantees Act did not constitute a ground for invalidating the results of the elections, since \u201cit had not prevented the actual will of the voters from being determined\u201d.",

Most of the complaints related to the difference between the results reported in the copies of the protocols received by the observers and \u201cthe data in the possession of the TEC\u201d. The protocols which were submitted to the TEC differed from the protocols which had been given to the observers; this was why the TEC had decided to recount the votes. As a result, the information which was in the possession of the TEC had been confirmed. When the recount was being conducted the chairmen of the PECs concerned had not been present, but the candidates had been. The observers had not been informed of the recount, but they had in any event been present at the TEC; all the actions of the TEC had been visible to them. As a result of the recount the TEC had drawn up new protocols.",

In particular, the actual recount had taken place in the basement room of the district administration building where the TEC was located, and that room had remained closed since it contained sealed bags with the ballot papers delivered from the PECs. Mr R. had opened the bags in her presence, breaking the seals which had been placed by the PECs. The room had contained no furniture, and they had brought only two chairs into it. The recount had been carried out by her and Mr R., and each precinct had taken about two hours to count. This work had lasted almost the entire day of 5 December 2011. While no one else had been specifically invited to the room, the observers, other members of the TEC and others had been able to enter it and observe the recount. The new protocols had then been drawn up in the main room used by the TEC, upstairs. Ms S. was unable to say what had happened to the \u201coriginal\u201d protocols.",

Its reasoning, which was almost identical to the judgment of the District Court, can be summarised as follows. First, the first-instance court had been correct not to take into account the copies of protocols submitted by the applicant, since the witnesses questioned in the court did not confirm that they had given their copies directly to him. The copies submitted by the applicant did not meet the formal requirements. In addition, the copies of the protocols concerning precincts nos. 640, 644 and 653 did not correspond to the copies which were in the archives of the three respective PECs. The applicant had failed to prove that the elections had been tainted by violations of the electoral law which had prevented the will of the voters from being established. According to the decisions issued by TEC no. 21 on 5\u00a0December 2011, the results had been declared void in the following precincts: nos. 667, 666, 646, 641, 668, 665, 664, 662, 657, 654, 652, 651, 641, 638, 635, 637, 681, 680, 678, 675, 630, 682, 627 and 629. In all those precincts the TEC had conducted recounts, on the basis of \u201cdoubts as to whether the protocols were drawn up correctly\u201d, \u201ccomplaints of violations of the law\u201d, and \u201ca complaint by Mr\u00a0L.\u201d. The TEC\u2019s actions had been lawful. The TEC members had had the right to be present during the recount, but they had not been obliged to be there; consequently, their absence had not affected the lawfulness of the recount.",

These results are challenged by the first to fifth applicants (see paragraphs 18-34 above). The claimant stressed that information about eighteen electoral precincts (including the precincts challenged by the five applicants) had been recorded incorrectly, that is to say differently from the \u201coriginal\u201d protocols issued as a result of the calculation of votes at the precinct commissions, in the presence of all the members of those commissions and observers. The complaints which had subsequently been lodged with the territorial commission could not serve as valid grounds for invalidating these results and ordering recounts, as no complaints had been lodged or recorded at the time of the calculation of the total number of votes in each of the precincts.",

Second, in eight of the precincts the recount had been ordered by the TEC. The TEC submitted a copy of its report, which noted breaches in formalising these eight PEC reports, and the court agreed that the breaches were serious (unrecorded corrections; inconsistency between the sum of the number of votes cast for each party and the total number of votes cast; difference between the figures noted numerically and spelled out, and so on). In such circumstances, the decisions to conduct a recount had been a lawful one; the final returns issued following the recounts had been correct and the results matched the figures announced by the City Electoral Commission.

Similarly worded decisions, signed by the TEC chairman and secretary at an unspecified time on 5 December 2011, stated that there were \u201ccomplaints lodged with the territorial electoral commission about breaches of legislation occurring in precinct electoral commission no. ... during the counting of votes, and other evidence providing objective reasons to doubt the correctness of the protocols\u201d. The identical decisions then stated that, in the circumstances, the alleged breaches could be overcome by conducting recounts. The precinct commissions concerned were directed to carry out the recounts \u201cimmediately\u201d and to draw up new protocols marked \u201crecount\u201d.

On 22 July 2014 the Ministry of the Interior forensic expert centre concluded that the copies of the protocols relied upon by the tenth applicant (PECs nos. 1089 and 1104) had been certified by stamps which differed from the stamps used by those PECs to certify the copies submitted to the City Electoral Commission. For all the other protocols no such conclusion could be drawn. Furthermore, several copies submitted by the applicants differed from the copies submitted by the CEC, meaning that those two sets of documents had not been simply reproduced by means of electronic reproduction. The expert report was unable to conclude that the documents in question had been tampered with or subjected to any changes or alterations.",

He argued that the applicants in the present case had submitted documents to the European Court which they claimed were authentic copies of the \u201coriginal\u201d election protocols from a number of precincts in St Petersburg. The letter pointed out that these documents raised doubts as to their authenticity, and asked the Investigative Committee to carry out an inquiry into the matter. On 25\u00a0September 2014 the Kirovskiy District Department of the Investigative Committee initiated an inquiry (\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0430) into the matter. Subsequent documents indicate that the Department attempted to contact eleven applicants in this case and to collect information from them. It appears that only Mr Shestakov, the eleventh applicant, was questioned. He reiterated what he had already stated about the way he had obtained copies of the protocols from members of PECs and observers. On 27 October 2014 an investigator of the District Department ruled that a criminal investigation should not be opened, finding no evidence of crimes under Articles 141, 142 and 142.1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 191 below). At the same time, in so far as the question concerned copies of the \u201coriginal\u201d protocols, the investigator forwarded the relevant material to the St Petersburg Department of the Interior to decide whether there had been any falsification of official documents.",

Complaints against the CEC were to be lodged with the Supreme Court; complaints against decisions and acts of regional electoral commissions concerning elections to the federal legislature were to be lodged with the regional courts; and complaints against actions of all other electoral commissions were to be lodged with the district courts. When examining a complaint against an electoral commission\u2019s decision, the relevant court also took into account the decisions of the lower electoral commissions if the violations alleged could have influenced the results of the elections in question (section 75 (4)). The courts\u2019 decisions were binding and could, inter alia, invalidate the commissions\u2019 decisions about the results and outcome of the elections. In April 2014 this section of the Basic Guarantees Act was amended so as to expressly mention the right of voters to challenge the results in the precincts where they had voted, taking into account the ruling of the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 80-88 above).",

The right to lodge complaints was granted to voters, candidates and their representatives, electoral groups, public bodies, observers and the commissions themselves. The commission considering the complaint should invite the complainant and a representative of the commission concerned (section 75(10) and (12)). If the commission identified breaches of law during the voting or during the drawing up of the results, it could declare the results void and, if necessary, call for a recount. The commission could act upon complaints until the results of the elections had been officially approved, following which the results could only be challenged before a competent court (section 77).",

In addition, decisions on the results of elections must also not take too long, especially where the political climate is tense. This means both that the time limits for appeals must be very short and that the appeal body must make its ruling as quickly as possible. Time limits must, however, be long enough to make an appeal possible, to guarantee the exercise of rights of defence and a reflected decision. A time limit of three to five days at first instance (both for lodging appeals and making rulings) seems reasonable for decisions to be taken before the elections.

It is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints, and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, and Selmouni v. France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999-V). The Court further emphasises that the domestic remedies must be \u201ceffective\u201d in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7 158, ECHR 2000-XI). Where several remedies are available, an applicant who has made use of a remedy that is apparently effective and sufficient cannot be required also to have tried others that were available but probably no more likely to be successful (see Aquilina v.\u00a0Malta [GC], no. 25642/94, \u00a7 39, ECHR 1999III). An applicant cannot be regarded as having failed to exhaust domestic remedies if he or she can show, by providing relevant domestic caselaw or any other suitable evidence, that an available remedy which he or she has not used was bound to fail. For example, applicants who have not pursued a remedy that has already proved ineffective for other applicants in the same position can reasonably be exempted from doing so (see, mutatis mutandis, Kleyn and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98 and 3\u00a0others, \u00a7 156, ECHR 2003VI).",

The complaints in respect of each of the constituencies where the results had been challenged by them were submitted for examination to at least one of the national authorities suggested by the Government. Between them, they exhausted all of those remedies and maintained that no effective review had been provided. In so far as the Government suggested that the applicants should have had recourse to the cassation procedure, it is true that the Court ruled in May 2015 that the two-tier cassation procedure introduced in January 2012 in civil proceedings constituted a domestic remedy to be used for exhaustion purposes (see Abramyan and Others v. Russia (dec.), nos. 38951/13 and 59611/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a076-96, 12 May 2015).

The Court notes that the position of the Russian Supreme Court, as expressed in its decision of 9\u00a0February 2012 and before the matter was reversed by the Constitutional Court in its ruling of 22 April 2013, was that the violations complained of affected the interests of the political parties whose candidates had stood for election, and not of individual voters or candidates, who had no standing to challenge them in the courts (see paragraph 79 above). In view of this, the three applicants in question could reasonably have concluded that they had no standing before the domestic courts and that they should rely instead on the party to raise such complaints on their behalf. In these circumstances, they could reasonably be exempted from from the obligation to pursue a remedy that had proved inaccessible to other persons in the same position.",

The results of the recounts had largely benefited the ruling party, to the detriment of the opposition parties.

There had been no State interference with the free expression of the will of the people at any stage of the process; the voters had been able to cast their votes; the results had been correctly assessed and recorded; and all complaints lodged had been effectively reviewed. In respect of the applicants who had complained of breaches of their passive electoral rights, the Government reiterated that they had been able to stand as candidates on party lists and fully participate in the elections in that capacity. The number of votes cast for each of the applicants, and the good overall results for SR in St Petersburg (the party had come second in the LA elections and third in the State Duma elections) showed that the elections had been free and pluralistic. There existed no guarantee of being elected, so long as the general requirements of free expression of the will of the people were complied with. The St Petersburg regional list of SR, which concerned five of the applicants (Mr Davydov, Mr\u00a0Payalin, Mr Truskanov, Ms\u00a0Pushkareva and Mr\u00a0Shestakov) had included over fifty candidates, and the top twelve had been elected to the LA. These five applicants had retained their positions on the party\u2019s list and would be eligible to replace candidates in the LA, should any of the serving SR members lose their seat. The five applicants had continued their political activity; some of them had been elected to municipal councils (Mr\u00a0Shestakov and Mr\u00a0Truskanov), and others had stood in the municipal elections in 2014, with varying results. The fact that there had had to be recounts in some precincts, in accordance with the guarantees set down in the applicable legislation, could not be interpreted as interference. Moreover, the results of the recounts demonstrated that the gains and losses had not been uniformly in favour of or to the detriment of any particular party; contrary to the applicants\u2019 assertions, in many constituencies ER had lost votes, and SR had gained votes or remained on an equal number.",

The copies of the relevant reports of the TEC decisions (the Government referred to TECs nos. 3, 4, 7, 21 and 27), showed that the decisions had been taken, in each case, upon weighty grounds, and by a lawful composition, namely a majority of members.

Copies of these decisions had been submitted to the Court (see paragraphs 154-157 above). All these decisions had been made public and had not been appealed against by the applicants or by the TEC members who had been absent during the recounts. The law did not stipulate which commission, precinct or territorial, should conduct recounts; this depended on the practical circumstances of the case. As to the method of conducting recounts, the Government explained that \u201cunlike the [initial] procedure of determination of the election results, recounts mean recounting the ballot papers which have already been sorted (packed in stacks), which considerably accelerates the procedure.

While the Contracting States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in imposing conditions on the right to vote and to stand for election, it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate or arbitrary (see MathieuMohin and Clerfayt, cited above, \u00a7 52, and Yumak and Sadak, cited above, \u00a7 109 (iii)).",

The Court reiterates here that the word \u201clegislature\u201d in Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention does not necessarily mean the national parliament: the word has to be interpreted in the light of the constitutional structure of the State in question (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, \u00a7 53, and Matthews, \u00a7 40, both cited above).

The recounting of votes on such a massive scale in itself points to a serious dysfunction in the electoral system and is capable of throwing serious doubts on the fairness of the entire process. The Court observes in this respect that the Venice Commission Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters recommends in section I.3.2 of its Guidelines that \u201ccounting should preferably take place at polling stations\u201d; the Explanatory Report on the Code adds in paragraph 45 that \u201cthis arrangement obviates the need to transport the ballot boxes and accompanying documents, thus reducing the risk of substitution\u201d (see paragraph 196 above).

The courts\u2019 examinations were mostly limited to purely formal issues, principally whether the copies of the results protocols obtained from the precinct commissions following the conclusion of the count had complied with numerous requirements applicable to such documents. The courts routinely dismissed documents certified by signatures of competent PEC officials and stamps as invalid evidence for trivial reasons, such as the failure to indicate the running number of the original copy from which the copy in question had been made, the absence of an indication of the address of the precinct commission, or the absence of a note indicating that it was an authentic copy (see, for example, paragraphs 118, 134, 143 and 147 above). The Court does not wish to deny the importance of adherence to rules of procedure in matters of election administration and the recording of results.

These aspects were not addressed by the district courts, which regularly referred to the official endorsement of the final results by the electoral commissions as the principal reason to dismiss the allegations as unfounded (see, for example, paragraphs 120 and 136 above).",
