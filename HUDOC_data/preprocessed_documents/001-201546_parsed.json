Lacking detailed description of the beatings, the applicant\u2019s allegations are not supported by the evidence in the case. The medical certificate issued by the hospital on the day of the alleged suicide attempt indicated a bruise on his head and cuts on his forearms (see paragraph 8 above). No other injuries supporting his allegations of the longstanding beatings were found. The Court considers that the location of the applicant\u2019s injuries correspond to the conclusions of the Sverdlovskiy Regional Court that they had resulted from his suicide attempt (see paragraph 14 above), when he jumped out of the window breaking the glass. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint about the events of 29 and 30 November 2005 is therefore manifestly illfounded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention.",
