He had at the time interrogated the applicant, but he had certainly not been alone: in order to avoid unfounded allegations, other colleagues had been present for at least part of the time.  Markl denied having used violence against the applicant, and supposed that the applicant and his wife, for unknown reasons, wanted to take revenge on them.  As to the course of the interrogations, Markl specified that at the beginning the applicant had denied any involvement in the offences at issue; only in the further course of questioning had he given the decisive hint as to the identity of the actual culprit.  As regards the injuries sustained by the applicant, Markl confirmed his statements in his report of 1 June 1988.  During the drive, he had been sitting next to the applicant, who had been handcuffed with his hands in front of his body, in the rear of the police car.  Markl continued that he had opened the door on the applicant\u2019s side from the outside.  The applicant had stumbled while getting out and fallen, knocking his right arm against the doorframe.  Markl had only been able to stop him falling.  The applicant had said that he was all right. Only the next day had he mentioned a bruise on his right upper arm.  Markl could not remember any other injuries or a footprint on the applicant\u2019s trousers.  Markl clarified that he had written the report concerning the accident on 2 June, but had put the date of the incident.  Markl further confirmed that a superior, possibly presented as a legally qualified person, had shortly been present at one of the interrogations.  Markl also indicated that he worked normally 60 to 70 hours overtime per month; at the relevant time he had possibly done 80 to 90 hours overtime. Moreover, they had not consumed any kind of alcohol during their work.\"",

Following their arrest, the applicant and his wife had been brought to the Police Authority.  Questioned about the further development of matters regarding the applicant, Police Officer Markl stated that the applicant\u2019s identity had been established and he had been questioned about the offences concerned.  Markl confirmed that Police Officer Fr\u00f6hlich had been present in the course of the interrogation.  However, he could not remember whether Police Officers Gross and Trnka had been also there.  The applicant had claimed to be innocent, and even claimed that he had nothing to do with drugs and in particular opium.  He had complained that the police was again creating difficulties.  Moreover, the applicant had repeatedly indicated that he would cause troubles and ridicule them.  Police Officer Markl then described the events when the applicant had been taken out of the building of the Police Authority: The applicant had been handcuffed with his hands in front of his body, he had been sitting in the rear of the police car.  Upon arrival, Markl had opened the door where the child lock had been in position as a precautionary measure.  When getting out of the car, the applicant had lost his balance, had fallen and hit his right arm against the door frame.  He had shown his injury, a round bruise, but had not wanted to see a doctor.  Upon further questioning by the public prosecutor, Markl stated that, upon the arrest, a piece of hashish had been found upon the applicant, nothing upon his wife.  However, police informers had told them that the applicant had been dealing with heroin and had been selling washing powder to drug addicts.  This information had not been recorded as the informers were not prepared to make a statement for the record.  Upon further questioning, Markl indicated that, having first denied any relationship to one of the victims, the applicant and his wife had later admitted a close relationship.",

It is a fact recognised by the courts (gerichtsbekannt) that it is impossible to prove the existence of a cervical syndrome by objective means, even using X-rays.  To have consulted a medical expert for this purpose would therefore merely have led to a delay in the proceedings. A haematoma about as big as an egg, many other bruises and a cervical syndrome constitute bodily harm.

Both he and his defence lawyer, as well as his superior officer, Mr Pretzner, attempted at the trial (file, page 114 in item 25) to make Ronald Ribitsch out to be a despicable, work-shy individual.  Apart from the fact that an officer of the Security Branch does not have the right to beat someone up in order to induce him to make a confession, simply because he is unemployed, what is noteworthy here is the obviously misguided attitude of the accused to his legal obligations.  In his efforts to portray the witness Ribitsch as a depraved individual, he suddenly claimed at the trial that the two anonymous callers had been Wilhelm Puschl and Ursula Hennemann.  He had, he stated, in the meantime learned from them that \u2018Ribitsch [was] a despicable creature (eine miese Kr\u00f6te) because he [sold] washing powder to the poorest of the poor, the drug addicts\u2019 (file, page 128 in item 25).  When the court asked him whether he had reported this, he was forced to reply that he had not.  He subsequently went on to entangle himself in more and more contradictions concerning the statements made by these two witnesses (file, page 129 in item 25).  If the accused\u2019s claim were really true this would mean that an officer of the Security Branch, who had good reason to suspect someone of, at the very least, deliberately inflicting grievous bodily harm by selling washing powder he passed off as heroin, did not consider it necessary in any way at all to perform his duty under Article 84 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  The conclusion must be drawn that the accused Markl would prefer to allow criminal acts to be committed with potentially fatal consequences than to run the risk of having people say that he now wants to pin something on Ribitsch - which he is obviously afraid of (see page 129).",

He, Markl, who had been standing right next to him, had managed to grab his upper left arm but had not been able to prevent him from falling.  However, due to his intervention the fall had been rendered much less serious, and Ribitsch had only fallen gently on to his behind.  Markl therefore himself states that he grabbed Ribitsch by the left arm, so that he cannot have inflicted a bruise on the inside of the right arm by catching him in this way.  However, this version of events in the report is also contradicted by the witness Fr\u00f6hlich (file, page 103 in item 25). This witness stated that there had been a big problem finding a place to park.  He had had to park very close to another vehicle, so that he had had a great deal of trouble getting out of his own.  It is `very strange\u2019 (lebensfremd) that, although the driver of the vehicle had great difficulty getting out of it on his side, and although, because of the tight squeeze, the suspect at the time (Mr Ribitsch) must obviously also have had trouble getting out - Markl stated that Ronald Ribitsch sat directly behind the driver - there was yet sufficient room for Ribitsch to fall against the edge of the door and then on to his bottom. If one considers Ronald Ribitsch\u2019s size, that is impossible. Furthermore, the witness Scheidlbauer, who is a general practitioner, made a statement as an expert witness that was both credible and `easy to understand\u2019 (nachvollziehbar), namely that whilst the largest bruise had been on the upper right arm it had not been the only one there.  He continued by drawing attention to a phenomenon that the courts have recognised in many previous cases, namely that a person who falls against a hard edge normally has a graze or a skin wound, whereas when a person falls against or is struck by something without sharp edges, whether it is something with a large surface area or a fist, it is not the surface that is affected but the soft tissues underneath the skin (file, page 107).  Similarly, a cervical syndrome could be the result of Ribitsch\u2019s head being violently shaken.",

Similarly, Ribitsch\u2019s claim (loc. cit.) that he was hit on the body in such a way \u2018that this did not leave many marks but was nevertheless very painful\u2019 would suggest that the officers had gone about their task in a methodical way, but this cannot be reconciled with Ronald Ribitsch\u2019s account, according to which the officers, in their efforts to force him to confess, had lost all control over their actions.  This version of events does not tally with Mr Ribitsch\u2019s assertion that it was possible for him to distinguish between the officers questioning him and those who were maltreating him, given that, according to other statements made by Ribitsch, Josef Markl participated both in the interrogation and in the ill-treatment.\"",

In stating its reasons, the Regional Criminal Court cast doubt on the applicant\u2019s credibility, notably on the basis of considerations unrelated to the course of events while he was in police custody.  These included his conviction for a drug offence in October 1988, the fact that he was unemployed, the fact that he was living beyond his means and the fact that he \"chose the course of making a public accusation on Austrian radio\" rather than lodging a complaint.  In justifying its departure from the view of the evidence taken by the court of first instance, the Regional Criminal Court also included the observation that \"one cannot simply assume that a police officer, and one moreover who had good reason to be aware of the heightened vigilance of the media, would let himself be drawn into criminal acts in a way that defies all logic\" (see paragraph 22 above).",

The Government were accordingly under an obligation to provide a plausible explanation of how the applicant\u2019s injuries were caused.  But the Government did no more than refer to the outcome of the domestic criminal proceedings, where the high standard of proof necessary to secure a criminal conviction was not found to have been satisfied.  It is also clear that, in that context, significant weight was given to the explanation that the injuries were caused by a fall against a car door.  Like the Commission, the Court finds this explanation unconvincing; it considers that, even if Mr Ribitsch had fallen while he was being moved under escort, this could only have provided a very incomplete, and therefore insufficient, explanation of the injuries concerned.",

In the course of these inquiries it questioned, among others, Mr Ribitsch, who was known to be a drug user and was also suspected of being a dealer.  Two informants, one of whom was a close friend of one of the deceased, had identified Mr Ribitsch as the supplier of the fatal dose of heroin.",

The judge mainly relied on the evidence given by the witnesses - Mr Ribitsch and other persons who can be numbered among his friends and relatives - and on the certificates made out by the hospital staff and the general practitioner, in which an account was given of the injuries to Mr Ribitsch\u2019s person and other symptoms the latter had described.

The main aim of this report was to establish, as far as possible, the cause of the injuries noted by the doctors and the symptoms the applicant had complained of.  Its conclusion was that the injuries and symptoms concerned could be explained in various ways; it was quite possible that they had been due to a cause different from that accepted by the District Court.  The Regional Criminal Court, composed of three career judges, carefully evaluated the evidence before it, examining in detail the statements of the applicant and the other witnesses, and acquitted the police officer, on cogent grounds. Moreover, it is the practice of appellate courts in  not to overturn the judgment of a lower court unless they have serious doubts whether it is well-founded.",
