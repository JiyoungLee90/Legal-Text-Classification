The three rules are not, however, \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21\u00a0February\u00a01986, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 98, and, more recently, B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy v.\u00a0Hungary [GC], no. 53080/13, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2016).",

Having regard to the punitive nature of such a measure, as acknowledged by the County Court itself, the automatic and mandatory confiscation of possessions belonging to third parties raises a serious issue not only of lack of proportionality but also of a gross breach of the presumption of innocence. The manner in which confiscation as laid down in Article 220 (k) of the Code of Tax Procedure was applied to the applicant company\u2019s two fuel tankers by the domestic courts in the administrative proceedings against the company N. left the administrative and judicial authorities no choice but to carry out the confiscation in accordance with the factual circumstances, and even prevented them from opting for a less intrusive penalty. The measure therefore amounted to a \u201cblind\u201d restriction on the right to property, making no distinction between the status of owner and that of holder by permission of the property used for the unlawful transport of goods subject to excise duty.

Consequently, while acknowledging the need for action to combat tax fraud, and even though the States must benefit from a broad margin of appreciation in this sphere, we consider that the interference with the applicant company\u2019s right to respect for its property failed to strike a fair balance between the requirements of the general interests of society and those of the protection of the applicant\u2019s fundamental rights.
