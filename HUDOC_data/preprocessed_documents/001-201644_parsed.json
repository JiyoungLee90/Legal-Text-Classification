The Court does not have any reason to depart from that finding in the present two cases. As in the above case, the applicants produced strong prima facie evidence of ownership and destruction of their property during the hostilities (see paragraphs\u00a07 and 13 above). Their claims and accompanying documents were accepted for review by the Commission (see paragraphs 8 and 14 above), and, furthermore, their entitlement to have their respective claims processed by the Commission was in each of the two present cases confirmed by the final judgments of the domestic courts. As in Arzhiyeva and Tsadayev (cited above, \u00a7\u00a054), various authorities cited the absence of entry in the register as the only reason why their claims had not been processed earlier (see paragraphs\u00a010-11, 16, 19 and 23 above). Against this background, and having regard to the nature of the domestic judicial awards (see paragraphs\u00a09 and 17 above), the Court considers that the applicants had, by virtue of the judgments in their favour confirming their entitlement under the domestic law to have their claims determined under the no-fault compensation scheme, a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d to acquire a pecuniary asset which was sufficiently established to constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d falling within the ambit of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention (see Gerasimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7177-79, with further references).",
