It observes that the applicants participated in candidates\u2019 meetings, they chose some of the plots offered to them and refused others for reasons which do not appear unjustified (see paragraphs\u00a023 and 26 above). Even though during the meeting held in December 2012 the applicants stated that they wished to wait for the Court\u2019s decision with regard to some of their property rights, that did not preclude the authorities from restoring their rights to the four plots which they had chosen at that same meeting (see paragraph 22 above). Furthermore, while in April 2015 the applicants sent a letter asking the NLS to stop planning the two plots which they had previously chosen (see paragraph 24 above), that letter concerned only those specific plots, and afterwards the applicants continued participating in the restitution process and chose several other plots offered to them (see paragraphs\u00a025 and 26 above). Accordingly, it cannot be said that the applicants effectively suspended the restitution process (compare and contrast Beinarovi\u010d and Others, cited above, \u00a7 162). The Court therefore sees no grounds to find that the applicants themselves significantly contributed to the delays.",
