The Court also found in \u00d6calan v. Turkey (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0114-115) that when a military judge participated in one or more interlocutory decisions that continued to remain in effect in the criminal proceedings concerned, the military judge\u2019s replacement by a civilian judge in the course of those proceedings before the verdict was delivered, failed to dissipate the applicant\u2019s reasonably held concern about that trial court\u2019s independence and impartiality, unless it was established that the procedure subsequently followed in the state security court sufficiently allayed that concern.",
