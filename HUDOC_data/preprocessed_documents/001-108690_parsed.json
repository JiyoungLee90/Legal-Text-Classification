The applicant\u2019s lawyer challenged the refusal to bring the action, arguing that her client should have the opportunity to assess by himself whether or not, having regard to the living conditions at the home, it was in his interests to remain there. She pointed out that the enforced continuation of his stay in the home, on the pretext of providing him with treatment in his own interests, amounted in practice to a deprivation of liberty, a situation that was unacceptable. A person could not be placed in an institution without his or her consent. In accordance with the legislation in force, anyone under partial guardianship was free to choose his or her place of residence, with the guardian\u2019s agreement. The choice of residence was therefore not a matter within the competence of the prosecution service. Despite those objections, the regional prosecutor\u2019s refusal was upheld on 11 October 2005 by the appellate prosecutor, and subsequently on 29 November 2005 by the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office at the Supreme Court of Cassation.",

In a letter of 7\u00a0October 2005, the District Court stated that since the applicant was partially lacking legal capacity he was required to submit a valid form of authority certifying that his lawyer was representing him, and that it should be specified whether his guardian had intervened in the procedure.

On 18\u00a0January 2006 the court held a hearing at which the representative of the mayor of Rila objected that the form of authority was invalid as it had not been countersigned by the guardian. The guardian, who was present at the hearing, stated that he was not opposed to the applicant\u2019s application, but that the latter\u2019s old-age pension was insufficient to meet his needs and that, accordingly, the Pastra social care home was the best place for him to live.",

According to the Government, in the event of a refusal the applicants\u2019 relatives could have applied to a court, which would have considered the merits of the request and, if appropriate, appointed a new guardian, who would then have been able to terminate the placement agreement. The Government also submitted in substance that the applicant\u2019s close relatives could have challenged the contract signed between the guardian R.P. and the Pastra social care home. Lastly, they indicated that the applicant himself could have requested the guardianship authority to appoint an ad hoc representative on account of his alleged conflict of interests with his guardian, with a view to requesting to leave the institution and establish his home elsewhere (Article 123 \u00a7 1 of the FC).",

Although the process of classification into one or other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the Court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of Article 5 depends (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, \u00a7\u00a7 92-93, Series\u00a0A no. 39).

The State is therefore obliged to take measures providing effective protection of vulnerable persons, including reasonable steps to prevent a deprivation of liberty of which the authorities have or ought to have knowledge (see Storck, cited above, \u00a7 102). Thus, having regard to the particular circumstances of the cases before it, the Court has held that the national authorities\u2019 responsibility was engaged as a result of detention in a psychiatric hospital at the request of the applicant\u2019s guardian (see Shtukaturov, cited above) and detention in a private clinic (see Storck, cited above).",

No members of the applicant\u2019s family were involved in his guardianship arrangements, and the duties of guardian were assigned to a State official (Ms R.P.), who negotiated and signed the placement agreement with the Pastra social care home without any contact with the applicant, whom she had in fact never met. The placement agreement was implemented in a State-run institution by social services, which likewise did not interview the applicant (see paragraphs 12-15 above). The applicant was never consulted about his guardian\u2019s choices, even though he could have expressed a valid opinion and his consent was necessary in accordance with the Persons and Family Act 1949 (see paragraph 42 above). That being so, he was not transferred to the Pastra social care home at his request or on the basis of a voluntary private-law agreement on admission to an institution to receive social assistance and protection. The Court considers that the restrictions complained of by the applicant are the result of various steps taken by public authorities and institutions through their officials, from the initial request for his placement in an institution and throughout the implementation of the relevant measure, and not of acts or initiatives by private individuals. Although there is no indication that the applicant\u2019s guardian acted in bad faith, the above considerations set the present case apart from Nielsen (cited above), in which the applicant\u2019s mother committed her son, a minor, to a psychiatric institution in good faith, which prompted the Court to find that the measure in question entailed the exercise of exclusive custodial rights over a child who was not capable of expressing a valid opinion.",

Instead, he was taken to Pastra by ambulance and placed in the home without being informed of the reasons for or duration of that measure, which had been taken by his officially assigned guardian. The Court observes in this connection that there are situations where the wishes of a person with impaired mental faculties may validly be replaced by those of another person acting in the context of a protective measure and that it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the true wishes or preferences of the person concerned. However, the Court has already held that the fact that a person lacks legal capacity does not necessarily mean that he is unable to comprehend his situation (see Shtukaturov, cited above, \u00a7 108). In the present case, domestic law attached a certain weight to the applicant\u2019s wishes and it appears that he was well aware of his situation.

In support of that contention, the applicant argued that the Director of the home had deemed him capable of integrating into the community and that attempts had been made to bring him closer to his family, albeit to no avail. Accordingly, the authorities had based their decision to place him in the home on the simple fact that his family were not prepared to take care of him and he needed social assistance. They had not examined whether the necessary assistance could be provided through alternative measures that were less restrictive of his personal liberty. Such measures were, moreover, quite conceivable since Bulgarian legislation made provision for a wide range of social services, such as personal assistance, social rehabilitation centres and special allowances and pensions. The authorities had thus failed to strike a fair balance between the applicant\u2019s social needs and his right to liberty. It would be arbitrary, and contrary to the purpose of Article 5, for detention to be based on purely social considerations.",

The Court had held that the lack of any fixed procedural rules on the admission and detention of such persons was striking. In its view, the contrast between this dearth of regulation and the extensive network of safeguards applicable to formal psychiatric committals covered by mental-health legislation was significant. In the absence of a formalised admission procedure, indicating who could propose admission, for what reasons and on what basis, and given the lack of indication as to the length of the detention or the nature of treatment or care, the hospital\u2019s health-care professionals had assumed full control of the liberty and treatment of a vulnerable incapacitated person solely on the basis of their own clinical assessments completed as and when they saw fit. While not doubting that those professionals had acted in good faith and in the applicant\u2019s best interests, the Court had observed that the very purpose of procedural safeguards was to protect individuals against any misjudgments and professional lapses (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 120-21).",

However, the objective need for accommodation and social assistance must not automatically lead to the imposition of measures involving deprivation of liberty. The Court considers that any protective measure should reflect as far as possible the wishes of persons capable of expressing their will. Failure to seek their opinion could give rise to situations of abuse and hamper the exercise of the rights of vulnerable persons. Therefore, any measure taken without prior consultation of the interested person will as a rule require careful scrutiny.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that in deciding whether an individual should be detained as a \u201cperson of unsound mind\u201d, the national authorities are to be recognised as having a certain discretion since it is in the first place for them to evaluate the evidence adduced before them in a particular case; the Court\u2019s task is to review under the Convention the decisions of those authorities (see Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a7 40, and Luberti v.

However, the relevant examination took place before November 2000, whereas the applicant was placed in the Pastra social care home on 10 December 2002 (see paragraphs 10 and 14 above). More than two years thus elapsed between the expert psychiatric assessment relied on by the authorities and the applicant\u2019s placement in the home, during which time his guardian did not check whether there had been any change in his condition and did not meet or consult him. Unlike the Government (see paragraph 138 above), the Court considers that this period is excessive and that a medical opinion issued in 2000 cannot be regarded as a reliable reflection of the state of the applicant\u2019s mental health at the time of his placement. It should also be noted that the national authorities were not under any legal obligation to order a psychiatric report at the time of the placement. The Government explained in that connection that the applicable provisions were those of the Social Assistance Act and not those of the Health Act (see paragraphs 57-60 and 137 above). Nevertheless, in the Court\u2019s view, the lack of a recent medical assessment would be sufficient to conclude that the applicant\u2019s placement in the home was not lawful for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e).",

As regards the need to justify the placement by the severity of the disorder, it notes that the purpose of the 2000 medical report was not to examine whether the applicant\u2019s state of health required his placement in a home for people with mental disorders, but solely to determine the issue of his legal protection. While it is true that Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) authorises the confinement of a person suffering from a mental disorder even where no medical treatment is necessarily envisaged (see Hutchison Reid, cited above, \u00a7 52), such a measure must be properly justified by the seriousness of the person\u2019s condition in the interests of ensuring his or her own protection or that of others. In the present case, however, it has not been established that the applicant posed a danger to himself or to others, for example because of his psychiatric condition; the simple assertion by certain witnesses that he became aggressive when he drank (see paragraph 10 above) cannot suffice for this purpose. Nor have the authorities reported any acts of violence on the applicant\u2019s part during his time in the Pastra social care home.",

The Convention requirement for an act of deprivation of liberty to be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny is of fundamental importance in the context of the underlying purpose of Article 5 of the Convention to provide safeguards against arbitrariness. What is at stake is both the protection of the physical liberty of individuals and their personal security (see Varbanov, cited above, \u00a7 58). In the case of detention on the ground of mental illness, special procedural safeguards may be called for in order to protect the interests of persons who, on account of their mental disabilities, are not fully capable of acting for themselves (see, among other authorities, Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a7 60).",

Nevertheless, under that Article the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, providing him with the requisite medical assistance (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 92-94).",

In this connection an important factor to take into account, besides the material conditions, is the detention regime.

However, the importance of exercising these rights will vary according to the purpose of the action which the person concerned intends to bring before the courts. In particular, the right to ask a court to review a declaration of incapacity is one of the most important rights for the person concerned since such a procedure, once initiated, will be decisive for the exercise of all the rights and freedoms affected by the declaration of incapacity, not least in relation to any restrictions that may be placed on the person\u2019s liberty (see also Shtukaturov, cited above, \u00a7 71).

He submitted that although there was no comparable case-law concerning unlawful detention in a social care home for people with mental disorders, regard should be had to the just satisfaction awarded by the Court in cases involving unlawful detention in psychiatric institutions. He referred, for example, to the judgments in Gajcsi v. Hungary (no. 34503/03, \u00a7\u00a7 28-30, 3 October 2006) and Kayadjieva v. Bulgaria (no. 56272/00, \u00a7 57, 28 September 2006), while noting that he had been deprived of his liberty for a considerably longer period than the applicants in the above-mentioned cases. He submitted that a sum of EUR 30,000 would constitute an equitable award on that account. Lastly, he added that his lack of access to the courts to seek a review of his legal status had restricted the exercise of a number of freedoms in the sphere of his private life, causing additional non-pecuniary damage, for which an award of EUR 20,000 could provide redress.",

He also maintained that the guardianship regime had not been geared to his individual case but had entailed restrictions automatically imposed on anyone who had been declared incapable by a judge. He added that the fact of having to live in the Pastra social care home had effectively barred him from taking part in community life and from developing relations with persons of his choosing. The authorities had not attempted to find alternative therapeutic solutions in the community or to take measures that were less restrictive of his personal liberty, with the result that he had developed \u201cinstitutionalisation syndrome\u201d, that is, the loss of social skills and individual personality traits (see paragraph 250 of the judgment).",

No justification was offered for the fact that Mr Stanev was stripped of the ability to act in accordance with his preferences to the extent determined by the courts and the law and that, instead of due assistance from his officially appointed guardian, the pursuit of his best interests was made completely dependent on the good will or neglect shown by the guardian. In this regard the lack of respect for the applicant\u2019s recognised personal autonomy violated Mr Stanev\u2019s right to personal life and dignity as guaranteed by Article 8 and failed to meet contemporary standards for ensuring the necessary respect for the wishes and preferences he was capable of expressing.",

In this regard the majority\u2019s preference not to consider separately the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 8 resulted in a failure to subject to separate scrutiny the absence of safeguards for the exercise of these rights in the face of a potential or even evident conflict of interests, a factor which appears to be of central importance for the requisite protection of vulnerable individuals against possible abuse and is equally pertinent to the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 8 and Article 6.",

It appears that the guardian\u2019s discretion to block any attempt to take proceedings in court affected not only the applicant\u2019s right of access to court for the purposes of restoration of capacity, but also prevented the institution of any proceedings in pursuit of the applicant\u2019s interests and rights, including those protected under Article 5 of the Convention. As was also submitted by his representatives before the national authorities, Mr Stanev \u201cshould have [had] the opportunity to assess by himself whether or not, having regard to the living conditions at the home, it was in his interests to remain there\u201d (see paragraph 38 of the judgment).",
