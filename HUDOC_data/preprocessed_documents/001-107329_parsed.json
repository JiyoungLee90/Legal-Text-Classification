Quite the contrary, it follows from the latest reports by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the US Department of State, as well as the information of other organisations to which they refer in their documents, that the use of torture and ill-treatment against detainees in Uzbekistan is \u201csystematic\u201d, \u201cunpunished\u201d and \u201cencouraged\u201d by law-enforcement and security officers. According to those sources, despite the Uzbek authorities\u2019 assertions that such practices had significantly decreased, reports of torture and ill-treatment of detainees and prisoners continued unabated (see paragraphs 46-48 above).

In its Muminov judgment the Court considered that there were serious reasons to believe in the existence of the practice of persecution of members or supporters of that organisation. It found that reliable sources affirmed the existence of a practice of torture against persons accused of membership of HT, with a view to extracting self-incriminating confessions and to punishing those persons, who were perceived by public authorities to be involved in religious or political activities contrary to State interests (judgment cited above, \u00a7 95).",
