The Justice of the Peace refused the applicant\u2019s requests for the police officers who had arrested him to be called and examined, and for video evidence to be admitted, but granted his request for three eyewitnesses to be examined. The witnesses testified that there had been a public meeting with a State Duma deputy to discuss current political developments; that no one had chanted slogans or made noise or obstructed traffic; and that the police had not given any orders or warnings before arresting the applicant. On the basis of the written statements of two police officers the court established that the applicant had taken part in an irregular public meeting and had disobeyed a lawful order from the police to disperse. It also found that the applicant had chanted the slogans \u201cRussia without Putin!\u201d and \u201cPutin is a thief!\u201d and had refused to leave the square, which needed to be cleared for the Victory Day festivities. The Justice of the Peace has rejected the statements of three eyewitnesses, on the grounds that they had different estimates of the number of people present at the venue, the number of police officers who arrested the applicant, and the time of his arrival at the meeting. The applicant was found guilty of disobeying the lawful order of the police, in breach of Article 19.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences, and was sentenced to fifteen days\u2019 administrative detention.",

However, he considered that in view of their immediate connection with current political developments, their small scale, and the absence of risk to public order, the authorities could be expected to show tolerance for these gatherings. As regards two other occasions, he contested that an irregular gathering had taken place.

Likewise, on 24 February 2014 at 12 noon he was arrested while waiting in front of the court-house because he wished to attend the pronouncement of the judgment in a high-profile case. This gathering, if it was classified as one, could not have been foreseen or notified to the authorities, and it caused no disturbance which would have merited its dispersal, arrests or the ensuing prosecution. According to the applicant, on each of these occasions the authorities\u2019 response had been grossly disproportionate and in violation of Article 11 of the Convention.",

By appearing at the hearing they meant to demonstrate the involvement of civil society and its solidarity with the activists, whom they regarded as political prisoners. The common cause which brought these people to the court-house \u2013 to express personal involvement in a matter of public importance \u2013 distinguished this unintended gathering from a random agglomeration of individuals each pursuing their own cause, such as a queue to enter a public building. It is also to be distinguished from a situation where a passer-by gets accidentally mixed up with a demonstration and may be mistaken for someone taking part in it (see Kasparov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 72). The Court reiterates that Article\u00a011 of the Convention covers both private meetings and meetings in public places (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no.\u00a037553/05, \u00a7 91, ECHR 2015), and that the protection of personal opinions is one of the objectives of freedom of peaceful assembly as enshrined in Article 11 of the Convention (see Ezelin v.

However, in the present case, by holding the picket the applicant was seeking not only to express his opinion in front of the Investigative Committee, but to do so together with other demonstrators, even if they were not doing it simultaneously (see Schwabe and M.G. v.\u00a0Germany, nos.\u00a0 and , \u00a7 101, ECHR 2011 (extracts)).

In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Oya\u00a0Ataman v.

In those cases the police interrupted irregular but peaceful gatherings, arrested the participants, and escorted them to police stations to have administrative offence reports drawn up. The Court noted, in particular, that under Article\u00a027.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences the applicants could only be escorted to a police station if the reports could not be drawn up at the place where the offence had been discovered. However, no reasons had been given in those cases for not doing this on the spot, which led to the finding that the arrest and escort to the police station had constituted an arbitrary and unlawful deprivation of liberty (see Navalnyy and Yashin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 93-97, and, mutatis mutandis, Novikova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 182-83 and 226-27). Furthermore, once the administrative offence reports had been drawn up at the police station, the objective of escorting would have been met and further remand in custody pending the judicial hearing would require specific justification, such as the demonstrated risk of absconding or obstructing the course of justice. In the absence of any explicit reasons for not releasing the applicant, the Court considered the detention pending trial unjustified and arbitrary even though it fell within the forty-eight-hour time-limit provided for by Article 27.5 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Administrative Offences (see Navalnyy and Yashin, cited above, \u00a7 96, and Frumkin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a074568/12, \u00a7 150, 5 January 2016).",

Indeed, on none of the seven occasions was there a reason, explicit or implied, why the administrative offence report could not be drawn up on the spot. In addition, on 9 May 2012 the applicant was detained for an unstated number of hours before being brought before the Justice of the Peace on the same day, and on 24 February 2014 he was detained overnight before being brought before the judge, without explicit reasons being given for not releasing him before the trial, merely because he had been charged with offences punishable by a prison term. Neither the Government nor any other domestic authorities have provided any justification as required by Article\u00a027.3 of the Code, namely that it was an \u201cexceptional case\u201d or that it was \u201cnecessary for the prompt and proper examination of the alleged administrative offence\u201d.

For example, the Court has found that Article 18 was violated where a prominent opposition politician was deprived of her liberty without proper justification (Tymoshenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 49872/11, \u00a7 300, 30 April 2013) and where measures were taken against an oppositional actor to \u201csilence or punish the applicant for criticising the Government\u201d (Ilgar Mammadov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no.\u00a015172/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0142-43, 22\u00a0May 2014). In short, the provision serves to address the abusive limitation of the rights of oppositional actors with the aim of silencing them (see, in overall terms, the partly dissenting opinion of Judge Keller in Kasparov, cited above, \u00a7 4).",

The repetitive, systematic or targeted arrest of activists such as the applicant can have a chilling effect on political expression and stifle the activity of oppositional actors. As a result, depriving individuals such as the applicant of their liberty without further justification as a method of supressing criticism falls squarely within the scope of Article\u00a018 of the Convention.",

Admittedly, the level of proof necessary in order for the Court to find a violation of Article 18 on the merits is a relatively high one, albeit one that has been subject to much-needed mitigation in recent years. However, in the present case the Court did not even enter into an examination on the merits, thus perpetuating the sidelining that Article 18 has suffered elsewhere in the Court\u2019s case-law.",

The fact that the Court found violations of Articles 5, 6 and 11 in this case does not do justice to the abusive aspect of this case. Therefore, we cannot agree with the majority\u2019s decision to acknowledge that \u201cthe applicant\u2019s arrest and administrative detention had the effect of preventing and discouraging him and others from participating in protest rallies and actively engaging in opposition politics\u201d (see paragraph 79 of the majority\u2019s judgment), which would seem to fall squarely under Article 18, but not to examine Article 18 on the merits.",

While all of the Court\u2019s judgments and decisions are made on the basis of the individual circumstances and allegations at stake in a particular case, and there is no system of binding precedent in the Strasbourg case-law, it is nonetheless possible to use that judgment to illustrate the point to be made here. The relevance of the Frumkin judgment stems from the fact that the allegations made against the respondent State therein concern a matter similar to that at stake here, and the violations of the Convention found are comparable. In addition, both cases concern the same respondent State. However, the applicant in Frumkin was awarded EUR 25,000 in respect of the violations of Articles 5, 6 and 11 of the Convention found in that case (see Frumkin, cited above, \u00a7 182). This is interesting for present purposes because the applicant in Frumkin brought one application complaining about his arrest, detention and conviction stemming from one public assembly. In the case before it here, however, the Court is considering five separate applications brought by the applicant concerning his arrest on seven occasions at different public events (see paragraph 6 of the majority judgment in the present case).",

The reason is that, although Mr Navalnyy\u2019s rights were violated in the context of seven different arrests, he was awarded just twice the amount of compensation awarded to an applicant whose rights were violated on only one occasion, as shown by the example of the Frumkin case. In effect, each of Mr\u00a0Navalnyy\u2019s arrests was compensated for by less than a third of the amount by way of just satisfaction that Mr Frumkin received for the violations of his rights suffered in conjunction with his arrest. While the awards made under Article\u00a041 depend on a number of factors, and no two cases are identical in this or other regards, this is a glaring difference that accordingly demands an explanation. The question here, then, is whether it is justified to reduce the amount of compensation awarded to Mr Navalnyy for the individual violations of his rights in the light of the fact that they occurred on multiple occasions.",
