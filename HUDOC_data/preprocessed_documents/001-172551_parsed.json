It further observes that while extending the applicants\u2019 detention the domestic courts had relied on the existence of a reasonable suspicion of their involvement in aggravated violent sexual offences against minors, the particular vulnerability of the victims, the complexity of the criminal cases against the applicants and the existence of a serious risk of their absconding or interfering with justice, confirmed, inter alia, by their previous criminal history, the pattern of their behavior or the absence of clear ties with Russia in case of Mr Waes (application no. 76349/12). The Court is satisfied that the domestic courts cited specific facts in support of their conclusions that the applicants were liable to obstruct justice, to re-offend or abscond. They also considered a possibility of applying alternative measures, but found them to be inadequate. The domestic courts duly examined all the pertinent factors and gave \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d reasons to justify the applicants\u2019 continued detention. The Court also finds that the domestic authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings (see, for example, Khloyev v. Russia, no.\u00a046404/13, \u00a7\u00a7 96-107, 5 February 2015; Topekhin v. Russia, no. 78774/13, 10 May 2016; Sopin v. Russia, no.\u00a057319/10, 18 December 2012 and Isayev v.
