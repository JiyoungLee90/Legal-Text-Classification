The applicant company had therefore reported on this issue and the way in which the authorities had enforced their respective decisions. In order to show the public the anguish and shock which this approach had produced in Christian, it had been necessary to publish a picture showing the pain in his face and make clear to the public just what measures the Republic of Austria was implementing, allegedly in the interest of the child.

This had caused him additional and significant suffering. Another important factor was the extensive dissemination of the information and the inherently strong influence the applicant company\u2019s newspaper had on public opinion. It had to be noted that the Kronen Zeitung reached (in 2006) 43.6% of the entire Austrian population \u2013 up to 60% of the population in some L\u00e4nder \u2013 as readers, which, in relative terms, made it one of the newspapers with the highest circulation in the world.

In this regard the Court reiterates that the publication of photographs and articles the sole purpose of which is to satisfy the curiosity of a particular readership regarding the details of a public figure\u2019s private life cannot be deemed to contribute to any debate of general interest to society despite the person being known to the public. In such conditions freedom of expression calls for a narrower interpretation (see MGN Limited, cited above, \u00a7 143, with further references). The Court considers that such considerations also apply to persons, like Christian, who are not public figures.",

However, the amount of compensation, EUR 130,000, is exceptional, and the Court observes in this connection that in specific circumstances an exceptional and particularly high amount of damages for libel (see Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, 13 July 1995, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 316B, and Independent News and Media and Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited v.

Even though these news items had already become known to the public, at a certain point their frequent repetition was capable of creating a climate of continual harassment inducing in the person concerned a very strong sense of intrusion into their private life or even of persecution (see Von Hannover, cited above, \u00a7 59).",

In this regard, the Court observes that a maximum amount for compensation in a single case is provided for in section 7(1) of the Media Act, which provides that damages must not exceed EUR 20,000. Moreover, section 6(1) of the Media Act contains clear guidelines for the fixing of the amount of damages, and provides, inter alia, that the compensation must not endanger the economic existence of the media owner. The Court considers that these safeguards are adequate and effective preventing disproportionate awards. The Court therefore concludes that the amount awarded in damages was not disproportionate in the particular circumstances of the case.",
