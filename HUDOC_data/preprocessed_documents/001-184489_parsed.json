They were sentenced to twentyfive years\u2019 imprisonment. The applicants\u2019 conviction was based on selfincriminating statements given by the defendants during the pre-trial investigation in the period between September and December 2002 while they had been on the premises of ORB-2 (records of their questioning as suspects, records of their questioning as accused, records of confrontation between the parties, records of crime-scene examinations), and the findings of forensic medical examinations. The court also relied on statements by prosecution witnesses, including Ts., L. and K., and victims, although these did not link the applicants to the crimes they had been charged with. Despite the court\u2019s rulings, most of the prosecution witnesses and the victims did not attend the trial. Having regard to the challenging social situation in the Chechen Republic, where the witnesses in question lived, the court used the statements obtained from them at the pre-trial stage as evidence. The defence witnesses were all heard during the trial and provided alibis for the applicants. The court, however, excluded their testimony, as they were all either their relatives or friends. The court decided that the applicants\u2019 sentences should start to run from 25 and 19\u00a0September 2002 respectively.",

In determining whether a particular form of ill-treatment should be classified as torture, consideration must be given to the distinction, embodied in Article 3 of the Convention, between this notion and that of inhuman or degrading treatment. As noted in previous cases, it appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of such a distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element to torture, as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture, which in Article 1 defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (see G\u00e4fgen v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7\u00a7 89-90, ECHR 2010).",

Since they had not had recourse to the above remedy, their complaint had to be dismissed for failure to exhaust domestic remedies. In the alternative, the Government argued that the applicants had failed to comply with the six-month requirement for lodging their complaint. They considered that the applicants\u2019 allocation to penal facilities had been a \u201csingle moment\u201d decision and did not give rise to a continuous situation for the purposes of calculating the six-month rule under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Government further submitted on the merits of the complaint that the applicants\u2019 allocation to remote penal facilities had amounted to an interference with their rights under Article 8 of the Convention. However, despite the fact that the legal grounds for allocating persons convicted, as the applicants, under Articles 208 (membership of an illegal armed group) and 317 (attempt on the life of a law-enforcement officer) of the Criminal Code to penal facilities determined by the FSIN (Article 73 \u00a7 4 of the CES), had been introduced several months after the applicants\u2019 actual transfer, the interference had nevertheless been in accordance with the law, had been necessary and had not amounted to a violation of Article\u00a08 of the Convention. The applicants had been given long prison sentences, to be served in strict-regime penal facilities. However, at the relevant time there had been no such penal facilities in the Chechen Republic, which was why the applicants had been allocated to penal facilities in other regions. Furthermore, had the applicants remained in the Chechen Republic to serve their sentences, it would have created a serious risk to public order and safety in view of the criminal situation in the region at the material time.",

Therefore, they had not had any domestic remedies to exhaust. The applicants considered that their allocation to penal facilities far from home constituted a continuing situation, because they continued to suffer the negative consequences of the interference with their rights under Article 8 of the Convention, and that the six-month time-limit for lodging their complaint with the Court had been complied with. The applicants submitted on the merits of the case that their placement in penal facilities far from their home region had amounted to an interference with their right to respect for their family life. The interference had not been in accordance with the law, since the law did not satisfy the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirement, and had not pursued a legitimate aim. Even if there had been no appropriate penal facilities in the Chechen Republic there should have been such facilities in the adjacent regions. The applicants pointed to the existence of at least one facility in the Chechen Republic, IK-2, which, although a normal-security prison, had a high-security wing. Furthermore, it was unclear how their allocation to remote penal facilities could have served to protect public safety in the Chechen Republic. Even assuming that the interference had pursued a legitimate aim, it had been disproportionate as it had unnecessarily limited their opportunity to preserve family and social ties after their conviction.",
