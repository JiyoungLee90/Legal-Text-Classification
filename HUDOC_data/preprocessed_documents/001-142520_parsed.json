The sound pressure level is a measure of the air vibrations that make up sound and it indicates how much greater the measured sound is than the threshold of hearing. Because the human ear can detect a wide range of sound pressure levels, they are measured on a logarithmic scale with units of decibels (dB). If the instantaneous noise pressure level is measured this is called \u201cA-weighting\u201d (abbreviated dBA), whereas if the noise pressure level is measured over a certain time span, this is called the \u201cequivalent continuous sound pressure level\u201d (abbreviated LAeq).

The latter remedy was more focused on the problem of noise nuisance and was thus more appropriate for the applicant\u2019s complaints.

Therefore, she should have brought her complaints to the Court within six months of realising that this was the case.

Furthermore, she had not had an opportunity to participate in the administrative proceedings granting the company operating licences to run a bar and a shop. In those proceedings she had also complained to the Administrative Court, which had ordered the administrative bodies to allow her to participate in the proceedings, but that too had been to no avail, as the administrative bodies had failed to comply with the Administrative Court\u2019s judgment. The Administrative Court had also upheld several other complaints she had submitted, but the judgments of the Administrative Court had never been enforced, and the proceedings before the administrative bodies were still pending after more than ten years.

It was true that this report had showed that the permitted level of noise had been significantly exceeded (by 13 and 15 dB) in the living room of the applicant\u2019s flat on the first floor and inside the flat on the ground floor, but that had happened only when chairs were being dragged, which had been only a temporary occurrence that could not affect any of the applicant\u2019s rights. Furthermore, the measurements of March 2008 (see paragraph 69 above) had found that the level of noise was excessive during the night, but that needed to be viewed in the context of the fact that the house was located near a road. The expert report of 14 November 2008 concerning the noise insulation in the house (see paragraphs 48-49 and 52 above) had first found the noise insulation insufficient but then, after the company had carried out the necessary work on the insulation, the report had found the noise insulation adequate. In addition, the expert report commissioned during the civil proceedings confirmed that the noise in the applicant\u2019s flat did not exceed permitted levels, and in that regard the applicant had all the procedural guarantees of a fair trial to challenge the findings. The Government also pointed out that the expert reports had not found the level of any other emissions affecting the applicant\u2019s flat excessive. The applicant had not argued or demonstrated that she had suffered any damage to her health or well-being as a result of the alleged nuisance or that it had adversely affected any of her property rights and interests.",

Spain (no. 4143/02, ECHR 2004X) concerning complaints of excessive levels of noise emanating from nightclubs. In the former case the Court was satisfied, on the basis of a number of unequivocal and compelling tests carried out over a period of eight years, that the level of noise there exceeded the maximum permitted levels under the domestic law and under the relevant international standards (see Olui\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 52-63). The Court reached the same conclusion in the case of Moreno G\u00f3mez, in which it found it obvious that the applicant\u2019s daily life was disrupted by the excessive night-time noise from nightclubs, which continued over a number of years and thus amounted to a breach of Article\u00a08 (see Moreno G\u00f3mez, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 58-60).

Bulgaria (nos. 43449/02 and 21475/04, 25\u00a0November 2010), comparable to the present case in that it concerned allegations of excessive noise from a computer club located in the same residential building as the applicants\u2019 and below their flat, the Court found, even without any noise tests being carried out at the domestic level, that the disturbance affecting the applicants\u2019 homes and their private and family lives reached the minimum level of severity under Article 8 of the Convention. It based its findings on the noise and various other disturbances created by those attending the computer club in and around the residential building (see Mileva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 97).",

Thus, the report found that the measured level of noise at 48 dB in the parking area and in the entrance to the applicant\u2019s flat did not exceed the permitted level of 50 dB during the night (see paragraph 31 above). It is not, however, clear how the report came to the conclusion that the house was predominantly used for business purposes, given that the applicant used 59.63% of the house as living space, while the company used 40.37% for business purposes (see paragraph 7 above). This leads to the conclusion that the house was predominantly used as a residential property, and that the maximum noise level under the by-law should be 45 dB (see paragraph 110 above and zone\u00a03 of table no. 1 of the by-law) applicable to premises predominantly used as dwellings. This approach, considering the applicant\u2019s house to fall within zone 3 under table no. 1 of the by-law, was later used in two reports on noise measurements (see paragraphs 69 and 82 above). Therefore, if the expert report drawn up by company E. had correctly placed the house under the relevant zone it would have found that the measured level of noise at 48\u00a0dB in fact exceeded the permitted level of 45 dB under the relevant domestic law and the international standards (see paragraph 114 above).",

During the night the level of noise in the entrance to the living room of the applicant\u2019s flat on the first floor exceeded the permitted level by 2 dB while all sources of noise in the bar were switched on and while only the air-conditioning fan was running in the bar. Inside the living room the level of noise during the night was over the limit by 3 dB when the sources of noise were turned on and when the fan was running, and by 13 dB while the chairs were being dragged across the floor in the bar. The level of noise inside the flat on the ground floor was over the limit by 4 dB while the sources of noise were switched on and by 16 dB while the chairs were being dragged across the floor in the bar (see paragraph 63 above). Moreover, these measurements show that the level of noise exceeded the relevant international standards for noise levels (see paragraph 114 above, and compare Olui\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 54-60). The report of 7 March 2008 drawn up by company B-I., which was focused on the improvements to the air-conditioning system in the bar, found that the level of noise was not excessive; that was also confirmed by company E. (see paragraphs 65 and 66 above). However, since there are no indications that at that point any improvements to the noise insulation in the flooring of the bar had been made, and in fact in November 2008 the noise insulation was found to be insufficient (see paragraph 48 above), it could be concluded that the noise created by dragging the chairs across the floor inside the bar remained excessive. Such noise, given the extent to which it exceeded the permitted levels and the fact that it was pervasive in the ordinary regular activities of the customers of the bar, must have disturbed the amenity of the applicant\u2019s everyday life.",

Thus, following the applicant\u2019s complaints, the Administrative Court on 17 December 2009 quashed the decisions of the administrative authorities authorising that activity and remitted the case for re-examination (see paragraphs 40 and 41 above). However, the order made by the Administrative Court remained futile, as it was not effectively complied with, and in fact, according to the material available before the Court, the relevant proceedings are still pending after almost four years. At the same time it remains unclear under what operating licence the bar is still operating, particularly having in mind the findings of the Administrative Inspectorate of 24 November 2010, which noted that the operating licence issued in 2005 was no longer valid (see paragraph 44 above, and compare Mileva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 99).",

However, although the applicant complained to the higher domestic courts that she had had no opportunity to challenge the noise expert report effectively during the trial, the Koprivnica County Court and the Constitutional Court failed to rectify that procedural omission (see paragraphs 91 and 94 above).
