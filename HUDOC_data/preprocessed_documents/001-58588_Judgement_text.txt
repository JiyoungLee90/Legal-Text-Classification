The case originated in an application against Greece lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Greek national, Mr Mehmet Agga, on 5 August 1997. The application was registered on 22 November 1997 under file no. 37439/97. The applicant is represented by Mr S. Emin, a lawyer practising in Komotini, and Mr T. Akillioglu, a lawyer practising in Ankara and the Government by Mr V. Kyriazopoulos of the Legal Council of the State, Acting Agent.
	The applicant complained, inter alia, that, contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, criminal proceedings brought against him had not been heard within a reasonable time. 
On 3 December 1997 the Commission (First Chamber) decided to give notice of the application to the respondent Government and invited them to submit their observations on the merits.
The Government submitted their observations on 24 February 1998, to which the applicant replied on 27 April 1998.
Following the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 § 2 thereof, the case was transferred to the Court.
In accordance with Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Second Section. The Chamber constituted within the Section included ex officio Mr C. Rozakis, the judge elected in respect of Greece (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 26 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court), and Mr M. Fischbach, the VicePresident of the Section (Rules 13 and 26 § 1 (a)). The other members designated by the latter to complete the Chamber were Mr G. Bonello, Mrs. V. Strážnická, Mr P. Lorenzen, Mr A. Baka and Mr E. Levits (Rule 26 § 1 (b)). Subsequently Mrs M. Tsatsa-Nikolovska replaced Mr Levits who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 24 § 5 (b)).
On 24 November 1998, the Chamber declared admissible the applicant’s complaint that the criminal proceedings against him had been unreasonably lengthy. It declared the remainder of the application inadmissible1.
The applicant is a Greek national, born in 1932 and resident in Xanthi.
The applicant was a candidate in the parliamentary elections of 18 June 1989. On 9 June 1989 Mr TOB complained to the police that the applicant had promised him a sum of money in exchange for his support in the elections.
On 13 June 1989 the public prosecutor of Xanthi instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant for attempting to bribe a voter. On 26 July 1989 the prosecutor summoned the applicant to appear before the three-member first instance criminal court (trimeles plimmeliodikio) of Xanthi on 12 September 1989 to be tried on this charge.
On 12 September 1989 the applicant was ill and the hearing was adjourned until 21 November 1989. On that date the hearing was adjourned until 9 January 1990 because the clerk of the court, following the instructions of his trade union, refused to work overtime. On 9 January 1990 three prosecution witnesses failed to appear. They were fined and the hearing was adjourned until 20 February 1990. On that date the applicant asked for an adjournment because he was ill. The hearing was adjourned until 19 June 1990. On 19 June 1990 TOB failed to appear. He was fined and the hearing was adjourned until 18 September 1990. On 18 September 1990 a further adjournment was ordered until 5 March 1991 because of the “work to rule” policy of the clerks of the court, according to which the clerks refused to work overtime.
The applicant was tried on 5 March 1991. He was found guilty and received a suspended sentence of four months' imprisonment. The applicant and the public prosecutor appealed. The case-file was transferred to the public prosecutor of the Court of Appeal of Thrace on 19 March 1991 who fixed a hearing for both appeals for 9 January 1995.
However, on that date the three-member court of appeal (trimeles efetio) of Thrace had to adjourn the hearing until 6 December 1995 because of the “work to rule” industrial action of the clerks of the court. On 6 December 1995 the prosecution witnesses did not appear. They were fined and the hearing was adjourned until 4 March 1996.
The appeals were finally heard on 4 March 1996. The court heard TOB and two other prosecution witnesses who had heard TOB on the radio denouncing the applicant’s attempt to bribe him. It also heard the applicant and a defence witness. In a decision delivered on the same day, the court of appeal upheld the applicant's conviction and sentence.
On 4 November 1996 the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation complaining, inter alia, of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention because the court of appeal had seriously delayed the proceedings.
On 18 February 1997 the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant's appeal considering, inter alia, that Article 6 of the Convention did not create any grounds of appeal in cassation other than the grounds provided for in the Code of Criminal Procedure.
