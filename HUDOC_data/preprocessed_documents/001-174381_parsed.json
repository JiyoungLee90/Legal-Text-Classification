Germany, no. 3690/10, \u00a7 55, 26 November 2015). The Court emphasises that, in order for Article 8 of the Convention to come into play, an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and its manner must cause prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see A. v. Norway, no.\u00a028070/06, \u00a7 64, 9\u00a0April 2009, and Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, \u00a7 83, 7 February 2012). It is not convinced, however, in the circumstances of the present case, that the impugned statements could be considered as an attack reaching the requisite threshold of seriousness and capable of causing prejudice to S.P.\u2019s personal enjoyment of private life. In any event, the Court considers that in the defamation proceedings instituted by S.P. the domestic courts did not perform a balancing exercise between the need to protect the plaintiff\u2019s reputation and the Convention standard, which requires very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on debates on questions of public interest, thus failing to recognise that the case before them involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and protection of reputation (see, with further references, Reznik v. Russia, no.\u00a04977/05, \u00a7 43, 4 April 2013).",

It would differ, however, with the Town Court\u2019s conclusion that the applicant did not provide a justification for such allegations. A witness appeared before the Town Court to confirm that S.P. had indeed worked for Strela ZhSK, although she had not concluded a contract of employment with that entity. In the course of the defamation proceedings, a payroll document from Strela ZhSK confirmed that S.P. had received a salary from that association. When initiating criminal proceedings against S.P., the Shchelkovo town prosecutor\u2019s office had considered her as \u201ca person performing managerial functions\u201d at Strela ZhSK (see paragraph 8 above). As noted by the applicant, Strela ZhSK had brought civil proceedings against S.P., which had been ongoing before a justice of the peace at the time the article was published (see paragraph 60 above). In the Court\u2019s view, those elements were sufficient to demonstrate that, in so far as the impugned statements concerned statements of fact, the applicant relied on a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis proportionate to the nature and degree of factual allegations and thus acted in good faith and complied with the ordinary journalistic obligation to verify a factual allegation (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, \u00a7 78).",

Indeed, the Government has raised the same argument before the Court (see paragraph 38 above). Furthermore, the Town Court ignored the fact that at the time of the defamation proceedings a criminal investigation against S.P. in connection with her activities as head of Strela ZhSK had been ongoing (see paragraphs 8 and 16 above). It chose to employ a definition of \u201cfinancial irregularities\u201d found in an unauthoritative source to label the applicant\u2019s statement as \u201cuntrue\u201d (see paragraph 13 above).

It also observes that the value judgments employed in the impugned article had sufficient factual basis (see, among many others, Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7 105), as confirmed to the Town Court by two visitors to the Public Reception Office (see paragraph 13 above). The Court has on many occasions pinpointed a structural deficiency of the Russian law on defamation whereby no distinction was made between value judgments and statements of fact, referring uniformly to \u201cstatements\u201d (\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f), and which proceeded from the assumption that any such \u201cstatement\u201d was amenable to proof in civil proceedings (see, with further references, OOO\u00a0Ivpress and Others, cited above, \u00a7 72). It notes that by the time the Town Court examined S.P.\u2019s allegations, Resolution no. 3 of the Plenary Supreme Court had already entered into force, instructing Russian courts to distinguish statements of fact from value judgments (see paragraph 34 above). Nevertheless, neither the Town Court nor the Regional Court complied with those guidelines in the course of the proceedings under consideration, thus failing to draw a clear distinction between the two (ibid., \u00a7 73).",

Both G.A. and N. were candidates. The Court reiterates that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech (see S\u00fcrek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a026682/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999IV). It further reiterates that freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion about the ideas and attitudes of political leaders. More generally, freedom of political debate is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society which prevails throughout the Convention. The limits of acceptable criticism are accordingly wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual. Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance. There is no doubt that Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention enables the protection of the reputation of others \u2013 that is to say, of all individuals \u2013 and that that protection extends to politicians too, even when they are not acting in a private capacity. However, in such cases the requirements of such protection have to be weighed in relation to the interests of open discussion of political issues (see Lingens v.\u00a0Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 103).",

The two rights are interrelated and operate to reinforce each other. For that reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely (see Bowman v. the United Kingdom, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I; D\u0142ugo\u0142\u0119cki v.\u00a0Poland, no. 23806/03, \u00a7 40, 24 February 2009; and Grebneva and Alisimchik v. Russia, no. 8918/05, \u00a7 56, 22\u00a0November 2016). That principle applies equally to national and local elections (see Kwiecie\u0144 v. Poland, no.\u00a051744/99, \u00a7 48, 9 January 2007).",

That was clear to readers given the specific mention that N. had paid for the publication from his election fund. The domestic courts did not dispute that fact either. Nevertheless, they did not consider it when assessing the applicant\u2019s liability for the contents of the publication. The Court reiterates in this connection that a newspaper cannot be required to systematically verify the truth of every comment made by one politician about another in the context of a public political debate before publishing such comments (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070).",

Such an omission in itself is sufficient for the Court to conclude that the domestic courts did not perform a balancing exercise of weighing considerations of respect for freedom of the press in the context of an election.
