According to domestic law the State could also have taken the property under title of public tenure in exchange for a recognition rent, to eventually demolish it. The demolition was thus lawful pursuant to Article\u00a019 of Chapter 88 of the Laws of Malta. As to the impugned law, this could not be found to be incompatible with the Constitution since it had been in force before 1962. As to its compatibility with the Convention, the court found that the taking had pursued a public interest namely a slum clearance project. However, the recognition rent established in line with LAB policies, which was not subject to any future increases, was too low and thus disproportionate.

Indeed there had been relevant witness testimony to the effect that the property had been demolished around three months prior to the first taking, the LAB had accepted that it was so, and the Government had not objected to such fact, nor had they shown when the demolition took place. It followed that the demolition had taken place prior to the taking under possession and use and at a time when the Government had no title over the property. However, even if this were not so, and that it had been demolished when it was under title of possession and use, the demolition would still have been unlawful, since according to law it was not possible to demolish a property under a title of possession and use the rights attached to which were limited. That illegality persisted until the Commissioner of Land acquired the property under title of public tenure; however, despite the passage of three years since the demolition the applicants did not challenge that measure. In any event that was no longer an issue, as the situation was sanctioned when the State took the property under title of public tenure (as provided for in Article\u00a019 of Chapter 88 of the Laws of Malta). The measure thus became lawful, and pursued the general interest of slum clearance.",

Indeed the fact that the taking consisted of land (as the property above it had been demolished) made it feasible to apply the taking under public tenure procedure. The Constitutional Court further rejected the applicants\u2019 claim that it would have been more appropriate to take the property by means of outright purchase, as they had not requested the LAB to order the Commissioner of Land to take such a course of action under the mentioned Article 19. The law granted the Commissioner of Land discretion as to which form of taking it would undertake and the Constitutional Court\u2019s role was limited to verifying whether the form of taking which was actually used breached the rights of an individual.",

Thus, given the award, in the light of their claim, it could not be considered that there arose such a disproportionality leading to a violation of the applicants\u2019 property rights. Nevertheless, a breach did arise as a result of a failure to pay compensation since 1989, given that the applicants\u2019 refusal to accept the offer of MTL\u00a015.62 (approximately EUR\u00a036.39) had been entirely justified. The Constitutional Court noted that as the breach had occurred and continued to persist, there was no reason to await the outcome of the LAB proceedings.",

While the applicants claimed compensation of around EUR\u00a050,000 the Constitutional Court noted that the sale value according to the applicant\u2019s ex-parte architect in 2005 was EUR\u00a017,470.30 and that in 2011, according to the technical experts of the board, it was EUR\u00a010,575.36. Thus, given the small size of the property, the area in which it was in, the fact that it had been demolished at the expense of the Government and the fact that the recognition rent was adequate, the Constitutional Court considered that EUR 1,500 was an adequate amount of compensation to be shared by the applicants jointly. It further considered that it needed not examine the Convention compatibility of the relevant law in abstracto, it having already determined that its application in the present case constituted a breach. Costs of the firstinstance proceedings were to remain shared by the parties, as were those of the main appeal; and costs of the cross appeal were to be paid by the applicants.",

They noted that the applicants received a recognition rent (established by the LAB) of EUR\u00a0158.40 annually for a property valued by the applicant\u2019s architect at around EUR\u00a017,475 with an annual rental value of EUR\u00a0611.

The three rules are not, however, distinct in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among other authorities, James\u00a0and\u00a0Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7 37, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a098; and Beyeler v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2000-I).",

The Court further notes that as held by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 26 above) and as transpires from the evidence and submissions before this Court, the demolition took place before the taking under title of possession and use which was ordered by means of a President\u2019s declaration of 27\u00a0October 1989, thus, at a time when the Government had simply occupied the property but had no title to it. It follows that, as held by the Constitutional Court, the demolition was unlawful (see paragraph 26 above, in primis). Moreover, as also held by that same court, even had it been demolished when it was under title of possession and use, the demolition would still have been unlawful, since according to law it was not possible to demolish a property under a title of possession and use, the rights attached to which were limited (see paragraph\u00a026 above). That having been established it is unnecessary for this Court to consider whether the demolition pursued a legitimate aim, or whether the measure was proportionate.

Although in the then obtaining circumstances a sale was improbable, the Court cannot accept that the measure complained of amounted to a de facto expropriation. However, the applicants\u2019 right of property was severely restricted: they could not exercise the right of use in terms of physical possession. Thus, this constituted a means of State control of the use of property, which should be examined under the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see, mutatis mutandis, Saliba and Others, cited above, \u00a7 52).",

It follows that the applicants should have been paid approximately EUR\u00a0113 annually for the two years during which their property was taken under this title. In respect to this amount, the fact that, as argued by the Government, the rent received was in line with the rent laws applicable on the island, does not favour the Government\u2019s case. Indeed, the Court has on various occasions held that legislation regarding controlled rents in Malta was in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Ghigo v.\u00a0Malta, no. 31122/05, \u00a7\u00a7 69-70, 26 September 2006; Edwards v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a017647/04, \u00a7\u00a7 78-79, 24 October 2006; Fleri Soler and Camilleri v.\u00a0Malta, no. 35349/05, \u00a7\u00a7 79-80, ECHR 2006X; and Amato Gauci v.\u00a0Malta, no. 47045/06, \u00a7 62, 15 September 2009). However, in the present case, it is not necessary for the Court to decide whether, given the legitimate aim and the value of the property (the remaining land, see paragraph\u00a027 above) at the time when it was held under title of possession and use (see paragraph\u00a016 above), such compensation was sufficient, as the applicable acquisition rent was never determined by the LAB nor paid to the applicants.",

The Court reiterates that what might have been justified years ago, will not necessarily be justified today (see Amato Gauci, cited above, \u00a7 60, and Saliba and Others, cited above, \u00a7 63). It suffices for the purposes of the present case for the Court to find that since the recognition rent established for the taking under public tenure was not subject to any future increases despite developments in the property market, such compensation decades after the initial taking is disproportionate. More importantly, that recognition rent had not been paid until the Constitutional Court judgment and seems to have remained unpaid at least until the time of the introduction of the application, that is, nearly thirty years after the taking.",

The latter were required to bear most of the social and financial costs of supplying housing accommodation to third parties (see, mutatis mutandis, Saliba and Others, cited above, \u00a7 67, see also Gera de Petri Testaferrata Bonici Ghaxaq, cited above, \u00a7 59).
