Because of violence in 2005, he was sentenced to placement in a psychiatric ward. In 2013 the High Court upheld the measure. From 2007 to 2011 [the applicant] was placed in the high-security psychiatric unit ... under a dangerousness decree. Subsequently, he was treated in an open psychiatric ward, but owing to [his] irritability and threatening behaviour, he was moved to a closed ward in September 2012. Afterwards, despite treatment with a potent anti-psychotic drug, [his] condition was described as fluctuating, with [the applicant having] a tendency to be aggressive [and] paranoid, and to overrate himself in an unrealistic manner. [The applicant had] no understanding of [his] illness, and his ability to have contact [with people] was compromised. ... On the evening of 7 February 2013 [the applicant] made threatening remarks about the chief physician responsible for the treatment. When she talked to him on 8 February 2013 he was completely dismissive, would not sit down, would not answer, and was white-faced and kept his mouth tightly shut, and he seemed to be affected by pent-up anger. Conversation with him was unsuccessful and, apart from being aggressive, he displayed a lack of logic, owing to [his] paranoid misinterpretation of hostility from the chief physician. He was considered to be dangerous, and at 1 p.m. the decision about physical restraints was made. Once he had the belt strapped around him he appeared to be very vocal and angry at first glance, but after a few hours he calmed down more, and consequently a foot strap was released and toilet visits were allowed. However, at around 11 p.m. he was still considered to be full of pent-up anger and potentially dangerous. At 12 noon on the following day he was released from the belt. The Medico-Legal Council must thus answer the given questions [as follows]:",

It is also all right to be angry, and that, in itself, cannot lead to physical restraint. I also understand that one can be angry about the situation. However, when the anger is of such a nature and extent that there is a fear that someone will be hurt, you must physically restrain a patient. Before this happens, there is a time when you try to talk to the person in question and try to avert the anger. Physical restraint is a last resort in order to calm the situation, and only if no other measure is possible.

However, despite measures taken to tackle the frequent use and length of immobilisation in psychiatric hospitals, such as increased staff training and certain legislative amendments, there had been no reduction in the registered use of immobilisation in Denmark. On the contrary, the instances of immobilisation, and notably those of prolonged immobilisation (for more than 48 hours), has steadily increased and reached all-time peaks in 2012 and 2013 on a national level. The CPT therefore remains seriously concerned about the frequent and prolonged use of immobilisation in psychiatric hospitals. ...",

During immobilisation, one staff member has to be permanently located near the patient (while as far as possible respecting his/her privacy). The need for continuation of the measure of immobilisation has to be medically assessed at least four times a day in evenly-spaced intervals by a doctor. A second doctor has to authorise the continuation of immobilisation beyond 48 hours; however, such authorisation is thereafter obligatory only once a week. In the Committee\u2019s view, a restraint approval based on the patient\u2019s physical and mental condition is of little value if it is several days old. Moreover, the documentation examined by the delegation showed that in the case of a patient who had been continually immobilised for a period of 34 days at Amager, authorisation in writing by a second doctor had only been provided twice during the whole period. Indeed, staff was of the opinion that only one such authorisation was required, even if the patient was restrained for more than a month. Existing legal safeguards must be rigorously enforced.",

The frequent termination of immobilisation just before the requirement for the second doctor\u2019s assessment may raise questions as to the genuine necessity of applying the measure for the whole 47 hours. Moreover, at Amager, staff told the delegation that the release of a patient from immobilisation depended inter alia on the situation on the ward, such as the presence of other particularly demanding patients, staffing levels and the female/male staff ratio on the shift.

The Danish Government, acknowledging the problem, has for several years now worked towards reducing recourse to coercion in psychiatry. In 2014, it adopted an Action Plan which included, amongst other things, the overall goal of the reduction in the percentage of hospitalised patients subject to coercion on the one hand, and of the total number of instances of mechanical restraint over 48 hours on the other, each by 50% by 2020. In addition, six experimental belt-free units were to be created in psychiatric hospitals. In order to monitor the goal of the 50% reduction in coercion, the Government had further formed a \u201cTask Force for Psychiatry\u201d.",

The Danish Health and Medicine Agency (Sundhedsstyrelsen) expressed its serious concerns about this \u201csubstitution effect\u201d and reiterates its genuine commitment to achieve a long-term reduction in all means of coercion in psychiatry through a continued management focus on that goal, aimed at a long-term \u201ccultural change in psychiatry\u201d.",

It is particularly alarming that the delegation again received reports that psychiatric patients had been fixated to a bed for several months in different psychiatric hospitals pending their transfer to Sikringen. In two cases, the patients had apparently been under belt restraint for 10 and 13 months. This is completely unacceptable. Not surprisingly, one of these patients told the delegation that he required training in order to walk again properly after having been released from the belts. The CPT recommends that the Danish authorities take the necessary steps to ensure that patients are never mechanically restrained due to the lack of places at a secure psychiatric hospital.",
