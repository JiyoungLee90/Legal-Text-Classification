The strike lasted until 13 April 2005 when the applicant union called it off in order to comply with the County Court\u2019s subsequent provisional measure of 12 April 2005 prohibiting the strike (see the next paragraph).",

The way in which this provision was drafted suggests that it is not mandatory ... There is no doubt that section 210(1) of the Labour Act entitles trade unions to strike in cases of collective disputes, that is, as regards issues that may be, but are not, regulated by a collective agreement. ... [T]he Labour Act has only provided for the protection of the basic rights of employees. [However], there are many other sources of labour law governing employment-related rights and duties. Collective agreements may regulate employment relations in a manner more favourable for employees ... The question therefore arises whether a strike undertaken on grounds provided for in the collective agreement is lawful. ... If the employer, by signing a collective agreement, agreed that the trade union could undertake a strike even in cases of a breach of that agreement by the employer, then the strike cannot be considered unlawful only because it was undertaken on that ground. ...\u201d",

Despite that the domestic authorities had unilaterally increased salaries of doctors and dentists in 2005 by 10% with a view to alleviating the situation thus created (see paragraph 17 and 38 above).

Secondly, the courts had focused on the name rather than the substance (falsa nominatio non nocet). Instead of examining whether the Annex could have remained valid as an independent collective agreement, they had simply held that the Annex had been a part of the main Collective Agreement for the Health and Health Insurance Sector and was thus null and void because it had not been entered into by all the trade unions that had concluded that agreement (see paragraph 23 above).",

In particular, the reasons adduced by the domestic courts for their decisions to prohibit the strike seemed to suggest that in such circumstances trade unions could not strike because either (a) the collective agreement was valid and section 210(1) of the Labour Act prohibited strikes in respect of matters already governed by a collective agreement (see paragraph 32 above), or (b) the collective agreement was invalid and for precisely that reason it could not be enforced by resorting to a strike.

As to the applicant union\u2019s argument to the contrary (see paragraph 54 above), the Court reiterates that its power to review compliance with domestic law is limited and that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply the domestic law. The Court\u2019s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Federation of Offshore Workers\u2019 Trade Unions and Others v.

The Supreme Court held so, even though in the civil proceedings for prohibition of the strike, where the validity of the Annex was a preliminary issue, that court had itself found the Annex null and void. In those circumstances it was of particular importance to address that third ground for the strike (see paragraph 14 above) because under the domestic law trade unions were allowed to strike in the absence of a collective agreement (see paragraphs 32-33 above). Instead, the domestic courts considered that they were not required to do so because the applicant union\u2019s representative had allegedly stated during the proceedings that it had been listed as subsidiary in case in the meantime the Annex was declared invalid in the parallel civil proceedings for declaring it null and void. In the view of those courts, that condition had not been fulfilled at the time (see paragraphs 19 and 23 above).",

In the absence of any exceptional circumstances, the Court finds it difficult to accept that upholding the principle of parity in collective bargaining is a legitimate aim (see paragraph 57 above) capable to justify depriving a trade union for three years and eight months of the most powerful instrument to protect occupational interests of its members. That is especially so in the present case where the applicant union was in that period not allowed to strike to pressure the Government of Croatia to grant doctors and dentists the same level of employment-related rights the Government had already agreed upon in the Annex, which had been invalidated on formal grounds only. It follows that the interference in question cannot be regarded as proportionate to the legitimate aim it sought to achieve. This conclusion is not called into question by the Government\u2019s argument (see paragraph 53 above) that the domestic authorities unilaterally increased by 10% salaries of doctors and dentists in 2005. That is so because the Annex provided for progressive increase of their salaries by 10% every year in the period between January 2005 and January 2010 (see clause 57 of the Annex in paragraph 37 above).",

Nevertheless, regulation of collective and strike action remains within the scope of the powers of the Member States of the Union, in accordance with Article 153 (5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

The legitimate exercise of the right to strike may not result in sanctions of any sort, which would be tantamount to acts of anti-union discrimination. Only limited categories of workers may be denied this right and only limited restrictions may be imposed by law on its exercise. The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association and the Committee of Experts on the Application of Convention and Recommendations (the \u201cCommittee of Experts\u201d) have considered temporary restrictions on strikes under provisions prohibiting strike action in breach of collective agreements as compatible with freedom of association, since the solution to a legal conflict as a result of a difference in the interpretation or application of a legal text should be left to the competent courts. Conversely, a ban on strike action not linked to a collective dispute to which the employee or union is a party would be contrary to the principles of freedom of association. Thus, recourse to strike action is generally possible as a means of pressure for the adoption of an initial agreement or its renewal, although strikes systematically decided long before negotiations take place do not fall within the scope of the principles of freedom of association. Provisions which prohibit strikes if they are concerned with the issue of whether a collective employment contract will bind more than one employer are also contrary to the principles of freedom of association, since workers and their organisations should be able to call for industrial action in support of multi-employer contracts. Furthermore, workers\u2019 organisations bound by collective agreements should not be prevented from striking against the social and economic policy of the Government, in particular where the protest is not only against that policy but also against its effects on some provisions of collective agreements. If the legislation prohibits strikes during the term of collective agreements, this restriction must be compensated by the right to have recourse to \u201cimpartial and rapid arbitration machinery\u201d for individual or collective grievances concerning the interpretation or application of collective agreements.",

In a democratic society, the ultimate practical \u201cmeans to persuade the employer to hear\u201d the demands of the workers is obviously strike action. If collective action represents the core of the workers\u2019 freedom of association, strike action is the core of the core. Indeed, striking predated both unions and collective bargaining.

Furthermore, it differentiated between an accessory and a core aspect of trade union freedom, the taking of secondary industrial action by a trade union, including strike action, against one employer in order to further a dispute in which the union\u2019s members are engaged with another employer being considered as an accessory, and not a core, aspect of that freedom, with the consequence that Governments should have a wider margin of appreciation in regulating that aspect.

To use the strong, but appropriate, words of the Chamber in the present case, the right to strike is \u201cthe most powerful instrument to protect occupational interests\u201d of trade unions and their members. States have a duty to guarantee that the exercise of this fundamental human right be fully preserved both in the public and the private employment sector.

The crux of the case lies in knowing whether that subsidiary ground for striking was covered by Article\u00a0210(1) of the Labour Act (\u201cin order to protect and promote the economic and social interests of their members or on the ground of non-payment of salary...\u201d), or Article 10 of the Collective Agreement for the Health and Health Insurance Sector (\u201cin respect of all other unresolved issues or in the case of a dispute concerning the amendment or supplement to this Agreement\u201d). It evidently was. The legal framework in question did provide for striking for the purpose of ensuring employment-related interests not provided for in the collective agreement, which was exactly what the applicant union intended, since it aimed at addressing the special needs of a professional sector which were not dealt with by the collective agreement.",

But that was not the case, and the best evidence for that was that the applicant\u2019s claim was endorsed by all the other relevant participants in the negotiation process regarding the main collective agreement. Three facts support this assessment: firstly, the Government had already entered into a special agreement with the applicant union in order to satisfy the specific needs of the professional sector in question, which was invalid only on account of a procedural flaw in the decisional process; secondly, the Government acknowledged the need for a salary increase in this special professional sector, and even implemented it unilaterally; and thirdly, even the other trade unions, parties to the Collective Agreement for the Health and Health Insurance Sector, had agreed that there was a need for a special arrangement for the specific needs of the medical and dentistry sector. In reality, a genuine need for a special arrangement protecting the interests of the members of this professional sector which had not been covered in that agreement had emerged, and that need had been recognised by all relevant stakeholders in the Croatian health service labour market.",

Conversely, while the prohibition of the strike on the basis of its first and second grounds (to enforce the Annex obligations) was lawful and pursued a legitimate aim, it was unlawful and did not pursue a legitimate aim with regard to its alternative third ground (to regulate issues specific to doctors and dentists). The domestic courts decided, in the civil proceedings for the prohibition of the strike, that they were not required to take into consideration the third ground because the applicant union\u2019s representative had allegedly stated during the proceedings that it had been listed as a subsidiary ground in case the Annex was declared invalid in the meantime in the parallel civil proceedings to have it declared null and void, and that condition had not been fulfilled at the time of the delivery of their judgments. This formalistic approach of the domestic courts is unacceptable: in the civil proceedings for the prohibition of the strike, the domestic courts found that the Annex was \u201cinvalid\u201d, but did not draw all the legal consequences from that reasoning. Instead, they avoided addressing the legality of the prohibition order in the light of the third purpose of the strike on grounds that the Annex had not yet been declared invalid.

The same right applies to disputes on the validity of amendments or supplements to the collective agreement. The perpetuation of the provisional order of the Zagreb Court of 12 April 2005 not only petrified the labor conflict, but also deprived the applicant union of the \u201cmost important instrument\u201d it had to put pressure on the Government to address the special interests of doctors and dentists and grant them the same level of rights that had already been agreed upon in the Annex.",

Although the effects of the strike are disputed, the Government admitted that 85% of services had been rendered and work stoppages occurred in only one out of five clinical centres, one out of seven university hospitals and six out of 22 general hospitals. It is inherent in the very exercise of the right to take collective action, including to strike, that some degree of social nuisance will be caused and fundamental economic freedoms of the employer will be prejudiced to a certain degree. The Article 11 \u00a7 2 test of \u201cnecessity in a democratic society\u201d may take into account the social and economic consequences of the exercise of the right to strike. In this particular case, the social nuisance and economic damage caused cannot be considered excessive, in view of the number of days of the strike, the percentage of medical services rendered during the strike and the percentage of work stoppages that occurred in clinical centres, university hospitals and general hospitals nationwide, and therefore the prohibition of the strike was not necessary in a democratic society.",
