A person charged with a criminal offence does not lose the benefit of this right merely on account of not being present at the trial (see the Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 June 1984, Series A no. 80, p. 45, para. 99, and, mutatis mutandis, the Goddi judgment previously cited, Series A no. 76, p. 12, para. 30, and the F.C.B. judgment previously cited, Series A no. 208-B, p. 21, para. 33).

Admittedly, the remedy in question was an extraordinary one relating to the application of the law and not to the merits of the case. Nevertheless, in the French system of criminal procedure, whether an accused who does not appear may have arguments of law and fact presented at second instance in respect of the charge against him depends largely on whether he has provided valid excuses for his absence. It is accordingly essential that there should be an opportunity for review of the legal grounds on which a court of appeal has rejected such excuses.",

It is, however, not contested that the applicant, who must be assumed to have acted throughout with the benefit of legal advice, chose of his own volition and in defiance of the French courts (which were, of course, concerned not only with his own personal situation but also with rights of his former wife and the children) not to return to France. Had he done so and had he attended, as summoned, before the Court of Appeal he would have been entitled to the assistance of counsel there; and had he surrendered to the warrant for his arrest, the grounds on which his appeal to the Court of Cassation was dismissed would not have existed. The remedy was, in other words, at all material times in his own hands, and we do not see how it was \"disproportionate\" for the French system of justice to leave it there. Given that he must be taken to have been advised of the legal position it should not avail him now to say that, although he remained outside the jurisdiction of his own accord, he asked for legal assistance before the Court of Appeal and to be legally represented for an appeal to the Court of Cassation. In circumstances such as those of this case, where no taint of unfairness is alleged against the criminal trial at first instance, the conditions imposed in relation to the appeals to the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation were not in our view such as to justify a finding against the French Republic of violation of the Convention.",

The philosophical and social choice of favouring at any cost an absent defendant and of making an absolute solely of the defendant\u2019s choice (as to whether or not to appear at the trial) may be a proposition in a Foucault-type conception of criminal justice; but in that case we should have to give up the traditional conception of punitive criminal law and replace it by a new system for which no State offers a model. But that would be to make procedural requirements not provided for in the European Convention. Even Committee of Ministers Resolution (75) 11, which has no binding effect on member States, does not go as far as that; indeed, it implies that the Convention allows States to restrict the rights of those seeking to elude justice.",
