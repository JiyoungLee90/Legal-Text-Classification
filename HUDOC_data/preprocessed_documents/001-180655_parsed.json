As to the risk of absconding, the judge took into account the statements of the suspects, including the fact that some of them had decided to remain silent, the gravity of the charges and the severity of the anticipated penalty, and concluded that there was a risk of the suspects absconding if they were released. Detaining the suspects on the grounds of the risk of their reoffending was justified by the fact that most of them held managerial posts in companies implicated in the criminal proceedings and had authority to sign business accounts and other financial documents. The judge further held that special circumstances (\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438) suggested that if released, the suspects might interfere with the investigation by influencing prosecution witnesses who were to be examined by the investigating judge.

This rule is absolute and does not allow for an individual assessment of how much detail was disclosed (see Balenovi\u0107 v. Croatia (dec.), no. 28369/07, 30 September 2010 and Abbasov and Others v. Azerbaijan (dec.), no. 36609/08, \u00a7 28, 28\u00a0May 2013). Given the importance of this principle, the Court reiterates that a breach of the rule of confidentiality might, in certain circumstances, justify the conclusion that an application is inadmissible on the grounds of an abuse of the right of application (see Miro\u013cubovs and Others v.

In order to be regarded as an abuse of application, the disclosure of confidential information must be intentional and the direct responsibility of the applicant in the disclosure must be established with sufficient certainty (see Arsovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 30206/06, \u00a7\u00a040, 15 January 2013 and Gorgadze v.

This is because, even assuming that the Government\u2019s allegations were correct, the information disclosed to the press contained very little other than that which was, in any event, already publicly available and, in particular, did not reveal any details of the alleged friendly-settlement negotiations, such as the amount involved, or any offers or concessions made therein, so as to be capable of prejudicing in any way the proceedings before the Court.

With particular regard to the risk of absconding, consideration must be given to the character of the person involved, his morals, assets, links with the State in which he is being prosecuted and his international contacts (see Buzadji, cited above, \u00a7 90). The risk of reoffending, if convincingly established, may lead the judicial authorities to place and leave a suspect in detention in order to prevent any attempts to commit further offences. It is however necessary, among other conditions, that the danger be a plausible one and the measure appropriate, in the light of the circumstances of the case and in particular the history and personality of the person concerned (see Valeriy Samoylov v.

It suffices, in the absence of a formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official in question regards the accused as guilty, and a premature expression of such an opinion by the tribunal itself will inevitably run foul of the said principle (see Perica Oreb v.

At the same time, the Court notes that the domestic courts referred to a reasonable suspicion that the accused had committed the crimes with which they were charged in the bill of indictment (see paragraph 18 above). It is clear from the reading of the domestic decision as a whole that the domestic courts treated the impugned circumstances not as established facts, but only as allegations (see Karan v.

The Court is satisfied that the domestic courts were referring not to the question whether the applicants\u2019 guilt had been established by the evidence, which was clearly not the issue to be determined in the context of detention, but to whether there were legal grounds for the applicants\u2019 continued detention (see Miladinov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a075).",
