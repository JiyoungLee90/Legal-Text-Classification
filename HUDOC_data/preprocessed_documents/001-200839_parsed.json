Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. The Court also held, inter alia, that negative stereotyping\u00a0of an ethnic group was capable, when reaching a certain level, of having an impact on the group\u2019s sense of identity and on its members\u2019 feelings of selfworth and self-confidence (ibid; see also Lewit v.

Although the Contracting States are permitted, or even obliged, by their positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention to regulate the exercise of freedom of expression so as to ensure adequate protection by law of individuals\u2019 reputation, they must not do so in a manner that unduly deters the media from fulfilling their \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d role (for instance, by way of alerting the public to apparent or suspected misuse of public power as in Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere, cited above, \u00a7 113). Investigative journalists are liable to be inhibited from reporting on matters of general public interest (for instance, such as suspected irregularities in the award of public contracts to commercial entities) if they run the risk, as one of the standard sanctions imposable for unjustified attacks on the reputation of private individuals, of being sentenced to imprisonment or to a prohibition on the exercise of their profession (ibid). The chilling effect that the fear of such sanctions has on the exercise of journalistic freedom of expression works to the detriment of society as a whole, is likewise a factor which goes to the proportionality, and thus the justification, of the sanctions imposed on an applicant, who was entitled to bring to the attention of the public an important matter of general interest (ibid, \u00a7 114).",

Those findings were unfavourable to the applicant. It is true that, unlike the expert reports, F. concluded that the applicant\u2019s article contained indirect calls to violent actions against the non-Russian population (see paragraph 17 above). This finding was not, however, taken up by the trial court when convicting the applicant. It appears that both the trial and appeal courts chose to rely primarily on the expert reports rather than F.\u2019s report, which, however, was mentioned among the evidence supporting the applicant\u2019s guilt. It has not been alleged, and the Court does not find, that the applicant was restricted in challenging those expert reports during the trial. In addition, it appears that F. had been interviewed during the pre-trial investigation. It remains unclear what questions the applicant wanted to put to F. during the trial or on appeal.",

In cases concerning Article 10 of the Convention, \u201cit should only be resorted to if it is immediately clear that the impugned statements sought to deflect this Article from its real purpose by employing the right to freedom of expression for ends clearly contrary to the values of the Convention\u201d (see Perin\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7 114; Roj TV A/S, cited above, \u00a7 46; Ibragim Ibragimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 62; and Past\u00f6rs, cited above, \u00a7 37). The decisive point under Article 17 is \u201cwhether the applicant\u2019s statements sought to stir up hatred or violence, and whether by making them he attempted to rely on the Convention to engage in an activity or perform acts aimed at the destruction of the rights and freedoms laid down in it\u201d (see Perin\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7 115).",

The applicant\u2019s statements were clearly xenophobic. That does not mean, however, that the statements were totally unprotected under Article 10. In my opinion, for Article 17 to apply (and Article 10 not to apply), there would have to be a \u201ccall for hatred, violence or intolerance\u201d (see Perin\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7 239, and compare with the wording used in the judgments cited in paragraph 52 of the present judgment). I do not think that the applicant\u2019s articles can be read as containing such a call. The applicant merely vented his own frustration at the presence of \u201cnon-Russians\u201d.

This is rightly stated, since it is a requirement or aspect of the principle of effectiveness that limitations or restrictions to rights should be construed strictly and narrowly. However, in my view, the Court followed only in theory, and not in practice, its previous approach regarding the interpretation and application of restrictions to freedom of expression. Although the Court stated that it was applying that approach to the facts of the present case, in my view it did not do so. I contend that the restrictions imposed on the applicant were not necessary in a democratic society; the interference complained of was based on reasons which in the light of the case as a whole were not \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d to justify it. Furthermore, in my opinion, the sentence imposed on the applicant, prohibiting him from exercising any journalistic or publishing activities for two years (in addition to the penalty of a fine, which was also high), was disproportionate in the circumstances, thus violating the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 10 and the principle that the press must be able to perform the role of a public watchdog in a democratic society. This principle was enunciated, inter alia, in Cump\u0103n\u0103 and Maz\u0103re v. Romania ([GC], no. 33348/96, ECHR 2004XI), where the Court considered \u201cthat by prohibiting the applicants from working as journalists as a preventive measure of general scope, albeit subject to a time-limit, the domestic courts contravened the principle that the press must be able to perform the role of a public watchdog in a democratic society\u201d (\u00a7 119).",

The right to examine witnesses under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) is a minimum right for everyone charged with a criminal offence. Not permitting the applicant to cross-examine witness F. rendered the protection of his right to a fair trial under Article 6 neither practical nor effective. Any other interpretation of Article 6 would not reflect its purpose and the notion of fair trial. That the evidence of this witness was not favourable to the applicant is clear from the judgment (see paragraphs 17, 26 and 81). The domestic courts provided no reasons for dismissing the applicant\u2019s request to have witness F. examined (see paragraphs 81 and 84 of the judgment), notwithstanding that witness F.\u2019s report had been admitted in evidence (ibid.), such that it was unavoidable that it had some influence on the domestic judges\u2019 thinking.",
