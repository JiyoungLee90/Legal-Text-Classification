They stressed that the use of a rubber truncheon in the applicant\u2019s case had been lawful and justified. It therefore did not fall under the notion of \u201cill-treatment\u201d prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention.

In addition, the Government noted that having used a rubber truncheon, the warder had not intended to humiliate or debase the applicant or to cause him physical or psychological suffering. The use of force constituted an adequate and lawful response to the applicant\u2019s unruly behaviour when he resisted the warders\u2019 lawful orders.

The applicant stressed that the official version that he had intended to attack the warders did not bear analysis.

The Court accepts that the use of force may be necessary on occasion to ensure prison security, to maintain order or prevent crime in penitentiary facilities.

However, even proceeding on the assumption that the Government\u2019s description of the circumstances surrounding the application of force to the applicant is the more accurate one, the Court does not discern any necessity which might have prompted the use of rubber truncheons or of violence of such a degree, as confirmed by the materials of the case file, against the applicant (see paragraph 46 above). On the contrary, the actions by the officer L. were grossly disproportionate to the applicant\u2019s alleged misconduct and manifestly inconsistent with the goals he sought to achieve. Thus, it follows from the Government\u2019s submissions that, having entered the corridor, the applicant refused to proceed to outdoor exercise and attempted to punch the warders, taking up a boxing position, using threats and grabbing their clothes. The Court accepts that in these circumstances the officers may have needed to resort to physical force to put a stop to the applicant\u2019s unruly behaviour. However, the Court is not convinced that hitting a detainee with a truncheon or kicking him a number of times was conducive to the desired result.",

The Court has already noted in previous cases that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element which defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7\u00a0114, ECHR 2000VII). According to the Court\u2019s consistent approach, treatment is considered \u201cinhuman\u201d if it is premeditated, applied for hours at a stretch and causes either actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering. It is deemed to be \u201cdegrading\u201d if it is such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 92). The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a violation of Article 3 (see, for example, Peers v.\u00a0Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2001-III, and Kalashnikov v. Russia, no.\u00a047095/99, \u00a7 101, ECHR 2002-VI).",

In the present case the applicant made a complaint of ill-treatment to the Vladimir Town Prosecutor\u2019s office on 14 July 2003. While the parties did not indicate the date when the deputy prosecutor issued a formal decision initiating the inquiry into the applicant\u2019s complaint, it appears that no investigative steps were taken until 30 October 2003, when the deputy prosecutor interviewed the six warders (see paragraph 17 above). On the same day he issued his first decision, dismissing the applicant\u2019s complaints of ill-treatment. In this respect the Court finds it striking that for a period of more than three months between 14 July and 30 October 2003, that is during the period immediately after the incident which usually proves to be crucial for the establishment of the truth in cases similar to the one at hand, there were no developments in the inquiry (see, for similar reasoning, Vladimir Fedorov v.

It reiterates that proper medical examinations are an essential safeguard against ill-treatment. The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and have been allocated a mandate which is sufficiently broad in scope (see Akko\u00e7 v.

When a doctor writes a report after a medical examination of a person who alleges having been ill-treated, it is extremely important that he states the degree of consistency with the allegations of ill-treatment. A conclusion indicating the degree of support to the allegations of illtreatment should be based on a discussion of possible differential diagnoses (non-ill-treatment-related injuries \u2013 including self-inflicted injuries \u2013 and diseases) (see Barabanshchikov v. , no. 36220/02, \u00a7 59, 8 January 2009).",

However, the deputy prosecutor confined himself to mere reiteration of the records and medical specialists\u2019 statements (see paragraph 19 above) and did not attempt to examine the medical evidence before him or to draw conclusions on that basis. In this connection the Court is concerned that the lack of any \u201cobjective\u201d evidence of criminal conduct - which could have been provided by medical or expert reports \u2013 was subsequently relied on by the deputy prosecutor as a ground for his decision not to institute criminal proceedings against the officer.

It is apparent from the decision submitted to the Court that the prosecution authorities based their conclusions mainly on the statements given by the warders involved in the incident. The applicant\u2019s right to participate effectively in the investigation was not secured. It transpires from the deputy prosecutors\u2019 decision that he only heard the applicant in person some time after 1 April 2004, when the Frunzenskiy District Court had quashed his decision of 2 March 2004. In any event, although excerpts from the applicant\u2019s complaints to the prosecution authorities were included in the first decisions not to institute criminal proceedings, the prosecution authorities did not consider the applicant\u2019s statements to be credible, apparently, because they reflected a personal opinion and constituted an accusatory tactic by the applicant. However, the investigator did regard the warders\u2019 testimonies as credible, despite the fact that their statements could have constituted defence tactics, could have been called forth by corporate solidarity and have been aimed at damaging the applicant\u2019s credibility. In the Court\u2019s view, the prosecuting investigation applied different standards when assessing the statements, as those made by the applicant or, for that matter by his inmate Mr Li., were deemed to be subjective, but not those given by the warders. The credibility of the latter statements should also have been questioned, as the prosecuting investigation was supposed to establish whether the warders were liable on the basis of disciplinary or criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v.

Although it appeared from the warders\u2019 statements that other inmates had been taken for outdoor exercise at the same time as the applicant, and therefore could have witnessed the incident, no steps were taken to identify those possible witnesses. While the investigating authorities may not have been provided with the names of individuals who could have seen the applicant and might have witnessed his alleged beatings, they were expected to take steps on their own initiative to identify possible eyewitnesses. The investigating authorities also failed to respond to the applicant\u2019s argument that officer L. had injured his hand when he had broken the applicant\u2019s tooth.

Mikhaylov, with authority to represent his interests in the proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights. Counsel acted as the applicant\u2019s representatives following the communication of the case to the respondent Government.
