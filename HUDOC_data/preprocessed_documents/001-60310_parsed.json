My elder brother's van arrived at about 6.30 a.m. I got into the driver's cabin, and my elder brother, Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin, did likewise. He had already put a foot inside when I heard six pistol shots and my brother collapsed in the driver's cabin of the van. There were four of us in the cabin and my brother fell on top of us. I started to run after the two men who had fired the shots. I did not see their faces, but there had been other people in the tearoom while I was there, apart from the workmen. It was they who shot my brother. Both of them had a pistol in their hands but I am unable to identify the make. One of the killers was approximately 1 metre 80 tall, the other 1 metre 60. He was stout. The man who was 1 metre 80 tall was slim, had a black moustache and hollow cheeks. The other man was 1 metre 60 tall, stout, blond and had bright coloured eyes. I ran after them but was unable to catch them. They turned into another street and got away. They did not fire at me or anyone else.'",

His van was going to pick up the workmen outside M\u00fcsl\u00fcm Olcay's coffee house to take them to the building site. When he left the house, I wondered whether he would manage to catch the van and that is why I waited outside the house. I was approximately 250 metres from the van and there was nothing obstructing my view of it. I knew that the van driver was Mesut \u015een, but did not know the workmen. As my husband, Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin, got into the van alongside the driver, two people came up and fired shots, but I was unable to work out whether my husband was the target. At that point a person I did not know arrived and told me that my husband had been shot. One of the assailants was stout and short. The other was slim and approximately 1 metre 70 tall. I did not see their faces. From what I heard, they fired six or seven shots. I saw one of them fire a shot in the air. I do not know who killed my husband. I was not questioned after the killing. The first deposition I gave was to you on 15 April 1998. Mesut \u015een was the van driver and that is how I know that he was at the scene of the murder. I do not know the identity of the other workmen. I do not remember whether I took any official action after the murder. The assailants ran towards me. At that point I did not know that they had shot my husband. They disappeared round the corner of the road just next to me. They were holding pistols. My brother-in-law, Halil Sabuktekin, arrived and told me that my husband had been shot. I did not see Halil run after the suspects. When he got up to me he fainted. I wanted to help him recover his senses and at the same time to follow the suspects, but I did not find them. I met an elderly person. I do not know his name, but do know his address. That person may know in which direction the suspects fled. When I asked him which way they had gone, he said that he had not seen them. To be precise, he said that they had run off and that there was no point in giving chase, as I would never be able to catch them up. No one stopped me when I tried to chase them. In any event, I was the only person who sought to follow the suspects. Three or four years before my husband was killed, there was an investigation. My husband was taken into police custody but was not detained. He was questioned about a person named R\u0131fat and another workman, who were working on one of the building sites in the sub-prefecture of Karatas. R\u0131fat and the other workman were suspected of being members of the PKK and I think my husband was suspected of helping them. I repeat that my husband was not detained but merely taken into police custody. I do not suggest that any plainclothes police officers were at the scene of the murder. No one sought to stop anyone from chasing the suspects. In any event, I was the only person who attempted to follow them. That is all I have to say.'",

She relied on the Susurluk Report as support for allegations that illegal assaults had been committed with the support of the authorities and to their knowledge. She said that while the report did not enable those responsible for the assaults to be identified, it did contain very serious admissions and an acknowledgement that attacks for which no responsibility had been claimed and which had been attributed to \u201cunknown perpetrators\u201d had in fact been ordered by senior officers in the security forces, a fact that was of direct relevance to the present case. She pointed to the shortcomings in the investigations into the illegal killings, which had been highlighted by the Convention institutions, as evidence that public prosecutors were not really in a position to investigate complaints against members of the security forces effectively. Those matters, taken as a whole, showed that the security forces and those acting under their control or with their approval enjoyed impunity, a factor which in the applicant's submission was incompatible with the concept of the rule of law. In the special circumstances of the instant case, in which her husband had been at risk of attack owing to his position as an active member in the pro-Kurdish HADEP party, the authorities had not protected his life and the respondent State had failed to discharge its positive obligation to protect by law the lives of a category of citizens known to be exposed to a real and present danger by the illegal activities, of which the authorities were aware, of the counter-insurgency movements.",

The Court notes that following an operation by the security forces a member of the illegal Hizbullah organisation was arrested with six other suspects and they were charged inter alia with being implicated in the murder of Salih Sabuktekin. Forensic tests carried out on the guns and ammunition seized at the suspects' homes showed that the cartridge cases were of a different type from those found at the scene of the crime. The Public Prosecutor at the Adana National Security Court took a statement from M\u00fcsl\u00fcm Olcay, who was shown photographs of the suspects. Mr Olcay was unable to provide any other information than that he had given in his statement to the police. He said that he had not seen the killers' faces. Also in that connection, Halil Sabuktekin likewise stated that the men who had shot his brother were not any of the suspects and presumed members of Hizbullah whose photographs he had been shown (see paragraph 47 above). As regards the proceedings that ended with the acquittal of the persons accused, the Court notes that the domestic courts reached that verdict as a result of a lack of real evidence. Having examined the documents in the investigation file, it does not consider that that there were any failings in the conduct of the proceedings serious enough to harm the overall investigation into the murder. Furthermore, when the National Security Court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to find the suspects guilty, the Public Prosecutor at the National Security Court sent fresh instructions to the Anti-Terrorist Branch to conduct a thorough investigation into the murder and to provide him with detailed information about the results of its inquiries.",

That evidence shows that the authorities took witness statements from the applicant and the victim's brothers and other people who were present when the crime was committed (see paragraphs 45-59 above). It is true that the applicant's first statement was not taken until 15\u00a0April 1998, that is to say three and a half years after her husband was killed. According to a letter from the Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the applicant and other people were instructed by the police to attend the police station to give a statement on the day of the murder. The Court notes at the outset that the applicant was not present at the scene of the crime. She was 250 metres from the van. Her statements show that she did not see the killers or know the identities of the workmen in the van (see paragraph 57 above). The Court also notes that neither the applicant nor the deceased's brothers informed the authorities responsible for investigating the case of the matters which, in their opinion, proved or made it probable that Salih Sabuktekin had been killed by or at the instigation of the security forces. The applicant failed to inform the relevant bodies of specific events that might have served to corroborate her allegation and notably of certain events on which she relied before the Commission, such as the three nocturnal visits by the police to her home, her brother-in-law's attempt to pursue the killers with another person and the fact that they had been prevented from doing so by plainclothes police officers who had gone on to arrest them. Nor do Halil Sabuktekin's statements to the investigating authorities show that he made any reference to those events, which allegedly occurred immediately after the killing, either. In these circumstances, the fact that the applicant was not interviewed promptly by the investigating authorities does not suffice to cast any doubt on the effectiveness of their investigations (see paragraphs 45 and 57 above).",
