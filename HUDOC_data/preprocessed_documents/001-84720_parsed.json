He considered that this limitation had not been provided for by law, since section 38 of the 1994 Act provided for the right to claim compensation for past violations and did not refer to on-going breaches. Moreover, the applicant argued that he could not ask for the prohibition of further use of his protected work since the decision to use the photograph taken by him had been adopted by the Government. According to the legislation in force (see paragraph 20 above), an individual could not challenge a Government decision in court unless the decision related specifically to him or her.

However, the court only referred to identity cards and not to the photograph taken by the applicant, in respect of which there was no dispute. Moreover, section 4 of the 1994 Act expressly distinguishes between the author's rights in respect of works created by him or her and the property right over the material object in which that creation is embodied (see paragraph 19 above). It follows that the finding of the Supreme Court of Justice that identity cards could not be subject to copyright had no bearing on the applicant's rights in respect of the photograph he had taken. This finding is confirmed by the fact that the domestic courts found, in the first set of proceedings, that the applicant's rights had been infringed. The courts awarded him compensation despite the Ministry's use of the photograph in an identical manner both before and after 1999, that is as a background for identity cards.",
