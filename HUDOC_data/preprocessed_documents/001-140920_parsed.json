The establishment of an inflexible time limit, however, is likely to run counter to the importance of the private life interest at stake. Thus, the Court found a violation in Shofman v. Russia (cited above) where an absolute one-year time limit ran without any exceptions from the date when the putative father was informed that he had been registered as the father, irrespective of his awareness of the circumstances casting doubt on his paternity. The time-limit of one year set out in Article 80 \u00a7 1 of the Family and Custody Code cannot be characterized per se as inflexible as it is connected with a putative father\u2019s decision to recognise his paternity of a child and does not follow from a legal presumption.",

In the present case the applicant had, via the prosecutor, access to a court to challenge his paternity and the courts examined the merits of the case. The Court finds that the domestic courts properly identified the conflicting values and interests at stake. They took into account the different interests of the applicant and of the child. They carefully balanced those interests and provided detailed reasons for their findings. They found, in particular, that the applicant had recognised his paternity of D in full awareness that he might not have been his biological father. In such circumstances, once the limitation-period for the applicant\u2019s own claim to seek annulment of his recognition of paternity expired, it was open to the domestic courts to give greater weight to the interests of the child rather than to the applicant\u2019s interest in disproving his freely acknowledged paternity. This approach has been confirmed in a number of cases decided by the Court (see, inter alia, Yildirim v. Austria (dec.), cited above; K\u0148\u00e1kal v. Czech Republic (dec.), no. 39277/06, 8 January 2007; and Wulff v. Denmark (dec.), cited above).",

The notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d incorporates the right to respect for an individual\u2019s decision to become or not to become a parent, and this embraces the decision to become a legal parent notwithstanding the biological origins of the child or embryo. In so far as the issue falls within the ambit and under the protection of Article 8, I can accept that the applicant\u2019s complaints do not necessarily amount to an abuse of the right of petition (see paragraph 49 of the judgment). However, I have serious misgivings as to whether the \u201clink between the applicant\u2019s wish to have his earlier acknowledgment\u201d revoked (paragraph 60) suffices to reasonably characterise the opening of proceedings at his own request as constituting \u201can interference\u201d (paragraph 61) attributable to the authorities and not to his own wish.",

Even if such an obligation existed (which I doubt), it appears quite obvious that in so far as this was done after a substantial period of established family links with the child, in these proceedings the domestic courts were clearly under an obligation not only to examine the applicant\u2019s belated change of mind, but also to take into account and balance it against the child\u2019s rights under Article 8 and to afford the latter the requisite protection.

In the circumstances I find it difficult to understand how the domestic courts\u2019 decisions refusing his challenge to his declaration of paternity can sensibly be understood as an \u201cinterference\u201d with his right to respect for private life. Recognition of paternity by the husband, like a decision to adopt, is an act inherently intended to strengthen and preserve private and family life. To the best of my knowledge there exists no positive obligation on the part of the State to allow a person to retract such recognition at will, just as there is no positive obligation to allow a parent to terminate an adoption at will.
