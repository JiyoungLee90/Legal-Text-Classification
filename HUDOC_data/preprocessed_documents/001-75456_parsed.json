However, it recalls that the danger of absconding cannot solely be assessed on the basis of the severity of the sentence risked, but must be analysed with reference to a number of other relevant additional elements, which may either confirm the existence of such a danger or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Muller v. France, judgment of 17\u00a0March 1997, Reports 1997 II, \u00a7 43, and Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series\u00a0A no. 207, \u00a7 43). In this regard, the Court notes the lack of such sufficient reasoning in the domestic court\u2019s decisions to prolong the applicant\u2019s remand in custody.",
