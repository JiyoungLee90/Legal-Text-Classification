B. refused again on 19 August 2005 and found that the prosecutor had failed to comply with his previous decision and that therefore the applicant\u2019s detention had been unlawful.

Moreover, the window cell was repaired after only four days and in any event the temperatures at the end of September were usually moderate. In addition, prisoners were allowed to bring their own mattresses and linen. In so far as the complaint under Article 5 was concerned, the court found that there were no civil remedies against the alleged breaches under Moldovan law.

This has the potential of unsettling numerous legal relations relying on the established situation and gives a discriminatory advantage to the State without any compelling reason. Therefore, the Court finds that Article\u00a086 (2) of the old Civil Code exempting State entities from the general limitation period was itself contrary to Article 6 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Platakou v.

Moreover, the notion of absolute nullity of a contract was first introduced in the Moldovan Civil Code together with the new Civil Code and the Supreme Court of Justice made express reference to the old Civil Code and particularly to Article 86 according to which no time-limit existed for the State to claim its property back (see paragraph 43 above).",

The Court found in paragraph 92 above that the upholding of the Prosecutor General\u2019s action after the expiry of the general time-limit, and in the absence of any compelling reasons, was incompatible with the principle of legal certainty, and in so doing drew a parallel with cases concerning quashing of final judgments. In such circumstances the Court cannot but find that the upholding of the Prosecutor General\u2019s actions constituted an unjustified interference with the applicants\u2019 right to property, because a fair balance was not preserved and the applicants were required to bear and continue to bear an individual and excessive burden (see, mutatis mutandis, Brum\u0103rescu v.
