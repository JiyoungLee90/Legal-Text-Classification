However, the domestic courts dismissed his case on different grounds, namely on the grounds that he could not be considered as a \u201cconcerned\u201d person since he had not been a party to the annulment proceedings brought by the main shareholders (see paragraph\u00a030 above). In the Reisner case, however, the domestic courts, without dwelling on whether the applicant had been a \u201cconcerned\u201d person who could benefit from the courts\u2019 decisions, had held that the restitution of that applicant\u2019s rights as a shareholder had been legally impossible as, following its sale to HSBC, Demirbank had been struck off the commercial register. The Court notes that although the domestic courts gave differing grounds for dismissal, both applications concern the very same subject matter and it therefore finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to adopt a different conclusion from the one reached in Reisner (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045-51).",

The authorities were under an obligation to compensate him for the loss, which was clearly the result of illegal administrative actions that were subsequently declared unlawful by the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraphs\u00a08-16 above). The applicant\u2019s shares were removed from his possession on the basis of unlawful interference, yet he received no compensation for his loss and was made to bear a disproportionate individual burden.",
