The Court will look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d and whether it was \u201cproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued\u201d. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among many other authorities, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2007IV).",

Not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas, but the public also has a right to receive them (see Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere, cited above, \u00a7 93; and Salum\u00e4ki v. Finland, no.\u00a023605/09, \u00a7 46, 29 April 2014 with further references). Moreover, the Convention provisions securing this right apply not only to \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cideas\u201d that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d (see, notably, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 24, and, more recently, Mouvement ra\u00eblien suisse v.\u00a0Switzerland [GC], no. 16354/06, \u00a7 48, ECHR\u00a02012 (extracts)).",

It notes that the applicant relied on official reports and presented the mayor\u2019s point of view on the matter in the same article (see paragraphs 8 and 11 above and, conversely, Flux, cited above, \u00a7 29).
