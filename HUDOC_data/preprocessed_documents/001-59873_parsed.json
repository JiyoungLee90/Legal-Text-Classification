Article 214, second paragraph, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which is a clear statutory provision with foreseeable effect, sets a time-limit on pre-trial detention extended in this manner, since it provides that persons detained pending trial shall automatically be released if the Indictment Division has not ruled within two months of the transfer order.",
