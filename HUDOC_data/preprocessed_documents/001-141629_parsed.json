Taken together with Article 15 of the Constitution, these provisions provided for a fundamental right to effective judicial proceedings. The right to an effective remedy also encompassed the right to claim that the proceedings took place within a reasonable time. The Supreme Court also made reference to the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and to the right to an effective remedy in Article 13 of the Convention. The Supreme Court found that the State Liability Act (Riigivastutuse seadus) did not provide for compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by excessive length of a preliminary investigation in criminal proceedings, declared it unconstitutional in this respect and awarded the complainant a sum of money relying on Article 25 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court further considered that the enactment of a special regulation for compensation for damage arising from criminal proceedings was required (for a more extensive summary of the judgment, see Raudsepp v. Estonia, no. 54191/07, \u00a7\u00a7 38-42, 8 November 2011).",

Thus, the question arises whether the second applicant was required to have recourse to administrative courts in order to comply with the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court has held that in cases like the present one, where the remedy in question was the result of interpretation by the courts, it takes some time before the public may be considered to be effectively aware of the domestic decision which had established the remedy and the persons concerned be enabled and obliged to use it (see, for example, Broca and Texier-Micault v. France, nos. 27928/02 and 31694/02, \u00a7 20, 21 October 2003; Depauw v. Belgium (dec.), no.\u00a02115/04, 15 May 2007; Leandro Da Silva v.

Having regard to the fact that in the present case the domestic proceedings ended before the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 22 March 2011 and that the second applicant lodged his application with the Court merely two months after the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment, the Court considers that this period of time was too short for the second applicant to be considered to have become aware of the development of the pertinent domestic case-law.",

In particular, the Court has previously departed from this general rule in cases, for example, against Italy, Croatia and Slovakia concerning remedies against the excessive length of proceedings (see Brusco, cited above; Nogolica v.\u00a0Croatia (dec.), no.\u00a077784/01, ECHR 2002-VIII; and Andr\u00e1\u0161ik and Others v.\u00a0Slovakia (dec.), nos. 57984/00, 60226/00, 60237/00, 60242/00, 60679/00, 60680/00 and 68563/01, ECHR 2002-IX) and in \u0130\u00e7yer v.

The remedies under consideration in these cases were enacted to redress at a domestic level the Convention grievances of persons whose applications pending before the Court concerned similar issues (see Demopoulos and Others v.

Having regard to the fact that in the present case the applicants lodged their applications with the Court on 4 March 2010 and 31 May 2011, after the domestic proceedings had lasted for nearly five and over six years, respectively, the fact that the domestic remedy in question was developed by case-law without any specific transitional provisions concerning cases pending before the Strasbourg Court having been enacted and considering the small number of similar cases in respect of the Contracting Party concerned, the Court considers that there are no particular circumstances in this case to justify departing from the general rule that the assessment of whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is carried out with reference to the date on which the application was lodged with the Court (compare, for example, Parizov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a014258/03, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, 7 February 2008, and Eriksson v.\u00a0Sweden, no. 60437/08, \u00a7 53, 12 April 2012).
