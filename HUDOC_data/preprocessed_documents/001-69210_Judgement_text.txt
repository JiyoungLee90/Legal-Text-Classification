The case originated in an application (no. 69012/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovakian national, Mrs Gabriela Kopecká (“the applicant”), on 21 February 2001.
The Government of the  (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Kresák, succeeded by Ms A. Poláčková.
On 5 October 2004 the Court decided to communicate the application. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Pusté Uľany.
In 1991 the applicant sustained an injury at work as a result of which she has been handicapped.
On 8 January 1992 she sought compensation from her former employer before the Galanta District Court. The applicant also submitted an expert opinion.
In the course of 1992 and 1993 the District Court held 12 hearings.
On 8 April 1994 the District Court decided to obtain a second expert opinion. The defendant challenged the decision ordering him to pay an advance on expert’s fees. On 31 August 1994 the appellate court determined that issue.
On 22 September 1994 the District Court decided to obtain an opinion from a different expert. On 1 December 1994 and on 9 March 1995 the court urged the expert to submit the opinion.
On 11 July 1995 the case was assigned to a different judge.
Between 28 November 1995 and 12 October 1999 the District Court requested the expert five times to submit the opinion or to return the file to it. The letter of 12 October 1999 was returned to the court with a remark indicating that the addressee had died. It was later established that the expert had died in December 1995.
Between 26 October 1999 and 3 May 2000 the District Court unsuccessfully attempted to locate and obtain the case file which had been sent to the expert. On 16 June 2000 it requested the parties to submit all relevant documents to it as the file had been lost with the expert. The court reiterated its request on 10 August 2000 and, as regards the applicant, also on 7 September 2000.
In the meantime, on 31 March 1999, bankruptcy proceedings were brought against the defendant.
On 17 August 2000 the administrator in bankruptcy informed the District Court that he did not possess the documents which the court had requested. The administrator asked the District Court to stay the proceedings due to the defendant’s bankruptcy.
On 20 September 2000 the applicant informed the District Court that she possessed no further documents relating to the case.
On 22 March 2001 the Galanta District Court stayed the proceedings concerning the applicant’s claim pending the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings against the defendant company.
On 8 September 2003 and on 5 December 2003 the District Court requested the  to submit to it the latter’s decision of 9 July 2003 under which the bankruptcy proceedings had been discontinued. In the meantime, on 27 October 2003, the defendant company had been deleted from the companies register whereby it had ceased to exist.
On 29 December 2003 the Galanta District Court received the above ’s decision of 9 July 2003. On 19 January 2004 the District Court discontinued the proceedings in the applicant’s action of 8 January 1992 on the ground that the defendant had ceased to exist without any legal successor. The decision became final on 7 February 2004.
Article 48(2) of the Constitution provides, inter alia, that every person has the right to have his or her case tried without unjustified delay.
Pursuant to Article 130(3) of the Constitution, as in force until 30 June 2001, the  could commence proceedings upon the petition (“podnet”) presented by any individual or a corporation claiming that their rights had been violated.
According to its case-law under the former Article 130(3) of the Constitution, the  lacked jurisdiction to draw legal consequences from a violation of a petitioner’s rights under Article 48(2) of the Constitution. It could neither grant damages to the person concerned nor impose a sanction on the public authority liable for the violation found. In the ’s view, it was therefore for the authority concerned to provide redress to the person whose rights had been violated.
As from 1 January 2002, the Constitution has been amended in that, inter alia, individuals and legal persons can complain about a violation of their fundamental rights and freedoms pursuant to Article 127. Under this provision the  has the power, in case that it finds a violation of Article 48(2) of the Constitution, to order the authority concerned to proceed with the case without delay. It may also grant adequate financial satisfaction to a person whose constitutional right has been violated as a result of excessive length of proceedings (for further details see, e.g., Andrášik and Others v. Slovakia (dec.), nos. 57984/00, 60237/00, 60242/00, 60679/00, 60680/00, 68563/01, 60226/00, 22 October 2002).
It has been the ’s practice to examine alleged violations of the right to a hearing without undue delay only where the relevant remedy was filed with it at a time when the alleged violation occurred or still lasted ( ÚS 34/99 of 20 May 1999 or III. ÚS 20/00 of 12 April 2000). It has not examined complaints about length of proceedings in which a final decision had been delivered at the moment of introduction of such complaints.
In case registered before the Constitutional Court under file number I. ÚS 122/03 the plaintiff complained, inter alia, about the length of enforcement proceedings relating to a sum which his former employer owed him. The proceedings were stayed, in 1999, as bankruptcy proceedings had been brought against the defendant. In its decision of 18 June 2003 the Constitutional Court expressed the view that, where civil proceedings are lawfully stayed, there is a legitimate legal obstacle to proceeding to a resolution of the matter in issue. Referring to its case-law, the Constitutional Court held that inactivity of a court which is due to such a legal obstacle cannot be considered as unjustified delay in the proceedings contrary to Article 48(2) of the Constitution. To the extent that the plaintiff complained about delays in the proceedings prior to the decision to stay the enforcement proceedings given in 1999, his complaint had been lodged after the expiry of the two months’ time-limit laid down in Section 53(3) of the Constitutional Court Act. In addition, at that time a different means of protection of individuals’ constitutional rights existed (petition under Article 130(3) of the Constitution) and the plaintiff had not used that remedy without invoking any relevant reason for such failure. The complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution, introduced with effect from 1 January 2002, was not intended to be a substitute for remedies which had been available to individuals until 31 December 2001. The  therefore rejected the plaintiff’s complaint. It confirmed the above position in its decision I. ÚS 162/03 given on 17 September 2003.
In decision IV. ÚS 205/03 of 18 February 2004 the Constitutional Court held that undue delays in proceedings may also result from an ordinary court’s decision to stay proceedings where such a decision is not justified in the particular circumstances of the case.
