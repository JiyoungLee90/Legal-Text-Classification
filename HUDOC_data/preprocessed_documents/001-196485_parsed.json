According to the appeal court, the new military unit was under no legal obligation to enforce the judgment, as it was given against a different military unit. The court noted that the applicant had not requested the initial debtor to provide her with the leave days in 2004-2006, during her service in that unit. Furthermore, the domestic courts had never examined the possibility of changing the method and the procedure of the execution of the judicial award.

In such cases, the defendant State authority must be duly noti\ufb01ed of the judgment and is thus well placed to take all necessary initiatives to comply with it or to transmit it to another competent State authority responsible for execution (see, among others, Akashev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a021). The initial debtor in the present case was served with the copy of the judgment and, moreover, started to comply with it (see paragraph\u00a011 above).

Similarly, the Court sees no reason to depart from its settled approach and finds that the applicant cannot be blamed for not making use of the compulsory enforcement proceedings.",

However, in the absence of any further clarifications from the parties, the Court cannot speculate on the outcome of such request, let alone prospects of success of such proceedings, given that the key issue in the present case was a correct determination of an entity responsible for further enforcement, rather than specific enforcement modalities.

In these circumstances, the Court is unable to establish the exact scope and nature of any specific additional steps the applicant had to take to obtain the enforcement of the judgment. Accordingly, the Court does not have sufficient grounds to conclude that her behavior was an obstacle to timely and full enforcement of a judgment (see, by contrast, Gadzhikhanov and Saukov v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a010511/08 and 5866/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a025-31, 31\u00a0January 2012), and rejects the Government\u2019s argument to that effect. As it is incumbent on the State to organise its legal system in such a way that ensures co-ordination between various enforcement agencies and secures honouring of the State\u2019s judgment debts in good time (see, mutatis mutandis, Reynbakh v.\u00a0Russia, no. 23405/03, \u00a7\u00a023, 29\u00a0September 2005), the Court further finds that it was for the applicant\u2019s two consecutive employers \u2013 the military units apparently belonging to the same sub-division \u2013 to ensure coordination in providing her with the allowances pursuant to the final judgment during her uninterrupted service in the Russian military forces.",

Indeed, in so far as that judgment has not been annulled and modified, the Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article\u00a06 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7\u00a012, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085). Having regard to the violation found, the Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well. It therefore considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the judgment of 11\u00a0February 2004.",

In general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention (see Shofman v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a074826/01, \u00a7\u00a053, 24\u00a0November 2005, with further references). By finding a violation of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 in the present case, the Court has established the Government\u2019s obligation to take appropriate measures to remedy the applicant\u2019s individual situation, that is to ensure compliance with the applicant\u2019s enforceable claim under the judgment of 11\u00a0February 2004 (see, for instance, Humbatov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 13652/06, \u00a7\u00a038, 3\u00a0December 2009, with further references). The Court notes that the applicant in the present case was dismissed from military service. In this connection, the Court considers that a decision on appropriate measures to enforce the judicial award, or, if this proves impossible, granting the applicant reasonable compensation, or a combination of these and other measures, falls to the respondent State (see, mutandis mutadis, Tarverdiyev v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no.\u00a033343/03, \u00a7\u00a066, 26\u00a0July 2007). The Court, however, emphasises that any measures adopted must be compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment (see Assanidze v.\u00a0Georgia [GC], no.\u00a071503/01, \u00a7\u00a0202, ECHR 2004-II, with further references).",

Regard being had to the documents in its possession and to its case-law, the Court considers that the amount claimed is not reasonable to quantum, given a straightforward nature of the case at hand. Furthermore, the Court observes that neither the applicant\u2019s submissions nor the case file contain information on the specific services covered by the invoices, or on the lawyer\u2019s hourly or daily rate, or a detailed description of the work done in that case and the time spent on it. Thus, the Court considers that a significant reduction is necessary on those grounds (see Bykov v.\u00a0Russia [GC], no.\u00a04378/02, \u00a7\u00a0114, 10\u00a0March 2009).
