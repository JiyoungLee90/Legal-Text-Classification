Article\u00a02 \u00a7\u00a02 of the law was of a general nature and the intention of Parliament was to remove the doubt that the 1989 ministerial decision had created. It therefore governed any case falling within its scope and not only the applicants\u2019 case. The Government further note that there were no decisions of the Court of Cassation on the matter. The fact that the case-law of the lower courts was favourable to the applicants cannot indicate that the Court of Cassation would also rule in their favour. Lastly, the Government note that the timing of the enactment of Law no.\u00a02233/1994 was not suspicious and the State was not a litigant in the proceedings opposing the applicants to the school.",

In any event, had there been a need of interpretation of the ministerial decision, the applicants do not understand why Law no.\u00a02233/1994 was enacted only five years after the decision was taken. In their view, Article\u00a02 \u00a7\u00a02 of Law no.\u00a02233/1994 was an arbitrary provision, contrary to the Constitution. This view was also shared by the domestic courts on several occasions.
