Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7 200, 10 January 2012). In extending the defendants\u2019 detention pending new trial, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation issued a collective detention order in respect of four co-defendants, including the applicant, without making any distinction between their individual situations. The Court has already found that the practice of issuing collective detention orders without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention in respect of each detainee was incompatible, in itself, with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Kolunov v. Russia, no. 26436/05, \u00a7\u00a053, 9 October 2012; Shcheglyuk v. Russia, no. 7649/02, \u00a7\u00a045, 14\u00a0December 2006; and Korchuganova, cited above, \u00a7 76). The order had no regard to the fact that the applicant had already spent more than five years in custody and did not mention any concrete facts warranting his continued detention.",

The Court does not require any form of certification of the documents that the parties submit in the proceedings before it, and the domestic courts should have been aware \u2013 if need be, with appropriate legal advice \u2013 of these special features of the Strasbourg proceedings. Requiring the applicant to produce a certified copy of the Government\u2019s unilateral declaration imposed a burden on him which he was unable to discharge. In any event, if the Regional Court entertained any doubts as to the authenticity of the declaration, it was open to it to obtain confirmation directly from the office of the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. Finally, the Court notes that the Kemerovo Regional Court\u2019s extension order was, as had been the Supreme Court\u2019s order before it, of a collective nature and did not mention any concrete facts that could support its conclusion that the applicant should remain in custody.",
