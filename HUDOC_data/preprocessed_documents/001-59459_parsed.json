The Government submit that it was the parties that requested the adjournment of 9 February 1994. The adjournment of 1 June 1994 must have been requested by the applicant himself, the defendant being absent from the court that day. The hearing of 9\u00a0January 1995 was cancelled because of the absence of both parties. The court took care to fix the next hearing date shortly after each adjournment or cancellation. Moreover, its decision was issued within a reasonable time after the hearing. There were no delays before the court of appeal. It took the applicant thirteen months to appeal in cassation against the court of appeal\u2019s judgment. The Court of Cassation heard the case and issued its judgment within a reasonable time in the particular circumstances.

He also claims that he received a copy of the appeal court\u2019s decision only in August 1997. The applicant points out that the Court of Cassation decided to hear his appeal almost one year after it had been lodged. Moreover, it took the Court of Cassation eight and a half months to finalise the text of the decision, which the applicant did not receive before December 1999. The applicant considers that, given what was at stake in the proceedings, it was unacceptable that it should have taken the domestic courts six and a half years to issue a final judgment in his case.",
