It does not appear, however, that the local authority has taken any measures to comply with the judgment. In fact, the judgment has remained without enforcement to date, that is for more than five years since it was issued. The Government did not offer any justification for that omission.",

The Court observes that the enforcement proceedings in the present case were finally closed in 2002 and neither party has indicated any possibility for their re-opening. Accordingly, the enforcement of the judgment of 21\u00a0February 2000 is no longer possible. This indicates the existence of a causal link between the violation found and the alleged pecuniary damage. However, noting the fact that the judgment was given in 2000, that is almost two years after the devaluation of the Russian currency in August 1998, the Court does not discern a causal link between the violation found and the applicant's claim to the pre-devaluation equivalent of the judgment debt in US dollars. Having regard to the above considerations, the Court awards the applicant EUR 2,109 in respect of the pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
