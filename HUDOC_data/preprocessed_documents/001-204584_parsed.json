Moreover, that unreserved attribution of the above-mentioned criminal acts to the applicant was described in the statement as a new relevant fact which had recently come to light in the investigation, which largely undermined the impact of the neutral wording used at the beginning of the statement. Therefore, the overall manner in which the statement was formulated left the reader in no doubt that the applicant had committed the criminal offence of high treason.",

The Court observes that Article 17.3 of the Law of 22 May 2012 provided that an investigating authority could restrict a detainee\u2019s right to correspondence for the purposes of ensuring a criminal investigation. Article 19.8 of the Law of 22 May 2012 also provided that an investigating authority could restrict a detainee\u2019s right to have visits and telephone calls for the same purposes (see paragraph 64 above).

Moreover, Article 23 of the Law of 22 May 2012, which governs a detainee\u2019s right to receive and subscribe to a newspaper or magazine, provided for restrictions only in respect of publications propagandising war, violence, extremism, terror and cruelty, or inciting racial, ethnic and social enmity and hostility, or containing pornography (see paragraph 64 above). The Azerbaijani Government also failed to refer to any legal provision laying down restrictions in respect of receiving and subscribing to sociopolitical newspapers or magazines. Consequently, it is not possible to establish that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right in this regard had a legal basis in domestic law, and thus the Court concludes that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to receive and subscribe to sociopolitical newspapers or magazines was not in accordance with the law within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 8.",
