The case originated in an application (no. 43610/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Janusz Wiśniewski (“the applicant”), on 29 September 2006.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that his pre-trial detention had exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.
On 19 May 2008 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1969 and is currently detained in Wrocław Prison.
On 26 March 2002 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of a series of thefts and armed robberies committed as a part of an organised criminal group.
On 28 March 2002 the Zielona Góra District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence. The court also stressed the likelihood of a lengthy prison sentence being imposed on the applicant and the complexity of the case.
Subsequently, several other members of the same criminal group were detained and charged in connection with the same investigation, which was conducted by the Organised Crime Department of the Zielona Góra Regional Prosecutor’s Office.
The applicant’s appeals against the detention order and the decisions extending his detention, and his numerous applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were all unsuccessful.
In the course of the investigation, the applicant’s detention was extended on 21 June 2002 (to 26 September 2002), 23 September 2002 (to 24 December 2002), 20 December 2002 (to 25 March 2003), 20 March 2003 (to 26 July 2003) and 22 July 2003 (to 30 November 2003). The courts repeated the grounds previously given for his continued detention, emphasising the complexity of the case and the large number of co-accused.
On 19 November 2003 the Zielona Góra Regional Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the  (Sąd Okręgowy). The applicant was charged with several counts of theft and armed robbery committed as part of an organised criminal group.
During the court proceedings the courts further extended the applicant’s detention pending trial on several occasions, namely on 26 November 2003, 25 February 2004, 11 March 2004, 23 June 2004, 21 September 2004, 16 December 2004, 10 March 2005, 17 June 2005, 18 August 2005 and 25 October 2005. They repeated the grounds that had previously been given for the applicant’s continued detention.
On 23 February 2006 the  gave judgment. It convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment and a fine.
The applicant appealed.
On 5 December 2006 the Poznań Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) upheld that judgment.
The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) which was dismissed on an unspecified subsequent date.
On 8 October 2004 the Zielona Góra District Court remanded the applicant in custody.
On 6 January 2005 it extended his pre-trial detention on the grounds of the likelihood that the applicant might tamper with evidence and the complexity of the case.
Subsequently, further decisions to extend his detention were taken by the  and the Poznań Court of Appeal on the following dates: 31 March 2005, 1 July 2005, 6 October 2005, 29 December 2006, 23 March 2007, 31 July 2007 and 27 September 2007. The courts repeated the grounds originally given for his detention.
On an unspecified date the applicant was served with a bill of indictment charging him with armed robbery.
On 21 November 2007 the  decided not to extend the applicant’s detention.
It appears that the criminal proceedings are still pending before that court.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pre-trial detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its prolongation, and release from detention, and the rules governing other “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are described in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 27-33, 25 April 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 May 2006.
On 24 July 2006 the Constitutional Court, in a case in which it examined jointly two constitutional complaints (skarga konstytucyjna) lodged by former detainees, declared Article 263 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure unconstitutional in so far as it related to the investigation stage of criminal proceedings (no. SK 58/03). The provision in question provided that the detention measure could be extended beyond two years if the pretrial proceedings could not be completed because of “important obstacles” which could not have been overcome. The provision in question did not set any statutory time-limit for extending the detention measure. The  considered that the impugned provision, by its imprecise and broad wording, could lead to arbitrary decisions of the courts on pre-trial detention and thus infringe the very essence of constitutional rights and freedoms. Referring to other grounds for extraordinary extensions of pre-trial detention under Article 263 § 4, namely suspension of criminal proceedings, prolonged psychiatric observation of the accused, the prolonged preparation of an expert opinion, evidence gathering in a particularly complex case or a foreign country, and the intentional protraction of the proceedings by the accused, the Constitutional Court stated that although those criteria were to some extent vague as well, their constitutionality could be secured through their precise definition formulated through practice and by reference, inter alia, to the settled caselaw of the European Court as regards violations of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.
The  ruled that the unconstitutional provision was to be repealed within six months from the date of the publication of the judgment in the Journal of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw).
The relevant statistical data, recent amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure designed to streamline criminal proceedings and references to the relevant Council of Europe Documents can be found in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kauczor (see Kauczor v. Poland, no. 45219/06, §§ 27-28 and 30-35, 3 February 2009).
