In addition, the applicant was ordered to pay J.\u2019s legal fees in the amount of EUR 5,896.21 plus interest. J.\u2019s claim for non-pecuniary damages was dismissed without examining the merits as he had not directed his compensation claim against the publisher of Alibi, Yhtyneet Kuvalehdet Oy, who bore the primary responsibility according to the law. The court noted that J. was an experienced police officer whose duties involved the exercise of public power but that he was not of high rank. The crimes had not been committed in office but had taken place during J.\u2019s free time. The judgments convicting J. as well as the information about his lack of criminal liability and wish to undergo psychiatric evaluation were public. However, all public information was not necessarily publishable. The crimes committed by J. had been ordinary and not very serious. On the other hand, the local interest in the case had been so exceptional that it had been reasonable to write about acts committed by J. and about his state of mind. The applicant had been aware of the fact that J. had been mentally ill at the time of the publication. The publication of J.\u2019s name did not strengthen the applicant\u2019s journalistic message nor was it well-founded in any other way. J.\u2019s name had not been disclosed in any other publication. The fact that J. had given an interview to the press did not change the outcome of the applicant\u2019s case as J. had not been able to evaluate the repercussions of his actions due to his mental illness.",

The request for non-pecuniary damages was rejected as premature because the compensation claim had not been directed against Yhtyneet Kuvalehdet Oy. The court found, in addition to the District Court\u2019s reasoning, that a crime was not the perpetrator\u2019s private matter. However, J.\u2019s trial had still been pending when the impugned article was published. Due to his mental illness, he had not been able to understand that his acts or trial would attract more publicity than usual. The applicant\u2019s act was intentional as he must have known that it was probable that the publication of the information would be conducive to suffering or damage to J.",

The court found that the publication of J.\u2019s name had caused him and his family mental suffering, especially as his delusions had been mentioned in the article. The article had affected J.\u2019s reputation permanently and it had made it difficult for J. to continue to live a normal life. J. had given an interview to another magazine in which his identity had not been disclosed. Therefore, the fact that he had given the interview did not make his suffering any less.

The applicant\u2019s conviction and order to pay non-pecuniary damages to J. did not represent an unreasonable sanction, even bearing in mind that the case concerned an exception to the freedom of expression.

The greater and more profound social implications a matter has, the more important it is to be able to publish information thereon. The Council divided persons into three groups as to the level of protection of identity: (1)\u00a0persons exercising political, economic or administrative power; (2) other public persons, for example in the sectors of entertainment, sports, arts or science; and (3) ordinary citizens. The Council noted that the protection of identity is narrowest for group 1 and most extensive for group 3. However, this scale was not to be used formally but the extent of protection should be interpreted on a case by case basis. A person\u2019s position had a great significance in determining the protection of private life but that alone could not be considered as a decisive factor. The significance of a matter also had an important impact. The conduct of a well-known person appearing in public in connection with his or her professional tasks or public role does not as such belong to such person\u2019s protected sphere of private life. On the contrary, information concerning lifestyle does normally belong to such person\u2019s sphere of private life even though his or her sphere of protection is narrower than that of an ordinary citizen. In some cases information concerning a person\u2019s lifestyle can be closely connected to his or her professional tasks in a way that its publication is justified. It is required, however, that the matter in question does have considerable general significance. Also, the publishing should not extend further than is necessary for the consideration of the matter. Finally, it is in accordance with good journalistic practice to see to it that the publishing does not cause undue suffering for the person in question or for his or her relatives.",

The domestic courts found that the publication of J.\u2019s name did not strengthen the applicant\u2019s journalistic message nor was it well-founded in any other way. His name was mentioned about 50 times and was thus not a mistake. J.\u2019s name had not been disclosed in any other publication.

The published information consisted of facts only, but the information given was very detailed. This information fell thus within the scope of protection of J.\u2019s private life. Moreover, the publication of this private information took place before J. was convicted. The published article reached about 100 readers in J.\u2019s home town and about 25,000 readers in the whole country. The potential damage to J.\u2019s reputation was thus not limited. As to the sanctions imposed on the applicant, the issue of civil liability of the applicant was still pending before the Court of Appeal and the issue of proportionality of this sanction could thus not yet be assessed.

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may entail excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are a question of practice (see Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 30 and, mutatis mutandis, Kokkinakis v.

Even though there was no precise definition of private life in the preparatory works (see government bills HE 84/1974 and HE 184/1999), these works mentioned that the necessity of mentioning a person\u2019s name or other description of a person enabling identification was always subject to careful consideration.

Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention, it is applicable not only to \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cideas\u201d that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d. This freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in Article 10 \u00a7 2 which must, however, be strictly construed. The need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, for example, Lingens v. , 8 July 1986, \u00a7 41, Series A no. 103, and Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no.\u00a023118/93, \u00a7 43, ECHR 1999-VIII).",

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a \u201crestriction\u201d is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Janowski v.

Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart \u2013 in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities \u2013 information and ideas on all matters of public interest (see Jersild, cited above, \u00a7 31; De Haes and Gijsels v.

This duty extends to the reporting and commenting on court proceedings which, provided that they do not overstep the bounds set out above, contribute to their publicity and are thus consonant with the requirement under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that hearings be public (see Egeland and Hanseid v. Norway, no. 34438/04, \u00a7 49, 16 April 2009). Not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas, the public also has a right to receive them (see, Sunday Times v. the  (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7 65). In addition, the Court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v.

The concept of private life covers personal information which individuals can legitimately expect should not be published without their consent and includes elements relating to a person\u2019s right to their image. The publication of a photograph thus falls within the scope of private life (see Von Hannover v. Germany, no.\u00a059320/00, \u00a7\u00a7 50-53 and 59, ECHR 2004-VI).",

Austria, no. 34315/96, \u00a7\u00a7 33 et seq., 26\u00a0February 2002). The Court thus found, in one case, that the use of certain terms in relation to an individual\u2019s private life was not \u201cjustified by considerations of public concern\u201d and that those terms did not \u201c[bear] on a matter of general importance\u201d (see Tammer, cited above, \u00a7 68) and went on to hold that there had not been a violation of Article 10. In another case, however, the Court attached particular importance to the fact that the subject in question was a news item of \u201cmajor public concern\u201d and that the published photographs \u201cdid not disclose any details of [the] private life\u201d of the person in question (see Krone Verlag GmbH & Co. KG, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037) and held that there had been a violation of Article 10. In a group of Finnish cases the Court found that a private person could, by her behaviour, be taken to have entered the public domain and that the disclosure of her identity in a newspaper report had a direct bearing on matters of public interest (see Flinkkil\u00e4 and Others v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 83 and 85; Tuomela and Others v. , no. 25711/04, \u00a7\u00a7 56 and 58, 6 April 2010; Jokitaipale and Others v. , no. 43349/05, \u00a7\u00a7 71 and 73, 6\u00a0April\u00a02010; Soila v. , no. 6806/06, \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 70, 6 April 2010; and Iltalehti and Karhuvaara v. , no. 6372/06, \u00a7\u00a7 60 and 62, 6 April 2010).
