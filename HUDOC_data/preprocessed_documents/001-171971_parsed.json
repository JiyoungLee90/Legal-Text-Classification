The President considered that the decisions had been unlawful from the beginning as the prerequisites for either entitlement had never been met and that the applicant could not legitimately rely on these decisions being maintained, as he had obtained them by giving information that was substantially incorrect. Referring to Section 16 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Rehabilitation Act, he observed that the applicant, contrary to the statements in his applications, had worked as a secret informant for the Ministry of State Security and had produced at least five reports for the Ministry in which he put at real risk the persons on whom he had informed.",

His father had returned, incapacitated for work, from Soviet captivity only in 1947 or 1948. While serving in the police forces he had not been aware of working for other government agencies. The written commitment to the state security service might have been dictated to him when he was under the influence of alcohol but he had no memory of it whatsoever.

Acknowledging that in a dictatorship which lasted for decades, minor involvement with the regime was frequent, it considered that the applicant\u2019s position as a secret informant of the state security service did not itself suffice to trigger the application of that provision. However, compensation provided under the Act was intended to benefit innocent victims only, but not those who had also participated in offences contrary to the principles of humanity and which were harmful to others or at least put them at risk. This could be assumed when a secret informant voluntarily reported on others and the reports could potentially cause persecution by the state security service. In that case compensation payments were ruled out, no matter how great the offender\u2019s own suffering had been. The courts were not to compare the extent of suffering involved.",

Furthermore, the five reports mentioned in the decision of the President of the Regional Court, as well as two more reports were capable of putting in danger the persons informed on. The applicant mainly reported on their contacts with West Germany and West Berlin. An intention to leave the former GDR without permission, in particular, could have led to severe criminal persecution of the persons involved. The reports were not meaningless but contained valuable information for the state security service. The applicant\u2019s claim that some reports were unknown to him and factually incorrect and that he did not recognise the names of the superior officers was irrelevant to the Regional Court\u2019s decision.",

Other aspects had not been relevant for the Regional Court because domestic law neither required the matter to be balanced against the applicant\u2019s personal life history, nor was it a prerequisite under Section 16 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Rehabilitation Act that one of the persons on whom the applicant had informed suffered any disadvantage as a result of his reports. Likewise, his economic and personal circumstances as submitted to the Regional Court were not of any relevance.

The impugned decision to revoke the previous granting of compensation does not concern the applicant\u2019s criminal rehabilitation as such. The Regional Court\u2019s decision of 8 February 1994 to annul the 1958 judgment (see paragraph 7\u00a0above) was not affected. The Court has already decided that when a person faces an interference with his or her means of subsistence and is claiming an individual, economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute this must be considered \u201ccivil\u201d in the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Salesi v.\u00a0Italy, 26 February 1993, \u00a7 19, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0257E). This also applies to individual compensation claims for injustices suffered under a former regime (Wos v. Poland (dec.), no.\u00a022860/02, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2005IV, concerning a victim of Nazi persecution). The aim of the applicant\u2019s request for judicial review was to receive further compensation for his criminal persecution under the former GDR\u2019s rule and to keep the amounts already received. He was granted a pension according to Section 17a of the Criminal Rehabilitation Act (see Relevant domestic law and practice, paragraph\u00a022 above). Regard being had in particular to the eligibility criteria of a claimant\u2019s financial difficulties, the Court is thus satisfied that the right in question was \u201ccivil\u201d in character, in the autonomous sense of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention.",

By rendering the administration of justice transparent, an oral hearing in public contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 \u00a7 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Mehmet Emin \u015eim\u015fek v.

This does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases (see Miller v.\u00a0Sweden, no. 55853/00, \u00a7 29, 8 February 2005).

That court found the applicant\u2019s claim that he had believed to be reporting to regular police forces not to be credible as the former GDR\u2019s authorities file on the applicant contained a handwritten statement in which he committed to the state security service to serve as a secret informant. Considering the facts to be sufficiently established, the court found no reason to investigate the case further or to call witnesses. It did not consider hearing the applicant in person to be necessary because he had not submitted circumstances indicating that he committed himself to the state security service under insupportable pressure. The Court notes that the present case thus differs from the case decided by the Brandenburg Constitutional Court (see paragraph 29 above), in which the claimant was denied an opportunity to explain in person a situation of insupportable pressure merely because his submissions had not been supported by evidence from the files of the state security service.",

The Court notes that according to the caselaw of certain domestic courts, including the Federal Administrative Court, concerning Section 16 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Rehabilitation Act (see Relevant domestic law and practice, paragraphs 23 and 24 above), the applicant\u2019s own suffering was not to be weighed against the risk to which he had exposed others. Therefore, the details of the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty had no bearing. Likewise, according to the case-law of the domestic courts, neither the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances at the relevant time nor the question whether any of the persons on whom the applicant had reported actually suffered disadvantages, were relevant aspects for the application of the said provision. Hence, even if the domestic courts had assumed the applicant\u2019s factual submissions in this respect to be true, they would not have drawn different conclusions (compare Pursiheimo v.\u00a0Finland (dec.), no. 57795/00, 25 November 2003; compare and contrast \u00d6zata v. Turkey, no. 19578/02, \u00a7 36, 20 October 2005).",
