However, this cannot be said with regard to the present case because, as appears from the available documents, the local city administration did not take an effective part in the impugned proceedings, the submissions, if any, by the applicant\u2019s family members did not vary and the number of witnesses was not particularly large. The Court further points out that some applicant\u2019s claims in the case depended on the outcome of others (a claim for non-pecuniary damages) and, therefore, the courts, having dismissed the latter, did not go into the merits of the former. Lastly, the forensic examination and on-site inspections, as mentioned in the court decisions, seem to have been completed before the first judgment in the case was taken. Accordingly, the Court comes to the conclusion that the case before the domestic authorities was not particularly complex.",

Therefore, it considers that the delay in the proceedings was mainly caused by the repeated re-examinations of the case. Although the Court is not in a position to analyse the quality of the case-law of the domestic courts, it observes that, since remittal is usually ordered because of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency in the judicial system (see Wierciszewska v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7\u00a046, 25\u00a0November\u00a02003).",
