On 23 June 2007 the investigator decided to suspend the criminal proceedings until the perpetrators had been identified.

However, in the present case, the applicant\u2019s allegation that he had been attacked by a police officer from the Yasamal District Police Office was examined by an investigator who was also from the Yasamal District Police Office, and who took the decision to suspend the criminal proceedings concerning the attack on the applicant. The applicant\u2019s complaint was therefore examined by the police office where the agent who had allegedly committed the offence was based. In the Court\u2019s view, an investigation by the police into an allegation of misconduct by its one of own officers could not be independent in these circumstances (see Layijov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055).",

The investigator also failed to question the applicant\u2019s colleagues as witnesses in connection with the attack. No explanation was provided by the Government as to why the domestic authorities failed to take these investigative steps. Moreover, although the applicant argued that he had been attacked by the police officer N.R., in his letter of 13 June 2007 the investigator informed the applicant that it had not been established that he had been attacked by the police officer N.N.

In this connection, the Court notes that only ten days after the beginning of the investigation, the Minister of Internal Affairs described the attack on the applicant as sabotage, alleging that it had been organised by the applicant himself (see paragraph 19 above). The Court considers that this statement by the Minister of Internal Affairs, who was also the hierarchical superior of the investigator in charge of the investigation, shows that during the investigation the domestic authorities were more concerned with proving the lack of involvement of a State agent in the attack on the applicant than with discovering the truth about the circumstances of that attack. In particular, it does not appear that adequate steps were taken during the investigation to investigate the possibility that the attack could have been linked to the applicant\u2019s work as a journalist. On the contrary it appears that the responsible authorities had already discarded that possibility in the early stages of the investigation and with insufficient reason (compare Gongadze v. Ukraine, no. 34056/02, \u00a7\u00a0179, ECHR\u00a02005XI, and Adal\u0131 v. Turkey, no.\u00a038187/97, \u00a7 231, 31 March 2005).",

The Court also reiterates that the key importance of freedom of expression as one of the preconditions for a functioning democracy is such that the genuine, effective exercise of this freedom is not dependent merely on the State\u2019s duty not to interfere, but may call for positive measures of protection, even in the sphere of relations between individuals (see \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem v. Turkey, no. 23144/93, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000III).
