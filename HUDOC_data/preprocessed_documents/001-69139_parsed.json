The applicant also drew attention to the fact that, according to the autopsy report of 9\u00a0April 1994, rigor mortis had not yet set in. This indicated that the three men had been killed less than 24 hours before; the men had thus been in the hands of their captors for four days before they had been killed.

It is inherent in proceedings relating to cases of this nature, where an individual applicant accuses State agents of violating his rights under the Convention, that in certain instances solely the respondent Government have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. A failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 70, ECHR 2000VI).

The Court finds it established that Necati Ayd\u0131n remained in the custody of the State. It follows that the Government\u2019s obligation is engaged to explain how Necati Ayd\u0131n was killed while still in the hands of State agents. Given that no such explanation has been put forward by the Government, the Court concludes that the Government have failed to account for the killing of Necati Ayd\u0131n.",

The deliberate or intended use of lethal force is only one factor, however, to be taken into account in assessing its necessity. Any use of force must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c).

There they met with the Chief Public Prosecutor Bekir Sel\u00e7uk who told them that Necati might have gone to join the PKK. Having regard to the credible and consistent testimonies given by these two lawyers to the Commission\u2019s delegates (see paragraphs 91-97 and 98-100 above), the Court sees no reason to doubt the veracity of their statements. The Court notes, however, that Mr Sel\u00e7uk told the delegates that he did not remember meeting with the lawyers (see paragraph 106 above). The Court has serious doubts as to the reliability of this witness, whose statement to the delegates was evasive. The Court is, moreover, disconcerted by the nature of some of the opinions expressed by him. In this context the Court would in particular point to his comments concerning acquittals by a court of law merely reflecting the personal opinion of judges (see paragraph 105 above) and his remark that civil servants who were suspected of having links with the PKK, but against whom there was no evidence, would be relocated (see paragraph\u00a0107 above). The Court finds that these disturbing comments from a senior public prosecutor reflect an abject disregard for the principle of the rule of law.",
