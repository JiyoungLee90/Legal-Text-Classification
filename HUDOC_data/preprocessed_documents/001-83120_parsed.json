The applicant further complained that the medical assistance provided to him had been insufficient since the doctor had only prescribed him painkillers and had not made any further examinations. His request that an X-ray examination be carried out at his own expense had been refused. On 23 March 2006 the  judge responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the applicant's appeal on the ground that the decision to place the applicant under the \u201cclosed prison regime\u201d had been based in law and was a consequence of his conduct, which had endangered the order and security in the prison.

The judge instructed the applicant to firstly make his complaints to the prison administration.

It follows that the applicant could have addressed his complaints to any of these authorities. In fact, he chose to address his complaints to a judge responsible for the execution of sentences. In the Court's view this choice was in conformity with the domestic legislation. However, the judge did not institute any proceedings upon the applicant's complaint nor did he issue a decision upon it. Instead, he replied to the applicant by letters, the first of 24\u00a0September 2004 and the second of 8 November 2004.

The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 16\u00a0September\u00a01996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, pp.\u00a01210-11, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a065 and 68).",

In the Government's opinion that was sufficient and the applicant's allegations about the dirty sheets were therefore also unfounded. As to the food provided, the applicant's complaint was of a general nature and unsubstantiated. The Government asserted that the food was prepared according to a normal diet. A representative of prisoners was included in drawing up the menu. There had been no complaints from other inmates about the food quality and therefore the applicant's complaint in that connection was also unfounded. As regards toiletries, the Government acknowledged that these had not been provided to the applicant. However, during his stay in Unit 1 of Gospi\u0107 Prison he had worked and received some income, and therefore had been able to purchase the necessary toiletries. As to the applicant's general complaints about the lack of adequate medical care in prison, the Government submitted that a doctor had been on call every day. As to the applicant's specific allegations that he had not received adequate medical assistance for his injury, the Government emphasised that the medical records submitted showed that the applicant had been seen by a doctor on the same day and adequate treatment had been prescribed. The doctor had seen the applicant again the very next day and three days after the incident the applicant had been sent to a hospital to be examined by a specialist. On that occasion an X-ray examination had also been carried out and it had showed no fractures.",

However, according to the Court's case law, the indications so afforded by the national law have only relative value; the very nature of the offence is a factor of greater importance (see Campbell and Fell, cited above, p. 36, \u00a7\u00a071).",

Firstly, some matters may be more serious than others. Secondly, the illegality of some acts may not turn on the fact that they were committed in prison: certain conduct which constitutes a disciplinary offence may also amount to an offence under the criminal law. In the circumstance of the present case, it corresponds to a crime of drug abuse under Article 173 of the Croatian Penal Code which comprises also mere possession of the illegal drugs.",
