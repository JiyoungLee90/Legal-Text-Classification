P.J. and M.A., as well as S.H. and V.V., who had been eyewitnesses to the incident of 17 September 2004, were also interviewed. On the basis of evidence obtained from them, the DCPS established that the applicant had used offensive language against P.J. and M.A., had resisted arrest, and had bitten M.A. on the right thumb. As regards the force used against him, the report noted that this had concerned the twisting of his arms and the use of handcuffs, which, as determined by a superior in the Ministry, had been necessary and justified. Accordingly, the DCPS concluded that the police officers concerned had acted in accordance with the law and the rules of the Ministry.",

The Ministry alleged that the applicant, after receiving a parking ticket, had started following the police car, sounding his horn and flashing his lights. After the police car had stopped, he had approached it and started insulting the police officers and kicking the car. The applicant did not comply with the orders of the police officers to calm down, and actively resisted when they tried to arrest him. The applicant also bit M.A. on the right thumb, which was a serious bodily injury. In respect of the thumb injury a medical report of 17 September 2004, signed by Dr M.D., was attached to the criminal complaint.",

Despite the serious nature of the applicant\u2019s allegations and the medical reports confirming his injuries, which were brought to the attention of the public prosecutor, the latter does not appear to have taken any serious steps to secure the evidence after the incident. Besides seeking information from the Skopje Clinic regarding some of the applicant\u2019s injuries (see paragraphs 42 and 45 above), he did not summon the applicant and the accused, or any other third person who could have provided relevant information regarding the case, notwithstanding that he had explicit authority in this respect (see paragraph\u00a076 above). The public prosecutor rejected the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint for lack of evidence that the accused had committed the imputed crimes. This decision was based to a decisive extent, on the evidence provided by the police, namely the DCPS\u2019s evaluation report of the force used against the applicant (see paragraph 46 above).",

During that investigation and the ensuing trial, the accused officers, the applicant, his wife and son were examined, and an independent medical expert examination was ordered. In this respect, the Court is satisfied with the diligence displayed by the investigating judge. However, it cannot lose sight of the fact that these proceedings were a result of the applicant\u2019s determination to pursue the charges against the officers. Although the applicant was in a position to take over the prosecution of the officers during the criminal proceedings, the public prosecutor remained passive. The Court observes that during the proceedings the trial court invited the public prosecutor on three occasions to take over the prosecution, given that the charges concerned aggravated bodily harm, which was subject to State prosecution (see paragraphs 50, 53 and 59 above). On each occasion the public prosecutor refused explicitly to take over the prosecution. In this connection the Court would emphasise that victims of alleged violations are not required to pursue the prosecution of State agents on their own. This is a duty of the public prosecutor, who is better placed in that respect (see Kitanovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 15191/12, \u00a7\u00a090, 22 January 2015). The judicial investigation initiated upon the applicant\u2019s complaint cannot justify the public prosecutor\u2019s lack of action (see, mutatis mutandis, Butolen v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 41356/08, \u00a7 77, 26 April 2012).",

That decision was delivered over four years after the applicant had instituted the proceedings. It was based on a statement in which, as noted in the court record of 24 March 2009 (see paragraph 60 above), the applicant withdrew the charges against the police officers accused. However, the Court notes that with separate submissions of 25 and 26 March 2009, the applicant contested before the trial court the assertion that he had withdrawn the indictment, and argued that he had requested instead that the prosecution should be taken over by the public prosecutor. Given the applicant\u2019s earlier requests in this respect (see paragraphs 50, 53 and 59 above), such an interpretation does not appear unreasonable. He also sought the reinstatement of the proceedings and for the trial court to continue examining his case. Similarly, in the appeal against the trial court\u2019s decision the applicant argued that the trial judge had misinterpreted his statement, and sought a remedy from the higher court for this alleged error. In such circumstances, the Court cannot agree with the Government that the applicant\u2019s statement noted in the court record of 24 March 2009 contained an explicit and unqualified declaration by which he had withdrawn the indictment (see paragraph 83 above). The actions that the applicant took immediately after the trial court had stayed the proceedings clearly demonstrated his intention to continue with the proceedings (see, by converse implication, Don\u010dev and Burgov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 30265/09, \u00a7 57, 12 June 2014). That the proceedings were stayed under somewhat unclear circumstances, coupled with the unreasonable time that elapsed in the proceedings before the trial court (unlike the proceedings against the applicant, see paragraphs 19 and 34 above), suggest that the authorities did not submit the applicant\u2019s case to the careful scrutiny required by Article 3 of the Convention (see Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran v. Turkey, no. 42942/02, \u00a7 62, 8 April 2008).",
