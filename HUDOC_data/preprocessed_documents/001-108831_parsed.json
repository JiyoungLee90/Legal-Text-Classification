It has been the Court\u2019s constant position that a person who has obtained a judgment against the State may not be expected to bring separate enforcement proceedings (see Metaxas v. Greece, no. 8415/02, \u00a7 19, 27 May 2004). In such cases, the  authority must be duly noti\ufb01ed of the judgment and is thus well placed to take all necessary initiatives to comply with it or to transmit it to another competent State authority responsible for execution. This is particularly relevant in a situation where, in view of the complexities and possible overlapping of the execution and enforcement procedures, an applicant may have reasonable doubts about which authority is responsible for the execution or enforcement of the judgment (see Akashev v. Russia, no.\u00a030616/05, \u00a7\u00a021, 12 June 2008, and Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a068).

Russia, no. 69306/01, \u00a7\u00a032, 20 October 2005) Accordingly, it is not unreasonable that the authorities request the applicant to produce additional documents, such as bank details, to allow or speed up the execution of a judgment (see, mutatis mutandis, Kosmidis and Kosmidou v. Greece, no. 32141/04, \u00a7 24, 8 November 2007, and Burdov\u00a0(no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 69). The creditor\u2019s uncooperative behaviour may be an obstacle to timely enforcement of a judgment, thus alleviating the authorities\u2019 responsibility for delays (see Belayev v. Russia (dec.), 36020/02, 22 March 2011). The requirement of the creditor\u2019s cooperation must not, however, go beyond what is strictly necessary and, in any event, does not relieve the authorities of their obligation under the Convention to take timely action of their own motion, on the basis of the information available to them, with a view to honouring the judgment against the State (see Akashev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a022, and Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 69).",

It thus systematically found that the time taken by the authorities to comply with a judgment should be calculated from the moment on which it became final and enforceable until the moment when the judicial award was paid to the applicant (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a073). Thus, the Court did not accept, for instance, the State\u2019s attempts to justify the enforcement delays by an erroneous transmission of the writ of execution by one authority to another (see Akashev, cited above, \u00a7 19-20). Nor was the applicant to blame for successive transmissions of the writ of execution to various State authorities after fruitless attempts to secure the respondent\u2019s voluntary compliance with the judgment (Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 75).",

It must first and foremost ascertain the existence of the State\u2019s responsibility for non-enforcement of the judgments in a situation where the applicants, since 2000 and 2008 respectively, have not taken any steps to recover the judgment debts. The Government argued that the applicants\u2019 failure to comply with the necessary formalities made it impossible for the State to pay the judicial awards.",

As it has already mentioned above, the submission by the creditor of bank details appears as a necessary and reasonable step required from the applicant (see paragraph 22 above). As to the certified copy of the judgment, the Court has already found that the  authority intervenes as a party in court proceedings and must automatically receive the original text of the judgment from the domestic court itself (see paragraph 21 above). The Court does not discern, therefore, any need for the applicant to assist the State authorities in obtaining a duly certified copy of the judgment for a second time.",

The Court observes that Article\u00a0242.1 of the Budget Code makes it possible for a successful litigant to request the trial court to forward the writ of execution directly to the competent State authority. In the Court\u2019s understanding, this option was meant to facilitate and accelerate the payment of judicial awards by the State. If, however, the applicant for any reason obtains himself the writ of execution from the trial court, it would appear logical, in the Court\u2019s view, to require that he submits it to the competent authority with a view to enforcement of the judgment.",

Finally, they neither elucidated their position before the Court, nor pointed to any valid circumstance preventing or dispensing them from complying with the enforcement procedure.",

The behaviour of the second applicant was also objectionable in the Court\u2019s view. On 23 December 2008, that is two months after the judgment in his favour became final, the Legal Department of the Ministry of Finance sent him a letter setting out a list of the documents that should be provided for recovery of the judicial award (see paragraph 11 above). The applicant, however, did not react at all.",

In the absence of any explanation from the applicants, the Government\u2019s assumption that they had deliberately withheld the writs of execution for several years does not appear unfounded. In the Court\u2019s view, the present situation strikingly differs from that observed in virtually all other non-enforcement cases decided against , in which the applicants took the necessary steps with a view to payment of the judicial awards by the State.",
