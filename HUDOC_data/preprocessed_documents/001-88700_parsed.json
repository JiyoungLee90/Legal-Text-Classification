Firstly, after the commencement of the handwriting examination on 17 December 2002 it took the domestic court three months to send the case to an expert body. The advance payment was made by the applicant as soon as he was informed about this requirement. Secondly, it took the domestic court almost three months to prepare the final text of the judgment of 24 June 2003 which prevented the applicant from lodging his appeal earlier. Further, after the quashing of the judgment of 24 June 2003 on appeal on 2 October 2003 it took the domestic court four months (until 3 February 2004) to fix the new hearing of the case. Thirdly, the final text of the subsequent judgment of 25 July 2005 was prepared only in October 2005, and the applicant could not lodge his appeal until then. Further, the appeal hearing against the judgment of 25 July 2005 initially scheduled for 19 January 2006 did not take place until 4 April 2006 due to the failure on the part of the domestic court to inform the defendants of the contents of his appeal. Therefore, over eight months elapsed before the appeal hearing did take place. Finally, in reply to the Government\u2019s argument about the fact that the applicant appealed against the decisions of the District Court and thus contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings, the applicant submitted that he was free to exercise his procedural rights. Besides, as a result of his appeal the judgment of 24 June 2003 was found unlawful.",

As to the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant contributed to the delay in the proceedings by appealing against the judgments of the District Court, the Court reiterates that an applicant cannot be blamed for taking full advantage of the resources afforded by national law in the defence of his interests (see Angelova v. Russia, no. 33820/04, \u00a7 44, 13 December 2007).",

The Court notes, however, that on many occasions the inquiries were made with the same bodies (some of them having defendant status in the proceedings) on the same subject, both when the case was examined by the District Court for the first time and for the second time after its quashing on appeal by the City Court. The Court also notes that the State bodies in question were not particularly diligent in supplying the domestic court with the requested information, and the domestic court did not avail itself of the measures available to it under national law to discipline the participants to the proceedings and to ensure that the case was heard within a reasonable time (see Sokolov v. Russia, no. 3734/02, \u00a7 40, 22\u00a0September 2005).",

Further, it took the domestic court three months to prepare the final text of the judgment of 24 June 2003 and another three months to prepare the final text of the subsequent judgment of 25 July 2005, the first judgment being two pages long and the second four pages long. After the quashing of the judgment of 24 June 2003 on appeal on 2 October 2003 it took the domestic court four months (until 3 February 2004) to fix the new hearing of the case. Besides, a four-month delay occurred from 17\u00a0September 2004, when the domestic court again suspended the proceedings until 26 November 2004 when following the applicant\u2019s request the above decision was found unlawful. Finally, six months elapsed from October 2005 when the applicant appealed against the judgment of 25\u00a0July 2005 until the examination of the case on appeal on 4 April 2006. The delay of all of the above amounted to almost three and a half years.",
