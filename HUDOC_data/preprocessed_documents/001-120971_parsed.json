The report was also submitted to the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow. According to the report, on 7 and 13\u00a0December 2010 the second applicant had been questioned as a witness in a criminal case against a number of Tajikistani nationals. On 18 May 2011 officer Z. received an order to establish the whereabouts of the second applicant as she was absent from her registered place of residence and, if found, to hand her the summons for questioning on 19 May 2011 in connection with the same criminal case. On the latter date at approximately 9 a.m. officer Z. together with officer L. arrived at the second applicant\u2019s then current residence. They called her on the telephone, but as nobody answered they remained in the car waiting for her at the entrance to the block of flats. At approximately 9.12 a.m. the second applicant left the block of flats. The two officers then approached her, introduced themselves and presented their certificates attesting to their status as FSB officers. At the same time they explained that they were required to serve the summons for questioning on her and presented her with the summons. The second applicant refused to either take it or sign the document to that effect, stating that at a legal advice centre she had been advised not to sign any documents in the absence of her lawyer. Officer Z. then read out the summons, informing her that she had been summoned for questioning on 19 May 2011 at 9 a.m. and reminded the second applicant that she had previously been questioned in relation to this case and had the investigator\u2019s telephone number. Therefore, she could call him and verify the summons. He also reminded her that it was her duty to appear for questioning and that she could otherwise be subjected to coercive measures. She replied that she was not trying to avoid questioning, but she was not going to make it in time for 9 a.m. Officer Z. then suggested that she call the investigator and arrange another time. She agreed to do that; however, she again refused to accept the summons, explaining that she would appear on a different date and answer all questions put to her. In the second applicant\u2019s presence officer Z. then noted on the summons her refusal to accept it and the time of the refusal. After that he and officer L. got back into the car. However, the second applicant then approached them and said that she would not call the investigator to arrange another time if they could give her a lift to the questioning session. They agreed to do so. Officer Z. was driving, officer L. was in the front passenger seat while the second applicant was in the back seat by herself. Her freedom was not restricted in any way, and during the journey she was talking on a mobile phone and sending text messages. She did not show any anxiety concerning the questioning and did not make any requests, such as to contact her lawyer or her family. After they arrived at the FSB\u2019s premises, the second applicant reported to the investigator, who invited her for questioning. Later on that date they received additional information to the effect that the second applicant had been placed on an international wanted list. After the second applicant\u2019s questioning, some time after 2.45 p.m., officer Z. informed the investigator and the second applicant of that new information. The second applicant stated that she was aware of the fact. Officer Z. then contacted the Meshchanskiy District Office of the Interior, where he handed over procedural documents received from the Tajikistani authorities. The second applicant was escorted to the Office of the Interior in order for it to proceed with her detention. In the evening of 19 May 2011 officer Z. met with E., who presented herself as the second applicant\u2019s lawyer and said that she had submitted complaints concerning the FSB officers\u2019 actions before the Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Meshchanskiy District Court.",

The court noted in this respect that under Article 125 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure it was only possible to challenge before a court the actions of officers who had carried out operational and search activities if those officers had acted on the instructions of an investigator or investigating body. In the present case, according to the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow, investigator G. had never instructed the FSB officers to arrest the second applicant and take her to the Moscow Department of the FSB\u2019s premises, and therefore the lawfulness of their actions could not be reviewed under Article 125 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure.

According to the Government, it was received by the court \u201cshortly\u201d before the hearing on appeal. According to the second applicant, it was received by the court on 26 July 2011. In her statement of appeal, which was one-and-a-half pages long, the second applicant pointed out that deprivation of liberty should be applied as a preventive measure only exceptionally, and that she had to take care of her three minor children.",

The Plenary reiterated that any party to criminal proceedings or other person whose rights and freedoms were affected by the actions or inaction of the investigating or prosecuting authorities in criminal proceedings could use Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to challenge a refusal to institute criminal proceedings or a decision to terminate them. The Plenary stated that whilst the bulk of decisions amenable to judicial review under Article 125 also included decisions to institute criminal proceedings, refusals to admit a defence counsel or to grant victim status, a person could not rely on Article\u00a0125 to challenge a court\u2019s decision to apply bail or house arrest or to remand a person in custody. It was further stressed that in declaring a specific action or inaction of a law enforcement authority unlawful or unjustified, a judge was not entitled to annul the impugned decision or to oblige the official responsible to annul it but could only ask him or her to rectify the shortcomings indicated. Should the authority concerned fail to comply with the court\u2019s instructions, an interested party could complain to a court about the authority\u2019s inaction and the court could issue a special ruling (\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435), drawing the authority\u2019s attention to the situation. Lastly, the decision stated that a prosecutor\u2019s decision to place a person under house arrest or to remand him/her in custody with a view to extradition could be appealed against to a court under Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

The judicial authorisation of remand in custody in that situation was to be carried out in accordance with Article 108 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and following a prosecutor\u2019s petition to place that person in custody. In deciding to remand the person in custody the court was to examine if there existed factual and legal grounds for applying the preventive measure. If the extradition request was accompanied by a detention order of a foreign court, the prosecutor was competent to remand the person in custody without the authorisation of a Russian court (Article 466 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) for a period not exceeding two months, and the prosecutor\u2019s decision could be challenged in the courts under Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

However, the Committee expresses concern that the lack of clarity on when the person is considered to be detained under this law (article 91.1) leaves detainees without basic legal safeguards for the period between arrest and official acknowledgement of detention. It has been reported that, in practice and in the majority of cases, detainees are not afforded the rights of timely access to a lawyer and an independent doctor, notification of family members, and other legal guarantees to ensure their protection from torture. In particular, the Committee is concerned by numerous allegations regarding the failure of police officials to keep accurate records of all periods of deprivation of liberty; to register suspects within three hours of arrival at the police station; to adhere to the 72-hour time limit for releasing or transferring suspects from a police station to pre-trial detention facilities; and to notify family members of transfers of detainees from one place of deprivation of liberty to another. Furthermore, it is concerned that article 111-1 of the CPC allows judges to authorize pre-trial detention solely based on the gravity of the alleged crime committed, and that it can be extended up to 18 months[.]",

The Russian courts had examined the first applicant at the hearing and had studied the relevant materials; the first applicant\u2019s lawyer had also been given an opportunity to present his position in the case.

The Court further notes that the Moscow City Court specifically stated that when deciding on the first applicant\u2019s extradition it would not discuss the issue of his guilt. When the issue was brought up on appeal before the Supreme Court of Russia, in its decision of 6 December 2011 it found no evidence that the first-instance court had considered the issue of the first applicant\u2019s guilt and emphasised that the latter court had expressly stated that this had not been its task.

It notes that both the first-instance and appeal courts specifically emphasised that the issue of the first applicant\u2019s guilt in respect of the offences he had been charged with in  was not within their competence. The Court is thus satisfied that the Moscow City Court was referring not to the question of whether the first applicant\u2019s guilt had been established by the evidence \u2013 which was clearly not the issue to be determined in the extradition proceedings \u2013 but to whether there were legal grounds for extraditing the first applicant to the requesting country (see Gaforov, cited above, \u00a7 213).

She averred that the fact of her unacknowledged detention was corroborated by the following: (i) the absence of her signature on either the summons or the transcript of the questioning session on 19 May 2011; (ii) the lack of any explanation next to her refusal to sign these documents, whereas according to domestic law the person refusing to sign the transcript should be given an opportunity to give reasons for their refusal; (iii) the wording of the transcript of the questioning session conducted on 19\u00a0May 2011 was identical to that of the transcript of the questioning session performed on 13\u00a0December 2010, which in the second applicant\u2019s view proved that no questioning had actually taken place on 19 May 2011; (iv) the first applicant\u2019s statement to the effect that during his questioning as a witness on 19 May 2011 he had been told that in the event of his refusal to sign certain statements his wife would be put in jail (see paragraph 55 above). The second applicant also pointed out certain alleged inconsistencies in the reports of the FSB officers (see paragraphs\u00a057-58 above). In the first place, in her view it would have been illogical for her to have refused to sign the summons and have then asked the FSB officers to give her a lift. In addition, the reference to the provisions on coercive measures made no sense if the authorities claimed that she had gotten into the car of her own free will. Furthermore, in any event the summons had not been handed out to her in advance, as required by the applicable procedural rules. Moreover, assuming that she had been put on a wanted list in 2006, she considered it implausible that the authorities were not aware of this in December 2010 when the first questioning of her had taken place. The second applicant maintained that the above constituted irrefutable evidence that between 9 a.m. and 7.30 p.m. she had been under the control of the authorities, and that her detention had been arbitrary and in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1.",

Furthermore, although the domestic courts left the second applicant\u2019s complaint of her having been forcibly brought to the premises of the Moscow Department of the FSB on 19 May 2011 without examination on procedural grounds, the Moscow City Court in its decision of 1\u00a0August\u00a02011 established that the FSB officers had served the summons on the second applicant and then, upon her request, \u201chad given her a lift in their car\u201d to the Moscow Department of the FSB\u2019s premises.

The Court reiterates that in order to determine whether there has been a deprivation of liberty, the starting point must be the actual situation of the individual concerned and account must be taken of a whole range of factors arising in a particular case such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question. The distinction between deprivation of, and a restriction upon, liberty is merely one of degree or intensity and not one of nature or substance. Although the process of classification into one or the other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the Court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of Article 5 depends (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, \u00a7\u00a7 92 and 93, and H.L. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a045508/99, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2004-IX).

The Convention organs have held that this obligation should not be given a wide interpretation. It has to be specific and concrete, and the arrest and detention must be truly necessary for the purpose of ensuring its fulfilment. Moreover, in assessing whether the deprivation of liberty is justified, a fair balance has to be drawn between the significance in a democratic society of securing the fulfilment of the obligation in issue and the importance of the right to liberty. The relevant factors in drawing this balance are the nature and the purpose of the obligation, the detained person, the specific circumstances which led to his or her detention, and the length of the detention (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 69 in limine, Series A no. 22; McVeigh and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 8022/77, 8025/77 and 8027/77, Commission\u2019s report of 18 March 1981, DR 25, pp. 3743, \u00a7\u00a7 16896; Vasileva v.

Furthermore, from the fact that her lawyer was present at the drawing up of the record of arrest, it follows that she was able to contact the latter (see, by contrast, Farhad Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, no. 37138/06, \u00a7 165, 9 November 2010). Secondly, the second applicant\u2019s detention as a preventive measure was ordered by the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow on 20 May 2011. Therefore, in any event, less than forty-eight hours elapsed between the actual time of the second applicant\u2019s arrest at 2.35 p.m. on 19 May 2011 and the court\u2019s ordering her detention (see, by contrast, Farhad Aliyev, cited above, \u00a7 166). Taking into account the above elements, the Court considers that, regrettable as it is, the authorities\u2019 failure to accurately indicate the time of the second applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty in the record of arrest did not entail a breach of procedural guarantees against arbitrary detention.",

It is in the first place for the national authorities, and notably the courts, to interpret domestic law, and in particular, rules of a procedural nature (see Toshev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a056308/00, \u00a7 58, 10 August 2006). The words \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 do not merely refer back to domestic law; they also relate to the quality of this law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2002-IV). Quality in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible and precise, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see, among others, Dougoz v.

Such a complaint had constituted an effective remedy, as it had been within the competence of the court to order her release should her detention have been found to be unlawful. The Government referred to an example from domestic practice where a court had ordered the release of a person detained pending extradition because the prosecutor\u2019s detention order had been found to be unlawful. Accordingly, in the Government\u2019s view, the remedies available had complied with Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. Furthermore, according to the Government, if it had been established that the second applicant had been unlawfully subjected to preventive measures on 19 May 2011, she would have been entitled to compensation under Article 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The second applicant\u2019s appeal against the order of 20 May 2011 had been examined by the Moscow City Court during the hearing on 8 June 2011, which was clear from the transcript of the hearing. That court\u2019s examination of her appeal had not been mentioned in the decision of 8 June 2011 due to a clerical mistake. The second applicant\u2019s appeal against the order of 13 July 2011 had only reached the Meshchanskiy District Court shortly before the appeal hearing, and the Moscow City Court had not had any information about it having been submitted. Accordingly, the court had only examined the appeal submitted by the second applicant\u2019s lawyer. Her lawyer, who had been present at the hearing, had not informed the court of the existence of another statement of appeal.",

She averred that the domestic courts had failed to properly examine her complaint concerning her allegedly unacknowledged detention between 9 a.m. and 7.30\u00a0p.m. on 19 May 2011. She also argued that Article 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure could not be considered an effective remedy as it only provided for the right to redress, including compensation of pecuniary damage, in respect of those either charged with a criminal offence or unlawfully subjected to measures of restraint. However, in her case both the Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow had found that there had been no breaches of the law. Furthermore, the second applicant insisted that she had not had the opportunity to challenge her detention between 27 June and 6 July 2011, which she alleged to have been in breach of domestic law. She further contested the Government\u2019s submissions that her appeal against the arrest order of 20\u00a0May 2011 had been examined, as there had been no reference to it whatsoever in the Moscow City Court\u2019s decision of 8 June 2011. As for the Government\u2019s comments on the Moscow City Court\u2019s failure to examine her appeal against the decision of 13 July 2011 ordering the extension of her detention, she claimed, firstly, that the assertion that the statement of appeal had been belatedly received was unfounded as, according to the postal stamp on the envelope, it had been received by the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow on 26 July 2011, four days prior to the appeal hearing. Secondly, even assuming that the appeal statement had indeed reached the appeal court with delay, Article 389 of the Code of Criminal Procedure specifically provided that in such a situation the appeal court was to examine the case again. The second applicant finally noted that her lawyer\u2019s submissions had not been duly examined by the appeal court during the hearing on 1 August 2011. Consequently, in her view, Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention had been violated on numerous accounts.",
