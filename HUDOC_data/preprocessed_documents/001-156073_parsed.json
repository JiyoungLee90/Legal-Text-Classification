Although in cases concerning complaints about detention conditions the Court has not always required that an applicant support each and every allegation with particular documents, recognising that relevant information and possibilities to investigate the facts in such cases lie primarily in the hands of the authorities, in order for the Court to reverse the burden of proof and examine the merits of the complaints, they must at least have been clearly and consistently formulated (see, for example, Trepashkin v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a085, 19\u00a0July 2007). In the Court\u2019s opinion, this requirement has not been met in the present case, as the applicant\u2019s account of the facts was not detailed enough to make the nature and extent of his sufferings apparent and to show whether the ill-treatment complained of had reached the threshold of severity bringing the matter within the ambit of Article 3 of the Convention.\u00a0The Court finds therefore that the applicant has not made out an arguable claim concerning the material conditions of his detention in the SIZO. The Court also notes that the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning his handcuffing while in hospital are not supported by any evidence and thus lack substantiation.",

Justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see, for example, Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. , \u00a7 66, ECHR 2003I). The Court emphasises that the persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings (see Labita v.

Although the applicant\u2019s detention may have initially been justified on those grounds, after a certain amount of time had passed the courts were obliged to give more explicit reasons for the continued detention (see Gavula v. Ukraine, no. 52652/07, \u00a7\u00a7 89-90, 16 May 2013). However, they repeatedly relied on the same grounds without giving any particular details. In particular, they did not explain in what way the applicant could influence witnesses and hinder the investigation. The Court further notes that the applicant\u2019s arguments based on the alleged inadequacy of the medical treatment he had received in the SIZO were not duly addressed either (see paragraph 91 above).",
