The Government maintained that the applicants had been informed that because financial resources were limited it was impossible to say when their case might be resolved. In their view, by refusing the exchange the applicants had accepted that the expropriation could not be carried out until such time as the appropriate financial resources were available; they should therefore bear the consequences of their decisions.",

The expropriation was to be carried out at the request of the district Mayor or the regional inspector in accordance with the 1997 Land Administration Act. Thus, the expropriation could be carried out only at the request of the public authorities or of their own motion, and the applicants did not have any formal involvement in that procedure. The applicants\u2019 role in the process was limited to submitting requests to initiate expropriation proceedings. These requests had no binding effect on the authorities and the latter enjoyed complete discretion in this regard. The above-mentioned arrangements were even further restricted with the entry into force of the Protection and Conservation of Monuments Act on 17\u00a0November 2003, which specified that immovable monuments could be expropriated at the request of a regional inspector only where there was a risk of irreversible damage to the monument.

Turkey [GC], no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7\u00a0134, ECHR 2004-XII; Broniowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0143; and Plechanow v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a099). Such positive obligations may entail the taking of measures necessary to protect the right to property, particularly where there is a direct link between the measures an applicant may legitimately expect from the authorities and his effective enjoyment of his possessions, even in cases involving litigation between private entities. This means, in particular, that States are under an obligation to provide a judicial mechanism for settling effectively property disputes and to ensure compliance of those mechanisms with the procedural and material safeguards enshrined in the Convention. This principle applies with all the more force when it is the State itself which is in dispute with an individual (see Anheuser-Busch Inc., cited above, \u00a7 83, and Plechanow v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 99).",

In the present case, the domestic law did not provide a procedure by which the applicants could assert before a judicial body their claim for expropriation and require the authorities to purchase their property (see, mutatis mutandis, Skibi\u0144scy v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a034-39 and 94-95, 14\u00a0November 2006, concerning owners who were threatened with expropriation of their property at an undetermined point in the future). Consequently, the Court finds that the applicants were deprived of any means of compelling the State authorities to expropriate their property (see Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, \u00a7 56, ECHR\u00a01999V). In the assessment of the proportionality of the measures complained of, the lack of such a procedure weighs considerably against the authorities.",

However, the request was to no avail. In 2002 the applicants expressed their willingness to resolve the matter by means of an exchange of land. In 2003, seeking to resolve the situation, the authorities twice offered the applicants an alternative property. However, the applicants refused both offers, considering that the plots did not match their expectations. Specifically, in respect of the first plot the applicants argued that it did not correspond to the value of their property and consisted of fields and swamps. The Court notes the applicants\u2019 argument that the Government did not provide a valuation of their property or the two alternative properties. It does appear that no such valuation was provided by the Mayor of S\u0142awno District, the competent authority in the matter of expropriation, an omission which arguably prevented the applicants from making an objective assessment of the offers. Furthermore, the Court notes that the domestic law did not compel them to accept an offer of alternative property even if it matched in value the original plot.",

In those circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants could not have been blamed for refusing both offers, as it appears that they had no guarantee that their interests would be sufficiently protected. Having regard to the above, the Court finds that the Government\u2019s objection as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies on the ground of the applicants\u2019 refusal to accept the alternative plots should be rejected.",
