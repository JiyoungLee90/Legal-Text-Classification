Russia, no.\u00a06277/06, \u00a7\u00a7 48-53, 22 October 2015) the Court found that in the rehabilitation proceedings, the Russian authorities did not have to examine, still less acknowledge, at least in substance, that the applicant\u2019s detention had been formally defective, or that it had been based on insufficient reasoning, or had exceeded a reasonable time.

These grounds for compensation did not correspond to the basis of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 and the alleged violation could not therefore be redressed in these proceedings (see also, mutatis mutandis, El\u011fay v.
