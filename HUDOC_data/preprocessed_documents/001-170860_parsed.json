The Court is mindful of the fact that contact and residence disputes are by their very nature extremely sensitive for all the parties concerned, and it is not necessarily an easy task for the domestic authorities to ensure enforcement of a court order where one or both parents\u2019 behaviour is far from constructive. In the present case the mother\u2019s uncooperative attitude, based on her manifest hostility towards the applicant, made it particularly difficult for the domestic authorities to take action to fully enforce the applicant\u2019s contact rights (see Krasicki v.

Slovenia, no.\u00a07233/04, \u00a7 152, 3\u00a0October 2013).",
