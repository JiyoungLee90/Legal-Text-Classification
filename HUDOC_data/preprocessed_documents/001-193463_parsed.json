They proposed that further documentary evidence be taken into evidence, including the full case file from the Ministry regarding the contracts. These proposals were rejected as the trial court found no reason to doubt the veracity of the letters and considered that all relevant documents had already been submitted and any further requests were aimed only at prolonging the trial.",

Relying on a considerable amount of evidence, including the testimony of Ministry officials who had participated in the two contracts and other witnesses, written material related to the procurement, two expert reports and the statements of the two experts at the trial, the trial court concluded the two contracts had not been awarded in a process compliant with the rules of public procurement. It was established that the food contract could not be considered as urgent procurement. As to the construction contract, the court found that there had been neither a legal framework governing the construction of military housing on the site of the base, nor a clear decision or plan for the particular location, which suggested that the defendants\u2019 choice of location had been aimed at circumventing the public-procurement rules. The company had not been officially registered for construction activity at the time of award of the contracts, only subsequently.

From the available material, it can be established that it took a year and three months to start with the first hearing after the indictment had been upheld (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above). The Court notes that another delay in the proceedings occurred after the quashing of the first-instance judgment by the Court of Appeal on 2\u00a0March 2004. It observes that it took a year and six months to schedule the first hearing in the re-trial proceedings, a period which also included the preparation of two expert reports (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). Moreover, several hearings were postponed on account of the applicant\u2019s or a co-defendant\u2019s health. The State cannot be held responsible for that delay.",

It decided to read out his pre-trial statement (see paragraphs 16 and\u00a019 above), without making any efforts, through the instruments of international legal assistance, to summon this witness to the trial (see Pai\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 47082/12, \u00a7 38, 29 March 2016, and contrast Lu\u010di\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 5699/11, \u00a7 80, 27 February 2014). The domestic courts gave no reasons as to why the mechanisms of international legal assistance would have been unavailable in the particular case, and the Government did not offer a convincing explanation in this regard. In such circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that \u201call reasonable efforts\u201d can be said to have been made to secure Z.S.\u2019s attendance at the trial. Accordingly, it concludes that no good reason was convincingly shown for his absence. However, the absence of a good reason is a consideration which is not of itself conclusive of the lack of fairness of a criminal trial, although it constitutes an important factor to be weighed in the overall balance together with the other relevant considerations (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7 113).",

The Court observes that Z.S., who owned the company at the time of the award of the contracts, denied any acquaintance with the applicant and his statement primarily concerned his relations with the other two defendants, V.T. and Lj.P. (see paragraph 10 above). The domestic courts relied on his testimony mainly to establish facts relevant for the conviction of those defendants, particularly regarding the manner in which they had used the company to obtain unlawful pecuniary gain from the Ministry (see paragraph 23 and 26 above). The applicant\u2019s involvement and undue influence in the Ministry\u2019s procurement process was established on basis of the statements of his coaccused, K.Gj. and a witness, K.K. His defence that the two contracts had been concluded in a process compliant with the applicable rules of public procurement was rebutted on the basis of other evidence and not Z.S.\u2019s testimony, specifically: the testimony of several witnesses who were all involved in the Ministry\u2019s procurement process and the two contracts; expert evidence; the relevant documents from the Ministry and other documentary evidence (see paragraph 22 above). In view of the above-mentioned considerations the Court\u2019s conclusion is that the evidence of the absent witness, Z.S., could not be said to have been \u201csole or decisive\u201d for the applicant\u2019s conviction.",

Austria, no. 28328/03, \u00a7 43, 10 May 2012).
