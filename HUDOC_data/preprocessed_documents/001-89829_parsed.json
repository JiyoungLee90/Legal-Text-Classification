This had also been recognised by the Supreme Court. The Court has regard to the Government\u2019s argument that, in order to achieve the objective of expeditious proceedings, the applicant had been required to follow the course of the proceedings actively. The Court attaches importance to that objective, which does not, however, justify disregarding such a fundamental principle as the right to adversarial proceedings (see Nider\u00f6st-Huber v. Switzerland, judgment of 18 February 1997, Reports of judgments and decisions 1997-I, \u00a7 30).",

Moreover, there is nothing in the case file to prove that the applicant\u2019s attorney actually received the notice, as it was not sent by registered post. However, even assuming that she did receive the notice, the Court attaches credence to the applicant\u2019s argument that her attorney, not representing her at the appellate stage and having seen that the notice had also been addressed to the applicant, could have reasonably presumed that the applicant had thereby been aware of the hearing date. That being so, the Court considers that, without being duly informed about the appellate hearing, the applicant was effectively deprived of an opportunity to participate in it actively.\u00a0Moreover, this lacuna was aggravated by the fact that the defendant took part in the hearing and was given an opportunity to present his arguments. The Court also notes that the appeal court overruled the first-instance judgment in the defendant\u2019s favour. In addition, the Supreme Court, albeit having explicitly acknowledged that the applicant had not been duly summoned, upheld the appeal court\u2019s ruling.",

Moreover, according to the national law (see paragraphs 13-18 above) that was indeed the normal practice on appeal. However, as the appeal court did not verify whether the applicant had been duly apprised of the hearing, that practice was not followed in this case.",
