As the Court has already found in comparable cases (see S\u00fcss v. Germany (dec.), no.\u00a063309/00, 13 October 2005; Petersen v.

The Court notes that the Court of Appeal itself found in its decision of 14 October 2002 that the detention order of 25 July 2002 failed to comply with the formal requirements of section 114 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, this finding did not, according to the Court of Appeal, render the initial detention order of 25 July 2002 void and did not retrospectively render the applicant\u2019s detention from 25 July 2002 until 14 October 2002 unlawful. According to the case-law of the domestic courts (see paragraph 43 above), there was a distinction between detention orders \u2013 such as the one in the applicant\u2019s case \u2013 which, though defective on formal grounds, remained a valid basis for detention until replaced, and orders which \u2013 notably for lack of compliance with the substantive requirements of the provisions on pre-trial detention \u2013 were void. As a consequence, the applicant\u2019s detention from 25 July 2002 until the fresh detention order of 29\u00a0October 2002, which was issued in compliance with the formal requirements of section 114 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, was not unlawful under German law, as it was based on the initial detention order of 25 July 2002. It being in the first place for the national authorities to interpret domestic law, the Court is prepared to accept that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention remained lawful under domestic law and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law even after the Court of Appeal considered the initial detention order to have been defective for lack of sufficient reasons.",

However, the Court of Appeal\u2019s finding that the applicant had to be informed by the court of first instance of the reasons for suspecting him of an offence and had to be allowed to make representations on that subject necessitated practical arrangements to be made. In these circumstances, the lapse of time between the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision and the issuing of the new detention order on 29 October 2002 cannot be considered as rendering the applicant\u2019s detention arbitrary (compare also Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, judgment of 24 October 1979, Series A no. 33, p. 21, \u00a7 49 and Erkalo, cited above, p. 2478, \u00a7 57).",

He had applied for his arrest warrant to be quashed, arguing that he had not had access to the case files. His request for judicial review of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s decision not to grant his counsel access to the files had therefore been included in his request for judicial review of the detention order.

Ireland, judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p. 11, \u00a7 19; Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7\u00a047, ECHR 1999-II and \u0130lhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, \u00a7 58, ECHR\u00a02000-VII). It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to convince the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been discharged, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 19 September 1996, Reports 1996-IV, p.\u00a01211, \u00a7 68; and Horvat v. , no. 51585/99, \u00a7\u00a039, ECHR 2001-VIII). Thus, an applicant cannot be criticised for not having made use of a legal remedy which would have been directed to essentially the same end as the proceedings the applicant pursued to a conclusion and which moreover would not have had a better prospect of success (compare Iatridis, cited above, \u00a7 47; and Miailhe v.

Such proceedings could therefore only have afforded redress in respect of one aspect of the violation the applicant complained of. Moreover, both the Regional Court, which would have had jurisdiction to hear a motion under section 147 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Federal Constitutional Court were called to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint about the refusal to let his counsel inspect the files in the proceedings for judicial review of the detention order. In these circumstances, the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s submission that an additional motion for judicial review under section 147 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would have been an effective remedy offering reasonable prospects of success against the refusal to grant the applicant\u2019s counsel access to the files or, therefore, one which the applicant should have exhausted. The fact that the applicant withdrew his further appeal on 10\u00a0December 2002 (see paragraph 36 above) does not warrant a different conclusion on the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Given that the applicant had been released, his counsel had been granted access to the case files and the Court of Appeal and the Federal Constitutional Court had both already given a decision on the question of his counsel\u2019s right of access to the files, the Court does not accept that pursuing his further appeal to a conclusion and obtaining another decision of the Federal Constitutional Court were remedies which were capable of providing redress and offered reasonable prospects of success in the circumstances of the case.

However, these documents only gave an account of the facts as construed by the prosecution authorities on the basis of all the information available to them. It is virtually impossible for an accused, even if assisted by counsel, properly to challenge the reliability of such an account without being aware of the evidence on which it is based. Even in a case such as the present one in which the detention order was partly based on evidence seized at the defendant\u2019s home which, in principle, he would have been familiar with, his defence counsel must be given sufficient opportunity to acquaint himself personally with the underlying statements and other pieces of evidence.",

The suspicion against the applicant was grounded not only on business documents seized at the applicant\u2019s home, but also on documentary evidence obtained from his employers and on witness statements made by them, in other words on a large quantity of material which was only referred to in general terms in the detention orders. The Court does not lose sight of the fact that the refusal to grant the applicant\u2019s counsel access to the case files was based on a risk of compromising the success of the ongoing investigations. However, as reiterated above (at paragraph 92), this legitimate goal may not be pursued at the expense of substantial restrictions on the rights of the defence. Counsel must therefore be given access to those parts of the case files on which the suspicion against the applicant was essentially based. It follows that the applicant, assisted by counsel, did not, at that stage of the proceedings, have an opportunity adequately to challenge the findings referred to by the Public Prosecutor or the courts as required by the principle of \u201cequality of arms\u201d.",

According to the Court of Appeal, these defects amounted to a denial of the right of the accused to be heard in view of the fact that counsel for the defence had been refused access to the case files under section 147 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

In the present case, not only, as found above, were the proceedings reviewing the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention as such unduly delayed, contrary to Article 5 \u00a7 4, his counsel was not granted access to the case files until after the applicant\u2019s conditional release from prison. In these circumstances, the fact that the domestic authorities allowed the applicant\u2019s counsel to inspect the case files at a later stage of the proceedings could no longer remedy in an effective manner the procedural shortcomings in the earlier stages of the proceedings.",
