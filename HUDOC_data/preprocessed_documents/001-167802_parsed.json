Once it transpired that the applicant\u2019s deportation to Georgia was not feasible because his Georgian nationality had been revoked, the authorities started exploring other options, such as his departure to Turkey (contrast with Kim, cited above, \u00a7 52, where the Government provided no evidence of any efforts to secure the applicant\u2019s admission to a third country). In the meantime, a legal possibility arose to have the applicant\u2019s Georgian citizenship restored and the applicant\u2019s removal to Georgia was once again a realistic prospect (contrast with Mikolenko v. Estonia, no. 10664/05, \u00a7\u00a7 64-65, 8 October 2009).
