Thus, it was a\u00a0classic example of organised crime, by definition presenting more difficulties for the investigating authorities, and later for the courts, in relation to determining the facts and the degree of responsibility of each member of the group. It is obvious that, in cases of this kind, continuous control and limitation of the defendants\u2019 contact with each other and with other persons may be essential to avoid their absconding, tampering with evidence and, most importantly, influencing or even threatening witnesses. Accordingly, longer periods of detention than in other cases may be reasonable (see B\u0105k v. Poland, no. 7870/04, \u00a7\u00a056, 16\u00a0January 2007; Lukovi\u0107 v.

In the Court\u2019s view, the fact that the case concerned the alleged leader of such a criminal group should be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0of the Convention (see Tomecki v.

The Court acknowledges that, in cases such as the present one concerning organised criminal groups, the risk that a detainee, if released, might put pressure on witnesses or other co-accused, or otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high (see G\u0142adczak v. Poland, no. 14255/02, \u00a7\u00a055, 31 May 2007). The Court observes that, apart from the general risk flowing from the organised nature of the applicant\u2019s alleged criminal activities, the domestic courts relied on specific threats made to one of the victims, P.P., the testimony of one witness who had been threatened in an attempt to get him to change his testimony, and the testimony of several witnesses who were afraid to testify against the applicant if he were at liberty (see paragraphs 7 and\u00a019 above). The domestic courts considered these fears to be serious, and allowed these witnesses to testify against the applicant in his absence. The Court accepts that the risk of collusion flowing from the nature of the applicant\u2019s criminal activities actually existed, and justified holding him in custody on this ground for the relevant period (for similar reasoning, see Mkhitaryan\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia, no. 46108/11, \u00a7\u00a7 94-98, 5 February 2013).",

They relied on the seriousness and nature of the charges against him at that time, and the fact that not all of the members of the criminal group had been identified. The Court reiterates that while the gravity of the crimes allegedly perpetrated by the applicant could not by itself justify the overall length of his detention, the judicial authorities relied on information relating to the applicant\u2019s behaviour, the motives for his criminal activities, their duration, extent and methods, and his authority in the criminal group (see paragraphs 14, 17, and 20 above).",

The Court is of the opinion that, given the nature of the applicant\u2019s alleged criminal activities, especially the methods of violence and extortion, it was reasonable for the authorities to presume, even at the later stage of the trial, that if released he might carry out his threats. Therefore, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court is prepared to accept that the authorities thoroughly evaluated the risk of the applicant\u2019s reoffending, and were not unreasonable in fearing that he might reoffend if released.",

However, the Constitutional Court found no shortcomings in the Supreme Court\u2019s examination of the applicant\u2019s arguments regarding the grounds for detention, which were reviewed and answered in detail.
