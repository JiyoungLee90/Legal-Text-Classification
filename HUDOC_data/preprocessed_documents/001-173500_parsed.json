The applicant had been dismissed from his job because of the necessity to reduce the number of employees connected with production needs, which, within the domestic law, had been a lawful basis for terminating an employment contract. Once the writ on execution had been presented to the Compulsory Enforcement Service, the bailiff had immediately instituted enforcement proceedings and requested that the Committee comply with the requirements of the judgment. However, it had been impossible to reinstate the applicant in his previous job, since the structure of the Committee had been modified and the applicant\u2019s position no longer existed. This had been the main reason for the failure to reinstate the applicant in his previous position. Even assuming that there could have been such positions within the structure of the Committee, it would still have been impossible to enforce the judgment, since these positions had not been vacant. Even in this situation, the domestic courts had set aside the bailiff\u2019s decision to terminate the enforcement proceedings and had requested that the bailiff reopen those proceedings. After reopening the enforcement proceedings the bailiff had again requested that the Committee comply with the District Court\u2019s judgment, but the Committee had still found this impossible. It had only been after the reply by the Committee to this effect that the Administrative Court had left the bailiff\u2019s decision in force. In the meantime, the Administrative Court had decided, by its decision of 16 October 2012, that the applicant\u2019s forced absence should be calculated up to 15\u00a0December 2011, the day on which the Kanaker-Zeytun Tax Inspectorate had ceased to exist.",

The circumstances of the present case should be taken into account when assessing the duration of the enforcement proceedings, since, during those proceedings, the responsible State body, the Compulsory Enforcement Service, had taken all possible steps towards enforcing the District Court\u2019s judgment. It was only because of objective and substantial facts that the enforcement of the judgment had been impossible. Moreover, the Government emphasised that the applicant had been offered another position similar to his previous position, both verbally and by letter, but he had not accepted these offers. The reasons why the applicant had refused these offers were not relevant. The question of the applicant\u2019s reinstatement in his previous job could have been resolved had he accepted the Committee\u2019s offer.

As to the remaining part of the necessary payment, the delay in the payment had been connected to the wording of the District Court\u2019s judgment, since that judgment ordered that the relevant period be calculated up to the very date of the applicant\u2019s reinstatement. As this question had been before the domestic courts for a long time, the specific amount of money to be paid had remained uncertain for a long time. In the letter of the Committee of 8\u00a0November 2013, the Committee had expressed its wish to pay the whole sum for the applicant\u2019s forced absence. However, by declining the Committee\u2019s offer to reinstate him in a position similar to his previous one, the applicant had clearly intended to extend the period of time for which he could receive compensation, and had therefore also indirectly blocked the enforcement of the judgment of the District Court in respect of that part of the payment. Moreover, although the Administrative Court had held in its judgment of 16\u00a0October 2012 that the period for the applicant\u2019s forced absence should be calculated up to 15 December 2011, and that the sum for this period amounted to AMD 4,017,860, the Committee had expressed its readiness to consider the possibility of awarding the applicant the AMD\u00a09,975,970 claimed if he submitted any substantiating calculations.",
