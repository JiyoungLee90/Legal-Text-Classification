The case originated in an application (no. 27533/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Vladimir Buianovschi (“the applicant”), on 22 June 2004.
The applicant was represented by Mr Victor Marcu, a lawyer practising in Edineţ.  The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at that time, Mr Vitalie Pârlog.
The applicant complained that the failure to enforce a final judgment in his favour violated his right to have his civil rights determined by a court as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention and his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 29 March 2006 the President of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the admissibility and merits of the case (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1934 and lives in Cuconeştii-Noi.
In 1949 the applicant was persecuted by the communist authorities. His property was confiscated and he was exiled to Siberia for ten years.
In 1989 he was rehabilitated.
On an unspecified date in 2004 he brought an action against the Edineţ Department of Finances, seeking compensation for the confiscation of his property.
On 27 February 2004 the Edineţ District Court ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the defendant to pay him 100,000 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 6,333 euros (EUR) at the time). The judgment was not appealed and after fifteen days it became final and enforceable.
On 4 April 2004 a Bailiff received the enforcement warrant.
On 28 January 2005 the Bailiff sent the enforcement warrant to the President of Edineţ County, without having enforced it.
The judgment of 27 February 2004 has not been enforced to date.
The relevant domestic law was set out in Prodan v. Moldova (no. 49806/99, ECHR 2004III (extracts)) and Popov v. Moldova (No. 1) (no. 74153/01, §§ 29-41, 18 January 2005).
