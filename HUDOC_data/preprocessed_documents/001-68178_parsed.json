The muscles in the legs and feet had considerably withered. The illness had attacked even the hands and arms, with withered muscles and reduced strength in the fingers. Because of multiple inconveniences, the patient's functional capacity had been strongly reduced; he needed help for heavier household tasks, the preparation of meals, the purchase of household goods, carrying heavier objects, and for personal hygiene. The patient had incurred extra costs for medical treatment, foot rails, soft shoes, home assistance, and to some extent his food budget because of a limited ability to prepare meals; he also had to pay for the transportation service for disabled persons, and extra travel by personal car, because of his considerably reduced ability to walk.",

In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character.

The main issue to be determined was whether the applicant's need for assistance and additional costs had reached the level required for a disability allowance under the 1962 Act. However, one prominent feature was that the assessment as to whether the applicant was entitled to a disability allowance had to be made in relation to a particular point in time in the past, namely when he had retired at the age of 65.

Regard must be had to the nature of the national appeal system, to the scope of the appellate court's powers and to the manner in which the applicant's interests are actually presented and protected in the appeal, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it, and whether these raise any questions of fact or questions of law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case-file (see for instance Helmers v.

According to the interpretation made by the Swedish courts, these two grounds for refusing a request to hold an oral hearing were alternative, not cumulative. Thus, in administrative-law cases heard on the merits by one level of jurisdiction only, there is an apparent discrepancy between the Convention case-law, according to which an oral hearing must be held unless there are exceptional reasons, and the lesser standard applied by the national court.

Switzerland (judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263), which also concerned a disability pension. Admittedly, Mr Miller wished to have doctors and those employees of the Social Insurance Office who had participated in the contested decision called as witnesses. Normally, however, examination of the medical certificates included in the case file would have been enough to compensate for the non-appearance of such witnesses. Social security is a technical area, and has nothing in common with, for example, criminal matters, where the oral character of deliberations and the hearing of witnesses are of great importance.",

In turn, the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's request for a hearing to rule on whether he was to be granted leave to appeal and on the merits, and they subsequently also refused to grant such leave. Thus, Mr\u00a0Miller's case was examined by only one level of jurisdiction, without an oral hearing. That in itself is not decisive, but it is a factor to be taken into account.",

I think that in this situation to establish the applicant's degree of disability 13 years before the matter was brought before the courts the requested oral hearing would have had a very limited value. The offered oral evidence from the applicant's doctor about his state of health 15 years earlier - with a very high probability - had to be based on the medical documents available at the time. In my view it was justifiable to dispense with an oral hearing owing to the exceptional circumstances, such as the limited scope of the rather technical case and the significant amount of time which had elapsed since the events.",

The subject matter of that case was financial compensation for unlawful detention decided by national courts without holding a hearing. That case would have required a careful assessment of the applicant's and his family's personal distress and anxiety during his detention and an evaluation of these personal factors for the determination of his financial compensation. Moreover, I think that even though the Court was divided in the G\u00f6\u00e7 case, in that type of case the need for transparency and public scrutiny justifies public hearings more than in the Miller case, which was much more technical in nature.",
