The dissenting judge, however, noted in his separate opinion that Bilal \u00c7o\u015felav was being held in an adult wing of the prison in breach of the applicable domestic law, which required that he be kept in a juvenile wing. The judge argued that the possibility that his detention with adults had contributed to his psychological problems could not be excluded. He added that the fact that Bilal had repeatedly asked to be transferred showed that he had been having problems with the adult prisoners in his wing.

France, no. 37971/97, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2002-III, and the cases cited therein).
