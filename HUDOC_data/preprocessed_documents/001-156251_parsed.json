Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2005\u2011I). Although the object of Article 34 is essentially that of protecting an individual against any arbitrary interference by the authorities, it does not merely compel States to abstain from such interference. In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there are positive obligations inherent in Article 34 requiring the authorities to furnish all necessary facilities to make possible the proper and effective examination of applications. Such an obligation will arise in situations where applicants are particularly vulnerable (see Naydyon v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a016474/03, \u00a7 63, 14\u00a0October 2010; Savitskyy v.

The Court cannot emphasise enough the special importance attached to interim measures in the Convention system. Their purpose is not only to enable an effective examination of the application to be carried out, but also to ensure that the protection afforded to the applicant by the Convention is effective; such measures subsequently allow the Committee of Ministers to supervise the execution of the final judgment. Interim measures thus enable the State concerned to discharge its obligation to comply with the final judgment of the Court, which is legally binding by virtue of Article 46 of the Convention (see Mamatkulov and\u00a0Askarov, cited above, \u00a7 125; Shamayev and Others v.

The vital role played by interim measures in the Convention system not only underpins their binding legal effect on the States concerned, as upheld by the established case-law, but also commands that the utmost importance be attached to the question of the States Parties\u2019 compliance with the Court\u2019s indications in that regard (see, inter alia, the firm position on that point expressed by the States Parties in the Izmir Declaration and by the Committee of Ministers in Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)83 in the above-mentioned case of Ben\u00a0Khemais). Any laxity on this question would unacceptably weaken the protection of the core rights in the Convention, and would not be compatible with its values and spirit (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7\u00a0July 1989, \u00a7\u00a088, Series A no. 161); it would also be inconsistent with the fundamental importance of the right of individual petition and, more generally, undermine the authority and effectiveness of the Convention as a constitutional instrument of European public order (see Mamatkulov and\u00a0Askarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 100 and 125, and, mutatis mutandis, Loizidou v.\u00a0Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, \u00a7 75, Series A no. 310).",

The Government responded by submitting a typed copy of the applicant\u2019s medical history prepared by the detention authorities; certificates issued by the head of the applicant\u2019s correctional colony and the head of the Service for the Execution of Sentences in the Tatarstan Republic; and a copy of the report drawn up on 25 December 2013 by a medical commission, comprising the head, a deputy head and a senior inspector of the medical unit of the Service for the Execution of Sentences in the Tatarstan Republic, and a deputy head of the prison hospital of correctional colony no. 2.

That expert evidence was necessary to decide whether, as the applicant argued, his life and limb were at real risk as a result of the conditions of his detention, including the alleged lack of requisite medical care. In addition, the Court was concerned by the contradictory nature of the medical reports prepared by the applicant\u2019s experts and those commissioned by the prison authorities, which the applicant submitted with his application and his request for an interim measure. The interim measure in the present case was therefore also meant to ensure that the applicant could effectively pursue his case before the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Shtukaturov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 44009/05, \u00a7 141, ECHR 2008).",

The main purpose of the interim measure, as indicated by the Court in the present case - and the Government did not pretend to be unaware of it - was to prevent the applicant\u2019s exposure to inhuman and degrading suffering in view of his poor health and his remaining in the conditions of an ordinary detention facility that was unable to ensure that he received, as he argued, adequate medical assistance.",

It is more concerned with the fact that the aim of the expert examination, the result of which was set in the report, was to compare the applicant\u2019s condition against the exhaustive list of illnesses provided for by the Governmental Decree, which could have warranted his early release. Having limited their assessment to the mere restatement of the applicant\u2019s medical history, at no point during the examinations did the three doctors assess the applicant\u2019s state of health independently from that list or evaluate whether his illnesses, separately or in combination, given their current symptoms, nature and duration, required additional, case-related medical procedures or even the applicant\u2019s transfer to a specialised hospital.

It reiterates that, in assessing evidence, it has adopted the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is to rule not on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention  conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In proceedings before the Court there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. In accordance with its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, \u00a7 88, 23 February 2012, and the cases cited therein).",

It is aware that with multiple sclerosis being an incurable condition, treatment of such patients typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, slowing the progression of the disease and managing symptoms to alleviate the patients\u2019 sufferings. In the applicant\u2019s case, the treatment he received was incomplete and the medical supervision afforded to him was insufficient to maintain his health. There was no thorough and continuous evaluation of his condition or adequate diagnosis in response to the increasing number of his health-related complaints. It appears that during the entire period of his detention the applicant had no more than two MRI exams. The Government was not able to cite any additional diagnostic procedures which could have in detail recorded the progress of the applicant\u2019s condition and permitted a timely response to the aggravation of his illness. The medical personnel of the detention facilities took no steps to address his concerns or to apply the recommendation of the experts commissioned by the applicant. The Court is particularly concerned that the applicant did not receive the complete drug regimen. Without going into the issue of the medical record forgery, the Court finds that administering of merely a quarter of the prescribed medicines to the applicant was clearly insufficient to address his needs. It also did not find any evidence that at any point during the applicant\u2019s detention prison doctors significantly amended or extended his chemotherapy to modify the progress of the disease. There is also unconvincing evidence that prison doctors effectively addressed the applicant\u2019s associated effects of the multiple sclerosis, such as pain and bladder control problems, or comprehensively dealt with yet another of the applicant\u2019s illnesses, epilepsy. It does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that even the physical therapy, so needed for the treatment of the applicant\u2019s movement problems, was not provided. The poor quality of the medical services was accentuated by the fact that the applicant was kept in unsanitary detention conditions susceptible to further aggravating his state of health. The Court believes that, as a result of the lack of comprehensive and adequate medical treatment, the applicant was exposed to prolonged mental and physical suffering that diminished his human dignity. The authorities\u2019 failure to provide the applicant with the medical care he needed amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of Article\u00a03 of the Convention.",

Had it been otherwise, the prospect of future compensation would have legitimised particularly severe suffering in breach of this core provision of the Convention (see Vladimir Romanov v.

In this connection, the Court reiterates that it has on many occasions examined the effectiveness of the domestic remedies suggested by the Government in cases of applicants complaining of ongoing inadequate medical treatment, such as in the present case. It found, in particular, that in deciding on a complaint concerning breaches of domestic regulations governing the provision of medical care to detainees, the prison authorities would not have a sufficiently independent standpoint to satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a035 of the Convention (see Koryak v. Russia, no. 24677/10, \u00a7\u00a079, 13\u00a0November 2012, and Dirdizov v. Russia, no. 41461/10, \u00a7\u00a075, 27\u00a0November 2012). The Court also stressed that even though review by a supervising prosecutor plays an important part in securing appropriate medical care in detention, a complaint to the supervising prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy, because of the procedural shortcomings that have been previously identified in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Koryak, \u00a7 80-81, cited above). Having assessed a civil claim for compensation under the tort provisions of the Civil Code, the Court considered that such a claim could not offer an applicant any other redress than a purely compensatory award, and could not put an end to a situation where there is an ongoing violation, such as inadequate medical care (see Reshetnyak v. Russia, no. 56027/10, \u00a7\u00a7 65-73, 8\u00a0January 2013). Moreover, the Court found that such a remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, in particular because the award was conditional on the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities, which was extremely improbable in a situation where domestic legal norms prescribed the application of a certain measure, for instance certain conditions of detention or level of medical treatment (see A.B. v. Russia, no. 1439/06, \u00a7\u00a096, 14\u00a0October 2010).",
