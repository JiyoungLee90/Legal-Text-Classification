The Court reiterates that, the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 92-94, and Popov v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 208, 13\u00a0July 2006). In most of the cases concerning the detention of people who are ill, the Court has examined whether or not the applicant received adequate medical assistance in prison. The Court reiterates in this respect that even if Article 3 does not entitle a detainee to be released \u201con compassionate grounds\u201d, it has always interpreted the requirement to secure the health and well-being of detainees, among other things, as an obligation on the part of the State to provide detainees with the requisite medical assistance (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 94, Kalashnikov v. Russia, no.\u00a047095/99, \u00a7\u00a7 95 and 100, ECHR 2002-VI, Khudobin v. Russia, no.\u00a059696/00, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2006-XII (extracts), and Vasyukov v. Russia, no.\u00a02974/05, \u00a7 61, 5 April 2011). The Court accepts that member States cannot be required to provide the best possible medical care for prisoners. The level of medical care provided to prisoners should, however, be appropriate in the circumstances of each case. On the whole, the Court, in its own assessment, has applied a fair degree of flexibility in defining the required standard of health care, deciding it on a case-by-case basis. That standard should be \u201ccompatible with the human dignity\u201d of a detainee, but should also take into account \u201cthe practical demands of imprisonment\u201d (see Aleksanyan v.\u00a0Russia, no. 46468/06, \u00a7 140, 22 December 2008). The same should apply to the assessment by national authorities.",

The Court notes, however, that their statements were somewhat vague and required clarification. In order to clarify the applicant\u2019s health situation, the national courts commissioned further expert opinions. Three separate independent experts submitted their opinions (see paragraphs 9, 12 and 22 above). These experts established that the ZPH had all the necessary facilities for addressing the applicant\u2019s health issues and in September 2014 the doctors of the ZPH held that there was no need for the applicant\u2019s further hospitalisation (see paragraph 14 above). The domestic courts followed these reports. The Court sees nothing arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable in their assessment. The Court also notes that during his incarceration the applicant\u2019s health has been regularly monitored and that the expert reports indicated that adequate medical assistance had been provided to him (see paragraphs 9, 12, and 22 above).",
