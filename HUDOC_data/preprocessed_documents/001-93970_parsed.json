The applicant had also changed and supplemented her statement several times during the pre-trial investigation, which added to its length. The proceedings before the District Court had been completed speedily. The proceedings before the Court of Appeal, lasting over four years, had been delayed due to the supplementary investigation requested by the prosecutor. The purpose of that investigation had been to look into the applicant\u2019s contention about the money belonging to a Russian businessman. It was therefore conducted in her interest. The request was dated 15 August 2000 and the investigation reports were dated 13 and 25 March and 2\u00a0September\u00a02003. The investigation measures had comprised requests for international legal assistance and the police had been active in the conduct of the investigation. The leave to appeal proceedings in the Supreme Court had lasted less than seven months. In the Government\u2019s view, the case had been complex.",

The Court finds that the delay thus caused, some four and a half years, was not solely the Finnish authorities\u2019 responsibility. At least during the supplementary investigation at the appellate stage, the domestic authorities made efforts to speed up the proceedings at the international level. Apart from those periods during which the proceedings were stayed pending replies from the foreign authorities, the only stage entailing unnecessary delay seems to have been the consideration of charges, which lasted almost one and a half years.
