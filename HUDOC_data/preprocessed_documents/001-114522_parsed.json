The Constitutional Court held that such an extension was only possible if there still existed \u201csufficient grounds to believe\u201d that the accused might abscond during the investigation or trial, reoffend or otherwise obstruct the establishment of the truth, as provided by Article 97 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In so far as the challenged provision did not set a specific time-limit for holding the defendant in custody while he studied the case file, the Constitutional Court considered that it allowed for the possibility of determining such a time-limit for each particular case, depending on its specific features, on condition that the grounds for detention established in Article\u00a097 had been sufficiently confirmed. The court concluded that the challenged provision could not be interpreted as providing for superfluous or unlimited detention. Neither did it deprive the defendant and his counsel of the right to challenge before a higher court the lawfulness and validity of the extension order, as well as the right to make an application for the custodial measure to be overturned or altered.",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law, but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Saadi v. the  [GC], no. 13229/03, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR 2008).",

It relied on Article 109 \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The parties disagreed on whether such repeated extensions were permitted under the applicable provisions of the domestic law. The Court has already examined a similar situation in the Korchuganova v.\u00a0Russia case, in which it had regard to the interpretation given by the Russian Constitutional Court of the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u00a7 51, case cited above). The Court noted that, according to the Constitutional Court\u2019s binding clarifications of 13 June 1996 and 25 December 1998 [...], in the absence of an express legal provision for repeated extensions of detention on the ground that the defendant has not finished studying the file, the granting of such repeated applications for extension of the defendant\u2019s detention was not permitted by law and incompatible with the guarantee against arbitrary detention. The restrictive interpretation adopted by the Constitutional Court is consonant with the requirements of Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see, among others, Sherstobitov v. , no.\u00a016266/03, \u00a7 113, 10 June 2010; Shukhardin v.

The courts of general jurisdiction in the instant case, and the Government in their submissions before the Court, adopted an extensive interpretation of Article 109, claiming that, in the absence of an express prohibition on multiple extensions on the same ground, the competent court should remain free to grant as many extensions as it considered appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

The Court has previously held that the requirement to lodge a prior request for participation in the appeal hearing would not be contrary to the Convention, if the procedure was clearly set out in the domestic law (see, mutatis mutandis, Sibgatullin v. , no. 32165/02, \u00a7 45, 23 April 2009, in the context of appeal proceedings against conviction). The applicant provided the Court with a copy of his additional grounds of appeal against the detention order of 12 February 2009, which he lodged on 24\u00a0February 2009 and in which he had indicated that he wished to take part in the examination of his appeal. Having regard to the fact that the Government did not contest the authenticity of that document, the Court considers that the applicant did lodge a request for participation in the appeal hearing and therefore, it cannot be said that he waived his rights. Therefore, even assuming that for an unknown reason the request submitted by the applicant did not reach the appeal court, the latter should have verified whether the applicant had been duly notified of the appeal hearing and informed of the steps to be taken in order to participate in it and if he had not, whether the case should have been adjourned. There is nothing in the material before the Court to suggest that the appeal court considered those issues in the present case.",
