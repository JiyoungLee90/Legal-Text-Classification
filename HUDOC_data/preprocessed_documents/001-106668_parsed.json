He also pointed out that the State Agency for National Security had not objected to his receiving protection in  during the asylum proceedings (see paragraph 11 above).

In a 2007 judgment concerning an application for judicial review of a deportation order, the court examined, albeit briefly, the substance of a claim under that provision (\u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 9636 \u043e\u0442 15 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 2007 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 2222/2007 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u0406\u0406\u0406 \u043e.). However, in three 2008 judgments it held that the prohibition spelled out in section 44a does not concern the lawfulness of an expulsion order as such, but merely bars its enforcement.

It went on to rule that those provisions must be interpreted as meaning that the period during which enforcement of the deportation order has been suspended because the person concerned has challenged it by way of judicial review is to be taken into account in calculating the period of detention for the purpose of removal, where the person concerned remains in detention during that procedure. The court further ruled that Article 15 \u00a7 4 must be interpreted as meaning that only a real prospect that removal can be carried out successfully, having regard to the periods laid down in Article 15 \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 6, corresponds to a reasonable prospect of removal, and that such a reasonable prospect does not exist where it appears unlikely that the person concerned will be admitted to a third country, having regard to those periods.",

In addition, there are dozens of informal gatherings, sometimes referred to as \u201cunofficial camps\u201d, spread throughout the country. The majority of Palestinian refugees in  are those displaced during the ArabIsraeli war of 1948 and their descendants. More Palestinians arrived in 1967 after the SixDay War, and in the 1970s after they were expelled from . The refugees fall into three categories: those registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (\u201cthe UNRWA\u201d) (\u201cregistered refugees\u201d), who are also registered with the Lebanese authorities; refugees registered with the Lebanese authorities but not with the UNRWA (\u201cnon-registered refugees\u201d); and refugees registered neither with the UNRWA nor with the Lebanese authorities (\u201cnonID refugees\u201d). According to the UNRWA, on 30 June 2010 there were 427,057 registered refugees in ; 226,767, or 53.1% of them, were living in the \u201cofficial\u201d camps. However, according to a report by the International Crisis Group (see paragraphs 76 and 77 below), many observers believe that the numbers cited by the UNRWA are inflated and fail to take account of the impact of the 197590 Lebanese Civil War and subsequent waves of Palestinian departures; according to their estimates, in 2009 the refugees were between 200,000 and 250,000. There are an estimated 10,000 to 35,000 nonregistered refugees and 3,000 to 5,000 nonID refugees. By law, Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are considered foreigners and are subject to various restrictions (for details, see Amnesty International: Exiled and suffering: Palestinian refugees in , October 2007).",

Lower Street was regarded as the bastion of the radical Islamists in the camp. According to a local figure quoted in the article, there were three broad coalitions inside the camp: the Tahalof (Cooperative), the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and Islamic factions. The Tahalof consisted of seven factions, including the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The Palestinian Liberation Organization faction was made up of five groups and was dominated by Fatah. The Islamic faction comprised three groups: Asbat alAnsar, Harakat Mujahideen Islamiyah, and Ansar Allah. The article went on to mention interFatah conflicts inside the camp, saying that they centred on veteran Fatah leader Mounir Maqdah and his rival Mahmoud AbdulHameed AlIssa. Maqdah was described as being regarded as a renegade by some Fatah leaders, partly because of his close links to Palestinian Islamists.

Some of those groups, such as Usbat alAnsar and Jund alSham, had been able to find safe haven within the camps, most notably in Ain alHilweh. In March 2008 heavy clashes had erupted in the camp between Jund alSham militants and fighters of Fatah. They had exchanged rocket fire for four hours until a ceasefire had been agreed following mediation by another Islamist group. A Fatah leader had said at least four people had been wounded in the clashes. The Jund alSham fighters would leave the camp and Fatah security agents would take control. The Lebanese army had blocked the entrance to the camp while allowing civilians to leave. A Palestinian official had said that the militants of Jund al-Sham had been angered by Fatah\u2019s seizure of a commander of the group and his handover to the Lebanese army. The captive had been suspected of links to militant groups outside . On 15 September 2008 a Jund alSham member had been killed in further clashes between the group and Fatah.

Germany (dec.), no. 40932/02, 13\u00a0October 2005). The question whether the bar in section 44a of the Aliens Act 1998 on the expulsion of aliens to countries where their life or freedom would be in danger or where they may face a risk of illtreatment (see paragraph 38 above) would in fact prevent the applicant\u2019s removal to Lebanon goes to the merits of the case (see Boutagni v. , no.\u00a042360/08, \u00a7\u00a7 4748, 18 November 2010). Nor is it apparent, from the information available in the case file, that the Lebanese authorities will never issue travel documents enabling the applicant to reenter .",

Its decision mainly relied on the fact that the applicant had been a member of Fatah and had been personally engaged in a violent conflict with members of a militant group (Jund alSham) operating in the Palestinian refugee camp (Ain alHilweh) where he had lived (see paragraph 11 above).

Instead, it must be assessed against the background of the available information on the situation in  and that of the Palestinian refugees there. It is true that the situation in the country as a whole does not appear so serious that the return of the applicant there would constitute, in itself, a breach of Article 3 (see paragraph 58 above). However, it cannot be overlooked that the applicant is a stateless Palestinian originating from a refugee camp in  (see paragraphs 1 and 7 above). There is therefore a likelihood that he would not be allowed to reside in  proper, but would have to return to the camp from which he fled, Ain alHilweh. The information available on the Palestinian refugee camps in general and Ain alHilweh in particular (see paragraphs 5255, 60, 62, 6573, 77, 78, 80 and 8288 above) shows that they are not under the control of the Lebanese authorities, but of various Palestinian armed factions. They are secluded from the rest of the country, are often surrounded by Lebanese army checkpoints, and have been described in reports as \u201cbeyond the [S]tate\u2019s reach\u201d, \u201cde facto sanctuaries for weapons\u201d and \u201ca safe heaven for those who seek to escape the authority of the State\u201d. They continue to be plagued by outbursts of violence and armed clashes between various factions. Ain alHilweh, which is very densely populated and not under the control of any single faction, appears to be one of the more chaotic and violent camps, where Fatah and various radical Islamist groups have for decades been engaged in a conflict of varying degrees of intensity. Since 2007, there has been a string of violent clashes between Fatah and Jund alSham, which is reported to have about fifty armed men at its disposal. Although in late 2010 the Jund alSham suffered some setbacks, including the death of a leader, it reengaged in armed clashes with Fatah in March and April of this year. In addition, there appear to exist power struggles within the ranks of Fatah itself. They, together with corruption within the movement, have apparently contributed to various security breakdowns. One of those internal divisions is pitting the applicant\u2019s purported \u201cprotector\u201d, Mounir Maqdah (see paragraph 9 above), against other figures in Fatah. It is therefore not readily apparent that Fatah, despite its relative dominance in Ain alHilweh, would be able to provide the applicant with effective protection. Nor is it apparent that the applicant would be able to settle in another Palestinian refugee camp. Fatah apparently does not have strong positions in the camps in northern , where the radical Islamist groups are more powerful. Those circumstances, coupled with the applicant\u2019s personal account, amount to at least prima facie evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 if expelled to Lebanon. Having regard to the information referred to above, the Court is not persuaded that the situation has evolved to an extent that the findings made by the State Refugees Agency in October 2009 on the question of risk are no longer valid. Indeed, as recently as 19 April 2011 the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations reported on violent clashes in Ain alHilweh and estimated that there still existed a threat of violence inside the Palestinian refugee camps (see paragraph 73 above). The burden is therefore on the State to dispel any doubts in that regard.",

In that connection, it is noteworthy that when issuing and reviewing the decision to expel the applicant, the competent domestic authorities and courts did not try to make any assessment of that risk. The expulsion order and the proposal for one to be issued gave no consideration to this matter (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). In the ensuing judicial review proceedings, the  expressly stated that the applicant\u2019s fear that his life would be at risk in  was irrelevant (see paragraph 23 above). The Court is therefore unable to conclude that the Bulgarian authorities have duly addressed the applicant\u2019s concerns with regard to Article 3 (see, mutatis mutandis, Khodzhayev v. , no.\u00a052466/08, \u00a7 104, 12 May 2010, and Khaydarov v. , no. 21055/09, \u00a7\u00a7 11214, 20 May 2010). Their uncorroborated assertions that he is not who he says he is, but is a member of a militant Jihadist organisation who is sought by the Lebanese authorities in connection with a number of assassinations (see paragraphs 14, 22, 23 and 87 above) show, if anything, that he may be at even greater risk of illtreatment, by the Lebanese authorities themselves. There are a number of reports indicating that those authorities are likely to illtreat persons suspected of involvement with such groups (see paragraphs 61, 64, 74 and 75 and above). There is no indication that the Government have sought or obtained any form of assurance on the part of  in relation to such matters. In any event, the existence of assurances does not absolve a  from its obligation to consider their practical application (see, among other authorities, Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 24027/07, 11949/08 and 36742/08, \u00a7 106, 6 July 2010).",

However, the Court does not consider that the Government\u2019s statement can be regarded as a binding assurance that the applicant will not be expelled to , for two reasons. First, in contrast to the express assurances given by the French Government in Boutagni (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 42), in the present case the Government did not declare that the applicant would not be removed to , but merely said that the point would be examined at the time of the execution of the expulsion order. Secondly, the Government\u2019s statement is not based on, or reflected in, a binding legal act (contrast Boutagni, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 1920 and 4748), and it is unclear whether it can of itself bind the authorities responsible for executing the expulsion order (see, mutatis mutandis, Shamayev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 34445).",

Belgium and  [GC], no. 30696/09, \u00a7 286, 21 January 2011). It is not persuaded that, if and when they proceed with the applicant\u2019s expulsion, the Bulgarian authorities will examine with the necessary rigour whether his return to Lebanon would put him at risk of treatment prohibited under Article 3 (contrast M.H. v. Sweden (dec.), no. 10641/08, \u00a7\u00a7 25 and 41, 21 October 2008). The Government did not provide any particulars about the manner in which the immigration authorities apply section 44a when implementing expulsion orders, and did not give any concrete examples. The Aliens Act 1998 and the regulations for its application are silent on this point, and there are no reported cases (see paragraph 38 in fine above). It is thus unclear by reference to what standards and on the basis of what information the authorities will make a determination, if any, of the risk faced by the applicant if removed to . Nor is there any indication as to whether, if the authorities choose to send the applicant to a third country, they will properly examine whether he would in turn be sent from there to Lebanon without due consideration for the risk of illtreatment. The Court reiterates that under its caselaw removal to an intermediary country does not affect the responsibility of the expelling State to ensure that the applicant is not exposed to treatment contrary to Article 3 as a result of the decision to expel (see T.I. v. the United Kingdom, cited above; Salah Sheekh, cited above, \u00a7 141; K.R.S. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 32733/08, 2 December 2008; Abdolkhani and Karimnia, cited above, \u00a7 88; Babar Ahmad and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011316; and M.S.S. v.

As for the \u201csuspensive effect\u201d requirement, it should be noted that under Bulgarian law applications for judicial review of expulsion orders issued on national security grounds do not have automatic suspensive effect (see paragraph 35 above). It furthermore appears that the courts have no power to suspend the enforcement of such orders, even if an irreversible risk of death or illtreatment in the receiving State is claimed (see paragraphs 31, 34 and 37 above). The proceedings for judicial review of the expulsion order against the applicant cannot therefore be regarded as an effective remedy in respect of his grievance under Article 3.",

However, the Court has already found that there are no guarantees that before proceeding with the expulsion the authorities would subject the applicant\u2019s claims under Article\u00a03 of the Convention to rigorous scrutiny (see paragraphs 105 and 106 above). More importantly, the Government did not point to any procedure whereby the applicant would be able to challenge their assessment of those claims. From the provisions of the Aliens Act 1998 and the regulations for its application it does not appear that it is possible to bring a separate legal challenge against the enforcement of the expulsion order, let alone that there exists an avenue of redress that meets the two requirements set out in paragraph 120 above. The Court would emphasise in that connection that the existence of remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, and that it falls to the respondent State to establish that (see, among other authorities, McFarlane v.

Any deprivation of liberty under the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) will be justified, however, only for as long as deportation or extradition proceedings are in progress. If such proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible under that provision (see, among other authorities, Chahal, \u00a7 113; A. and Others v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7 164; Mikolenko v. , no. 10664/05, \u00a7 63, 8 October 2009; and Raza, \u00a7 72, all cited above). In other words, the length of the detention should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, \u00a7 74 in fine, ECHR 2008...). Indeed, a similar point was recently made by the ECJ in relation to Article 15 of Directive 2008/115/EC (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above). It should, however, be pointed out that unlike that provision, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention does not contain maximum timelimits; the question whether the length of deportation proceedings could affect the lawfulness of detention under this provision thus depends solely on the particular circumstances of each case (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a015933/89, Commission decision of 14 January 1991, unreported, and Gordyeyev v.

As a result, the applicant spent exactly eighteen months in custody, the maximum period allowed by law. Contrary to what has been suggested by the Government, compliance with that timelimit, which is in any event exceptional (see paragraphs 47, 48, 50 and 51 above), cannot automatically be regarded as bringing the applicant\u2019s detention into line with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention.

While the Bulgarian authorities could not compel the issuing of such a document, there is no indication that they pursued the matter vigorously or endeavoured entering into negotiations with the Lebanese authorities with a view to expediting its delivery (see Raza, cited above, \u00a7 73; Tabesh v .Greece, no. 8256/07, \u00a7 56, 26 November 2009; and Louled Massoud v. , no. 24340/08, \u00a7 66, 27 July 2010).

Where deprivation of liberty is concerned, legal certainty must be strictly complied with in respect of each and every element relevant to the justification of the detention under domestic and Convention law.
