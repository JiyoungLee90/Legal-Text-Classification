The case originated in an application (no. 10277/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Mr Nicolae Constantinescu (“the applicant”), on 9 February 2004.
The applicant died on 30 March 2005. However, his widow, Ms Floarea Constantinescu, and his daughter, Ms Silvia Surcel, expressed their wish to pursue the application. For practical reasons Mr Nicolae Constantinescu will continue to be called “the applicant” in this judgment, although Ms Floarea Constantinescu and Ms Silvia Surcel are now to be regarded as such (Dalban v.  [GC], no. 28114/95, § 1, ECHR 1999VI).
The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Răzvan-Horaţiu Radu.
On 3 May 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1929 and lived in Sopot.
On 8 March 1994 the applicant, together with four relatives, lodged a civil action claiming restitutio in integrum of a mill, the property of their parents, which had been taken by the State in 1948.
Of the twenty-two hearings held between 6 April 1994 and
On 9 February 1996 the Craiova Court of First Instance (“the Court of First Instance”) rejected the action, considering that the mill had been nationalised in accordance with the law and that therefore the applicant and his relatives had no right of property.
The applicant and his relatives appealed. Of the twenty-four hearings held between 23 August 1996 and 14 May 1998 one was adjourned at the applicant’s request.
On 21 May 1998 the Dolj Regional Court (“the ”), taking into account the expert’s report produced during the appeal, dismissed the appeal as being groundless.
On 1 February 1999 the Craiova Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) by a final decision upheld the findings of the lower courts, considering that the nationalisation had been lawful.
The applicant and his relatives made use of extraordinary remedies and on 12 May 1999 the Court of Appeal allowed the application to set aside the final decision of 1 February 1999, quashed the previous judgments and sent the case back for fresh examination. The court noted that under Government Ordinance no. 447/1997 the Ministry of Finance should have been summoned to appear in the proceedings as the State’s representative.
During the retrial, of the twenty-five hearings held between 26 August 1999 and 21 January 2002 two were adjourned at the applicant’s request.
On 8 September 2000 the Court of First Instance held that it had no jurisdiction ratione materiae, considering the case to be within the competence of the . On 14 December 2000 the  also refused to exercise jurisdiction. Following the dispute as to jurisdiction, the Court of Appeal decided on 12 June 2001 that it was the Court of First Instance which had jurisdiction ratione materiae.
On 28 January 2002 the Court of First Instance, having regard to the two experts’ reports and to the witnesses produced during the retrial, upheld in part the action lodged by the applicant and his relatives, considering that the legal requirements for nationalisation had not been fulfilled and therefore the State had no valid title. The court granted restitutio in integrum in respect of the mill and of the appurtenant land.
The defendant party appealed. Of the eleven hearings held between 10 May 2002 and 14 February 2003 none was adjourned as a result of requests by the applicant. A new expert’s report was produced.
On 21 February 2003 the  allowed the appeal by the defendant and rejected on the merits the action lodged by the applicant and his relatives, considering that the nationalisation had been lawful. That decision was upheld on 7 October 2003 by a final decision of the Court of Appeal.
