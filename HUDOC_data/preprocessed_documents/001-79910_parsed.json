On 25\u00a0November 2005 the Parliamentary Commission for Human Rights adopted a report on the implementation of the National Plan of Action. Both those reports confirmed the insufficient funding and related deficiencies and the failure to implement fully the action plan in respect of most of the remand centres in Moldova, including Prison no. 3 in Chi\u015fin\u0103u. The first of these reports mentioned, inter alia, that \u201cas long as the aims and actions in [the National Plan of Action] do not have the necessary financial support ... it will remain only a good attempt of the State to observe human rights, described in Parliament Decision no. 415-XV of 24 October 2003, the fate of which is non-implementation, or partial implementation\u201d. On 28 December 2005 the Parliament adopted its decision no. 370-XVI \u201cConcerning the results of the verification by the special Parliament Commission regarding the situation of persons detained pending trial in the remand centre no. 13 of the Penitentiaries Department whose cases are pending before the courts\u201d. The decision found, inter alia, that \u201cthe activity of the Ministry of Justice in the field of ensuring conditions of detention does not correspond to the requirements of the legislation in force.\u201d",

In particular, the Court notes that the domestic courts gave no consideration to any of the applicants' arguments in their decisions, even though they were obliged to consider such factors under Article 176 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph\u00a024 above). Moreover, according to Article 186 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 24 above), prolongation of detention on remand is to be ordered only \u201cin exceptional circumstances\u201d. None of the courts prolonging the applicants' detention appears to have identified any exceptional circumstances requiring such a prolongation.\u00a0It is, moreover, surprising that it was only on 29 April 2005 that a court ordered the applicant's release on grounds which had been invoked by them from the outset of their detention (see paragraph 16 above).

The Bar's requests to verify the presence of interception devices in the glass partition was rejected by the CFECC administration (see paragraph 26 above), and that appears to have contributed to the lawyers' suspicion.
