The court also made reference to the investigative acts already carried out and gave a precise indication of the evidence that still had to be taken. Consequently, it decided that it was indispensable to separate the applicant from the other suspects, the witnesses and the evidence which had not yet been secured. The court also relied on the serious nature of the charges against the applicant and the severity of the penalty he faced. No special circumstances dictated the lifting of the detention.",

In this connection the Government submitted that in the period from 2000 to 2003 the number of persons serving a sentence for involvement in organised criminal activities had remained relatively stable in Poland, representing on average only 0.016% of all those serving a sentence at that time. Since 2004, there had been a significant increase in the number of sentences relating to organised criminal activities. In the period up to 2000 the total number of those serving a sentence for organised criminal activities had been significantly lower. For example, in 1998 and 1999 only seven and eighteen persons respectively had been given a prison sentence for such crimes. According to the Government, several procedural problems tended to arise in cases relating to organised criminal activities. Such cases were complex by nature, as they typically involved the investigation of an activity carried out by a gang, and that in turn involved the examination of offences committed by several persons. The trial and pre-trial material was often voluminous and the legal and factual assessment required considerable time and effort. In many such cases evidence had to be taken from anonymous witnesses. The trial court had to guarantee both the anonymity of such witnesses and the rights of the accused. There were often problems due to the presence at the hearings of the accused or their legal representatives, including defence counsel and witnesses, as they were often interested in slowing down the process and, as a consequence, the trial court could not carry out the appropriate measures as planned. There were also many logistical problems, as the witnesses and accused, mostly belonging to the same or competing gangs of organised criminals in detention, required isolation both within the relevant detention facility and while being transported. Their relatively large number, coupled with the need to provide appropriate security, meant that they had to be placed in different detention centres. Even persons detained in the same facility had to be transported and brought to the courtroom separately, requiring additional manpower and equipment. In addition, not all courts had at their disposal appropriate facilities both to ensure the isolation of those being brought to court and to allow the police to guarantee the security of all the parties involved. This was particularly true of many district courts.",

It is for this reason that the lawyer-client relationship is, in principle, privileged. Similar considerations apply to a prisoner's correspondence with a lawyer concerning contemplated or pending proceedings where the need for confidentiality is equally pressing. That such correspondence be susceptible to routine scrutiny, is not in keeping with the principles of confidentiality and professional privilege attaching to relations between a lawyer and his client. In the Campbell v\u00a0the  judgment of 25 March 1992 Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0233, par.\u00a048, the Court found no reason to distinguish between the different categories of correspondence with lawyers which, whatever their purpose, concern matters of a private and confidential character.

On the other hand, it considers that the applicant has suffered non-pecuniary damage on account of the interference with his correspondence which is not sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation of the Convention. Considering the circumstances of the case, and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR\u00a0500 under this head.",
