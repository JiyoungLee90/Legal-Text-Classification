The case originated in three applications (nos. 59609/17, 74677/17 and 76379/17) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Tajik nationals and one Uzbek national (“the applicants”) on various dates, as indicated in the appendix.
The applicants were represented by various lawyers, as also indicated in the appendix. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr M. Galperin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On various dates requests lodged by the applicants for interim measures preventing their removal to their respective countries of origin were granted by the Court under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. The applications were also granted priority (Rule 41) and confidentiality (Rule 33) and the applicants were granted anonymity (Rule 47 § 4).
The applicants submitted complaints under Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention in connection with the pending removal to their countries of origin.
On 12 January 2018 notice of the above complaints was given to the Government and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible.
On 16 July 2018 the applicant’s representative in the case I.N v. Russia, no. 76379/17 informed the Court that the applicant did not wish to maintain his complaint under Article 3 of the Convention, while maintaining his complaint under Article 5 of the Convention. He further requested that the previously indicated interim measure be discontinued. On 29 October 2018 the Court decided to discontinue the indication of the interim measure in the applicant’s case.
The applicants are nationals of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Their initials, dates of birth, the dates on which their applications were lodged, the application numbers, as well as the particulars of the domestic proceedings and other relevant information are set out in the appendix.
On various dates the applicants were charged in their countries of origin with religious and politically motivated crimes, their pre-trial detention was ordered in absentia, and international search warrants were issued by the authorities.
Subsequently, the Russian authorities took final decisions to remove (that is to say extradite or expel) the applicants, despite consistent claims that in the event of removal the applicants would face a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.
The relevant domestic and international law is summarised in the Court’s judgments on removal from Russia to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan (see Savriddin Dzhurayev v. Russia, no. 71386/10, §§ 70101, ECHR 2013 (extracts), and Akram Karimov v. Russia, no. 62892/12, §§ 69-105, 28 May 2014).
The relevant reports by UN agencies and international NGOs on the situation in Tajikistan were cited in the case of K.I. v. Russia (no. 58182/14, §§ 2-28, 7 November 2017) and on the situation in Uzbekistan in the cases of Kholmurodov v. Russia (no. 58923/14, §§ 46-50, 1 March 2016), and T.M. and Others v. Russia ([Committee], no. 31189/15, § 28, 7 November 2017).
