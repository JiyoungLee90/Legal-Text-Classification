The case originated in an application (no. 59955/15) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Robert Zaręba (“the applicant”), on 13 November 2015.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Chrzanowska, and subsequently by Mr J. Sobczak, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 18 January 2017 notice of the complaint concerning conditions of detention was given to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1971 and is currently detained in Garbalin Prison.
The facts of the case were not in dispute and may be summarised as follows.
The applicant was detained in Łódź Remand Centre from January 2007 until at least the date on which he extended his claim lodged with the domestic courts, that is to say until 12 March 2013 (see paragraph 10 below).
The applicant submitted that during his detention in Łódź Remand Centre he had been held in overcrowded cells in which the space per person had been below the Polish statutory minimum standard of 3 sq. m.
The domestic courts found, without giving any further details, that the applicant had often been detained in overcrowded cells (meaning with less than the statutory minimum of 3 sq. m per person) between January 2007 and May 2009.
The courts established, in particular, that the applicant had been detained in cell no. 151 (11.23 sq. m) between 28 August and 20 October 2009 (one month and twenty-two days) shared by four prisoners, and then also on 21 October 2009 in a cell of 12.05 sq. m shared by five prisoners. The applicant submitted that the cells had not been properly ventilated, there had been fungus on the walls and the windows had been leaky.
On 7 May 2012 the applicant brought a civil action for infringement of his personal rights on account of the inadequate living conditions in Łódź Remand Centre between January 2007 until the date of lodging his action with the court. On 12 March 2013 he extended his claim for a further period from February 2012 until March 2013. The applicant argued that he had been detained in overcrowded cells below the statutory minimum standard. He claimed 82,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) (approximately 20,500 euros (EUR)) in compensation.
On 13 August 2013 the Łódź Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) awarded the applicant PLN 1,000 (approximately EUR 250) in compensation and dismissed the remainder of his action. The domestic court found that the applicant had been detained in overcrowded cells between 28 August and 21 October 2009 (one month and twenty-three days). The court considered that, although the defendant’s actions had been unlawful and the conditions difficult, the compensation awarded had been sufficient.
On 3 April 2014 the Łódź Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) dismissed appeals by the applicant and the defendant, holding that the firstinstance court had correctly established the circumstances of the case, had properly assessed the evidence and had awarded sufficient compensation.
On 11 June 2015 the Supreme Court refused to entertain a cassation appeal lodged by the applicant.
A detailed description of the relevant domestic law and practice concerning general rules governing conditions of detention in Poland and domestic remedies available to detainees alleging inadequate conditions, is set out in the Court’s pilot judgments in the cases of Orchowski v. Poland (no. 17885/04), and Norbert Sikorski v. Poland (no. 17599/05) adopted on 22 October 2009 (see §§ 75-85 and §§ 45-88 respectively). More recent developments are described in the Court’s decision in the case of Łatak v. Poland (no. 52070/08, 12 October 2010, §§ 25-54).
