It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A premature expression of such an opinion by the tribunal itself will inevitably run foul of the said presumption (see, among other authorities, Deweer v.

It has acknowledged that in cases where an applicant was an important political figure at the time of the alleged offence the highest State officials, including the Prosecutor General, were required to keep the public informed of the alleged offence and the ensuing criminal proceedings. However, this circumstance could not justify any use of words chosen by the officials in their interviews with the press (see Butkevi\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, \u00a7\u00a050, ECHR 2002II (extracts)). The Court has emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence. Nevertheless, whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see, inter alia, Adolf v. Austria, judgment of 26\u00a0March 1982, Series A no. 49, pp. 17-19, \u00a7\u00a7 36-41 and Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7 41). In any event, the opinions expressed cannot amount to declarations by a public official of the applicant\u2019s guilt which would encourage the public to believe him or her guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Butkevi\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7 53)",

The Government argued that, having regard to the overall context of that decision, the Court of Appeal had referred to the existence of evidence pointing to a likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences in issue, and not to the question of his guilt or innocence. However, the Court emphasises that there is a fundamental distinction to be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear judicial declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that the individual has committed the crime in question (Matija\u0161evi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a048).
