However, the Court considers that that ground gradually lost its force and relevance as the proceedings progressed. In particular, given the absence of any further attempt on the part of the applicant to obstruct the proceedings, it is difficult to accept that circumstance could justify the conclusion that the risk of his interfering with the proper course of the proceedings persisted during the entire period that he spent in custody (see, mutatis mutandis, Harazin v. , no.\u00a038227/02, \u00a7\u00a042, 10\u00a0January 2006).
