It emphasised that it was not necessary to present all of the relevant information to the applicant.

Without such an assessment the examination by a court of the applicant\u2019s case would constitute a pure formality, which would be contrary to Article 5 of the Convention. Furthermore, the State Court\u2019s examination of the possibility to apply other less strict preventive measure had involved the assessment of general and abstract arguments, without any further consideration. The Appeals Chamber invited the State Court to examine that possibility in the light of the circumstances of the case \u2013 in particular, the length of the applicant\u2019s detention, the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances and the evidence related to national security.",

Furthermore, the applicant had submitted certain documents (written statements, letters and so on) for the first time at the hearing of 23 May 2014, even though it was apparent that he had had them before. Having assessed the reasons given by the Aliens Service and the Ministry of Security, the content of the classified and open evidence, and the applicant\u2019s arguments, the court concluded that there still existed reasonable doubt as to whether or not the applicant posed a threat to national security and that the imposition of a less strict preventive measure was not justified, given the particular circumstances of the case. The State Court concluded that there had been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The court furthermore held that, contrary to the applicant\u2019s arguments that he feared criminal prosecution in Syria, it was evident from the case file that his family was very influential and close to Bashar Al Assad\u2019s regime. Many members of the applicant\u2019s family occupied high positions in government. His brother was a retired colonel in the Syrian Security Forces. Moreover, on 3 April 2007 the applicant had obtained a passport from the Syrian Embassy in Belgrade. The court concluded that in the prevailing circumstances there were no longer any obstacles to the applicant\u2019s deportation to Syria. Lastly, the court assessed the Ministry of Security\u2019s efforts in finding a safe third country and concluded that it had acted diligently and in close cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The court noted in particular that the deportation order had been issued on 1 February 2011 (see paragraph 14 above) and that the applicant had been detained with a view to deportation for more than three years, and on national-security grounds for more than five years. During that time no criminal proceedings had been opened against him. Furthermore, the open evidence presented to the applicant was widely known as it had already been published in the media. The deportation order was unlikely to be enforced: the relevant authorities had contacted more than thirty countries, but none of them had agreed to accept the applicant. Moreover, it was apparent from the case file that the National Security Agency did not have any new evidence that would justify the applicant\u2019s continued detention. The evidence on which his continued detention was based was the same as that which had been cited as justification for his initial detention. The court furthermore added that a concern that the applicant could pose a threat to national security, without any new evidence, was not enough to draw a reasonable conclusion regarding the actual threat that he represented. A detention based solely on security grounds was contrary to Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The administrative authorities had not justified their conclusion concerning the persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the applicant would pose a risk to national security if released. Furthermore, their examination of the possibility to apply less strict preventive measures had involved general and abstract arguments, without any further explanation being given. The court ordered the Aliens Service to examine such a possibility in the light of the arguments presented in its judgment.",

Furthermore, the applicant submitted that a preventive measure that included a prohibition on his leaving his registered place of residence, which was in Ilid\u017ea, would not have been suitable for him because he needed the services of a medical-care service located in Sarajevo.

Italy (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a0180, ECHR\u00a02006V, and Rooman v. Belgium [GC], no. 18052/11, \u00a7 129, 31\u00a0January 2019). The redress afforded by the national authorities must be appropriate and sufficient (see Kudi\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no.\u00a028971/05, \u00a7 17, 9\u00a0December 2008). Furthermore, the Court has already had occasion to indicate in the context of different Convention Articles that an applicant\u2019s \u201cvictim\u201d status may also depend on the level of compensation awarded at domestic level, where appropriate, or at least on the possibility of seeking and obtaining compensation for the damage sustained, having regard to the facts about which he or she complains before the Court (see Kuri\u0107 and Others v. Slovenia [GC], no. 26828/06, \u00a7 262, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). In respect of a complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1, the Court has held that in specific circumstances it can accept that the existence of a clear and established avenue under domestic law under which an adequate amount of compensation can be claimed may constitute sufficient redress within the meaning of the Court\u2019s case-law on Article 34 of the Convention (see Klinkel v. Germany (dec.), no. 47156/16, \u00a7 29, 11 December 2018).",

Such acknowledgement opened up the possibility for the applicant of claiming compensation in a separate set of proceedings. The 2003 Civil Proceedings Code provides for an action for the protection of personality rights before the State Court and the general rules of tort law provide for an action for damages for the breach of liberty and other personality rights (see paragraphs 82 and 83 above). In these circumstances, the Court finds that the applicant could reasonably have been expected to turn to the domestic courts to obtain compensation for the acknowledged breach of his rights under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, rather than turning to this Court to seek confirmation of the already recognised unlawfulness of his detention (see Klinkel, cited above, \u00a7 30).",

In such circumstances, it had been clear that no country would have an interest in accepting him on its territory. Furthermore, requests for the applicant to be admitted to other countries had always been sent only a few days before the Aliens Service had been due to examine and extend his detention. Therefore, it was evident that the deportation proceedings had not been pursued with due diligence and that the domestic authorities had not acted in good faith. Moreover, the domestic authorities had contacted the Syrian Embassy in Belgrade in 2014, asking it to accept the applicant, despite their already having guaranteed that he would not be expelled to his country of origin. The applicant furthermore alleged that since 8 November 2007 he had been a stateless person (see paragraph 74 above).",

Any deprivation of liberty under the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) will be justified, however, only for as long as deportation or extradition proceedings are in progress. If such proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f). The deprivation of liberty must also be \u201clawful\u201d. Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is at issue, including the question of whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1, and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention. To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention should be appropriate; and the length of the detention should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a03455/05, \u00a7\u00a0164, ECHR 2009).",
