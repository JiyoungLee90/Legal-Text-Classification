The Court has always held that a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his victim status unless the national authorities have acknowledged the alleged breach and afforded appropriate and sufficient redress (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0180 and 193, ECHR 2006V). One of the features of such redress is the amount awarded by the national authorities (see Kudi\u0107 v. , no. 28971/05, \u00a7 17, 9 December 2008). While it is true that the national authorities expressly acknowledged the breach alleged in the present case, the applicants were not able to obtain any compensation in respect of the delayed enforcement of the judgments (paragraph 7 above). Therefore, they may still claim to be victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention in relation to the period during which the judgments remained unenforced (see Dubenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a074221/01, \u00a7 36, 11 January 2005).",
