Since the Association for Home Visits to the Sick and Housebound had stopped visiting, the problem was unresolved, particularly as the applicant refused to go into the S. Nursing Home voluntarily. In respect of the second ground, the Appeals Commission considered that \u201cduring the hearing it had come to the conclusion that the applicant had a mental disability (senile dementia)\u201d (Geistesschw\u00e4che (altersbedingte Demenz)). In view of that disability, the Appeals Commission considered that the applicant's placement in a nursing home \u201cwould be justified even if it was considered that the degree of neglect was not sufficiently serious\u201d.

All the circumstances of her case had to be considered, in particular the nature and duration of the alleged deprivation, its intensity, and the manner in which it was effected. In the present case, the S. Nursing Home was an open institution with complete freedom of movement, to the extent that the applicant was able to occupy herself. The applicant, who was never in the secure ward, was free to have personal contacts, write letters or make telephone calls. The only limitation on the applicant was that she had to respect the hours fixed for the necessary medical treatment. From the outset, the applicant herself did not regard the placement in the nursing home as a deprivation of liberty and, before the Appeals Commission, she even welcomed the assistance given to her. In the meantime, she had agreed to stay in the nursing home of her own free will. As a result, the applicant's freedom of movement was, in fact, enhanced thanks to the care provided in the home.",

Rather, account had to be taken of whether he or she could still lead a normal life, and the adverse effects his or her not being able to do so would have on that person or others. The question was not whether the person concerned was of fixed abode, but whether the accommodation prevented him or her from receiving proper care. Similarly, in addition to financial means, account had to be taken of the person's need to lead a dignified life, degree of integration into a social network and state of health.

Like Judge Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson, I find that the circumstances of the present case differ from those in Nielsen v. Denmark (judgment of 28 November 1988, Series A no. 144). The factual basis of the latter case was the placement of a 12-year-old boy in the psychiatric ward of a hospital at the request of the mother, who had sole parental rights. Such a situation cannot be compared with the placement of an adult against her will in a nursing home, which was what happened in the present case. The Court considered that the facts in Nielsen amounted to an exercise of parental rights by the mother, not a restriction on freedom of movement by the State (loc. cit., pp. 23 et seq., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a063 et seq.). In so far as the Court went on to state that the restriction involved in the child's placement in a secure psychiatric ward did not amount to a deprivation of liberty, this statement (which has been subject to certain extra-judicial criticism [See Harris, O'Boyle and Warbrick, Law of the European Convention on Human Rights, p. 101, and Karen Reid, \u201cArticle 25 of the Convention: Applications by Children\u201d, in The Birth of European Human Rights Law]) is linked to the particular facts and circumstances of that case and, specifically, the fact that the decision to hospitalise the child was taken by the mother in the exercise of her parental rights (ibid., pp. 26-27, \u00a7\u00a7 72-73) [\u201cIt must be possible for a child like the applicant to be admitted to hospital at the request of the holder of parental rights, a case which clearly is not covered by paragraph 1 of Article 5\u201d (Nielsen, p. 26, \u00a7 72)]; Nielsen is again clearly distinguishable from the present case.",

In its decision, the Appeals Commission considered that \u201cduring the hearing it had come to the conclusion that the applicant had a mental disability (senile dementia)\u201d. However, firstly, such a conclusion was not, as already pointed out above, the result of a diagnosis by a medical expert on completion of a proper medical examination of the applicant. Secondly, \u201cmental disability\u201d and \u201csenile dementia\u201d are general terms which may or may not coincide with a state of \u201cunsound mind\u201d, depending on the precise nature and gravity of their symptoms and effects. Moreover, no relevant information was given by the Appeals Commission in their decision, presumably because no such information was obtained by them in the absence of a proper medical examination of the applicant. Incidentally, a finding to the effect that the applicant was of \u201cunsound mind\u201d sits ill with the fact set out in paragraph 27 of the judgment that \u201cOn 14 January 1998 the Aarberg District Government Office lifted the applicant's placement order as she had agreed to reside in the nursing home of her own free will\u201d (emphasis added).",
