The applicant spent most of the day in the cell, which measured 1.9\u00a0by 3.7\u00a0metres. The cell was located in the basement and so was exposed to hardly any daylight or fresh air, while the electric light was dim and there was no artificial ventilation. The cell lacked basic furniture and appliances, such as cupboards, a mirror or a rubbish bin. The toilet was some 1.2 metres from the dining table and was not separated from the living quarters. It smelled of excrement and was frequently flooded. The premises were infested with rats and were never disinfected. The detainees had very limited access to news and information about the outside world, the only source being a radio, which was turned on by the guards for a limited part of each weekday and was turned off completely at weekends. The food was meagre and consisted mostly of bread and wheat cereal. On numerous occasions the applicant\u2019s requests for medical treatment for the after-effects of a head injury he had sustained in 2001 and for elevated blood pressure were ignored or rejected. Likewise, a request by the applicant to be placed in a solitary cell on account of his unstable psychological state was refused.",

The dimensions of the bunks used in SIZO\u00a0no.\u00a03 were 1.85\u00a0metres by 0.70\u00a0metres. The basement cells, where the life prisoners were held, had windows measuring 1.10\u00a0meters by 1 meter, which afforded sufficient access to daylight. In the evenings the cells were lit by 100-watt bulbs, which enabled the detainees to read and write without damaging their eyes. Each window had a special ventilation pane which could be opened to air the cells. In addition, an electric ventilator in the corridor ensured artificial ventilation of the cells. The cells had radiators to ensure a stable temperature of between 18C and 20C. Each cell was equipped with two metal bunks, a chair, a shelf for personal belongings, a table, two small cupboards (which could also be used as stools for sitting on), a clothes hanger, a tap with a sink, a mirror, and a toilet. The toilets had \u201cU-bend\u201d pipes to prevent unpleasant odours; they were separated from the living area by fixed partitions.",

Before the case was communicated, the applicant submitted minimal factual details and provided no documentary evidence that would have enabled the Court to establish the relevant facts.

At the same time, the Court notes that an applicant must provide an elaborate and consistent account of the conditions of his or her detention mentioning the specific elements, which would enable the Court to determine that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded or inadmissible on any other grounds. Only a credible and reasonably detailed description of the allegedly inhuman or degrading conditions of detention constitutes a prima facie case of ill-treatment and serves as a basis for giving notice of the complaint to the respondent Government (see Ananyev and Others v.

Each inmate therefore had some 3.5 square metres of personal space (including the space occupied by furniture and fixtures), which is less than the minimum standard recommended for Ukraine by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (see Davydov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0107).

Given that, according to the case file, the applicant and his mother abundantly corresponded with the prosecutor\u2019s office regarding a variety of matters concerning the conditions of his detention, it appears that they had ample opportunities to pursue any complaint, and, if necessary, to follow up on a matter, which, in their view, had been overlooked or mishandled by the addressee.

He noted that this detention facility was located some 1,000 kilometres from Simferopol, where his parents lived. Travelling by public transport from Simferopol to Gubnyk involved rides in two trains, followed by either an unreliable bus or a costly taxi. The overall journey took some twenty-four hours, one way \u2013 which was impossible for the applicant\u2019s stepfather (who was born in 1925 and suffered from advanced disability). His mother, born in 1940, also suffered from various health problems. Taking a two-day multi-leg journey to attend a meeting with her son lasting several hours was an exhausting endeavour for her. It also involved a serious financial outlay and the need to make special care arrangements for her disabled husband during her absence. Accordingly, in spite of the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s strong desire to maintain close contact with him, she could not afford to visit him four times a year, as permitted by law (two times a year before 2010). Between 2007 and 2015 the applicant received only seven visits from his mother and no visits whatsoever from other family members.",

Italy (dec.), no.\u00a040750/98, 6 April 2000). However, it is inconceivable that prisoners should forfeit all of their Article 8 rights merely because of their status as persons detained following conviction (see, for example, Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos.\u00a011082/06 and\u00a013772/05, \u00a7 836, 25 July 2013). An essential element of a prisoner\u2019s right to respect for his or her family life is that the prison authorities should assist him or her in maintaining contact with close family members (see, for example, Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no.\u00a025498/94, \u00a7\u00a061, ECHR 2000-X). Detaining an individual in a prison which is so far from his or her family as to render family visits very difficult or even impossible may in certain circumstances constitute disproportionate interference with family life (see, for example, Vintman (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a078 and 103-104). While the Court has accepted that the domestic authorities must enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in matters relating to the execution of sentences, the distribution of the prison population should not remain entirely at the discretion of the administrative bodies. The interests of prisoners in maintaining at least some family and social ties must somehow be taken into account (see, for example, Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0836838 and 850).",

There is no appearance that they attempted, in any meaningful way, to consider the applicant\u2019s and his mother\u2019s arguments concerning their personal situation, including serious health-related and budgetary constraints on the applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 ability to travel in order to visit him in the Ladyzhynska Colony. The Court observes that the aforementioned circumstances giving rise to the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention in the present case are very similar to those that served as a basis for the finding of a violation of that provision in the aforementioned Vintman case (cited above, see\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a0100-104).
