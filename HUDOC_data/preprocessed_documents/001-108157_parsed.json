He also accepted that SH\u2019s father was \u201cknown\u201d by armed factions; was without any existing political party or tribal protection in Afghanistan; was living outside Afghanistan; and would be at risk upon return.

The Immigration Judge acknowledged that the applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s asylum appeal had been successful in 2004 because the Adjudicator had accepted that his father had occupied a position of prominence and a high-ranking position within the PDPA. Nevertheless, the Immigration Judge referred to the later AIT country guideline determination of SO and SO (KhaD \u2013 members and family) Afghanistan CG [2006] UKAIT 00003 (see paragraphs 24-25 below) and found that there were differences between the claims of the two brothers, including the fact that the applicant had never been involved in any political activity, whilst his brother had carried out some activities on behalf of their father which might have drawn the authorities\u2019 attention to him. In addition, the Immigration Judge did not accept that their father continued to be politically active or to have a high profile in Afghanistan, because the only evidence of any political activity related to events over 17 years previously, prior to 1992, when the applicant had still been a small child, and politics and personnel in Afghanistan had changed since that time. Even if his father had continued to be politically active, the Immigration Judge did not accept that the Afghan authorities or warlords would have any adverse interest in the applicant, given his lack of political profile and education; his age on leaving Afghanistan; the fact that he had only been a small child when his father had been politically active; and recent political developments in Afghanistan.",

Even if his brother FH had died, the Immigration Judge did not accept that he had been killed by the Mujaheddin, given that the applicant himself had stated that he did not know who had killed him but thought it was the Mujaheddin.

Furthermore, it could not be said that former membership of Khadimat-e-Atalat-e Dawlati (\u201cKhaD\u201d - the secret service wing of the Communist PDPA regime in Afghanistan until 1992) or the PDPA would generally suffice to establish a risk of persecution or treatment contrary to Article 3 on return unless an individual had personally crossed or had had \u201cconcrete conflicts\u201d with people who were now in power. In that context, the AIT considered that past or present personal conflicts were more important than political conflicts.

The PDPA eventually split into the Khalq (People) and Parcham (Flag) branches.

The Court acknowledges that, owing to the special situation in which asylum seekers often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assessing the credibility of their statements and the documents submitted in support thereof. However, when information is presented which gives strong reasons to question the veracity of an asylum seeker\u2019s submissions, the individual must provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies (see, among other authorities, N. v. , no. 23505/09, \u00a7\u00a053, 20 July 2010 and Collins and Akasiebie v. Sweden (dec.), no.\u00a023944/05, 8\u00a0March\u00a02007).",

If an applicant has not yet been extradited or deported when the Court examines the case, the relevant time will be that of the proceedings before the Court (see Saadi v. Italy, cited above, \u00a7 133). A full and ex nunc assessment is called for as the situation in a country of destination may change over the course of time. Even though the historical position is of interest insofar as it may shed light on the current situation and its likely evolution, it is the present conditions which are decisive and it is therefore necessary to take into account information that has come to light since the final decision taken by the domestic authorities (see Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, no. 1948/04, \u00a7\u00a0136, ECHR 2007I (extracts)).",

Furthermore, the applicant has not claimed that he has ever had any role in, or knowledge of, his father\u2019s political activities.

In addition, the AIT did not accept that the applicant\u2019s father had continued to be politically active or to have had a high profile in , because the only evidence of any political activity related to events prior to 1992.

Indeed, the Court notes that the only evidence regarding the same is the unsupported assertions in the applicant\u2019s and his father\u2019s witness statements. Even having regard to the special situation in which asylum seekers often find themselves, and the need to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assessing their credibility, the Court is not convinced that, in the present case, a bare assertion can be considered to be sufficient to establish that his father is still politically active or has a public profile in Afghanistan such as to give rise to any risk upon return to the applicant. In that regard, the Court considers it to be relevant that none of the witness statements submitted from any of the members of the former PDPA Government members (see paragraph 39 above) indicate or make any reference to any continuing activism or political role on the part of the applicant\u2019s father post 1992. Furthermore, if the applicant\u2019s father had continued to make radio, television or any other public statements condemning members of the current Government, the Court considers that the applicant would have been able to refer to the same or submit some form of evidence regarding the same to support those assertions. The fact that no such material is available suggests to the Court that, even if his father may have remained politically active in some way whilst living in the Russian Federation, such activities are not publicised and are therefore unlikely to be known in Afghanistan or elsewhere. Furthermore, his father\u2019s apparently voluntary return to Afghanistan, on one trip since 1992 (see paragraph 14 above), without encountering any difficulties there, corroborates the view that his father was of no adverse interest in .",

In his submissions before the Court, the applicant argued that, given FH\u2019s lack of political profile, there could be no reason for his having been killed other than due to his relationship with their father (see paragraph 40 above). The Court notes that there is no evidence before it regarding FH\u2019s death, how he died or the circumstances of his death which would indicate that he was killed by any particular person in Afghanistan or that his death would have any significance for the assessment of the risk to the applicant upon return to .

It is therefore necessary to take into account information which has come to light since the final decision was taken by the domestic authorities. In that regard, the Court recognises that the July 2009 UNHCR Guidelines (see paragraphs 30-31 above), whilst acknowledging that many former PDPA members would not generally be at risk in Afghanistan, also indicated that, depending on the individual\u2019s personal circumstances, certain high-ranking PDPA members and their family members may be at risk of persecution in Afghanistan if they were known, had a public profile and were without any factional support in Afghanistan. Indeed, it was on that basis that the applicant\u2019s brother, SH, was granted refugee status in the  in 2004 after the IAA had found that he had fallen \u201cfairly and squarely\u201d within the protection category set out by the UNHCR Guidelines in place at that time. The Court also takes heed of the AIT country guideline determination of SO and SO from 2006 (see paragraphs 24-25 above) which found similarly, in light of the UNHCR Guidelines and other evidence, that the risk to persons with a connection with the PDPA had to be considered by weighing up a number of factors including past or present personal conflicts.",

The Court acknowledges that the UNHCR Guidelines do not necessarily provide an exhaustive list of risk categories. Nevertheless, the Court considers that the omission of PDPA members and, more critically, UNHCR\u2019s own change in their position between July 2009 and December 2010, is significant. It indicates that former PDPA members are no longer considered to be at risk in . Indeed, the Court considers that the lack of other background evidence indicating that PDPA members continue to be at risk upon return to Afghanistan to the present day further corroborates that position. Having regard to all of the above, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant, who was never a PDPA member himself but merely a family member of a former PDPA member who had left Afghanistan 19 years ago, has demonstrated that he would be at risk upon return.",
