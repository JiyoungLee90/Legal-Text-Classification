This obligation is not confined to cases where it has been established that the death was caused by an agent of the State. The mere fact that the authorities have been informed of the death will give rise ipso facto to an obligation under Article\u00a02 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances in which it occurred (see Sabuktekin v. Turkey, no.\u00a027243/95, \u00a7\u00a098, ECHR 2002II; Kavak v. Turkey, no. 53489/99, \u00a7 45, 6\u00a0July 2006; and Al Fayed v. France (dec.), no. 38501/02, 27 September 2007). The investigation must be capable of establishing the cause of the injuries and the identification of those responsible with a view to their punishment. Where a death results, the investigation assumes even greater importance, given that the essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life (see mutatis mutandis, Paul and Audrey Edwards v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2002II).",

On each occasion they ordered the investigator to reopen the procedure and conduct further inquiries into what were clearly material issues. As a result, the investigation lasted approximately two and a half years. The Court stresses the requirement of reasonable expedition in cases concerning loss of life. The investigation did indeed commence promptly, but the time taken for it to finally conclude \u2013 two years and five months \u2013 cannot be justified by its complexity or any objective difficulties. The applicant therefore had grounds to question to diligence of the authorities, all the more so since she unsuccessfully complained about the delay and received no reply (see paragraph 16 above).",

The Court has stressed on many occasions that the involvement of the next-of-kin serves to ensure public accountability of the authorities and public scrutiny of their actions in such situations (see Ramsahai and Others v. the  [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 321, ECHR 2007II), to the extent necessary to safeguard the person\u2019s legitimate interests. In this case, the applicant had a strong and legitimate interest in the conduct of the investigation which would have been served by granting her the special status under the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 21 above; see also Gu\u0163u v. Moldova, no. 20289/02, \u00a7 61, 7 June 2007 and M\u0103t\u0103saru and Savi\u0163chi v. Moldova, no. 38281/08, \u00a7 90, 2 November 2010 concerning the procedural shortcomings where no proper criminal investigation is initiated). The Court does not accept the Government\u2019s argument on this point, namely that it is only once the investigation has established that a crime has been committed that the next-of-kin can be recognised as having the right to participate in the proceedings in the victim\u2019s stead. The Court would emphasise that Article 2 requires more than merely informing the next-of-kin of the progress of the investigation: it includes their active involvement in it (see Salg\u0131n v. , no. 46748/99, \u00a7\u00a089, 20\u00a0February 2007). The Court finds that this was not done for the applicant. Moreover, substantial delays in involving the next-of-kin in investigative procedures are not acceptable (see Mikayil Mammadov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 4762/05, \u00a7\u00a0132, 17 December 2009, and Anusca v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 24034/07, \u00a7 44, 18\u00a0May 2010).",
