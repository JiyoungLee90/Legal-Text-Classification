The pressing social need to preserve public order cannot be invoked, since the measure concerned amounted to an aggravation of the criminal penalty imposed on Mr Boujlifa in relation to those imposed on French nationals, so that it is discriminatory. It is also incompatible with the objective of promoting the social rehabilitation of offenders.
