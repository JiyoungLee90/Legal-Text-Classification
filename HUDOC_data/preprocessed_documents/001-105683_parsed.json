He had immediately rushed to the scene. The area had been cordoned off by armed masked men, who had refused to answer questions. He had followed two of these men to the yard of the Bagalayev family, where he had heard children crying. The witness had rushed to the summer house, where he had found Mamed Bagalayev bleeding and with a weak pulse, and his brother and sister next to him. The witness had carried Mamed outside and had taken him to the Shali hospital, where Mamed had died. When the witness had been leaving the yard, he had seen an APC and a GAZ-53 lorry, both full of armed servicemen in camouflage uniforms, leaving the scene. He had immediately recognised the GAZ-53 lorry, as it had belonged to the factory. According to the witness, the military servicemen had not prevented him from accessing the summer house and taking the boy to the hospital.

However, this allegation was not specific and the Government did not submit any material to support it. The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s allegation that the vehicles, firearms and camouflage uniforms had probably been illegally obtained by the perpetrators. Nevertheless, it considers it very unlikely that the GAZ-53 lorry, which had been taken away from its driver by military servicemen on the day of the events, could have been unlawfully possessed by members of illegal armed groups and could have driven around freely in Shali on the same date with an APC without being noticed. The Court would stress in this regard that the evaluation of the evidence and the establishment of the facts is a matter for the Court, and it is incumbent on it to decide on the evidentiary value of the documents submitted to it (see \u00c7elikbilek v. Turkey, no.\u00a027693/95, \u00a7\u00a071, 31\u00a0May 2005).",

It finds that the fact that a large group of armed men in uniform in broad daylight, equipped with an APC and a lorry, were able to drive around the town and open fire without being afraid of being heard by local law-enforcement authorities strongly supports the allegation that these were military servicemen conducting a security operation. In their submissions to the authorities, the applicant and the witnesses to the events consistently maintained that Mamed Bagalayev had been shot by unknown military servicemen (see paragraphs 19, 42, 55, 56, 64-67, 71, 77-80 above). On numerous occasions the applicant and her lawyer requested that the investigation look into that possibility. The domestic investigation accepted these factual assumptions and took steps to check whether military servicemen were involved in Mamed Bagalayev\u2019s killing (see paragraphs 59 and 73 above), but it appears that no serious investigative steps were taken in that direction.",

However, after that, a number of very important steps were either delayed (for example, the key witnesses to the events were questioned only in June 2006 \u2013 that is, almost three years later (see paragraphs 92 and 93 above)) or not taken at all. In particular, the Court notes that, as can be seen from the orders of the supervising prosecutors and the decisions of domestic courts, the investigators failed to take a number of the most essential steps such as identification of the military unit stationed on the premises of the former food factory in Shali and questioning of a number of witnesses, including the ROVD officers, the applicants\u2019 neighbours and the military command in Shali. Further, the investigators failed to carry out an autopsy of Mamed Bagalayev\u2019s body or order a ballistic expert examination of the cartridges collected from the scene; they neither elucidated the circumstances under which the tailgate of the GAZ-53 lorry had disappeared from the investigation file nor found out how the lorry had been returned to its owners (see paragraphs 67, 104, 107 and 119 above). It is obvious that these measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced.

The Court observes that the applicant did, in fact, make use of that remedy, which eventually led to the resumption of the investigation. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined in its early stages by the authorities\u2019 failure to take necessary and urgent investigative measures. Moreover, the domestic court\u2019s instructions to the prosecutor\u2019s office to investigate the crime effectively did not bring any tangible results for the applicant. The investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, but it appears that no significant investigative steps were taken to identify those responsible for the murder of Mamed Bagalayev. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant could not be required to challenge in court every single decision of the investigative authorities. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their objection as regards the applicant\u2019s failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

Turkey, no. 30949/96, \u00a7\u00a0135, 31 May 2005) or to cases of unjustified use of lethal force by State agents (see Isayeva and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 57947/00, 57948/00 and 57949/00, \u00a7 229, 24 February 2005), as opposed to the relatives of the victims of enforced disappearances. The latter approach is exercised by the Court in view of the continuous nature of the psychological suffering of applicants whose relatives have disappeared and their resulting inability for a prolonged period of time to find out what happened to them (see, among many other authorities, Bazorkina, cited above, \u00a7 141; Imakayeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0166; and Luluyev and Others v.
