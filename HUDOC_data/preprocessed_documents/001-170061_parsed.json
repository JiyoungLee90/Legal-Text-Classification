In those cases, the applicants complained of particular circumstances which had affected them personally as individuals and to which the prison authorities could put an end by taking the appropriate measures. On the other hand, the Court has ruled on many occasions that when applicants claim to have been personally affected by the conditions prevailing in a prison, the remedies provided by Article 572 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and by Article 6 of the Penitentiary Code are not effective (see among other authorities, Papakonstantinou v. Greece, no. 50765/11, \u00a7 51, 13\u00a0November 2014).",
