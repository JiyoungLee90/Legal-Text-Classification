In order to comply with the rule, normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged (see the Aksoy v.

The Court further notes that the relevant administrative authorities, having exceeded the statutory time-limits for giving a decision, informed the applicant of the delay and set new dates (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above). It is further to be noted that the excessive length of the proceedings in this particular case was not entirely due to inactivity on the part of the administrative authorities but was to a great extent caused by legislative changes (see paragraphs 8 and 13 above) and the Constitutional Court's judgment which had found the respective provisions to be incompatible with the Constitution (see paragraph 7 above). In these circumstances the Court does not consider that the applicant should have lodged a further complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court in order to fulfil his obligation under Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1. The remedies the applicant used were therefore adequate and sufficient to afford him redress in respect of the alleged breach (see also, mutatis mutandis, Kaniewski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 38049/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a032-39, 8\u00a0November 2005).",
