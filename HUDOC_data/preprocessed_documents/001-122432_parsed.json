However, she alleged that her entitlement could be proved by evidence from witnesses and by her testimony. The witnesses she proposed would also testify to other relevant matters, for example that the plaintiff had held meetings with tenants at which they had tried to find an optimal solution and it was suggested that another flat would be allocated to her; certain steps were even taken in that direction. One of the tenants had been allocated another flat. Another option discussed was alterations to the building in question, and the plaintiff had even presented a project in that respect. She further argued that the premises she occupied were a single unit, and therefore a flat, since the Housing Act provided that the premises comprising a flat \u2018in principle [constituted] a single construction unit\u2019. She further argued that she had lived in the flat for over thirty-five years and that it could not be considered as a place she was occupying on a temporary basis. She argued that the first-instance court, before reaching its conclusion, should have heard relevant evidence and then made an assessment of all relevant matters.",

The applicant did not claim title to ownership, nor did she challenge the privatisation of the properties by Mlini Hotels before a court, with the State as defendant.

The domestic courts examined this issue, finding that the applicant had another flat to live in.
