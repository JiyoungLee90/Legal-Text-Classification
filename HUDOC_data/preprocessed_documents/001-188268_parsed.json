In his capacity as acting director and later managing director, he had been authorised to act on behalf of the company. Moreover, even after he had resigned as managing director, he had still been active in the running of the company and had also signed the winding-up petition.

It observed, inter alia, that the Constitutional Court had found the measure of lifting the corporate veil under the FOCA to be in line with the principle of the separation of a company\u2019s assets from those of its members and thus consistent with the Constitution. The court considered it irrelevant whether the applicant had become a member of L.E. before or after the creditor\u2019s claim had arisen. Having joined the company, he had assumed its assets as well as its liabilities. It further held that it was not decisive that the applicant had not remained a director of L.E. until the dissolution of that company. What was crucial was that the applicant had been actively involved in its management and that he had had the rights of a minority member pursuant to section 445 of the Companies Act 1993 (see paragraph\u00a037 below). The court noted that, in contrast to section 6 of the Companies Act 1993 which required the creditors of a company to prove that a member of the company had abused the corporate form (see paragraph 34 below), the FOCA had introduced a \u201cnon-rebuttable\u201d presumption that the members of a struck-off company were deemed to have undertaken joint and several liability for any outstanding debts of the company. In accordance with the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling, they could be exonerated from their personal liability only if they demonstrated that they were \u201cpassive members\u201d of the company (see paragraphs\u00a046 and 51 below). Lastly, the court took note of the fact that the applicant had indeed made a winding-up petition on behalf of L.E., but it considered this irrelevant because L.E. had at the time failed to make the required advance payment and the petition had therefore been rejected (see paragraphs 15 and\u00a018 above).",

Indeed, it would appear from the preparatory work relating to the adoption of the FOCA that on 28 February 1999 6,587 companies had accounts frozen for more than one year; their debts amounted to SIT 84,452,000,000; and 6,083 of them (92%) had no employees. Therefore, the Act required companies to conduct their business in such a manner that they were able at all times to fulfil their obligations in due time (section 5). Moreover, they were required to maintain adequate capital in proportion to the volume and type of operations and activities they carried out and to the risks to which they were exposed (section 6). In this connection, the company\u2019s management had to ensure that the company conducted its business in accordance with the law and the principles of financial operations (section\u00a08), that it regularly monitored the risks incurred in conducting those operations and that it took appropriate measures to hedge against such risks (section 9).",

An economically dormant company did not conduct business operations, nor did it generate income or make payments. At the same time, its financial situation was not known to its creditors, who relied on the presumption that it had at least a minimum amount of assets.

Thus, as a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Article 35 \u00a7 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to inform the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level, otherwise the principle of subsidiarity would be breached. However, this provision allows only remedies which are normal and effective to be taken into account, as an applicant cannot extend the strict time-limit imposed under the Convention by seeking to make inappropriate or misconceived applications to bodies or institutions which have no power or competence to offer effective redress for the complaint in issue under the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Lopes de Sousa Fernandes v. Portugal [GC], no. 56080/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0130-32, 19 December 2017). It follows that if an applicant has recourse to a remedy which is doomed to fail from the outset, the decision on that appeal cannot be taken into account for the calculation of the six-month period (see Jeronovi\u010ds v.

Indeed, the FOCA did not expressly provide for any such liability, but only referred to another piece of legislation: in accordance with section 27(4) of the FOCA, the members of a company which had been struck off pursuant to the FOCA were presumed to have made a statement provided for in section 394(1) of the Companies Act 1993, which, in turn, provided that a company could be struck off at the request of its members, without any winding-up proceedings, on the condition that the members made a statement in the form of a notary deed to the effect that all the company\u2019s obligations had been fulfilled, that any disputes with the employees had been settled and that the members assumed joint and several liability for any potential outstanding obligations of the company.

In his view, there were no such circumstances in the present case. Referring to the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) of 21 October 2010 in Idryma Typou AE v. Ypourgos Typou kai Meson Mazikis Enimerosis (C81/09, EU:C:2010:622), he argued that the impugned measure was likewise contrary to the fundamental principles of company law in the European Union. He invited the Court to apply the Vaskrsi\u0107 jurisprudence (Vaskrsi\u0107 v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 31371/12, 25 April 2017) and find a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, despite the fact that he had been relatively passive with regard to the destiny of L.E. and its outstanding debt. In the applicant\u2019s view, what was crucial was that he had not acted in bad faith. In this connection, he pointed out that he had attempted to have L.E. dissolved by instituting winding-up proceedings, but his attempt had failed because L.E. was not able to cover the related costs. The applicant further maintained that a fair balance between the general interest and his property rights was upset by imposing on him the onus of demonstrating his \u201cpassive\u201d status. In any event, he emphasised that he had held a managerial position in company L.E. for only a couple of years. This was not sufficient, in his opinion, to hold him liable for debts of the company. The applicant concluded that the impugned measure was profoundly unfair because the Slovenian Railways had fully realised its claim, whereas he had been left with nothing. He had, therefore, been made to bear an excessive burden.",

Both documents had been duly served on L.E. at its registered address, which was a normal practice. In addition, the decision to institute strike-off proceedings had been published in the court register, an easily accessible public register, whilst the decision on the strike-off had been published in the Official Gazette. The Government argued that, had the applicant and other members of company L.E. acted with due diligence, they could have acquainted themselves with both decisions in two different manners. They also emphasised that the time-limits for lodging an objection to the institution of proceedings and an appeal against the strike-off decision had been extensive, namely two months and thirty days, respectively. The Constitutional Court of Slovenia had likewise held that the personal service of decisions rendered in strike-off proceedings against dormant companies on all members of the companies would be very time-consuming, and in certain cases impossible, given the numbers involved and the fact that companies did not always notify the register of all relevant changes (see paragraph 49 above). Mr J. Za., Mr M. K. and Mr J. Zu. had thus remained registered as members of L.E. after their deaths (see paragraphs 10, 12 and\u00a017 above) and the applicant had remained registered as managing director of L.E. after his dismissal (see paragraph 14 above).",

As to the Vaskrsi\u0107 jurisprudence, to which the applicant referred, the Government claimed that it was irrelevant: the Vaskrsi\u0107 case had concerned the selling of the applicant\u2019s home at public auction in order to enforce a minor claim (EUR 124) although there were other means of enforcement available.

One of the key principles of company law was that members of companies were not personally liable for the debts of the companies, unless there was proof that they had acted in abuse of the corporate form (the so-called lifting or piercing of the corporate veil). The FOCA disregarded that principle. Pursuant to section 37(3) of that Act, the FOCA started to apply only three months after its introduction. The companies therefore had no time to act in order to escape its application. According to the association, since the court register was not up to date (the companies did not always notify the court register of all relevant changes), even those who were no longer members when a company was struck off were held liable for debts of the company; moreover, they were unable to put forward any arguments to the contrary in judicial proceedings pursued against them by the creditors. The association acknowledged that the Constitutional Court in the 2002 decision had limited the liability for debts of struck-off companies to active members only (that is, those who were able to influence the operation of the company), but argued that this had created confusion in the Slovenian legal system. Further confusion had purportedly been created by attempts to abolish the impugned regime of personal liability introduced by the FOCA. The third-party association further submitted that whereas the members of struck-off companies were held liable for the companies\u2019 debts, they were not able to realise the companies\u2019 claims. It acknowledged that the Association of Judges, the Judicial Council, the Institute for Comparative Law of the Faculty of Law of the University of Ljubljana and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, among others, had expressed support for the FOCA, but claimed that all of them were acting in collusion with leftist political structures. The association, lastly, provided the following figures: almost 25,000 companies were struck off; assuming that each of them had at least two responsible members, about 50,000 people were affected (2.5% of the Slovenian population).",

In this regard, it should be pointed out that when speaking of \u201claw\u201d, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term (see, for example, Visti\u0146\u0161 and Perepjolkins v. Latvia [GC], no. 71243/01, \u00a7 96, 25 October 2012). It follows that the legal norms upon which the interference is based should be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application (see, among many other authorities, Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0109-10, ECHR 2000-I). In particular, a norm is \u201cforeseeable\u201d when it affords a measure of protection against arbitrary interferences by the public authorities (see Centro Europa 7 S.r.1. and\u00a0Di\u00a0Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, \u00a7 143, 7 June 2012). Any interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must, therefore, be accompanied by procedural guarantees affording to the individual or entity concerned a reasonable opportunity of presenting their case to the responsible authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by that provision. In ascertaining whether that condition has been satisfied, a comprehensive view must be taken of the applicable judicial and administrative procedures (see Jokela v. Finland, no. 28856/95, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2002-IV; Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, \u00a7\u00a0134, ECHR 2005-XII; and Stolyarova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 15711/13, \u00a7 43, 29 January 2015).",

The FOCA was published in the Official Gazette on 8 July 1999 and entered into force on 23 July 1999. The Court considers that the regulation introduced by the FOCA was accessible to the applicant and that the content of the Act was sufficiently clear to enable him to foresee that his company ran the risk of being struck off from the court register and that he ran the risk of being held personally liable for its debts.",

This is particularly true with regard to persons carrying on a professional activity, who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation. They can on this account be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails (see, among other authorities, Kar\u00e1csony and\u00a0Others v. Hungary [GC], nos. 42461/13 and 44357/13, \u00a7 125, 17 May 2016, and Cantoni v. France, 15 November 1996, \u00a7 35, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V). The same may be said to apply to persons engaging in commercial activities (see, by analogy, \u0160pa\u010dek, s.r.o., v.\u00a0the Czech Republic, no. 26449/95, \u00a7 59, 9 November 1999, and Forminster Enterprises Limited, cited above, \u00a7 65). As a minority member of L.E. and its former managing director, the applicant must have been well aware not only of the state of the company, but also of the civil proceedings brought against it by its creditor (see paragraph 11 above). As a result, the Court is of the view that the applicant could have been expected to devote his attention in no small measure to the outstanding issues facing the company. It considers that the applicant must have been acquainted with the domestic law applicable to companies, and in particular to insolvent companies, and that no specific warning as to the impact of the FOCA had to be provided to him.",

Greece (no. 2) (no. 66610/09, ECHR 2013), which concerned a piece of legislation introduced in 1942 (during the occupation of Greece by the Axis Powers) and ratified in 1946, under which all bank deposits which had not been claimed by the account holder or had not been the subject of any transactions for a period of twenty years were transferred permanently to the State. The Court held in that case, inter alia, that the fact that the applicant had not been informed when the limitation period was due to expire, or therefore afforded the possibility of stopping the limitation period running, had upset the fair balance required by Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1. It is significant that, unlike the present applicant, the applicant in that case was an ordinary citizen unversed in civil or banking law. The present case has more in common with J.A. Pye (Oxford) Ltd and\u00a0J.A. Pye (Oxford) Land Ltd v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no.\u00a044302/02, ECHR 2007-III). In that case, the Court examined the proportionality of the taking-away of land belonging to the applicant companies on account of twelve years\u2019 adverse possession. It held, inter alia, that the lack of notice to a paper owner before the expiry of the limitation period at the relevant time had not upset the fair balance required by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

However, the fact that the said decision was given more than two years after the relevant provisions of the FOCA had become applicable did not affect the applicant in any way, as the issue of his own personal liability for the debts of company L.E. was established in the enforcement proceedings which began in April 2002 (see paragraph 24 above) and ended in July 2007 (see paragraph 30 above). Throughout those proceedings, of which he only became aware in December 2004 (see paragraph 24 above), the applicant argued that he had not been an active member of company L.E., relying on the very decision of the Constitutional Court to support his main argument against the enforcement. Therefore, the Court cannot discern that the applicant was in any way adversely affected in the exercise of his rights by the fact that the distinction between active and passive members was not introduced until October 2002.",

Indeed, it led to the development of consistent domestic jurisprudence according to which the members of struck-off companies holding at least a 10% share were personally liable for the debts of the companies and those holding less than a 10% share were, as a rule, not liable. The Court considers this 10% threshold not to be arbitrary given the statutory rights enjoyed by members of limited liability companies with at least a 10% share: the right to be informed of the company\u2019s affairs; the right to access the company\u2019s records and files; the right to request the convening of a general meeting; the right to request that a specific issue be included on the agenda of a general meeting; and the right to lodge an action with the competent court requesting that the company be wound up (see paragraphs 37-38 above). Relevant international organisations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), use a similar test in order to distinguish between investors who do not control a company (portfolio investors) and those who do (direct investors).

One of the side effects of the transition from a socialist to a free-market economy was the existence of a large number of dormant companies with debts, but no assets, which had been created under the legislation of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The legislature considered that the initiation by the courts of winding-up proceedings against such companies, which was the only measure available at the time, would have inundated the courts for an estimated 30 years and would have had significant financial implications for the State (see paragraph 85 above). The FOCA thus introduced the possibility for companies to be struck off from the court register, on the court\u2019s initiative, without first being wound up. In addition, in order to protect the creditors of such companies, section 27(4) of the FOCA, as amended by the Constitutional Court in 2002, provided that the former members of companies struck off under the FOCA who had been able to influence the operation of the companies would be liable for the companies\u2019 debts (see also Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos. 11082/06 and\u00a013772/05, \u00a7 877, 25 July 2013). Bearing in mind the particularly broad margin of appreciation enjoyed by the domestic authorities in matters of general social and economic policy (see Jahn and Others, cited above, \u00a7 91; Visti\u0146\u0161 and Perepjolkins v.

In situations such as the deterioration of the commercial market due to a high number of dormant and insolvent companies, there may be a paramount need for the State to act so as to avoid irreparable harm to the economy and to enhance the legal security and confidence of participants in the market.",

A general measure has also been found to be a more feasible means of achieving the legitimate aim than a provision allowing a case-by-case examination, when the latter would give rise to a risk of significant uncertainty, of litigation, expense and delay as well as of discrimination and arbitrariness (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, \u00a7 108, ECHR 2013, with further references).

Here, then, as elsewhere, the law, confronted with economic realities, has had to provide protective measures and remedies in the interests of those within the corporate entity as well as of those outside who have dealings with it: the law has recognized that the independent existence of the legal entity cannot be treated as an absolute.

The introduction of new rules on the lifting of the corporate veil so as to make members of dormant companies liable for the companies\u2019 debts, on the basis of a presumption that they intended to have the companies dissolved and that they assumed joint and several liability for those debts, would also seem to have been motivated by a certain urgency. Moreover, by virtue of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision, such liability was confined to company members who were in fact able to influence the operation of a company (see paragraph 51 above). The Constitutional Court pointed out, inter alia, that the need for an additional protection of creditors was even stronger under the FOCA, which did not envisage any procedures to ensure repayment to creditors in the event of the dissolution of these companies, and in case of potential over-indebtedness of a company also no procedures to at least ensure the regular responsibility of limited liability companies (decision U-I-135/00 of 9\u00a0October 2002, \u00a7 49, cited in paragraph 50 above).",

The quality of the parliamentary and judicial review of the necessity of that legislation and of the measures adopted was such as to warrant a wide margin of appreciation as regards the legislative and judicial choices made (see Animal Defenders International, cited above, \u00a7 109). The divergence of views expressed in the legislature, on the one hand, and the Constitutional Court, on the other, is one that must be considered to fall within that margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether the impugned interference in the instant case is reconcilable with the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Bladet Troms\u00f8 and\u00a0Stensaas v.

In its judgment of 12 March 2005, the Ljubljana Local Court found that the onus of proving his status as passive member was on the applicant and that he had failed to demonstrate that he had not been an active member of L.E. The court established that with his 11.11% share in the company, the applicant had enjoyed the rights of a minority member, and moreover, had been employed by the company and actively involved in its management since 1993. In his capacity as acting director and later managing director, he had been authorised to act on behalf of the company. Furthermore, even after he had resigned as managing director, he had still been active in the operations of the company and had also signed the winding-up petition. Lastly, the court considered that, as a minority member, the applicant could have and should have proposed the appointment of a new director at a general meeting of the company because pursuant to domestic law all limited liability companies had to have at least one director.",

It noted, inter alia, that the Constitutional Court had found the measure of lifting the corporate veil under the FOCA to be in line with the principle of the separation of a company\u2019s assets from those of its members and thus to be consistent with the Constitution. The court considered it irrelevant whether the applicant had become a member of L.E. before or after the creditor\u2019s claim had arisen. Having joined the company, he had assumed its assets as well as its liabilities. It further held that it was not decisive that the applicant had not remained a director of L.E. until the dissolution of that company. What was crucial was that the applicant had been actively involved in its management and that he had had the rights of a minority member pursuant to section 445 of the Companies Act 1993 (see paragraph 37 above). The court noted that, in contrast to section 6 of the Companies Act 1993, which required the creditors of a company to prove that a member of the company had abused the corporate form (see paragraph 34 above), the FOCA had introduced a \u201cnon-rebuttable\u201d presumption that the members of a struck-off company were deemed to have undertaken joint and several liability for any outstanding debts of the company. In accordance with the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling of 2002, they could be exonerated from their liability only if they demonstrated that they were \u201cpassive members\u201d of the company (see paragraphs\u00a046 and 51 above). Lastly, the court took note of the fact that the applicant had indeed made a winding-up petition on behalf of L.E., but it considered this irrelevant because L.E. had at the time failed to make the required advance payment and the petition had therefore been rejected (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above).",

In principle it is not the Court\u2019s task to reassess their factual findings. Moreover, as the Court has recognised in its case-law, presumptions of fact or of law operate in every legal system. The Convention clearly does not prohibit such presumptions as a matter of principle. It does, however, require the Contracting States to remain within certain limits in this respect as regards criminal law (see Salabiaku v.\u00a0France, 7 October 1988, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 141A). In the Court\u2019s view, presumptions can a fortiori be accepted in the area of company law, where the right to respect for possessions may be at stake. Moreover, there is nothing to indicate that the manner of the application of the relevant burden of proof in the applicant\u2019s case overstepped those limits (see paragraph 100 above).",

As explained by the Constitutional Court of Slovenia in its decision UI135/00, \u00a7 44 (cited in paragraph 51 above), limited liability companies, also known as private limited companies, were very different from public limited companies, notably when it came to the responsibility of their members. The applicant acknowledged that L.E. had already been insolvent at the time when it was converted. Consequently, it can only be concluded that, as a limited liability company, L.E. was not adequately capitalised from the start and acted in breach of the applicable rules of company law. Moreover, despite the fact that the company had been unable to re-establish liquidity and solvency since 1995, it did not apply for winding-up until two years later, when it was evidently lacking any assets whatsoever. L.E. failed to make the required advance payment for the costs of the proceedings in the amount of EUR 626, and instead decided to wait until such proceedings were instituted of the court\u2019s own motion. However, the relevant legislation changed and removed that possibility; the FOCA introduced stricter provisions on the operation of companies.",

Hungary, no. 65681/13, \u00a7 34, 13 January 2015, where the Court held that the applicant had not been granted enough time to adjust to the new situation). It is true that the members would have been required to cover the costs of winding-up proceedings instituted by them, but would have avoided the strike off and personal liability for the debts of the company. In sum, although the company was not able to pay its debts or to perform the activities for which it had been established, it perpetuated its existence. In this connection, the Court sees no grounds for calling into doubt the position of the Constitutional Court relied on by the Government that such companies posed a threat to the proper functioning of the market.",

The new scheme was introduced to avoid winding-up proceedings which would be time-consuming and costly to the State (see paragraph 43 of the judgment). Such simplified proceedings for the purpose of striking off dormant companies could, however, have left creditors without any possibility of protecting their interests against the assets of the struck-off company (see paragraph 52 of the judgment). Thus the lifting of the corporate veil was introduced in order to serve the \u201cgeneral interest\u201d of protection of creditors while it should also encompass the interests of shareholders (see paragraph 50 of the judgment). The State thereby gave preference to the protection of the interests of creditors over those of shareholders, and in fact entirely placed the costs of the simplified proceedings on the shoulders of the shareholders, who had done nothing but make corporate decisions within the limits of reasonable business risk, just like the creditors.

He only became acting director on 23 February 1993, and managing director on 23 February 1995, on account of a serious accident in which the two main directors had died and two other shareholders had been injured. Thus the applicant found himself occupying a managerial position, almost \u201cagainst his will\u201d, through those dramatic circumstances.",

His intention was not to conceal any improper conduct or to commit any wrongdoing, but to remove himself from a management role.

However, the fee for publication in the Official Gazette remained unpaid, and this was because the other shareholders refused to pay up, according to the applicant. In view of that explanation, which has not been denied by the Government, is it reasonable to expect him to have borne those expenses on his own? Can he be considered personally at fault? We do not believe so, since the obligation to pay must lie on all the shareholders, even though, legally speaking the applicant could have paid himself. The collective responsibility of the various components of the limited liability company must be engaged, and not only that of a single shareholder, who had, moreover, been seeking to resign since 1995.",

However, it has not been shown, or even alleged, that the applicant in the present case acted unlawfully. The lifting of the veil was thus only intended as a means of trying to recover a debt which had nothing to do with him, because he had not held shares in the company at the time when the debt had been registered. He had not had any influence over the decision which had given rise to the debt owed to the Slovenian Railways, and found himself having to reimburse the sum of 32,795 euros, there being no maximum statutory limit to the amount that he could be asked to pay. If the debt had been 10 times or 100 times higher, he would have been required to reimburse the full amount, on the same basis, without his personal situation being taken into account.",
