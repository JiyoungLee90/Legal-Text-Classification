The Court reiterates in this connection that a State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal aid purposes. The competent national authorities are required under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) to intervene only if a failure by legal aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or is sufficiently brought to their attention in some other way (see, among many other authorities, Daud v.\u00a0Portugal, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II, \u00a7 38, and Sejdovic v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7 95, ECHR 2006II).",

The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s conduct could not of itself relieve the authorities of their obligation to take steps to guarantee him an effective defence. The above-mentioned shortcomings on the part of the court-appointed lawyer were manifest, which put the onus on the domestic authorities to intervene (see, for similar reasoning, Sannino v.

Article 51 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as interpreted by the Russian Constitutional Court, laid down a mandatory requirement for the legal representation of defendants who faced criminal charges of that gravity (see paragraphs 23, 28 and 29 above). The Court notes that the applicant never unequivocally waived his defence rights and yet no attempt was made to appoint a lawyer or to adjourn the appeal hearing in order to ensure that a lawyer was present (see, for similar reasoning, Shulepov v.

Taking into account three factors \u2013 (a) the wide powers of the appellate courts in Russia, (b) the seriousness of the charges against the applicants and (c) the severity of the sentence which they faced \u2013 the Court considered that the interests of justice demanded that, in order to receive a fair hearing, the applicants should have had legal representation at the appeal hearing. The Court therefore found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in conjunction with Article\u00a06 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in these cases (see Shulepov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a034-39; Potapov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 14934/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a021-26, 16 July 2009; Shilbergs v.

The legal issues in the applicant\u2019s case were particularly complex. It is significant that in his appeal submissions the applicant sought recharacterisation of the criminal offence and relied on the defence of self-defence. The Court is therefore of the view that, without the services of a legal practitioner, he was not in a position to articulate the arguments raised in the appeal statement and could not competently address the court on the legal issues involved, meaning that he was unable to defend himself effectively. Moreover, the appellate court had wide powers in determining his appeal and its decision was final. Of even greater relevance is the fact that the applicant had been sentenced by the first-instance court to twenty-five years and eleven months\u2019 imprisonment. For the applicant therefore, the issue at stake was an extremely important one (see, for similar reasoning, Maxwell v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1994, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a038-41, Series A no. 300C; Shilbergs, cited above, \u00a7 122; and Krylov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a046).",
