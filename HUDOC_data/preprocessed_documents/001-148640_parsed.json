He alleged that all the evidence had been fabricated and that the weapons found in his garden did not belong to him. In this connection, he submitted that the house had been uninhabited and the weapons found in his garden could easily have been planted there. He also noted that it had been impossible for him to have buried those weapons in the garden as he had been in prison until 20 March 2005 and following his release from prison he had been under strict police surveillance. He pointed out in this connection that the investigation and the first-instance court had failed to establish how he had obtained the weapons or when he had buried them in the garden. Moreover, when the weapons had been found they had been clean and there had been no trace of soil on them. The applicant further complained that the lower court had failed to show the video recording of the search. He also complained that despite his request, the first-instance court had not heard at the hearing one of his neighbours, N.M., who had been present during the entire search. Lastly, the applicant complained that, in spite of his explicit request, R.M., the person who had reported the existence of the weapons to the MNS, had never given evidence before the court. In this connection, he noted that there was a clear bias in R.M.\u2019s statement against him, since according to the latter\u2019s letter the MNS had already conducted a fruitless search of the garden in 1999.",

Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 118). In particular, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the requirements of Article 6 if the conviction is based solely, or in a decisive manner, on the depositions of a witness whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined either during the investigation or at trial (see Solakov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a047023/99, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2001X). However, the requirement that there be a good reason for admitting the evidence of an absent witness is a preliminary question which must be examined before any consideration is given as to whether that evidence was sole or decisive. Even where the evidence of an absent witness has not been sole or decisive, the Court has still found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and\u00a03 (d) when no good reason has been shown for the failure to have the witness examined (see, for example, in L\u00fcdi v.

The Court further notes that the investigation did not order a forensic examination of the weapons for the purposes of establishing when they had been buried in the garden and whether the applicant\u2019s finger prints were on them. Such a measure could have clarified the question whether the weapons belonged to the applicant. Instead, the investigation contented itself with ordering a forensic examination of the weapons in order to establish their ballistic, technical and chemical characteristics. The Court also observes that the search of the applicant\u2019s uninhabited house and garden was conducted without the knowledge or presence of the applicant, his lawyer or members of his family, despite the explicit and clear requirements of the domestic law in this respect (see paragraph 32 above). Moreover, in spite of the Court\u2019s specific request, the Government failed to provide it with a copy of the video recording of the search, submitting that it had been lost during a reorganisation of the Court of Appeal in July 2007.",

However, the Government failed to provide any element of proof that R.M. had been seriously ill but relied on a telegram that R.M. had sent to the first-instance court.

In this connection, the Court reiterates that even where the evidence of an absent witness has not been sole or decisive, the Court has still found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and\u00a03 (d) when no good reason has been shown for the failure to have the witness examined (see paragraph 41 above). Moreover, the Court observes that in the present case the applicant\u2019s right to cross-examine R.M. was crucial for establishing the applicant\u2019s guilt, because although the weapons and ammunition were found in the garden of the applicant\u2019s uninhabited house following a search, the only evidence which directly incriminated the applicant for illegal possession of weapons was the statement that R.M. had made during the investigation, according to which the applicant had told him when they were in Turkey that he had buried weapons in his garden.",
