It does not indicate that a person may be detained for forty days but rather requires that the person should be released at the end of the fortieth day if the request has not been received in the meantime. In other words, even though under domestic law detention could be ordered for a period exceeding forty days (for instance, Article 108 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure provides for an initial two-month period of detention), Article 62 of the Minsk Convention requires the domestic authorities to release anyone who has been detained for more than forty days in the absence of a request for extradition. Thus, the Minsk Convention could not have been a legal basis for the applicant\u2019s detention either (see, by analogy, Shchebet v. Russia, no. 16074/07, \u00a7 68, 12 June 2008).",

Shifting the responsibility for detention to the applicant when she was under the full control of the authorities is neither relevant, nor reasonable. Even assuming that the applicant\u2019s actions did protract the extradition procedure as the authorities were under obligation to examine her applications for asylum and her self-incriminating statements in respect of a crime committed in Russia, at this juncture two separate issues should be distinguished: the applicant\u2019s detention and her extradition. The question as to when the Prosecutor General was going to decide on the applicant\u2019s extradition is of no relevance to the Court for the purpose of examining the lawfulness and length of the applicant\u2019s detention. What is at stake is the applicant\u2019s right to liberty pending the decision on extradition. It should be noted that the domestic courts had a possibility to annul the measure of restraint or to change it to a more lenient one during the time the question of the applicant\u2019s extradition was under consideration. The Supreme Court of Karelia availed itself of this possibility on 14 October 2004 when it ordered the applicant\u2019s release, having found that her detention had exceeded a reasonable time.

The core problem of the present case appears, consequently, to be the applicability and substance of the legal provisions governing the term of the applicant\u2019s detention pending extradition. The Court must therefore ascertain whether domestic law is in conformity with the Convention, including the general principles expressed or implied therein. On this last point, the Court stresses that where deprivation of liberty is concerned it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the \u201cquality of the law\u201d, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. \u201cQuality of the law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Khudoyorov v. , no. 6847/02, \u00a7\u00a0125, ECHR 2005-X (extracts); Je\u010dius v.

Deciding on a complaint similar to that of the applicant in the case of Mr Nasrulloyev (see paragraphs 41-43 above), the Constitutional Court emphasised that in extradition proceedings the right to liberty should be attended by the same guarantees as other types of criminal proceedings. It unambiguously indicated that the application of measures of restraint with a view to extradition should be governed not only by Article 466 but also by the norms of a general character contained in Chapter 13 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Although the  refused to indicate specific legal provisions governing the procedure for detention with a view to extradition, it constantly referred to the legal prohibition on continuing a custodial measure beyond the established time-limits (see paragraph 43 above).

The applicant did not question the availability or effectiveness of a remedy for examination of the lawfulness of her detention, contrary to all the previous Russian cases concerning extradition examined by the Court (see Bordovskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-68; Garabayev v. , no. 38411/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092-98, 7 June 2007, ECHR 2007...

The present case differs from the abovementioned as the applicant\u2019s complaints were, in fact, examined by the domestic court.

Poland [GC], no. 28358/95, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2000). There is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.

France, 23 November 1993, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 273B, and Toth v. Austria, 12 December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series A no. 224). At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to proceedings before the court of appeal. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right of judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 is primarily intended to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. However, if the detention is confirmed by a court it must be considered to be lawful and not arbitrary, even where appeal is available. Subsequent proceedings are less concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention (see Tjin-a-Kwi and Van Den Heuvel v. the , no. 17297/90, Commission decision of 31 March 1993). Therefore, the Court would be less concerned with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and gave to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees (see, mutatis mutandis, Vodeni\u010darov v. Slovakia, no. 24530/94, \u00a7 33, 21 December 2000).",

Russia (no. 54071/00, \u00a7 79, 7 April 2005), where the total duration of the proceedings was 41 days for two levels of jurisdiction, the Court found no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. In that case the Court noted, in particular, that the applicant had requested leave to appear in person at the appeal court, and that because of that the court had had to adjourn the proceedings for one week. In another Russian case (see Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7 96, 1 June 2006) the Court found delays of 36, 29 and 26 days to be incompatible with Article 5 \u00a7 4, stressing that the entire duration of the appeal proceedings was attributable to the authorities. Lastly, in cases involving extradition proceedings, the Court found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention where the review proceedings lasted 31 and 46 days, respectively, for two levels of jurisdiction (see Sanchez-Reisse v.
