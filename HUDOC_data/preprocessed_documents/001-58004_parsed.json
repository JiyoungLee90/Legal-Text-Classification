Instead, in such cases, which required an uncertain prediction of future events in the receiving State, various factors should be taken into account, including the danger posed by the person in question to the security of the host nation. Thus, there was an implied limitation to Article 3 (art. 3) entitling a Contracting State to expel an individual to a receiving State even where a real risk of ill-treatment existed, if such removal was required on national security grounds.  The Government based this submission in the first place on the possibility of implied limitations as recognised in the Court's case-law, particularly paragraphs 88 and 89 of its above-mentioned Soering judgment.  In support, they furthermore referred to the principle under international law that the right of an alien to asylum is subject to qualifications, as is provided for, inter alia, by Articles 32 and 33 of the United Nations 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees (see paragraph 61 above).

That provision (art. 5-1-f) must be interpreted in good faith and with common sense, as indeed must any legal provision.  I would have qualms about holding here that a period of four or five years could really be regarded as \"[complying] with the requirements\" of that Article (art. 5-1-f) and as being \"lawful\" detention for a transitional and, in principle, limited period.  Admittedly, there were particular reasons in the present case which prevented the applicant being deported promptly (consideration of his application for judicial review and, above all, the problem of whether it was appropriate to deport him to ).  But to go from that to saying that the situation \"complied with the requirements\" of Article 5 of the Convention (art. 5) seems to me excessive.  However, one cannot go to the opposite extreme of holding that there has been a violation of the Convention for the Government were able to point to reasons of some weight.  In my view, it would have been preferable to say merely that Mr Chahal's detention \"was not contrary\" to the requirements of Article 5 (art. 5).

It is, however, arguable with equal, if not greater, force that his high profile would afford him additional protection.  In the light of the Indian Government's assurances and the clear prospect of a domestic and international outcry if harm were to come to him, there would be cogent grounds for expecting that, as a law-abiding citizen in India, he would be treated as none other than that.

Taking into account the importance of guarantees against arbitrariness especially in respect of detention under Article 5 para. 1 (f) (art. 5-1-f) (see paragraph 2 above) as well as the necessity of uniform standards being applied in this respect to all member States, we cannot but conclude that, in view of its features indicated in paragraph 5 above, the panel does not constitute an adequate guarantee against arbitrariness.  The fact that it includes \"experienced judicial figures\" (see paragraph 122 of the judgment) cannot change this conclusion.  ",
