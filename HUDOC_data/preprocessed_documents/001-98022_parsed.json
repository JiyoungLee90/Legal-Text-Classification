It is true that, if the time-limit of five years was applied for storage of prison documentation, as indicated in the certificates of 21 August 2007, the documents requested by the Court were most probably destroyed in 2005, and therefore the Government was not in a position to comply with the Court's request of 20 June 2007. However, the present application was communicated to the Government on 21 September 2004 and there is no evidence that the Government were in any way prevented from enclosing relevant documents stemming from the relevant period to their original observations of 15 December 2004, rather than producing certificates of 3 November 2004. Further, once they were on notice that the Court was dealing with the case, it would have been open to the Government not to destroy the documents, in case they were of relevance to the present proceedings.",

Russia, no. 28617/03, \u00a7 52, 13\u00a0November 2007, and Novinskiy, cited above, \u00a7 104). The Court finds that these considerations hold true in the circumstances of the present case, since the events at issue had taken place around seven years before the warders gave their statements, and it is clear from the way the statements are formulated that the warders based them on their personal recollections and not on any objective data. In the circumstances of the case and given the lack of any original prison documentation, the Court finds no objective reason to attach greater weight to those statements compared to those made, for instance, by the inmates referred to by the applicant. Overall, the Court finds that the Government have not accounted properly for their failure to support their account with copies of the original prison documentation, with the result that the Court may draw inferences from their conduct.",

In this latter respect, the Court rejects as erroneous the Government's submission in their observations of 15 December 2004 to the effect that the applicant had been released on 29 September 2002, given that in their additional observations of 7 September 2007 the Government indicated 30 September 2002 as the date of the applicant's release, the same date being mentioned in the certificate of 21 August 2007 (see paragraphs 74 and 76 above). Although the parties disagreed as to the exact number of cells in which the applicant was detained and the exact number of inmates per cell, there was no allegation of overcrowding beyond the design capacity or of a shortage of sleeping places (see, by contrast, Grishin v. Russia, no. 30983/02, \u00a7 89, 15 November 2007, and Kalashnikov v. , no.\u00a047095/99, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2002VI). Moreover, even on the basis of the applicant's description it is clear that during her detention in the IZ-62/1 she was mostly afforded no less than four square metres, and from no later than November 2000 until her release, no less than seven square metres, of living space (see paragraph 77 above).",

Such elements included, in particular, the opportunity to use the toilet in private, availability of ventilation, access to natural light or air, adequacy of heating arrangements, and compliance with basic sanitary requirements. Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue \u2013 measuring in the range of three to four square metres per inmate \u2013 the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Vlasov v. Russia, no. 78146/01, \u00a7\u00a084, 12 June 2008; Babushkin v.

The Court therefore has to satisfy itself that in the instant case the other conditions of the applicant's detention can be regarded as compatible with Article 3 of the Convention.",

However, and even assuming that, contrary to the applicant's assertion, none of the windows had ever been covered with plywood, as stated by the Government, the materials in the Court's possession, and namely the photographs of the cells submitted by the Government reveal that the windows were covered with metal grilles. Moreover, the Government conceded that the shutters which supplemented the grilles remained in place throughout the entire period of the applicant's detention, and were only removed in the period from January to March 2003, that is after the applicant's release (see paragraph 80 above). The Court has strong doubts that such arrangement enabled adequate penetration of natural light. In this respect the Court notes that the entries in the applicant's medical file reveal upon her arrival on 29 March 2000 at the IZ-62/1 she was found to be fit (see paragraph 102 above), whereas several weeks later, on 12 May 2000, she was diagnosed with slight myopia (see paragraph 109 above). The Court also attaches weight to the fact that in her complaint of 17 May 2000 the applicant stated that she was being detained in a poorly lit cell and that her sight was deteriorating (see paragraph 94 above). Overall, the Court is not convinced that the arrangements in the cells where the applicant was detained were sufficient to give the applicant adequate access to daylight.",

It notes that in her complaints to the head of the IZ-62/1 dated 3 August 2000 the applicant mentioned that her cell was never ventilated (see paragraph 97 above). The Government, for their part, did not produce any reliable evidence confirming their allegation that the cells were equipped with mechanical ventilation and that the alleged presence of a vent in each window ensured proper natural ventilation of the cells. In the latter respect the Court retains certain doubts that a small window vent could have ensured adequate natural ventilation of the cells, given that, as was established above, the windows were at all times covered with grilles and shutters. It therefore appears that the applicant was kept in cells which were either poorly ventilated or not ventilated at all. In addition, at least during the first two months of her detention the applicant, a non-smoker, had to share a cell with several smokers (see paragraphs 81, 92 and 94 above), which, in the Court's opinion, could have caused her considerable distress in the absence of adequate ventilation.",

They referred to a report of a regional authority for hygiene and epidemiology reflecting the results of measurement on 17 August 2007 of temperature and humidity level in cells nos. 49, 020 and 54 of the IZ-62/1 (see paragraph 81 above). The Court cannot accept that the report has any evidentiary value, given that it concerns the results of a measurement carried out during the summer period several years after the relevant events. On the other hand, it observes that, according to the entries in the applicant's medical file, throughout her detention in the IZ-62/1 during the winter period she often suffered from various respiratory ailments (see paragraphs 124 and 126-130 above). In the Court's opinion, this fact suggests that the applicant's allegation concerning low temperature in her cells in the winter period are not devoid of foundation, it therefore accepts this allegation.",

In the present case, the applicant's pre-trial detention lasted from 28 February 2000, when she was taken into custody, until 6 February 2001, when she was convicted by the trial court. The total duration of the detention thus amounted to eleven months and ten days, which period does not appear particularly excessive in itself. The Court reiterates, however, that Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention cannot be seen as authorising pre-trial detention unconditionally provided that it lasts no longer than a certain minimum period. Justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, \u00a7 66, ECHR 2003-I (extracts)).",

The Court thus accepts the applicant's argument that the domestic courts did not give due consideration to the fact that she had resigned from her office of the Head of the Department of Justice three days after the criminal proceedings had been instituted and that therefore her ability to influence witnesses in a case concerning the embezzlement of budgetary assets in that public body had been at best questionable. The judiciary never specified why, notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the applicant in support of her requests for release, they considered the risk of her absconding or interference with the witnesses to exist and to be decisive. Moreover, the preliminary investigation in the present case had ended by 13\u00a0June 2000, but the applicant's detention on remand continued until 6\u00a0February 2001. The Court reiterates in this connection that whilst at the initial stages of the investigation the risk that an accused person might pervert the course of justice could justify keeping him or her in custody, after the evidence has been collected, that ground becomes less strong (see Mamedova v.

Denmark, 24 May 1989, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 154 and Sainte-Marie v. France, no. 12981/87, \u00a7\u00a032, 16 December 1992). It does not appear that there were any such circumstances in the present case: Judge K. only extended the applicant's pre-trial detention on 4 September and 4 November 2000 without even reviewing the lawfulness thereof, let alone assessing the degree of the applicant's guilt (see, by contrast, Hauschildt, cited above, \u00a7 52). This complaint therefore is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

In the present case, the applicant was detained and questioned as an accused on 28 February 2000 and her conviction was upheld on appeal and became final on 23 May 2001. Thus the overall length of the proceedings at issue was less than fifteen months, during which period the applicant's case was examined at two levels of jurisdiction. The Court does not find such a length of the proceedings excessive within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",
