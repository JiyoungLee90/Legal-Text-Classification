In their examination of the facts of the case, both the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation found that the Armenian court judgment of 1988 and the Moldovan court judgment of 2003 had dealt with the same subject matter (i.e., compensation due to the applicant for supplementary medical care and other costs derived from work injuries), basing their rulings on Article 55 (c) of the Minsk Convention, which excludes national authorities from recognising and enforcing the decisions of foreign courts in cases of res judicata. The Armenian courts stated the grounds for their judgments and the norms they were applying in a way which cannot be considered either arbitrary or unfounded. This is further reinforced by the fact that the company deemed responsible for compensation in the 1988 judgment had been declared bankrupt and sold to a third party, which was judicially ruled not to be liable for the company\u2019s debt.",

The factory had made payments until 1992. In 1997 the factory was declared bankrupt and the debtor company was released from the payment of any debts, in accordance with section 34 of the Bankruptcy Act. We note that the Government Decree of 1992 provided that in the event of a company\u2019s liquidation, the legal successor is to pay the debts; where there is no successor, the State social authorities are to take over payments. This Decree was in force until August 2004.

After several years of correspondence between the applicant and various Armenian authorities, in 2006 the Armenian Ministry of Labour announced that the applicant could have applied to the social authorities in order to receive funds from the State budget, as provided for in the 1992 Government Order.

We disagree with this assessment. Non-enforcement of a judgment is a continuous situation unless the judgment is annulled or otherwise changed by relevant courts (see Sabin Popescu v. Romania, no.\u00a048102/99, \u00a7 54, 2\u00a0March 2004). It appears that this is not the case here, and nor can the decision on the company\u2019s bankruptcy be considered such an annulment, since Armenia was under an obligation, both in terms of domestic law and the Moscow Convention, to ensure that damages incurred on its territory to persons employed therein were compensated. The Chamber makes a doubtful distinction between liquidation and bankruptcy in this case. Even assuming that such a distinction could be made, the object and purpose of the Moscow Convention should have been assessed properly by the Armenian authorities. In 2001 the Armenian Ministry of Justice should already have known to which authority the applicant\u2019s request was to be forwarded, or, if they considered that the applicant should have brought further proceedings before the Armenian courts, they should have informed him accordingly. It was only in 2006 that the Armenian authorities stated that it was too late for the applicant to receive funds from the social authorities. This reply does not make much sense, as the applicant had been in touch with the authorities from 2001.",

A major issue also arises concerning \u2019s compliance with its international obligations under the Moscow Convention. It would appear that the applicant\u2019s problems persist, and that the proceedings leading to the adoption of the 2003 judgment have not helped the matter, if indeed they are relevant at all to the 1988 judgment in respect of which the Chamber has found a violation of Article 6; this remains unclear.
