Eventually the renovation, which was completed in 1988, became more extensive and expensive than expected, in part because of difficulties related to the installation of a fire prevention system. At an unspecified time in 1989 or 1990, the applicants stopped paying the mortgages and the interest on them, resulting in an overdraft of NOK 4\u00a0million.

No objection was made. On 22 April 1994 the Nordfjord District Court (herredsrett), composed of Mr\u00a0Justice Steintveit and two lay judges, unanimously found for the Bank, declaring that its mortgage securities were valid. The District Court noted that the Bank had agreed on 3 December 1990 to cancel the NOK 2.6 million mortgage security with respect to the property in Stryn.

During this period he had not been involved with the applicants' loan agreement and both the agreement and the persons concerned had been unknown to him. Nor had he had any dealings with the former director of the local branch in Nordfjordeid who had pursued the case against the applicants. After ceasing to work with the Bank, the judge had maintained an ordinary customer relationship with it but had, beyond that, entertained no special links. On entering office as a judge in January 1987 he had, as a matter of caution, imposed on himself a rule not to deal with cases to which the Bank was a party for the next three years. The applicants' case was brought before the Court of Execution and Enforcement after the expiry of the three-year period. It had never been his opinion that his previous employment relationship with the Bank was a circumstance capable of calling into doubt his impartiality. Until the applicants' complaint of 12\u00a0December 1995, he had thought that they were of the same view. He saw no grounds for arriving at a different conclusion as regards his ability to sit.",

Moreover, the appeal before the High Court had been limited to the question of the first instance judge's impartiality. Thus, the Committee found, the observations of 9 October 1996 contained no information of any importance for the decision to be taken by the High Court.

This was at a time when the High Court considered the case ready for decision. As a justification for their request the applicants referred to the closeness of the time limit for making submissions in the other case concerning their property in Stryn and to the fact that Mr Fjeld had refused to hand the documents over to them. However, they presented no specific reason to the High Court as to why they needed the whole file in the V\u00e5gs\u00f8y case in order to defend their interests in that appeal (see Bendenoun v. France, judgment of 24 February 1994, Series A no. 284, pp. 21-22, \u00a7\u00a7 52-53).",

Leaving aside this apparent inconsistency, the Court notes that the District Court's judgment of 22 April 1994 in the compensation case expressly dealt with the Bank's letter of 22 April 1991 and criticised the Bank for having imputed the disputed affirmation to the applicants' lawyer.
