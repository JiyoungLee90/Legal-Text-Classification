The Court also reiterates that it is incumbent on the respondent Government to provide a detailed account of the relevant events (see, Labita, cited above, \u00a7 170). In\u00a0this connection the Court notes that the Government did not present a timeline of the administrative formalities completed for the applicant\u2019s release. The Court further observes that there was a delay of seven days between the delivery of the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision and the applicant\u2019s release. Consequently, in the Court\u2019s view, the relevant administrative formalities should in the present case have been carried out more swiftly. In\u00a0this regard, the Court observes that the paramount importance of the right to liberty imposes on the authorities a duty to do away with organisational shortcomings attributable to the State which may occasion unjustified deprivation of liberty (see G\u0119bura, cited above, \u00a7 35).",
