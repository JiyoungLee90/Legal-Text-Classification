This required reasonable opportunities to undertake courses aimed at helping prisoners to address their offending behaviour and the risks they posed. While Article 5 \u00a7 1 did not impose any absolute requirement for prisoners to have immediate access to all courses they might require, any restrictions or delays encountered as a result of resource considerations had to be reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, bearing in mind that whether a particular course was made available to a particular prisoner depended entirely on the actions of the authorities (see \u00a7\u00a0218 of the judgment).",

In July 2008 he completed the ETS course, followed by the Living with Loss course four months later (see paragraphs 8-9 above). In early 2009 he commenced the SOTP, completing it in July 2009 (see paragraph 10 above). Following completion of that course, a period of evaluation began and a SARN report was prepared (see paragraph\u00a011 above). The applicant completed a further alcohol awareness course in July 2011 and the TSP in November 2011 (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above).

The reasonableness of the delay in accessing the ESOTP must further be viewed in the context of the gravity of his offence, which necessitated extensive offending behaviour work, and the imposition of a tariff of almost five years (see paragraph 6 above). It must also be considered against the backdrop of the wide range of rehabilitative courses which the applicant had already accessed before the expiry of his tariff and which had allowed him to present evidence to the Parole Board of a reduction in the level of risk that he posed.",
