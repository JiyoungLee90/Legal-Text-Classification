When this request met with the inmates\u2019 refusal, the soldiers entered the prison and saw that the inmates had barricaded themselves in their dormitories using their bunk-beds, tables, lockers and other furniture. When the inmates were all confined in one room, the walls of the room were demolished and the soldiers threw in gas canisters. However, the inmates covered their heads with wet fabrics to protect themselves from the effects of the gas, before proceeding to throw the gas canisters back at the soldiers. The inmates then started throwing cleaning products containing acid and bleach at the soldiers and hitting them with metal rods made from window bars. When the soldiers finally gained control of the prison, sixteen of their number had either been beaten up by the inmates or intoxicated by the tear gas. When the operation ended at around 10.00 p.m. the injured inmates were taken to hospitals.",

In that connection the Court reiterates that, if the authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of wilful police ill-treatment to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough in the prosecution and punishment of those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity and the general legal prohibitions of killing and torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, despite their fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Nikolova and Velichkova v. Bulgaria, no. 7888/03, \u00a7\u00a055, 20\u00a0December 2007). The Court reiterates that, for complaints about treatment suffered in police custody, criminal proceedings are the proper means of obtaining redress (Okkal\u0131 v.
