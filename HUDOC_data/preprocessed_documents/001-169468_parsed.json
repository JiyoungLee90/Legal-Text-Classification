Disregarding a company\u2019s legal personality as regards the question of being a \u201cvictim\u201d will be justified only in exceptional circumstances (see Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria (dec.), no.\u00a049429/99, 9\u00a0September 2004; G.J.\u00a0v. Luxembourg, no. 21156/93, \u00a7 23, 26\u00a0October 2000; and Agrotexim and Others v.

On the other hand, the sole owner of a company can claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention in so far as the impugned measures taken in respect of his company are concerned, because in the case of a sole owner there is no risk of differences of opinion among shareholders or between shareholders and a board of directors as to the reality of infringement of Convention rights or to the most appropriate way of reacting to such an infringement (see Ankarcrona v.
