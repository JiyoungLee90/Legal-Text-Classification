In particular, the criminal courts which dealt with the applicant\u2019s case acknowledged unequivocally the excessive length of the criminal proceedings against him and explicitly took that into account when determining his sentence. As a result, at first instance the applicant was given a sentence below the statutory minimum, which was also suspended. The SCC further lowered both that sentence and the period for which it had to be suspended, respectively, to one year\u2019s imprisonment suspended for three years. In doing so the SCC specifically referred to the excessive length of the proceedings against the applicant. Subsequently, the civil courts awarded the applicant EUR 1,350 as compensation for the unreasonable duration of the proceedings.",
