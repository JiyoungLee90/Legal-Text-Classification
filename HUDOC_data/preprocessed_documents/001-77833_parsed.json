In these circumstances, the Court is required to verify whether the way in which the Constitutional Court interpreted and applied the relevant provisions of the domestic law, produces consequences that are consistent with the principles of the Convention, as interpreted in the light of the Court\u2019s case-law (see, mutatis mutandis, Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a064886/01, \u00a7\u00a082, to be published in ECHR 2006). In doing so, the Court has to examine the period between the date of the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Croatia and the date of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision (see, by analogy, Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a0103). If the \u2019s decision is consistent with Convention principles, the Court will, when examining the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies, refrain from dealing with the length of the proceedings subsequent to that decision. Otherwise, a genuine examination of the total length after the ratification is warranted.",
