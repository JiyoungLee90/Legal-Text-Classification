Therefore, the court of first instance had come to the right conclusion that the claims brought by G., the mother of A., had to be granted. The City Court agreed with the conclusion of the court of first instance that the applicant\u2019s claims had to be dismissed because the applicant had not proved that she had moved into the disputed flat and had shared the same household as the tenant, M., her grandmother. Her registration as living in that flat had been of an administrative nature and had not provided her with any right to live there. In such circumstances, the judgment of the court of first instance had been lawful and duly reasoned. The City Court further held that the grounds of the applicant\u2019s appeal had aimed to reassess the evidence in the case, and that, given the fresh conclusion that the court of first instance had duly assessed the evidence before it, those grounds could not serve as a basis for quashing the judgment.",

The present case differed from Croatian cases concerning the eviction of applicants (\u0106osi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 28261/06, 15\u00a0January 2009, and Pauli\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 3572/06, 22 October 2009). The applicants in those cases had moved into their flats on lawful grounds and had had no alternative accomodation. After their eviction, the flats had become the property of the State. The applicant in the present case had moved into the flat unlawfully, without obtaining the written consent of her uncle. The State had not been a party to the proceedings in question, and after the applicant\u2019s eviction the flat in question had been given to a private individual \u2013 A., a minor. Prior to being registered as living in her grandmother\u2019s flat, the applicant had been registered as living in her mother\u2019s flat, and after her eviction she had been registered as living in a room \u2013 belonging to her husband \u2013 in a communal flat. Therefore, after her eviction from the disputed flat, the applicant had not been deprived of the opportunity to move into different housing. Under domestic law, being registered as living in a particular dwelling did not give rise to any rights or obligations in respect of that dwelling.",

As far as A. was concerned, the courts had established that he had lawfully acquired the right to live in the flat, since he had been moved into the flat by his father (the applicant\u2019s uncle), and that if the applicant\u2019s claims were granted then his right to a home would be breached.

In that respect, while the lawfulness of establishing one\u2019s home in a particular place and the availability of alternative accommodation might be relevant for the assessment of the proportionality of an eviction, the Court observes that those matters were not examined by the domestic courts in the present case. As regards A.\u2019s interests, the Court agrees that in the present case the domestic courts had to balance two competing private interests, namely A.\u2019s right and the applicant\u2019s right to occupy the State-owned flat under a social tenancy agreement following the death of the tenant. However, the Court is not convinced that in taking the decision to evict the applicant, the domestic courts balanced those interests in a way compatible with the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention.",

They both claimed to have acquired the right to live in the flat after the death of their grandmother. In order to decide the case, the domestic courts had to establish whether the applicant and A. could be recognised as the tenant\u2019s family members. The applicant claimed that she and her grandmother had initially brought court proceedings together as members of the same family, that her grandmother had never challenged her right to occupy flat, and that on several occasions the welfare authorities had declared that she and her grandmother were a low-income family and had awarded them housing allowance (see paragraphs 13 and 18 above). However, neither the court of first instance \u2013 during the fresh examination of the case on 5 March 2008 \u2013 nor the appeal court which examined the case on 19 June 2008 examined those arguments. The Court considers that the mere fact that A. had acquired the right to live in the flat but did not actually live there was not sufficient to explain why the applicant\u2019s interests had to give way to A.\u2019s and why the applicant\u2019s eviction was justified. By failing to examine the crux of the applicant\u2019s arguments, the domestic courts thus failed to balance the competing rights and therefore failed to determine the proportionality of the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her home.",
