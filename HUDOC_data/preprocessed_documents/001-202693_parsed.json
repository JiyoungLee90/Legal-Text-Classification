The court held a hearing at which it heard the first and the second applicant, in the presence of an interpreter. The court noted that the first applicant had already twice applied for refugee status in Poland but that on each occasion he had not pursued his application, so the respective proceedings had been discontinued. In 2004 he had illegally left Poland for Austria, where he had stayed for nine years. In January 2015 he had attempted to enter Poland on four occasions, without applying for asylum. The court considered that that indicated his intention to abuse the procedure for obtaining international protection. In view of the fact that the first and the second applicants had indicated that they had been in good health, placing them in the Guarded Centre for Aliens had not posed any risk to them. In respect of the applicants\u2019 son the court held that the best interests of the child lay in his remaining with his parents.",

Non-governmental organisations had been warning for a long time that Polish border guards were preventing foreigners from lodging applications for refugee status at the border and sending them back instead. The fact that they had been victims of such an illegal practice on the part of the Polish authorities should not be held against them and constitute grounds for placing them in detention. Lastly, the applicants complained that a guarded centre for aliens could hardly be considered a suitable place for their one-year-old son.

Furthermore, the court considered that it had not been possible to apply other measures provided by law since the applicants had not had sufficient financial means to sustain themselves during the asylum proceedings.",

The Court therefore concludes that the interference pursued a legitimate aim for the purposes of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Bistieva and Others, \u00a7 76; Popov, \u00a7\u00a0137; A.B. and Others v.
