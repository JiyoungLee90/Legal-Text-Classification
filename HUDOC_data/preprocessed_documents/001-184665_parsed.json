Instead, the Court concludes that trafficking itself as well as exploitation of prostitution, within the meaning of Article 3(a) of the Palermo Protocol, Article 4(a) of the Anti-Trafficking Convention, Article\u00a01 of the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others and the CEDAW (see paragraphs\u00a027, 28, 31 and 33 above), fall within the scope of Article\u00a04 of the Convention and will assess the present case under that provision.

The Court\u2019s case-law shows that the procedural requirements of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention may go beyond the stage of the investigation, both in situations where the alleged ill-treatment was perpetrated by State officials and by private individuals (for State officials see, for example, Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran v.\u00a0Turkey (no 42942/02, 8 April 2008); and for private individuals see\u00a0Beganovi\u0107 v.

The Court has held that where the investigation had led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, are to be taken into account. While there is no absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction or in a particular sentence, the national courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow life-endangering offences and grave attacks on physical and mental integrity to go unpunished. The important point for the Court to review, therefore, was whether and to what extent the courts, in reaching their conclusion, might be deemed to have submitted the case to the careful scrutiny required by Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, so that the deterrent effect of the judicial system in place and the significance of the role it was required to play in preventing violations of the right to life and the prohibition of ill-treatment are not undermined (see Beganovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 77, relying on Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran, also cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 62).",

When these authorities established that a person had been trafficked, they should take, within their respective competences, all necessary measures following from the application of relevant criminal provisions (see Chowdury and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 116). The obligation to investigate does not depend on a victim\u2019s complaint: once allegations of trafficking have being brought to the authorities\u2019 attention, they must act of their own motion. To be effective the investigation must be independent from those implicated in the events. The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but of means. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. The victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (see L.E., cited above, \u00a7\u00a068).",

The national courts did not give adequate attention to these elements and concluded that the applicant had given sexual services voluntarily.

Finally, the purpose consists of \u201cexploitation\u201d.

Firstly, in the above instruments relied on in Rantsev, the notions of \u201cexploitation of the prostitution of others\u201d and \u201cother forms of sexual exploitation\u201d are relevant only as parts of the \u201cpurpose\u201d element of the definition of trafficking. Secondly, the terms \u201cexploitation of the prostitution of others\u201d and \u201cother forms of sexual exploitation\u201d are not defined in those instruments. This is a deliberate choice in order for these instruments to remain without prejudice to how States Parties deal with prostitution in their domestic law. Thirdly, while it is correct that according to Article 4(b) of the Anti-Trafficking Convention, the consent of the victim is irrelevant, this does not have the effect of diluting the \u201cmeans\u201d elements in the definition of trafficking. On the contrary, the provision states that \u201cthe consent of the victim of \u2018trafficking in human beings\u2019 to the intended exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of exploitation ... shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth ... have been used\u201d. In other words, the victim\u2019s consent is no valid defence, and cannot have the effect of exonerating the perpetrator, where it is established that the \u201cmeans\u201d element is present (cf.\u00a0paragraph 79 of the present judgment, where the majority appear to confuse the issues; in the present case the domestic courts did not find that there was sufficient evidence to establish that the applicant had been forced into prostitution, such that the issue of consent \u2013 in terms of consent not being capable of constituting a valid defence \u2013 could not even arise).",

Notably, as explained above, neither the Palermo Protocol nor the Anti-Trafficking Convention purport to ban the \u201cexploitation of prostitution\u201d as a phenomenon distinct from its place as an element of the \u201cpurpose\u201d component of human trafficking, nor is it defined in those instruments. By considering now that the \u201cexploitation of prostitution\u201d \u2013 whatever is meant by it \u2013 falls within the prohibition enshrined in Article 4, the majority introduce an enlargement of the scope of that Article that is both significant and obscure. The latter aspect is particularly problematic in the light of the requirement that such exploitation be qualified as a criminal offence (see paragraph 63 of the present judgment) which, in the absence of any further definition, cannot but raise concerns under Article 7 of the Convention.",

It is, however, important to note that quite a large number of member States of the Council of Europe have not ratified this particular Convention (unless I am mistaken, 26 of the 47 member States are parties to it), whereas all of them have ratified the more recent and less comprehensively formulated Anti-Trafficking Convention (to which reference was made in Rantsev).",

It would also be problematic to suggest that the initial recognition of a person as a victim of trafficking, for the purpose of qualifying for various measures of support, was in itself sufficient to engage the application of Article\u00a04 regardless of any further developments in the course of the case (see paragraph 52 of the present judgment).",

There has thus been no reason for the parties, or any other interested circles, to anticipate that the scope of Article 4 would now be detached from the criteria that define human trafficking (on which there is consensus among the member States) and extended to cover situations without the elements of coercion, deception or abuse that are required in the context of human trafficking. Notably, the Contracting States most concerned by the issue, namely those where the current legislative policy for the regulation of prostitution is different from that of the respondent State (the latter entailing that prostitution and the purchase of sexual services are illegal, see paragraph 65 of the present judgment), will be taken by complete surprise, and will not even have any possibility of requesting a referral of the case to the consideration of the Court\u2019s Grand Chamber, this right being reserved to the parties to the case.

The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, such as witness testimony and forensic evidence, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, for instance, Y. v. Slovenia, cited above, \u00a7 96, with further references). The promptness of the authorities\u2019 reaction to the complaints is an important factor (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a7 133 et seq., ECHR 2000IV). Consideration has been given in the Court\u2019s judgments to matters such as the opening of investigations, delays in identifying witnesses or taking statements (see M\u0103t\u0103saru and Savi\u0163chi v.

As mentioned in paragraph 17 above, that norm entails that where coercion or another form of the \u201cmeans\u201d element of trafficking has been established, the victim\u2019s consent is incapable of operating as a valid defence to the effect of exonerating the perpetrator. Where no coercion has been established, this issue does not arise. Thus, in the context of the present case, the statement at the end of paragraph 79 is beside the point.",
