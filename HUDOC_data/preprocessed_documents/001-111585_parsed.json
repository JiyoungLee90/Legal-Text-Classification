Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during detention.

The 21st Chamber of the court, which tried the applicant for forging an official document, acquitted him of that charge, confirming the authenticity of the medical report on the basis of an expert report from the Gendarmerie Command and the concerned doctor\u2019s statements. However, the same doctor retracted his previous statements before the 19th Chamber of the same court.
