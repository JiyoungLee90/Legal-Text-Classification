The Court notes that more than three years of the total length of the proceedings before the national courts are attributable to the parties. In particular, the Court observes delays regarding the lodging of an appeal against judgment no. 2927/1997 with the Court of Appeal and appeals on points of law with the Court of Cassation challenging judgment nos.\u00a07938/1999 and 9275/2002 of the Court of Appeal respectively. However, the Court does not find that the parties\u2019 conduct alone contributed to the prolonged length of the proceedings. On the contrary, the Court is of the opinion that that the overall length of the proceedings, which was approximately twelve years and four months, remains excessive. In particular, it is noted that the duration of the proceedings when the case was pending the second time before the Court of Cassation - which lasted more than four years - was at least in part attributable to the national courts. Their handling of the case did not facilitate its timely completion. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the length of the proceedings can only be explained by the failure of the domestic courts to deal with the case diligently (see G\u00fcm\u00fc\u00fften v.
