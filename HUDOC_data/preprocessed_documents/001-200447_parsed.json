The court held that the provision applied in relation to the applicant\u2019s removal, section 50 (1) point\u00a08 of the Federal Notary Act (see paragraph 20 below), was, taking account of the case-law clarifying it, sufficiently precise. According to that provision, a notary must be removed from office if his economic circumstances, the manner of his business administration or his conduct regarding deposits jeopardise the interests of users of legal services. The provision did not require fault. It was also not a requirement for a notary to have violated a particular obligation to treat a deposit in a particular way in the past. Rather, it was sufficient that a notary gave the impression of not being trustworthy in this connection. This was, for example, the case if a creditor had to apply for enforcement measures against a notary in relation to an undisputed obligation. Even if an enforcement measure appeared to be invalid, a notary would be obliged to pay and could only challenge the validity of the measures in subsequent reimbursement proceedings. The court concluded, after having listed and examined numerous enforcement measures against the applicant, that he had been the subject of such measures forty-six times in the course of roughly ten years, mostly for minor amounts of up to 3,000 euros (EUR), but on one occasion also for 565,000 German Marks \u2013 on the whole that gave sufficient cause to remove him from office.",

He did not challenge the existence of the enforcement measures as such, but insisted that he had ultimately paid his debts. In respect of two enforcement measures he challenged their legal basis. He argued that one claim had only been become enforceable after appeal proceedings and the amount of another claim of 268.50 euros had been established incorrectly. With regard to the application of section 50 (1) point 8 of the Federal Notary Act, he argued that he had not caused a real risk to the interests of his clients. Furthermore, ten-year-old enforcement measures were not a valid basis to conclude that he could not be expected to change his business conduct. Finally, his removal from office was disproportionate.",

It held that the applicant\u2019s right to a lawful judge as guaranteed by Article 101 \u00a7 1 sentence 2 of the Basic Law (see paragraph 23 below) had not been violated, because assigning disputes between a notary and a President of a Court of Appeal to that Court of Appeal was generally compatible with the constitutional guarantees. Also, the composition of the notary senate did not give rise to doubts regarding its impartiality. The applicant was wrong in claiming that the President, as member of the executive committee (Pr\u00e4sidium), could easily replace judges in the notary senate, because those judges were appointed for a period of five years (see paragraphs 28 and 30).",

In this context, it found that the applicant had not plausibly challenged the Court of Appeal\u2019s finding of facts. It further reiterated its earlier findings of its decision concerning the preliminary suspension of the applicant (see paragraph 7 above). It found that pursuant to section 50 (1) point 8 of the Federal Notary Act (see paragraph 20 below) a notary must be removed from office if his manner of business administration obliged creditors of legally acknowledged claims to apply for enforcement measures against him. The reasons for these measures were immaterial because it was neither necessary that such measures stemmed from financial problems of the notary nor did it require fault. Thus, the very existence of such measures was sufficient. In the past, the applicant had been the subject of forty-six enforcement measures, of which twenty-six had been adopted in the last four years prior to his definitive removal from office. Moreover, relying on written information from the tax authorities, that the Federal Court of Justice had obtained on 13 September 2013, the applicant had also not complied with his tax obligations. Further, the Court of Appeal had not been obliged to verify whether the applicant\u2019s conduct had caused a real risk because an abstract risk to the interests of the users of legal services was sufficient. The court concluded that the definite removal from office was proportionate because the applicant had not changed his conduct despite numerous warnings.",

In this connection, Article 54 of the Code of Administrative Court Procedure and Articles 41 to 49 of the Code of Civil Procedure lay down requirements and rules of procedure in order to deal with such a complaint. On the basis of Article 42 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a judge can be recused if there are grounds justifying doubts as to the judge\u2019s impartiality. The court must, as explicitly set out in Article\u00a045 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Code of Civil Procedure, rule on a complaint of bias lodged under that heading without the challenged judge being involved in reaching that decision, but instead with his substitute under the rules of the allocation plan. In case the bias complaint is held to be well founded, the judge must be replaced in accordance with the allocation plan. However, if the bias complaint is held to be inadmissible or unfounded, the judge will resume his function in the senate. The case-law of the domestic courts (Federal Administrative Court, decision of 24 January 1973, no. 3\u00a0CB 123/71 and decision of 14 November 2012, no. 2 KSt 1/11) does allow for the possibility that Article 45 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure should not be applied, and hence allows for a ruling on a complaint of bias to be delivered with the participation of the challenged judge, if the complaint of bias is abusive. The domestic courts have held complaints of bias to be abusive where they were not based on reasons specific to the judge\u2019s person or where they had not been substantiated in a manner so as to justify grounds for doubts as to the judge\u2019s impartiality.",

The Court considers, even though it has doubts with regard to the applicant\u2019s allegation that a constitutional complaint against the decision of 22 May 2013 would not have been possible, that the applicant was not relying on Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention to establish the jurisdiction of a certain court branch for a certain matter, although this issue had formed part of his domestic complaint (see paragraph 9 above) but rather that he was relying essentially on Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention to establish an independent and impartial tribunal. Therefore, the complaints of bias, which allow a party to the proceedings to challenge the tribunal\u2019s independence and impartiality and regarding which the applicant exhausted domestic remedies, appear to be effective with regard to the guarantee relied on.

As, under the Federal Notary Act, the presidents of the Courts of Appeal were also the supervisory authorities for notaries, the underlying reason for conferring the power to remove a notary from office to those presidents, was that they had a particular professional competence. Under section 111 of the Act (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above), the Courts of Appeal had jurisdiction concerning a complaint against a removal from office. Where a Land had more than one Court of Appeal, section 111a (see paragraph 25 above) allowed for jurisdiction to be concentrated at just one of these courts. Several L\u00e4nder had made use of that possibility, including the Land of Lower Saxony, where the jurisdiction had been concentrated at the Celle Court of Appeal.

In Oleksandr Volkov, in addition to the fact that the judges of the Higher Administrative Court were under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the Ukrainian High Council of Justice, a number of serious issues had been identified. These problems related firstly to structural shortcomings in the procedure before the HCJ, notably the inclusion of the Minister of Justice and of the Prosecutor General as ex officio members of that body and the fact that the great majority of its non-judicial members were appointed directly by the executive and legislative authorities. Secondly, the Court took into account the appearance of bias on the part of some members of the HCJ who had determined the applicant\u2019s case. It observed that the members of the Ukrainian HCJ who had carried out the preliminary inquiries in the applicant\u2019s case and submitted requests for his dismissal had subsequently taken part in the decisions to remove him from office. Moreover, one of them had been appointed President of the HCJ and had presided over the hearing of the applicant\u2019s case. The Court therefore found that the proceedings before the HCJ had been incompatible with the principles of independence and impartiality set forth in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, \u00a7 117). The subsequent determination of the applicant\u2019s case by Parliament, the legislative body, had not remedied the structural defects of a lack of \u2018independence and impartiality\u2019 but rather had served to contribute to the politicisation of the procedure and to aggravate the inconsistency of the procedure with the principle of the separation of powers (ibid., \u00a7 118). In those circumstances, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, it was extremely important for the Ukrainian Higher Administrative Court to afford the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention in order to be able to remedy any lack of independence and impartiality.",

The Court also notes the absence of any specific evidence of a lack of impartiality, such as, for instance, the existence of pending disciplinary proceedings against one of the members of the benches that examined the applicant\u2019s appeals. In more general terms the Court considers it normal that judges, in the performance of their judicial duties and in various contexts, should have to examine a variety of cases in the knowledge that they may themselves, at some point in their careers, be in a similar position to one of the parties, including the defendant. However, a purely abstract risk of this kind cannot be regarded as apt to cast doubt on the impartiality of a judge in the absence of specific circumstances pertaining to his or her individual situation. Even in the context of disciplinary cases a theoretical risk of this nature, consisting in the fact that judges hearing cases are themselves still subject to a set of disciplinary rules, is not in itself a sufficient basis for finding a breach of the requirements of impartiality.",

It is therefore necessary to scrutinize the system as a whole with a specific view to the respective guarantees and safeguards. In the present case, under domestic constitutional requirements, all three judges enjoy full judicial independence. When adjudicating cases, judges are not subordinate to the President (see paragraphs 33 et seq. above). In respect of disciplinary measures and promotion decisions, the domestic legal order requires that they must never be capable of influencing a judge\u2019s decision in a particular case. A judge therefore cannot be subjected to disciplinary measures or to promotion decisions based on particular decisions delivered in the course of a case. Compliance with those requirements is subject to judicial review, to be initiated on an application by a judge who considers him or herself to have been affected (see paragraphs 34, 36 and 37). Yet, despite these safeguards and guarantees, it cannot be excluded that the President\u2019s involvement in disciplinary and promotion decisions could be capable of arousing objectively justified fears on the part of the applicant.",

This was not a fundamental question of fact, but a question of law (see Sigma Radio Television Ltd, cited above, \u00a7 166). Even though the applicant had also challenged the basis for two enforcement measures, it was not necessary to examine or to take evidence in this respect. It is evident from the reasoning of the Federal Court of Justice (see paragraph 16 above) that the underlying reasons for the individual enforcement measures were immaterial. Fault or financial problems were not a prerequisite in order to assess whether a notary\u2019s manner of business administration jeopardised the interests of the users of legal services. Moreover, a fresh analysis of each of the enforcement measures was not required because it was sufficient to conclude that the measures as a whole created an abstract risk to the interests of the notary\u2019s clients. It was not necessary to establish that there was a tangible risk. In this context, the Court observes that the existence of all forty-six enforcement measures as such was uncontested. With regard to the applicant\u2019s argument that the events leading to his removal dated back a long time, the Federal Court of Justice highlighted that the majority of the enforcement measures had taken place during a period of four years prior to the removal decision. Furthermore, it had obtained fresh evidence from the tax authorities in respect of the applicant\u2019s compliance with his tax obligations. In respect of the applicant\u2019s final argument, the Court notes that the review proceedings included a fresh proportionality assessment.",
