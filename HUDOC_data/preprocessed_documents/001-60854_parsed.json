The first-instance court had in particular failed to address correctly the complaints relating to certain refusals to take evidence and to the fact that some evidence was not taken in an adversarial manner as the court had only decided to include it in the case-file. The applicant had thus been deprived of the possibility of questioning certain witnesses.

During the investigations the prosecuting authorities gathered two hundred and twenty-four items of evidence to be presented to the court. There were also many witnesses to be interviewed.
