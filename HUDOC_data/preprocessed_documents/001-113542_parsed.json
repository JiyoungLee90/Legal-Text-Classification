After criminal proceedings against N.T. came to an end in October 2003 (see paragraph 12 above), the court decided to resume the examination of the case, and held a hearing on 19 April 2004.",

Those rules required that any information, even that coming from official sources, be checked against at least two independent sources. The first applicant had not done that with regard to the information received from a public prosecutor whose identity she had been unable to establish. The resulting articles had contained defamatory and injurious statements about N.T. and his family which went beyond the information in the press release issued by the authorities: that the \u201cbusiness of [the applicant\u2019s wife had] thrived and she [had] amassed a substantial capital\u201d, that the \u201cwhole family [had been] implicated in the affair\u201d, and that the authorities had found \u201ca bag with secret documents relating to the business of the \u2018Kremikovtsi\u2019 metallurgical plant\u201d. By writing and publishing unverified defamatory allegations about N.T. the applicants had acted in breach of the general duty under section 45 of the Obligations and Contracts Act 1951 (see paragraph 24 below) not to infringe the rights of others. They could have anticipated the damaging result of their actions and could have averted it by taking additional steps to verify the accuracy of the statements in the articles. They had not done so, and had therefore acted negligently. The second applicant had been under a duty to do so by virtue of his position as the newspaper\u2019s editorinchief, especially with regard to an article that did not bear a byline. As for the first applicant, she had made untrue and uncorroborated injurious remarks and allegations about N.T.\u2019s personal and professional life, without taking into account the negative consequences that could flow from them. Media Holding AD was vicariously liable for the applicants\u2019 actions.",

Those claims had been triable at first instance not by the Sofia City Court, but by the Sofia District Court. By accepting to hear the case, the Sofia City Court, which had the rank of a regional court, had in effect exercised its powers under Article 80 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952 to take up and examine at first instance a case falling within the jurisdiction of one of the district courts in its region (see paragraph 25 below). That had in turn led to an appellate judgment by the Sofia Court of Appeal. Had the procedure ran its normal course, the case would have been examined at first instance by the Sofia District Court and on appeal by the Sofia City Court. The case thus fell within the ambit of Article 218a \u00a7 1 (a) of the Code (see paragraph 26 below), with the result that no appeal lay against the Sofia Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.",

The first applicant had no doubt been aware of that, but had presented the allegations as entirely true. She was an experienced journalist, who was surely well aware of the presumption of innocence and of the possibility that allegations might fail at trial. She should have therefore relayed with utmost care the information received from the prosecuting authorities. Instead, she had chosen to interpret that information loosely and to present it as unchallenged fact.

The prosecutor\u2019s conjectures had been presented as unchallengeable facts. The entire article had tried to convey the idea that N.T.\u2019s family had engaged in shady dealings. The main point was therefore not that the first applicant had failed to verify the accuracy of the information that she had obtained from the public prosecutor, but that she had consciously misused that information to give a sensational spin to otherwise unsensational news.

Although the Court can and should exercise a certain power of review in this matter, since failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of Article 10, the scope of its task is subject to limits inherent in the subsidiary nature of the Convention, and it cannot question the way in which the domestic courts have interpreted and applied national law except in cases of flagrant nonobservance or arbitrariness (see, mutatis mutandis, Weber and Saravia v.

The Court must firstly have regard to whether the publication has made a contribution to a debate of general interest. It must also take into account other factors, such as the nature of the activities that were the subject of the publication, the way in which the information was obtained, the way in which the report was published, and the way in which the person concerned was depicted in it (see, mutatis mutandis, Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, \u00a7\u00a7 9094, 7 February 2012, and Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, \u00a7\u00a7 10912, ECHR 2012...). Other factors \u2013 and the list is not exhaustive \u2013 may include the source of the information (see, for instance, Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 72), the steps taken to verify it (see, for instance, Rumyana Ivanova v.

The court was in particular of the view that although those allegations had been based on information obtained from a public prosecutor, the first applicant had been under a duty to check the story against other sources (see paragraph 19 above). The Court is unable to agree with that reasoning. It has in the past held that the press should normally be entitled to rely on the content of official reports without having to undertake independent research (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 72, and Colombani and Others v. France, no.\u00a051279/99, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2002V). It later expanded the scope of application of that principle, saying that journalists must be free to report on events based on information gathered from official sources without further verification (see Selist\u00f6 v. , no. 56767/00, \u00a7 60, 16 November 2004). More recently, it applied that approach to information given orally by a public prosecutor in charge of the prosecuting authorities\u2019 relations with the press (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7 105). The situation in the present case presents no material difference. In view of the practice of the Bulgarian prosecuting authorities to give routine informal press conferences in which prosecutors would talk to journalists about cases (see paragraph 9 above), the military prosecutor\u2019s statement made on 30 May 1996 is to be similarly considered an official source of information obviating the need for further verification. The fact that the applicant was unable to establish the identity of that prosecutor does not detract from that position. Moreover, information about the case was published also by the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and was later on disseminated by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency. The national courts did not express doubts as to whether the prosecutor had indeed made the statement in issue, and the Court sees no reason to doubt that the first applicant acted in good faith in connection with that. A perusal of the text of the two articles (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above) shows that she did not adopt the allegations as her own (contrast Rumyana Ivanova, cited above, \u00a7 62).",

Moreover, journalists cannot be expected to act with total objectivity and must be allowed some degree of exaggeration or even provocation (see Selist\u00f6, cited above, \u00a7 56). The fact that the text of the articles and their captions contained expressions designed to attract the public\u2019s attention does not in itself present a problem (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7 108).

It is true that the first applicant could have phrased the impugned statements more carefully, so as to highlight the fact that they were reflecting statements made by law enforcement officials at the early stages of a criminal investigation. However, the question is, again, not how the Court or a national court would have worded those statements, but whether they went beyond the limits of responsible journalism. The Court does not consider that they did. The first applicant made it clear that she was quoting law enforcement officials and that the statements were based on the results of the investigation thus far. Moreover, the overall thrust of the first article made it clear that that investigation had just started. Nor was it unreasonable for the first applicant to include in her story statements concerning N.T.\u2019s wife and father. She did not mention any irrelevant or private details (see Flinkkil\u00e4 and Others v. , no. 25576/04, \u00a7 84, 6 April 2010, and contrast Tammer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 68), whereas the business of N.T.\u2019s wife and the fact that his father had held public office were clearly relevant to the story, and therefore had a direct bearing on a matter of public interest. In a democratic society, the authorities are entitled to inform the public about criminal investigations in progress, provided they choose their words carefully (see Daktaras v. , no. 42095/98, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2000X), and do so with all the discretion and circumspection necessary if the presumption of innocence is to be respected (see Allenet de Ribemont v.\u00a0France, 10 February 1995, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 308).

The difference in treatment to which the applicants were subjected \u2013 their appeal on points of law not being examined, in contrast to the one lodged by N.T. about three years earlier \u2013 was not based on an identifiable personal characteristic of theirs. It was exclusively due to an intervening change in the rules governing the admissibility of appeals on points of law. It could not therefore be regarded as discriminatory (see, mutatis mutandis, Magee v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 28135/95, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2000VI, and Hristozov and Others v.

During that time the case was examined on the merits four times. After that, the question whether the applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law was admissible was examined by two levels of court. The only serious delays attributable to the authorities during that period were a pause of about a year during the second examination of the case by the Sofia Court of Appeal, when the proceedings were stayed to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings against N.T., and a period of about a year and a half during which the case was waiting to be heard by the Supreme Court of Cassation pursuant to N.T.\u2019s appeal on points of law (see paragraphs 1322 above). With regard to the former, the Court does not consider that the stay was arbitrary or unreasonable (see Djangozov v. Bulgaria, no. 45950/99, \u00a7 38, 8 July 2004, and Todorov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 39832/98, \u00a7 48, 18 January 2005), or that it lasted so long as to prejudice irretrievably the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings as whole. With regard to the latter, the Court observes that recently, in Nikolov and Others v. Bulgaria (nos. 44184/05, 22250/06 and 37182/07, \u00a7\u00a7 3742, 21 February 2012), it found a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on account of delays of about two years in the examination of appeals on points of law by the Bulgarian Supreme Court of Cassation. However, the Court\u2019s ruling in that case was based entirely on the very high stakes involved for the applicants, who had been challenging their dismissals from work. It is true that the stakes in the present case, which concerned the first applicant\u2019s professional reputation, were also higher than normal (see, mutatis mutandis, Kalpachka v. Bulgaria, no. 49163/99, \u00a7 71, 2 November 2006). However, this is a question of degree. The situation here cannot be compared with those obtaining in cases, such as Nikolov and Others, where the outcome of the proceedings directly concerns a person\u2019s employment. Delay in such cases may have serious negative repercussions on the litigants\u2019 livelihood. For that reason, a very high level of diligence is required of the authorities (see Nikolov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 41). It follows that the delay in the present case, while regrettable, cannot be regarded as having rendered the length of the proceedings as a whole unreasonable.",
