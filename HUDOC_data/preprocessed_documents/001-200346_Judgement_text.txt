The case originated in an application (no. 51119/15) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five Russian nationals: Mr Abdulbek Gadayev, who was born in 1959 (“the first applicant”); Ms Asmalik Ezhiyeva, who was born in 1961 (“the second applicant”); Mr Aslan Gadayev, who was born in 1987 (“the third applicant”); Ms Tanzila Gadayeva, who was born in 1998 (“the fourth applicant”); and Ms Rayana Gadayeva, who was born in 2003 (“the fifth applicant”), on 2 October 2015.
The applicants were represented by lawyers from Materi Chechni, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) based in Grozny, Russia. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 19 September 2016 the Government were given notice of the application. The Government did not object to the examination of the application by a Committee.
The first and second applicants are the parents of Mr Anzor Gadayev, who was born in 1983. The third, fourth and fifth applicants are his siblings. They live in the village of Mesker-Yurt, Chechnya.
The summary of the facts described below is based on the statements provided by the applicants and witnesses to the events in question to the domestic investigating authorities and the Court.
In 2006 Mr Anzor Gadayev and Mr I.G. received a short prison sentence for participation in an illegal armed group. In 2006 and 2007 they were released; they then returned to Mesker-Yurt.
At around 6 or 7 p.m. on 5 August 2008 a group of armed men in camouflage uniforms arrested Mr I.G. and his cousin, Mr S.I. It is unclear whether the incident took place in a café in the town of Argun or on the Rostov-Baku highway (see paragraph 12 below). The men also seized Mr S.I.’s white VAZ 2107 car, with the registration number A 620 AY 95 RUS.  Presumably they thereafter changed the car’s registration plate and changed out of their uniforms and then drove to Mesker-Yurt.
At about 10 p.m. the men arrived at the applicants’ house in Mesker Yurt in civilian clothes in three vehicles: a white VAZ 2107 car with a registration plate containing the digits 32707 RUS; a VAZ 2112 car; and an UAZ jeep without registration plates.
One of the men knocked at the door at the applicants’ house, introducing himself as Mr Anzor Gadayev’s former fellow prison inmate and saying that he would like to speak with him. When the first applicant opened the door, two of the men entered the courtyard of the applicants’ house, grabbed Mr Anzor Gadayev and forced him into the VAZ 2107 car. The first applicant tried to intervene, but one of the perpetrators threatened him with firearms and fired several warning shots into the ground. Thereafter they drove away with Mr Anzor Gadayev in the direction of the Shali-Argun highway. His whereabouts have remained unknown ever since.
On 9 August 2008 police officers from the Argun district department of the interior (ОВД по г. Аргун) (“the Argun police station”) arrived at the above-mentioned café in Argun, where Mr I.G. and Mr S.I. had presumably been arrested, and interviewed its staff. The relatives of the abducted persons were not allowed to be present during the interviews. The applicants alleged that the officers at the Argun police station might have put undue pressure on the witnesses in an attempt to conceal an arrest perpetrated by State agents. No statements by the café’s staff about such police pressure were enclosed by the applicants with their submission to the Court.
On 10 August 2008 an unidentified person telephoned Mr S.I.’s father and told him that his son’s car was at the Argun police station. Mr S.I.’s father immediately went there and saw a white VAZ 2107 car, which allegedly belonged to his son, parked in the courtyard. The next day, 11 August 2008, he went to the police station with police officer O., who also saw the car. The police station’s on-duty officers refused to acknowledge that Mr Anzor Gadayev’s car was the one parked on their premises. They claimed that the vehicle in question had been found on 12 August 2008 on the highway between the settlement of Belgatoy and Mesker-Yurt (see paragraph 17 below). The first applicant later examined the car and confirmed that it had been used by the perpetrators of his son’s abduction (see paragraph 25 below).
On 19 August 2008 and 17 January 2009 Mr S.I and Mr I.G. respectively were released from detention; they then returned home. Having been questioned by the investigators, they submitted differing accounts of their abduction. According to Mr I.G., they were abducted from a café, whereas according to Mr S.I., they were arrested by men in camouflage uniforms on the Rostov-Baku highway (see paragraphs 29, 32 and 35 below).
Immediately after the abduction the first applicant reported the incident to the Shali district department of the interior (the Shali police station). Shortly thereafter a police officer from that station examined the crime scene and seized a cartridge case left by the perpetrators. On the following day the first applicant re-examined the area and found another cartridge case, which he later submitted to the police.
On 6 August 2008 the first applicant reported the abduction of his son by unknown persons to the Shali inter-district investigative committee in Chechnya.
On the same date, 6 August 2008, the investigators examined the crime scene. No photographs were taken and no evidence was collected. The investigators also questioned the first applicant and Mr Anzor Gadayev’s wife. The witnesses’ statements were similar to the accounts of the event submitted by the applicants to the Court.
On 12 August 2008 the Shali police station informed the investigators that Mr S.I.’s car had been found on the Rostov-Baku highway between the settlement of Belgatoy and Mesker-Yurt on the morning of the same day. Four bullets from a Kalashnikov assault rifle had been found in the car and seized by the police.
On 18 August 2008 the Shali inter-district investigative committee opened criminal case no. 45018 under Article 126 § 2 of the Russian Criminal Code (aggravated abduction).
Shortly thereafter the investigators requested the Chechen Ministry of the interior, together with district departments of the interior in Chechnya, to inform them whether Mr Anzor Gadayev had been arrested by them. All those authorities replied that they had not arrested him.
On 21 August 2008 the investigators obtained a cartridge casing collected by the police in the vicinity of the applicants’ house and joined it to the case-file evidence. An expert examination of 10 September 2008 established that the cartridge had belonged to a bullet fired from a Makarov or a Stechkin pistol.
On 2 September 2008 the investigators drew up a plan of basic steps to be taken on the basis of theories that the abduction of Mr Anzor Gadayev could have been perpetrated by members of an illegal armed group, private persons, or law-enforcement officers.
On an unspecified date in September 2008 (the date is illegible) a police officer, at the investigators’ request, informally interviewed the applicants’ neighbours. They stated that they had not seen the abduction. They declined to give formal evidence, citing a fear of being persecuted.
In the meantime, the investigators sent numerous requests for information to various law-enforcement authorities concerning the whereabouts of Mr Anzor Gadayev, but to no avail.
On 12 September 2008 the investigators learned from the applicants’ neighbours that Mr I.G. had been abducted on the same day, 5 August 2008.
On 18 September 2008 the first applicant was granted victim status in the case and questioned. His statement concerning the circumstances of the abduction was similar to the account of the event submitted by the applicants to the Court. He also noted that the manner in which the abductors had started up the engine of the VAZ 2107 car had indicated that they had not been its owners. The first applicant alleged that both abductions of 5 August 2008 had been perpetrated by the same men.
On 22 September 2008 the investigators questioned Mr S.I’s father. He submitted that on 10 August 2008 he had been informed that his son’s car had been at the Argun police station. He had immediately gone there and had seen the car. The next day, 11 August 2008, he had gone to the Argun police station with police officer O., who had also seen the car. However, the Argun police had refused to acknowledge that the car was on their premises. They had said that the vehicle that Mr S.I.’s father and police officer O. had seen had been found on 12 August 2008 on the highway between the settlement of Beltagoy and Mesker-Yurt. In the light of the above, Mr S.I.’s father alleged that his son had been arrested and then detained on the premises of the Argun police station.
The next day, 23 September 2008, the investigators seized Mr S.I.’s VAZ 2107 car. Three days later, on 26 September 2008, the first applicant examined it and confirmed that his son had been abducted in that car, as he had identified scratches and a dent on the vehicle.
On 5 October 2008 the investigators questioned the applicants’ neighbour, Mr L.S., who had seen a white VAZ 2107 car and a VAZ 2112 car driving away from the applicants’ house in the direction of the Argun-Shali highway late in the evening of 5 August 2008.
On 4 and 6 November 2008 the investigators questioned Mr Anzor Gadayev’s wife and the first applicant, respectively. They did not submit any new information.
On unspecified dates in November 2008 Mr I.G. and Mr S.I. were questioned by police officers from the internal investigations unit of the police about the events of 5 August 2008. According to Mr I.G., the abduction had taken place in the café in Argun, whereas according to Mr S.I., it had occurred on the Rostov-Baku highway. The investigators were informed of the outcome of the questioning by means of a report dated 15 November 2008.
On 18 November 2008 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators.
On 25 November 2008 the above decision was quashed and the investigation resumed.
In the meantime, on 22 September 2008 the investigators opened criminal case no. 57010 under Articles 126 § 2 (aggravated abduction) and 166 (aggravated car theft) of the Russian Criminal Code into the abduction of Mr I.G. and Mr S.I. That case was joined to case no. 45018 on 2 December 2009. Among other documents, the investigators joined to the case file the record of Mr S.I.’s interview of 22 August 2008, in which he submitted that the abduction had taken place on a highway.
On 26 December 2008 the investigation was suspended. The investigation was then resumed on 11 January, 16 February and an unspecified date in 2009, and 25 March 2014 and 14 January 2015; it was then suspended on 11 February, 17 March and 30 April 2009 and 25 April 2014 respectively.
On 29 January 2009 Mr I.G. was examined by forensic medical experts, who noted numerous scars on his left arm and back. The experts did not exclude the possibility that the scars were a result of Mr I.G. having been ill-treated.
During the medical examination Mr I.G. stated to the experts that on 5 August 2008 he had been arrested in a café in the town of Argun, placed in detention and then ill-treated. He was released from detention on 17 January 2009.
On 6 May 2011 the NGO Materi Chechni, on the applicants’ behalf, asked a number of State authorities and law-enforcement agencies to assist in the search for Mr Anzor Gadayev. In reply they received letters stating either that their request had been forwarded to yet another law-enforcement agency for further processing or that operational search activities were still in progress to establish Mr Anzor Gadayev’s whereabouts.
On 19 July 2013 the first applicant requested that the investigators grant him access to the case file. The outcome of that request is unknown.
It appears that the investigation is still ongoing.
On 26 March 2014 the first applicant lodged a complaint with the Shali Town Court challenging the investigators’ decision to suspend the investigation on 30 April 2009 and their failure to take basic investigative steps. The outcome of those proceedings is unknown.
On 16 December 2014 the applicant lodged a similar complaint with the same court. The court dismissed the complaint on 27 January 2015, having found that the investigators had earlier resumed the investigation. On 5 May 2015 the Chechnya Supreme Court upheld that decision on appeal.
