They further claimed that there had been no interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression, given that the proceedings against him had ended with the suspension of the pronouncement of the judgment. The Government submitted that should the Court conclude that there had been an interference, that interference had been prescribed by law and had pursued the legitimate aims of maintaining national security, territorial integrity and public safety, as well as preventing disorder and crime. The Government claimed that the interference with the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression had been necessary in a democratic society. According to the Government, as a politician, the applicant had showed his support for a terrorist organisation\u2019s activities by chanting the slogans noted in the first-instance judgment. Taking into account the necessity to fight against terrorism, the Government contended that the criminal proceedings against the applicant had corresponded to a pressing social need and had been proportionate.",

The Court finds no reason to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned cases, particularly in view of the fact that the applicant, a local politician, faced the threat of a penalty for five years. In the Court\u2019s opinion, that condition entailed a real and effective restraint and had a deterrent effect on the exercise of the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression. The Court thus finds that the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant and the judgment of 15\u00a0April 2010 amounted to an \u201cinterference\u201d with the exercise of his freedom of expression, and that he does therefore have \u201cvictim status\u201d under Article 10.

In the Court\u2019s view,\u00a0one of the slogans mentioned in the first-instance judgment, \u201cthe youth is \u00d6calan\u2019s fedai\u201d might be construed as having a violent tone. However, the first-instance court\u2019s judgment does not contain any information as to the reasons why the applicant was found guilty of disseminating propaganda in support of the PKK. Nor does the judgment contain any assessment of the content of the particular slogans chanted by the applicant. The Assize Court found that by participating in the reading out of the press statement and chanting slogans, the applicant had disseminated propaganda in favour of the PKK, without making an assessment as to whether the applicant\u2019s acts could be construed as encouraging violence, armed resistance or an uprising, or being capable of inciting to violence. These are essential elements to be taken into account. Besides, there is nothing in the case file showing that the event in question was not a peaceful public gathering or that applicant was involved in any violent acts or had the intention of inciting violence. However, the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court does not appear to have given consideration to any of the above factors. In sum, the Court considers that the national courts did not provide \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons for the applicant\u2019s criminal conviction under section 7 (2) of Law no. 3713.",
