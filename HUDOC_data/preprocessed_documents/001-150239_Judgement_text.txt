The case originated in eight separate applications (nos. 37270/11, 37278/11, 47705/11, 47712/11, 47725/11, 56203/11, 56238/11 and 75689/11) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”).  The applicants are all Serbian nationals, and their further personal details are set out in the appendix to this judgment.
The applicants were all represented before the Court by Ms R.  Garibović, a lawyer practicing in Novi Pazar.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Mr S. Carić, and subsequently by their current Agent, Ms Vanja Rodić.
By a decision of 15 October 2013, the Court declared the applications admissible.
All the applicants were employed by Raketa-Putnički Saobraćaj AD, a company based in Užice (hereinafter – “the debtor”).
Since the debtor had failed to fulfil its obligations toward its employees, the applicants brought numerous separate civil claims, seeking payment of salary arrears and various social security contributions.
The applicants obtained final court decisions ordering the debtor to pay them certain sums. The essential information as to the domestic proceedings in respect of each application is indicated in the appended table.
On 12 July 2010 the Užice Commercial Court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor. As a result, all of the ongoing enforcement proceedings against the debtor were stayed.
That decision was posted on the Užice Commercial Court’s notice board on the same date. It was also published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia on 4 August 2010.
The applicants duly reported their respective claims based on the above-mentioned court decisions to the insolvency administration.
The court examined the reported claims at hearings held on 30 September 2010, 30 November 2010, 31 January 2011, 16 March 2011, 28 April 2011 and 8 June 2011.
On 8 June 2011 the court partially accepted the applicants’ claims.
On 17 April 2012 some of the debtor’s property was sold. The remaining assets were advertised for sale in the newspapers and a public auction was scheduled for 29 June 2012. It is not known whether any assets were sold at that auction.
The insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor are still ongoing.
On 30 December 2002 the debtor was privatised.
On 17 July 2007 the privatisation was annulled because the buyer in question had failed to fulfil his contractual obligations.
Following the annulment of the debtor’s privatisation the State owned 58.18% of shares in the debtor.
On 11 December 2008 the State sold its shares to a private company.
The Act regulates the institution and conduct of insolvency proceedings against legal persons. Article 2 of the Act provides that the aim of insolvency is to ensure the most favourable collective settlement for creditors.
Article 8 of the Act provides that all insolvency proceedings must be conducted urgently.
In accordance with Articles 19 § 1 and 22 § 1, in insolvency proceedings against State-owned companies the role of an insolvency administrator will be performed by the Privatisation Agency.
Article 71 §§ 2 and 3 provides that an announcement on the opening of insolvency proceedings will be drafted by the insolvency judge immediately after the rendering of the decision to institute insolvency proceedings. The announcement must be posted on the court’s notice board and published in one prominent daily newspaper, and in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia.
Article 73 § 1 stipulates that the legal consequences of the opening of insolvency proceedings will take effect on the date on which the announcement of the institution of the insolvency proceedings is posted on the court’s notice board.
Article 93 §§ 1 and 2 provides that once insolvency proceedings have been instituted, the debtor cannot simultaneously be subjected to separate enforcement proceedings. Any ongoing enforcement proceedings are thus stayed by virtue of the law, and new enforcement proceedings cannot be instituted so long as the insolvency proceedings are pending.
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially-owned companies and enforcement proceedings are outlined in the case of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06 et al., §§ 57-64 and §§ 71-76, 15 January 2008. Furthermore, the case-law of the Constitutional Court in respect of socially-owned companies, together with the relevant provisions concerning constitutional appeals and the privatisation of socially-owned companies, are outlined in the cases of Marinković v. Serbia (dec.), no. 5353/11, §§ 26-29 and §§ 31-44, 29 January 2013; Marinković v. Serbia, no. 5353/11, §§ 29-32, 22 October 2013; and Ferizović v. Serbia (dec.), no. 65713/11, §§ 12-17, 26 November 2013.
