In the Court\u2019s view, these grounds were relevant and sufficient to justify the applicant\u2019s detention.

It is true that there was a period of inactivity between the hearings held on 22 October 1993 and 6 October 1994.  However, this inactivity cannot be attributed to the judicial authorities as it was caused by the fact that one of the accused repeatedly failed to comply with the court\u2019s summonses, and his case was on the latter date separated from that of the applicant.  On 1 March 1995 the hearing was cancelled for personal reasons concerning one of the judges, and on 22\u00a0April 1996 the hearing was not held as the court had failed to inform the applicant\u2019s lawyer of the date of the hearing.

Therefore the court proceedings had to be conducted from the beginning. However, otherwise the hearings in the case were scheduled at regular intervals and when they were adjourned it was, on many occasions, for reasons which cannot be attributed to the court. The hearings which were adjourned were in most cases not held as the accused failed to attend them for various reasons. ",

It is to be noted that he did not submit a relevant medical certificate in respect of the hearing scheduled on 24 November 1994, and submitted the certificate to justify his absence at the hearing on 16 January 1995 only on 26 January 1995. The applicant was further absent at the hearing which was to be held on 14 March 1997. Likewise, the hearing scheduled for 5\u00a0May 1997 was discontinued, as the applicant felt unwell. Later in April and May he failed to comply with the summons for medical examination to have his actual health condition established despite his previous undertaking to do so. In July and August 1995 the applicant again twice failed to report for the medical examination, ordered by the court in order to establish whether he could participate in the proceedings. On 25 March 1999 the applicant requested the court to adjourn the hearing in the appellate proceedings, and the court ultimately scheduled this hearing for 17 June 1999, and gave the appellate judgment on that date.

As a result, new lawyers were appointed to represent the applicant, which entailed delays in the proceedings. The applicant likewise did not establish an effective channel of communication with his lawyer as the latter stated on 16 January 1995 that he had unsuccessfully tried to contact the applicant.  Moreover, at the hearing held on 30 January 1997, on 31 October 1997 and on 28 January 1998 the applicant complained about the alleged lack of competence of the lawyers appointed under the legal aid scheme, who represented him.  In the light of the submissions of the applicant\u2019s lawyer of 10 February 1996 (\u00a7 56) his statements do not appear to be justified. The applicant also challenged the judges of the courts, dealing with his case on 11 March 1996 and 7 June 1996. These motions were declared unfounded. Assessing the circumstances of the case as a whole, the Court is of the view that the Government\u2019s submission that the applicant had resorted to delaying tactics is well founded.",
