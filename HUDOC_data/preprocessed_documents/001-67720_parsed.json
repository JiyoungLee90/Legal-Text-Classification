Dr S. considered that the applicant's condition necessitated his admission to hospital and was not compatible with detention in prison, whereas Dr B. concluded that it was compatible with detention, as the treatment was simple and could be administered in a prison environment, and Dr F. concluded that (medical) care in custody was entirely appropriate, and that compatibility with detention was reasonable under medical supervision although it would be more coherent for him to be detained in hospital.",
