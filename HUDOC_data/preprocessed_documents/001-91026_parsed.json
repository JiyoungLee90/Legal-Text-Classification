The Supreme Court emphasised that it was irrelevant whether the lower court formulated the adjournment of the hearing by a separate written ruling or not. It noted that the higher court could not set a new time for the hearing in the lower court; however, it could oblige the lower court to re-examine the matter. The higher court could assess whether there had been relevant objective circumstances that had caused the adjournment and whether the lower court had complied with the discretionary rules in scheduling a new hearing.

The first preliminary hearing in the present case was held on 18 May 2005, five years and seven months after the beginning of the proceedings. Before that no hearings had been held or adjourned.

In any event, according to the information available to the Court, this was the only adjournment of the hearing during the impugned proceedings.
