The court considered that Article 6 of the Convention was inapplicable because the applicant had been convicted before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force but added that, even if Article 6 applied, it would not affect their assessment on the facts. It considered that, on the limited documentary material before him, the judge could not have come to any other conclusion than that a fair trial was possible.

The conduct of the authorities was reasonable, in particular the police were entitled to take the view that ongoing abuse investigations took priority over past incidents; they also had to investigate other alleged incidents of abuse which did not, in the end, go to trial. They emphasised that the only delay criticised by the trial judge was the delay in taking statements from the complainants which occurred before the applicant was affected or charged.

Nor is the Court persuaded that the case was particularly complex.

Some delay in the trial resulted from the applicant's illness, but this was only a few months. A further delay was caused by the removal abroad of one of the complainants who had apparently forgotten about the imminent proceedings. This perhaps might not be altogether the fault of the authorities, although the applicant claimed that they failed to keep the witness properly informed. However, it nonetheless appears that it took two years eight months from arrest to trial (20 March 1997 to 22 November 1999) and then over a further two years for the appeal to be terminated (7 December 1999 to 20 December 2001 - this included a period of over eight months before the renewed application was granted after the refusal of the single judge and just over a year from the grant of leave to appeal to the final decision of the full court). Only a short part of this period can be attributed to the applicant, whose counsel applied for a short extension in the time-limit to perfect grounds of appeal.",

An added consideration is the fact that the trial concerned matters some years in the past and a further lapse of time could only damage the quality of the evidence available. In conclusion, there are several periods of delay which, taken together and in light of the date of the events under examination, disclose that the proceedings did not proceed with the necessary expedition and failed to satisfy the reasonable time requirement. There has, accordingly, been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
