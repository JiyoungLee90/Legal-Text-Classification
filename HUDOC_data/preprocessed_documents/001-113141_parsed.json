The court imposed a fine of 7,500\u00a0Polish zlotys (PLN; approx. EUR 1,900) on the applicant.

In this connection, the trial court observed that the applicant had long been in conflict with the mayor and on numerous occasions had requested the prosecution service to investigate the cases in which the mayor had allegedly breached the law. In some of the investigations she had succeeded in having the case remitted or reopened; however none of them had concluded with the filing of a bill of indictment. Assessing the situation objectively, the court noted that the actions of the mayor and the manner in which the investigation had been conducted could at most give rise to some doubts, but certainly did not justify the statement that the mayor had been putting extralegal pressure on the prosecution service. Furthermore, it underlined that had the applicant had suspicions regarding the mayor she should have notified the prosecution service about them with a view to having them objectively verified.",

It held that it was too farreaching to be covered by this provision, which also protected the reputation and the rights of others. Certainly, the mayor as a person holding public office had to accept that his activity would be scrutinised and that every citizen could express his or her views with respect to the actions of the authorities. Thus, opinions in respect of a politician could concern his efficiency in governing, his ability to take decisions, his aptitude or inaptitude to hold public office. Opinions consisted in expressing one\u2019s view on a subject open to abstract value judgment, which was not entirely measurable. However, the impugned statement of the applicant concerned the facts which were not supported by the reality of things but were based on her speculations and guesses. She could have expressed opinions regarding her doubts as to the correctness of the prosecutor\u2019s decisions or the manner in which the investigations had been conducted, etc.; however, her statement did not fall into this category. The applicant did not formulate a value judgment but alleged that an offence had been committed and thus she asserted the existence of a fact. In so far as the applicant argued that the Press Act was applicable to her case, the trial court noted that, in any event, she had not displayed particular diligence when publishing her allegations. The trial court concluded that the applicant\u2019s actions did not come under the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution and the Convention. The right to criticism and to express one\u2019s opinions did not include the right to formulate unjustified and unproved allegations that an offence had been committed. The allegation that the mayor had put extralegal pressure on the prosecution service was to be associated either with an attempt to bribe or an attempt to resort to threats or violence in order to influence a decision of a public authority.",

However, in the present case, the Court is unable to follow the domestic courts\u2019 position and finds that there are sufficient arguments to consider that the impugned assertion, taken against the background of the letter as a whole, should be regarded as a value judgment. The important issue to be borne in mind is the overall context in which the applicant made her statement. She adverted in her article to \u201cthe\u00a0extralegal pressure on the prosecution service\u201d, explicitly referring to the earlier case when the municipal council had harshly attacked in its statement the prosecutor who had conducted the investigation against the mayor. It is to be noted that the term \u201cextralegal\u201d as used by the applicant was exactly the same as the term employed in the statement of the municipal council.
