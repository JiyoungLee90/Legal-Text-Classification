Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty (see, among other authorities, W. v. Switzerland, judgment of 26 January 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0254A, p. 15, \u00a7\u00a030, and Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a0110, ECHR\u00a02000XI). The Convention case-law has developed four basic acceptable reasons for refusing bail: the risk that the accused will fail to appear for trial; the risk that the accused, if released, would take action to prejudice the administration of justice or commit further offences or cause public disorder (see Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, \u00a7\u00a059, ECHR\u00a02003IX (extracts)). The danger of absconding cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the possible sentence; it must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify pre-trial detention. In this context regard must be had in particular to the character of the person involved, his morals, his assets, his links with the State in which he is being prosecuted and his international contacts (see W.\u00a0v. Switzerland, judgment of 26\u00a0January 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0254-A, \u00a7 33 with further references, and Smirnova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a060).",
