She did not know \u00dcmit Ta\u015f and if he was there she was not in a position to identify him. She stated specifically that she could see Hasan and Mehmet \u015eerif Avar being put on the helicopter. The Commission noted that the applicants and the other witnesses appeared to associate the placing of detainees on the helicopter with their missing relatives largely because some were identified by the women and also on the basis that these eleven persons were the only detainees remaining at Kepir after the others such as Abdurrahim Yerlikaya and Mehmet \u0130lbey were released. They had also been held together as a distinct group and were no longer there after the operation ended. While this provided strong circumstantial evidence, the Commission was not satisfied that it could be established, to the necessary standard of proof, that the eleven missing persons were all placed on the helicopters, in particular \u00dcmit Ta\u015f, though it was satisfied that at least some of the eleven detainees were. There was no evidence that any of these persons were seen after the operation ended on or about 24-25 October. The Commission found that when they were last seen they were detained under guard by security forces. ",

There were accordingly insufficiently concrete elements to substantiate the claims that the eleven relatives of the applicants had been taken by soldiers.

However, within less than two months, he ceded jurisdiction to the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security public prosecutor on the apparent basis that it was a PKK-linked terrorist crime. There was no evidence in the file to provide any support for this assumption. The only material consisted of the petitions of the applicants and members of their family who referred to their relatives having been detained by soldiers, in addition to the absence of any entries being found in Kulp or  custody records. It was not until August 1994 that the  prosecutor began taking statements from the applicants. Though Mehmet Emin Akdeniz mentioned in his statement of 28 October 1994 that there were women who had witnessed the removal of the missing men in a security force helicopter, a statement was not taken from Pembe Akdeniz until 29 May 1996. It may be noted that, save one ambiguous statement by Zeki Akdeniz, all the statements from the applicants and their families maintained that soldiers had taken the missing men. On 29 April 1997, the  prosecutor declined jurisdiction, sending the file back to the Kulp public prosecutor noting the absence of evidence of PKK involvement.

It has reiterated in that connection that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. In order to minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5. Bearing in mind the responsibility of the authorities to account for individuals under their control, Article 5 requires them to take effective measures to safeguard against the risk of disappearance and to conduct a prompt and effective investigation into an arguable claim that a person has been taken into custody and has not been seen since (Kurt v. Turkey judgment, loc. cit., pp.\u00a01184-85, \u00a7 122-125, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey judgment, loc. cit., \u00a7 104).",

The authorities have failed to provide a plausible explanation for their whereabouts and fate after that date.

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 also varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention.

I consider that the Court is not equipped to carry out this type of actuarial calculation. Moreover, where compensation for pecuniary damage is concerned, there is no cause to make an award on the basis of \u201cequitable considerations\u201d, this being appropriate only for non-pecuniary damage. If the Court considers that a sum should be awarded for damage, and for alleged loss of income at that, it would have been preferable to order an expert report, as the former Court did on a number of occasions. In my opinion, moreover, it is not for the Government, as the Court considers, to comment on the speculations put forward without any acceptable basis by the applicants. Failing a proper expert report on the question, any discussion or supposition is baseless and therefore unacceptable.",
