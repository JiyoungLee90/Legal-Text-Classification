They submitted that the choice of the custodial measure had been prompted by the applicant\u2019s conduct while he had been under a written undertaking not to leave his place of residence: the applicant had been regularly late for, or absent from, sessions involving the examination of the case file without providing any reasons; he had refused to give the investigator his contact numbers; and he had tried to put pressure on the members of the investigating team. These circumstances, together with the seriousness of the charges against the applicant, had made the risk of his absconding or otherwise hampering the administration of justice well-founded. Therefore, detention had been chosen in respect of the applicant and subsequently extended with due consideration of all the relevant circumstances, including the applicant\u2019s state of health. When extending the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial the court had taken into account the fact that the applicant\u2019s medical diagnosis had not been confirmed by the forensic medical expert and therefore the applicant\u2019s references to poor health had remained unsubstantiated. Furthermore, the court had taken into account that, while in custody, the applicant had tried to exert pressure on witnesses so that they would change their testimonies before the court. Furthermore, while the applicant had provided the court with guarantees from members of the Duma to the effect that he would not abscond if the custodial measure was to be changed to a more lenient preventive measure, the court had serious doubts as to authenticity of the documents containing such guarantees. Despite good references from work and the applicant\u2019s family situation, he had been known to the investigating authorities as an offender. Specifically, in 1998 a criminal case had been opened against the applicant on the charges of taking the law into his own hands, which had been later terminated on nonrehabilitative grounds. The Government therefore concluded that the domestic courts had had relevant and sufficient grounds for holding the applicant in custody and that the proceedings had been conducted with \u201cspecial diligence\u201d.",

Referring to the decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Court of 31 May 2006 in the case against a certain Mr\u00a0T. who challenged the lawfulness of his conviction on account of the composition of the trial court, they asserted that the fact that lay judges had been called to serve more than once a year is not alone sufficient to call into question their judicial capacity.

The applicant further noted that the Government had acknowledged the fact that, while participating in the examination of the criminal case against him, which lasted one year and three months, Ms Kh. and Ms\u00a0Shch. had also been participating as lay judges in the examination of the criminal case against a certain Mr Tver. This constituted, in the applicant\u2019s opinion, a violation of section 9 of the Lay Judges Act which provided that lay judges were to be called to serve in a district court for a period of fourteen days, or as long as the proceedings in a particular case lasted, and that they could not be called more than once a year. In reply to the Government\u2019s reference to the decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Court of 31 May 2006, the applicant relied on decisions of the same body of 15 December 2004 and 22\u00a0February 2006. In the former decision the Presidium held that calling lay judges for service more than once a year was contrary to the requirements of the Lay Judges Act and the law on criminal procedure and required the quashing of any convictions in such a case. In the latter decision the Presidium expressed a similar view: it quashed the conviction and remitted the case for retrial since a lay judge had taken part in the examination of three other cases within the same year and therefore the composition of the court had been unlawful. The applicant further argued that after 1 January 2004 the participation of Ms\u00a0Kh. and Ms\u00a0Shch. as lay judges in his trial had ceased to be lawful since from the above date there had no longer been any basis in the domestic law for their further involvement in the proceedings.",

The position of the Russian Supreme Court presented by the Government and available in the case file supports that view (see paragraph 61).

Therefore, the logic is that if the lay judges are involved in two cases at the same time, it does not mean that the composition of the court is unlawful in both cases, rather it is unlawful in the subsequent case.
