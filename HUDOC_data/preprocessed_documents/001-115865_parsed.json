On 3 August 2001 the decision to open a criminal investigation referred to the damage to property caused by shelling by military servicemen (see paragraph 15 above). Similar information is repeated on several occasions in various official documents issued by the investigation (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above). The applicants and other witnesses consistently indicated that the fire had started as the result of shooting from a tank (see paragraphs 16, 21 and 22 above).",

The Court reiterates that, although sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and cautious about taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, the Court is nevertheless not bound by the findings of the domestic courts and may depart from them where this is rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, Matyar v.

The applicants, who were often absent when the damage was inflicted, were unable to furnish the domestic courts, or this Court, with reliable evidence confirming the involvement of State agents in the infliction of the damage to their property. Having regard to the twofold violence ensuing from the actions of both parties to the conflict, the Court was not convinced that in such circumstances the State could be held responsible for any damage inflicted during the military operation, or that the State\u2019s responsibility was engaged by the mere fact that the applicant\u2019s property had been affected (see Umarov (dec.), cited above, and Trapeznikova v. , no. 21539/02, \u00a7 108, 11 December 2008).
