On 13 December 2007 Bishop F. issued a press release repudiating allegations that his earlier comments had implied a degree of similarity between the scientists carrying out embryonic stem-cell research and the Nazis who had performed experiments on humans. He emphasised that he had had absolutely no intention of casting such defamatory aspersions upon the scientists, but reasserted his belief that there was an urgent need for such vitally important ethical issues to be debated critically. He claimed that he had never wished to imply that there had been any link between stem-cell research and the ideological and historical context of the crimes committed by the dehumanising Nazi system, which should not be relativised through comparison.",

In its judgment the court acknowledged the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression and to impart to others his beliefs that the fusion of an egg and a sperm represented the beginning of human life and that research using imported stem cells from terminated embryos involved the destruction of human life. It also emphasised that the applicant had the fundamental liberty to exercise his freedom of expression by imparting his opinion strikingly and pointedly, including in the form of abusive criticism addressed at well-known researchers referred to by name. However, the court found that, when viewed in its entirety, the press release had exceeded the permissible bounds of abusive criticism. The court based this decision on the fact that the implication that the scientists had been guilty not just of committing murder but of doing so for deeply despicable motives had been a central theme running through the press release and had escalated in the phrase \u201cThe time has finally arrived to overcome the spirit of Auschwitz\u201d. It concluded that the applicant had intended to imply that the scientists carrying out stem-cell research had been prompted by the same criminal, sadistic and dehumanising motives as those responsible for performing unimaginably cruel mass experiments on humans, such as Mengele in Auschwitz. Given Prof. Dr B.\u2019s position as a doctor and scientist, this implication had been severely insulting.",

Similarly to the District Court, the Regional Court acknowledged the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression and that his press release had contributed to a debate of great public interest. It further held that the majority of the statements in the press release had been value judgments and that therefore the press release had to be classified as a value judgment and not as a statement of fact. Nonetheless, the court stated that freedom of expression was not granted unconditionally and could be subject to restrictions with a view to protecting, inter alia, the right to personal honour. When examining contributions to a debate of public interest, however, there had to be a presumption in favour of freedom of speech. The Regional Court further found that the criterion for abusive criticism had not been met. Criticism which was excessive or even aggressive in nature was not necessarily abusive. The relevant criterion was whether the main purpose of the criticism had been to defame an individual rather than to debate the relevant issue. The court concluded that this was not applicable in the case at hand, since the applicant\u2019s past behaviour and the content of the press release showed that the focus had been on \u201cthe issue\u201d rather than the individual doctor against whom allegations had been made. The court therefore found that the right to freedom of expression had to be balanced with the legally protected personality rights of Prof. Dr B. and emphasised that freedom of expression granted equal protection to all statements of opinion, regardless of whether they were useful, useless, correct, incorrect, emotional, rational or even polemical or insulting. The Regional Court took into account that the press release had represented the applicant\u2019s contribution to the formation of public opinion, but believed that referring to Prof. Dr B. by name had been equivalent to linking his professional conduct to the atrocities committed by the Nazis. It concluded that this had represented a serious infringement of his personality rights, which had also been unnecessary since the applicant could have contributed to the debate without referring to the professor by name.",

In addition, when the Court examined cases concerning value judgments, which the domestic courts had found to be of a defamatory character, it assessed whether the language used had been of an excessive or dispassionate nature and whether an intention of defaming or stigmatising the opponent had been disclosed (see Genner, cited above, \u00a7 39).",

It accepts this finding but would add that the applicant nonetheless made allegations against the scientists and doctors conducting stem-cell research, and in particular against Prof. Dr B. The Court therefore finds that even though the intention behind the applicant\u2019s press release was not mainly to defame the scientists, by naming Prof. Dr B. it still had a stigmatising and defaming effect.",

Germany, nos. 397/07 and 2322/07, \u00a7 48, 13 January 2011). The comparison of modern-day stem-cell research to experiments carried out on humans in concentration camps must therefore be seen in the specific context of German history. The Court has previously accepted that in the light of their historical role and experience, States which have experienced the Nazi horrors may be regarded as having a special moral responsibility to distance themselves from the mass atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis (see Perin\u00e7ek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, \u00a7 243, ECHR 2015 (extracts), and Nix v. Germany (dec.), no. 35285/16, 13 March 2018). The Court therefore concludes that the attack on Prof. Dr B.\u2019s reputation was serious and that the historical context is a weighty factor to be taken into account when assessing whether there existed a pressing social need for interfering with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression (compare Nix, cited above, \u00a7 56).",

The Court recalls that where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see Delfi AS, cited above, \u00a7 139, with further references). It finds that the decisions by the domestic courts were based on a reasonable assessment of the statements in question, the rights of Prof. Dr B. and of the circumstances of the present case.",

Denmark, no. 19657/12, \u00a7 77, 5\u00a0December 2017). While the use of criminallaw sanctions in defamation cases is not in itself disproportionate, the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account, because they must not be such as to dissuade the press or others who engage in public debate from taking part in the discussion of matters of legitimate public concern (Ziembi\u0144ski v. \u00a0Poland (no. 2), no. 1799/07, \u00a7 46, 5 July 2016, with further references). In that regard, it notes that the applicant was sentenced to a penalty of 30\u00a0daily fines of EUR 15 each and thereby to a sentence at the lower end of the possible criminal sanctions for insult. Having regard to the seriousness of the violations of Prof.\u00a0Dr B.\u2019s personality rights and the nature of the personalized attacks, when seen in the historical context (see paragraph 29 above), the Court finds that the penalty appears moderate and did not fall outside of the domestic courts\u2019 margin of appreciation.",
