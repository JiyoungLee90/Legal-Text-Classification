The relevant assessment in this context was based on the criteria set out in the \u0160ilih judgment according to which only procedural acts and/or omissions occurring after the critical date could fall within the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction. Moreover, a \u201cgenuine connection\u201d between the impugned treatment and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent State needed to exist for the procedural obligations to come into effect (see \u0160ilih, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0162-163).",

Russia ([GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0145148, ECHR 2013). The Court explained that its temporal jurisdiction was not open-ended. It extends to those procedural acts and omissions which took place or ought to have taken place in the period after the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent State, provided that there is a \u201cgenuine connection\u201d between the triggering event and the entry into force of the Convention. The \u201cgenuine connection\u201d standard will be satisfied if the following two criteria are met: first, the lapse of time between the triggering event and the critical date must remain reasonably short, in any case not exceeding ten years; and secondly, a major part of the procedural steps must have been carried out, or ought to have been carried out, after the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent State. The Court has recently applied these criteria in the context of the civil proceedings for damages concerning the allegations of medical negligence under Article 2 of the Convention (see Shovgurov v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a017601/12, \u00a7\u00a7 56-65, 25 August 2015). In view of the fact that the procedural requirements under Article 2 concerning medical negligence accordingly apply under Article 8 (see, for instance, Trocellier v.

Romania, no.\u00a08759/05, \u00a7 43, 15 January 2013, and the case-law cited in paragraph 84 below), the Court sees no reason for not applying the same criteria in the context of the present case.",

Following the surgery, the applicant underwent further medical treatment and, after she had learnt the extent of the damage to her health, she instituted the relevant civil proceedings in January 1998, namely after the Convention had already entered into force in respect of Croatia.

For instance, the authorities must take sufficient care to ensure the independence, both formal and de facto, of the experts involved in the proceedings and the objectivity of their findings, since these are likely to carry crucial weight in the ensuing legal assessment of the highly complex issues of medical negligence (see Baji\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a095; and Karpisiewicz v. Poland (dec.), no. 14730/09, \u00a7 59, 11 December 2012; as well as the earlier case of Skraskowski v. Poland (dec.), no.\u00a036420/97, 6 April 2000, in which the same requirement was laid down in less explicit terms). A further requirement is that the experts must examine carefully all the relevant points and set out in enough detail the reasons for their conclusions (see Baldovin v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a011385/05, \u00a7 23, 7 June 2011; and Altu\u011f and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 32086/07, \u00a7\u00a7 78-81, 30\u00a0June 2015), and the courts or other authorities dealing with the case must then scrutinise those conclusions properly (see Csoma, \u00a7 56; and Altu\u011f and Others, \u00a7 82, both cited above). A system in which an opinion given by a specialised institution is automatically regarded as conclusive evidence which precludes further expert examination of the relevant issues falls foul of this requirement (see Eugenia Laz\u0103r v.\u00a0Romania, no. 32146/05, \u00a7\u00a7 76-80, 16\u00a0February 2010; Baldovin, cited above, \u00a7 24; and Csoma, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061).",

Such a responsibility is based on the principle of fault although, in the particular circumstances of a case, depending on the nature of the treatment, it may also be based on the principle of objective liability (see paragraphs 57-59, and also paragraph 35 above).
