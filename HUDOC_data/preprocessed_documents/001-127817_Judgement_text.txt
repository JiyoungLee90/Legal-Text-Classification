The case originated in an application (no. 33333/11) against the Republic of Slovenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Janez Stojan Sotošek (“the applicant”), on 5 May 2011.
The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 26 September 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Ljubljana.
On 5 May 1986 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against six defendants before the Ljubljana Basic Court claiming non-pecuniary damages for defamation.
By 28 June 1994 when the Convention came into force in respect of Slovenia, the court had scheduled eight main hearings which were all adjourned.
A hearing was scheduled for 19 September 1994 but was adjourned after the applicant had on 15 September 1994 lodged a motion for the referral of the matter to a Labour and social Court.
On 19 September 1994 the applicant’s motion was dismissed.
By 17 September 1998 when the Ljubljana District Court held a main hearing further four scheduled hearings had been postponed, one at the request of the applicant. On the latter date the court issued its decision, granting the applicant’s claim. The defendants appealed.
On 29 March 2000 the Ljubljana Higher Court upheld the appeal and dismissed the applicant’s claim. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law.
On 8 March 2001 the Supreme Court granted the applicant’s appeal on points of law and remitted the case back to the second instance court which on 21 June 2002 issued a decision to remit the case back to the first instance court.
On 29 November 2002 the applicant requested that a scheduled main hearing be postponed due to health reasons.
The hearing scheduled for 10 March 2003 was postponed after the applicant had on 6 March 2003 lodged a motion for suspension of the presiding judge, a motion to have disciplinary proceedings instituted against the judge, a motion to have the presiding judge excluded and a motion to transfer the case to another court.
On 23 April 2003 the Ljubljana District Court imposed a fine on the applicant for abusing procedural rights and for contempt of court.
On 25 May 2004 the applicant made a motion to have the case transferred to another court. On 24 June 2004 the Supreme Court dismissed the motion.
On 31 May 2004 a main hearing was held. The applicant did not appear at the hearing.
On 11 November 2004 the court held a main hearing and issued its decision, dismissing the applicant’s claim. The applicant appealed.
On 15 June 2006 the Ljubljana Higher Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law.
On 9 October 2008 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. The applicant lodged a constitutional appeal.
On 3 November 2010 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional appeal. The decision was served on the applicant on 6 November 2010.
