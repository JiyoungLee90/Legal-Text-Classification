In the advocate-general\u2019s opinion, if the same rationale were applied in the present case, even where domestic law had been circumvented, a legal relationship lawfully created abroad could not be prevented from producing the relevant legal effects where it concerned an effective family set-up and allowed it to function and evolve in normal conditions from the standpoint of Article 8 of the Convention.

It notes first of all that the applicants have not adduced any evidence in support of their assertion that a more liberal practice used to exist in France regarding the recognition of a legal parent-child relationship between children born abroad as the result of a surrogacy agreement and the intended parents. It observes next that at the material time Articles 16-7 and 16-9 of the Civil Code expressly provided that surrogacy agreements were null and void and specified that this was on public-policy grounds. Admittedly, the Court of Cassation had not given a general ruling on the question of recognition under French law of the legal parent-child relationship between intended parents and children born abroad as the result of a surrogacy agreement. It had, however, previously specified \u2013 in a case in which the surrogate mother was the biological mother \u2013 that such an agreement contravened the principles of the inalienability of the human body and civil status. It had concluded in a similar case that this precluded the establishment of a legal parent-child relationship between the child thus conceived and the intended mother, and precluded, among other things, registration in the register of births, marriages and deaths of the details recorded in a birth certificate drawn up abroad ... It was on the basis of those provisions of the Civil Code and in accordance with that explicit case-law that the Court of Cassation concluded in the present case that the judgment of the Supreme Court of California of 14\u00a0July 2000 was contrary to the French concept of international public policy in that it gave effect to a surrogacy agreement and that the entries in the French register of births, marriages and deaths of the particulars of the birth certificates drawn up in application of that judgment should be annulled. In the Court\u2019s view, the applicants could not therefore have been unaware that there was at least a substantial risk that the French courts would rule accordingly in their case, even if no provision of domestic law expressly precluded recognition of a legal parent-child relationship between the first and second and the third and fourth applicants, and notwithstanding the principle of the attenuated effect of public policy (which, moreover, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat considers inapplicable to this type of situation ...).

Transsexuals, for example, could obtain a change of the sex stated on their birth certificate, and the legal recognition of children lawfully born abroad as the result of a surrogacy agreement was the subject of debate among legal commentators, in Parliament and in society. It was all the more irrelevant since in principle French law was currently favourable to \u201cintended\u201d parents. Accordingly, in the case of the implantation of embryos in the womb of a third party, which was legal in France (the applicants referred to Articles L. 2141-4 et seq. of the Public Health Code), a woman who carried the embryo of another couple and gave birth to a child who was not biologically hers, could \u2013 as could her partner \u2013 establish a legal parent-child relationship with that child that excluded the biological parents. Similarly, in cases of donor insemination (also legal in France), no legal parent-child relationship could be established with the sperm donor, whereas a legal parent-child relationship with the mother\u2019s partner could be established (the applicants referred to Articles 311-19 and\u00a0311-20 of the Civil Code).",

Furthermore, their effective and affective family life was \u201clegally clandestine\u201d. This was particularly shocking in the case of the first applicant, who was deprived of recognition of the legal parent-child relationship with the third and fourth applicants by the refusal to record the particulars of the children\u2019s birth certificates in the French register of births, marriages and deaths even though he was their biological father and there was nothing to prevent that relationship from being officially recorded. What was more, the applicants had no other possibility of having the family ties legally established, since the case-law of the Court of Cassation precluded not only registration of the birth details but also adoption or recognition of their de facto enjoyment of status (possession d\u2019\u00e9tat).

Furthermore, in the event of the first applicant\u2019s death or should the first two applicants separate, the second applicant would be deprived of any rights in respect of the children, to their and her own detriment. In order to carry out administrative tasks for which French nationality or an official legal parent-child relationship were required (registration of the children for social-security purposes, enrolment at the school canteen or outdoor centre, or applications for financial assistance from the Family Allowances Office), they had to produce the US birth certificates together with an officially sworn translation in order to prove that the children were theirs, and the success of their application depended on the good will of the person dealing with it. The applicants pointed out in this connection that the advocate-general had recommended, before the Court of Cassation, recognising the legal parent-child relationship between the applicants, particularly on the ground of the children\u2019s best interests, and that the Paris Court of Appeal itself had observed that the situation would create practical difficulties for the Mennesson family. They also referred to the report of the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat of 2009 on the review of bioethical laws, which indicated that \u201cin practice, families\u2019 lives [were] more complicated without registration, because of the formalities that had to be completed on various occasions in life\u201d.

It was clear from the Supreme Court of California\u2019s decision of 14 July 2000 that the official parents of the third and fourth applicants were the first two applicants. The French authorities and courts had refused to make that finding, however, with the result that as the mother was not recognised as having that status under French law, the legal parent-child relationship could not be governed by the law of her country. Accordingly, it was governed by the law of the country of the third and fourth applicants: US law. As the legal parent-child relationship between them and the first two applicants could not be established under French law and the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgments of 13\u00a0September 2013 had annulled the recognition of paternity by biological fathers of children born as the result of a surrogacy agreement performed abroad ..., the third and fourth applicants could not acquire French nationality under Article 18 of the Civil Code (\u201ca child of whom at least one parent is French has French nationality\u201d) even though the first applicant was their biological father. The applicants added that, notwithstanding the circular of 25 January 2013 ..., the third and fourth applicants could not obtain a certificate of nationality. They submitted that, as a result of the judgment delivered in their case by the Court of Cassation and its decisions of 13 September 2013 describing as \u201cfraudulent\u201d the process by which the birth certificate of a child born abroad of a surrogacy agreement was drawn up, the US birth certificates of the children were invalid for the purposes of Article 47 of the Civil Code, whereupon that provision was inoperative. They added that the thrust of the circular was not aimed at precluding the issuing of a certificate of nationality on the basis of a mere suspicion that recourse had been had to a surrogacy arrangement, and that it was therefore inoperative in respect of situations such as theirs in which the courts had explicitly found that there had been a surrogacy arrangement. In support of that argument, they stated that they had not received a reply to the request for a certificate of French nationality for the third and fourth applicants lodged by the first applicant with the registry of the Charenton-le-Pont District Court on 16\u00a0April 2013. They produced acknowledgment-of-receipt forms signed on 31 October 2013 and 13 March 2014 by the registrar indicating that the request \u201c[was] still being processed in [his] department pending a reply to the request for authentication sent to the consulate of Los Angeles, California\u201d. They added that, on account in particular of the Court of Cassation\u2019s decisions of 13 September 2013, the first applicant could not recognise the third and fourth applicants even though he was their biological father.",

Firstly, it notes that according to the very terms of the provision referred to, French nationality is granted on the basis of the nationality of one or the other parent. It observes that it is specifically the legal determination of the parents that is at the heart of the application lodged with the Court. Accordingly, the applicants\u2019 observations and the Government\u2019s replies suggest that the rules of private international law render recourse to Article 18 of the Civil Code in order to establish the French nationality of the third and fourth applicants particularly complex, not to mention uncertain, in the present case. Secondly, the Court notes that the Government rely on Article 47 of the Civil Code. Under that provision, civil-status certificates drawn up abroad and worded in accordance with the customary procedures of the country concerned are deemed valid \u201csave where other certificates or documents held, external data, or particulars in the certificate itself establish ... that the document in question is illegal, forged, or that the facts stated therein do not match the reality\u201d. The question therefore arises whether that exception applies in a situation such as the present case, where it has been observed that the children concerned were born as the result of a surrogacy agreement performed abroad, which the Court of Cassation has deemed a circumvention of the law. Although they were invited by the President to answer that question and specify whether there was a risk that a certificate of nationality thus drawn up would subsequently be contested and annulled or withdrawn, the Government have not provided any indications. Moreover, the request lodged for that purpose on 16 April 2013 with the registry of the Charenton-le-Pont District Court by the first applicant was still pending eleven months later. The senior registrar indicated on 31 October 2013 and on 13 March 2014 that it was \u201cstill being processed in [his] department pending a reply to the request for authentication sent to the consulate of Los Angeles, California\u201d (see paragraph 28 above).",

As domestic law currently stands, the third and fourth applicants are in a position of legal uncertainty. While it is true that a legal parent-child relationship with the first and second applicants is acknowledged by the French courts in so far as it has been established under Californian law, the refusal to grant any effect to the US judgment and to record the details of the birth certificates accordingly shows that the relationship is not recognised under the French legal system.

Not only was the relationship between the third and fourth applicants and their biological father not recognised when registration of the details of the birth certificates was requested, but formal recognition by means of a declaration of paternity or adoption or through the effect of de facto enjoyment of civil status would fall foul of the prohibition established by the Court of Cassation in its case-law in that regard ...
