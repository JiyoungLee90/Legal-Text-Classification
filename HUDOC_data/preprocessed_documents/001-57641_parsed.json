Lastly, in a case before an Industrial Tribunal a female-to-male transsexual, who had not undergone any sex-change treatment, was treated as a female by the Tribunal for the purposes of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975; the person in question had sought and received employment in a position reserved for men under the Factories Act, but was dismissed after discovery of her biological sex (White v.

However, we are no more persuaded now than we were then that the arguments advanced in support of this view are valid. It remains our view that as regards the way in which it draws up the civil-status documents in question - that is to say the birth register and birth certificate - the United Kingdom has not taken all the appropriate steps to ensure, as far as possible, that allowance is made for changes in certain persons\u2019 sexual identity; and we consider that although, as we are glad to acknowledge, it has endeavoured to meet transsexuals\u2019 demands in several other respects, it has therefore to this extent failed to respect the applicant\u2019s private life. In our opinion, a just balance could have been struck between the public interest and the interests of the individual without upsetting the present system of recording civil status; the fact that such a balance would not necessarily meet all the applicant\u2019s demands should not prevent the Court from giving it due weight in assessing whether Article 8 (art. 8) has been complied with.",

That is because marriage is far more than a union which legitimates sexual intercourse and aims at procreating: it is a legal institution which creates a fixed legal relationship between both the partners and third parties (including the authorities [42]); it is a societal bond, in that married people (as one learned writer put it) \"represent to the world that theirs is a relationship based on strong human emotions, exclusive commitment to each other and permanence\"; it is, moreover, a species of togetherness in which intellectual, spiritual and emotional bonds are at least as essential as the physical one.",

There is a growing awareness of the importance of each person\u2019s own identity and of the need to tolerate and accept the differences between individual human beings. Furthermore, the right to privacy and the right to live, as far as possible, one\u2019s own life undisturbed are increasingly accepted.",

In some States the same result has been achieved through administrative or court practice (e.g.  and ). In addition, rectification of the birth certificate following a change of sex can be obtained in some European countries (e.g. ,  and ). This comprises in some States also the right to marry.",

C 256, 19.10.1989, p. 33). The European Parliament called on the Member States \"to enact provisions on transsexuals\u2019 right to change sex by endocrinological, plastic surgery, and cosmetic treatment, on the procedure, and banning discrimination against them\". The procedure should offer, inter alia, legal recognition, change of first name, and change of sex on birth certificates and identity documents. The Recommendation of the Parliamentary Assembly contains similar demands. The decisions of these representative organs clearly indicate that, according to prevailing public opinion, transsexuals should have the right to have their new sexual identity fully recognised by the law.",

With regard to the alleged violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, the central point is that the register of births records particulars, such as the sex of the child, as at the time of the birth and cannot under English law be changed to reflect the new sex of a post-operative transsexual. As a consequence of this, Miss Cossey is forced to reveal intimate personal details whenever a birth certificate is requested, for instance by certain institutions and employers. These situations are painful and distressing for her. She is obliged to choose between either hiding her new sexual identity, with all the possible consequences, or revealing her new sex and facing humiliating and even hostile reactions. In these and similar situations Miss Cossey\u2019s right to respect for her private life is, in our opinion, violated. What is more, the present English system relating to birth certificates constitutes a continuous and direct interference in the private life of Miss Cossey.",

When drafting Article 12 (art. 12) of the Convention the draftsmen probably had in mind the traditional marriage between persons of opposite biological sex as the Court stated in paragraph 49 of its Rees judgment. However, transsexualism was not at that time a legal problem, so that it cannot be assumed that the intention was to deny transsexuals the right to marry. Moreover, as we have tried to show above, there have been significant changes in public opinion as regards the full legal recognition of transsexualism. In view of the dynamic interpretation of the Convention followed by the Court, these social and moral developments should also be taken into account in the interpretation of Article 12 (art. 12).",
