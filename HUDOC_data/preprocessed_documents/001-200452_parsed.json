The expert was tasked with conducting a comparative assessment of the applicant\u2019s medical treatment during his years of compulsory confinement in prison medical centres. The expert report made reference to the World Health Organization Protocol on Medical treatment of Paranoid Schizophrenia and pointed out that deinstitutionalisation and several forms of psychotherapy represented the standard practice in respect of the effective treatment of this type of pathology. Regarding the applicant\u2019s condition on the date of the visit (27 March 2017) the expert observed that he had presented with mental disorders. Furthermore, the expert report stated that almost all the medication set out in the protocol had been prescribed to the patient, while he had undergone none of the psychotherapies deemed as essential for his recovery (such as group therapy, family therapy, social and vocational rehabilitation, and so forth). The Prison Hospital lacked the very basic medical conditions and trained medical personnel to carry out that treatment. Therefore, the application to the patient of almost all types of medication available in the plan for the treatment of this pathology, coupled with a total lack of psychotherapy and the prison regime (which also involved significant periods of isolation), largely risked becoming counterproductive and reducing significantly the chances of a potential recovery of the patient. The forensic expert urged that the applicant be transferred to a proper medical centre where he could undergo indispensable psychotherapy and also have his treatment plan thoroughly reviewed.",

In fact, the living conditions in these two establishments had further deteriorated since the 2014 visit (in\u00a0particular in terms of state of repair and overcrowding), and the level of psychiatric care remained clearly insufficient.

Albania, no. 25336/04, \u00a7 108, 7 July 2009).",

As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of the knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see\u00a0Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90 and 8 others, \u00a7 157, ECHR 2009). The Court has further stated that the six-month rule does not apply to continuing situations (ibid., \u00a7 159). In such cases, the six-month period runs from the cessation of that situation (see Iordache v. Romania, no. 6817/02, \u00a7 50, 14 October 2008). The concept of a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d refers to a state of affairs which operates by continuous activities by or on the part of the State to render the applicant a victim (see Petkov and Others v.

The medical reports prepared by the authorities had not provided an appropriate and thorough analysis of the differences between the binding medical protocol to treat the applicant\u2019s mental illness in a civil psychiatric clinic and the applicant\u2019s treatment in the Prison Hospital. The medical reports had failed to comment on the impact that the treatment afforded to the applicant in the prison environment had had on his state of mental health. Such a failure had vested the domestic courts with unlimited discretion to speculate on the applicant\u2019s state of mental health during his compulsory confinement in the prison\u2019s facilities. The medical reports had not mentioned the potential implications that his treatment in the Prison Hospital would have on the applicant\u2019s mental health, not least because of the lack of indispensable psychotherapy.

The authorities must also ensure that a comprehensive record is kept concerning the detainee\u2019s state of health and his or her treatment while in detention, that diagnosis and care are prompt and accurate, and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at adequately treating the detainee\u2019s health problems or preventing their aggravation, rather than addressing them on a symptomatic basis. The authorities must also show that the necessary conditions were created for the prescribed treatment to be actually followed through. Furthermore, medical treatment provided within prison facilities must be appropriate, that is, at a level comparable to that which the State authorities have committed themselves to provide to the population as a whole. Nevertheless, this does not mean that every detainee must be guaranteed the same level of medical treatment that is available in the best health establishments\u00a0outside prison facilities (...).",

While this requirement was not yet set out in the first judgments delivered in this area (...), from which it appeared that the therapeutic function of compulsory confinement was not as such guaranteed under Article 5, the current case-law clearly indicates that the administration of suitable therapy has become a requirement in the context of the wider concept of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of the deprivation of liberty. Any detention of mentally ill persons must have a therapeutic purpose, aimed specifically, and in so far as possible, at curing or alleviating their mental-health condition, including, where appropriate, bringing about a reduction in or control over their dangerousness. The Court has stressed that, irrespective of the facility in which those persons are placed, they are entitled to be provided with a suitable medical environment accompanied by real therapeutic\u00a0measures,\u00a0with a view to preparing them for their eventual release\u00a0(...).",

In the light of its findings in Gjyli v.

While it is true that Article 5 \u00a7 4 guarantees no right, as such, to an appeal against decisions ordering or extending detention, it follows from the aim and purpose of this provision that its requirements must be respected by appeal courts if an appeal lies against a decision (see Hutchison Reid v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2003IV).",
