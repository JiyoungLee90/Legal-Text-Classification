On 9 March 2010 three local residents testified to the investigators that on the night in question they had seen a VAZ 2109 car being blocked on Bolshoi Prospect by a dark-coloured off-road vehicle, following which persons wearing civilian clothes and armed with hand pistols had dragged the passengers and the driver out of the VAZ, handcuffed the detained men and put them in different vehicles (a dark minivan and a VAZ 2110) and then left. Some of the assailants had been wearing masks. One of them had got into the VAZ 2109 and driven away in it. The whole operation had lasted for two or three minutes; one of the men had filmed the events with a video camera, while another had directed the traffic to avoid the lane. The witnesses described one white minibus with tinted windows and one smaller light coloured minibus. The witnesses used terms such as \u201clike in crime reports\u201d or \u201clike in a movie\u201d. They referred to different times in connection with the events (between 8.30 p.m. on 25\u00a0December and 1 a.m. on 26 December). One additional witness, L., questioned in March 2011, identified the off-road vehicle as a UAZ-Patriot and the minivan as a Ford Transit. He specified that each of the four men had been made to lie face down on the road and that their hands had been handcuffed or tied behind their backs. As soon as they had been placed into the Ford minivan, one of the assailants had collected the items \u2013 hats, mobile phones \u2013 which had fallen on the ground. Two or three passers-by had been in the street at the time; at least one person had been walking a dog. As soon as they had left, a man had picked up a hat left on the ground and placed it on the fence. As can be seen from subsequent documents, in March and April 2011 the investigators made a list of dog owners in the neighbourhood and tried to identify additional witnesses, but without success.",

Prior to March 2013, Article 144 limited the actions of the competent official during that period and excluded the collection of evidence, which under Article 86 was possible only after a criminal investigation had been opened. If the official ruled to transfer the investigation to a competent body, he could take steps in order to protect the material evidence of the crime. The person who had lodged the complaint was informed about the decision taken and the possibilities for appealing against it (Articles 144 and 145).",

It had involved blocking the car in the street, forcing the four men out of their vehicle and hand-cuffing them, while at the same time directing the traffic and filming the scene. The applicants were of the opinion that the law-enforcement authorities had reason to suspect the four men of illegal activities, and thus would have been able to detain them in connection with the killing of Mr Aushev or the explosion of the vehicle in Ingushetia allegedly committed by the fourth applicant\u2019s brother (see paragraph 10 above). The applicants were of the opinion that if the abduction had been committed by common criminals, the response of the law-enforcement authorities would have been much more quick and efficient. They argued, with reference to the Court\u2019s judgments adopted in cases involving comparable circumstances in the Northern Caucasus, that the investigators\u2019 behaviour in the face of the applicant\u2019s well-founded complaint of a serious and violent crime gave rise to a strong presumption of at least acquiescence in the situation.",

Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7 282, ECHR 2001-VII, and Tani\u015f and Others v. Turkey, no. 65899/01, \u00a7 160, ECHR 2005VIII). Applying the above principles to cases concerning allegations of disappearances in the Russian Northern Caucasus, the Court has concluded that it is sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case that their missing relatives have been abducted by servicemen, such abduction thus falling within the control of the authorities, and it is then for the Government to discharge their burden of proof either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, among many examples, Aziyevy v. Russia, no.\u00a077626/01, \u00a7 74, 20 March 2008; Utsayeva and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a029133/03, \u00a7 160, 29 May 2008; Khutsayev and Others v.

The prima facie threshold was reached primarily on the basis of witness statements, including the applicants\u2019 submissions to the Court and to the domestic authorities, and other evidence attesting to the presence of military or security personnel in the area concerned at the relevant time. The Court relied on references to military vehicles and equipment; the unhindered passage of the abductors through military roadblocks, in particular during curfew hours; conduct typical of security operations, such as the cordoning off of areas, checking of identity documents, searches of premises, questioning of residents and communication within a chain of command; and other relevant information about special operations, such as media and NGO reports. Given the presence of those elements, it concluded that the areas in question had been within the exclusive control of the State authorities in view of the military or security operations being conducted there and the presence of servicemen (see, for example, Ibragimov and Others v. Russia, no. 34561/03, \u00a7 82, 29 May 2008; Abdulkadyrova and Others v. Russia, no. 27180/03, \u00a7 120, 8 January 2009; and Kosumova and Others v. Russia, no. 27441/07, \u00a7 67, 7 June 2011). If the Government failed to rebut that presumption, this would entail a violation of Article 2 in its substantive part. However, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Tovsultanova v. Russia, no. 26974/06, \u00a7\u00a7 77-81, 17 June 2010; Movsayevy v. Russia, no. 20303/07, \u00a7 76, 14 June 2011; and Shafiyeva v. Russia, no. \u00a049379/09, \u00a7 71, 3 May 2012).",

As the Court has found, these operations could entail the detention of individuals in the context of non-acknowledged security operations, and such detention could be considered life-threatening (see Aslakhanova, cited above, \u00a7 101).",

The documents examined by the Court provide no solid evidence of a security operation having taken place, such as references to military vehicles or personnel, uniforms, use of special equipment, unhindered passage through roadblocks or during curfew hours, or other potentially relevant elements routinely cited in previous such complaints. It appears that the abductors used passenger vehicles, were wearing civilian clothes and were armed, according to witness statements, with hand guns (see paragraph 33 above) \u2013 a weapon which could be obtained and concealed more easily than, for example, larger weapons such as machine guns. Moreover, attempts to trace the vehicles\u2019 registration plates and mobile phone connections in the area proved futile (see paragraphs 28, 39, 42 above).",

Most of these attacks, although the subject of pending criminal investigations, were unresolved at the time of the submission of the parties\u2019 observations and the perpetrators have not been established. The applicants and their relatives connected the disappearance under examination with these previous episodes of violence; however it does not appear that their suspicion about the abductors being State servicemen was communicated to the investigators in a clear manner (for example, see paragraphs 22 and 45 above). In such circumstances, the sole fact that some witnesses described the group which had taken the four men away as being well-organised and efficient does not suffice to make a prima facie case that they were State servicemen.",

The applicants believed that the loss of time in the critical first period of the investigation could have led to a missed opportunity to immediately locate the captors and obtain the release of the four men. The first applicant had been questioned for the first time in January 2010. Further delays in collecting crucial evidence were linked to the examination of the CCTV records. Only once the recordings had been viewed could the investigators locate the area where the unknown group had taken hold of the four men (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above). Further delays had followed and the eyewitnesses to that episode had been identified and questioned only in March 2010 and March 2011 (see paragraph 33 above). Other CCTV recordings which could potentially have been relevant to solving the crime had been lost because they had been sought after the expiry of the storage time-limit (see paragraph 34 above). Thus, the investigators had failed to take reasonable steps to secure highly relevant evidence. Finally, the applicants argued that the investigation had lacked the requisite degree of public scrutiny, as neither the applicants nor their legal representatives had received any information about the progress made or the important procedural steps taken in the case (see paragraphs 40, 41 and 43 above).",

It is striking that the disappearance of the applicants\u2019 relatives was not linked in any significant way to the investigation of the preceding events involving other relatives of the applicants. From January 2010, such a link was repeatedly raised with the investigative authorities by the applicants and their representatives. It is certainly not the Court\u2019s role to substitute itself for the domestic investigative authorities, who are much better placed to perceive and react to relevant information as it is gathered in the course of a criminal investigation; the evaluation of the data and the possible reactions to it remain firmly in the domain of the professional law-enforcement personnel. However, the Court retains the authority to evaluate these measures against the minimum threshold for an effective investigation in the light of the importance accorded to the rights protected by Article 2 of the Convention. In the present case it is difficult to ignore the extraordinary sequence of attacks involving various members of Maksharip Aushev\u2019s extended family (see paragraphs 8-11, 18 and 22 above). These events were regarded as interconnected by the applicants and their relatives. At the same time, there is not much evidence in the documents supplied to the Court that the respective investigations of these events were in any way coordinated. This may be considered as an oversight of one of the most relevant known elements of the case, and the failure to take it into account as a failure to carry out a thorough, objective and impartial analysis of all relevant elements, entailing a breach of the procedural obligation to investigate under Article 2 of the Convention.",

To this must be added the disappearance, on the first night of their arrival in St\u00a0Petersburg, of her last remaining, youngest brother and the three other relatives who had accompanied him. These events coincided with the final stage of pregnancy and the birth of her child on 28 December 2009. It appears reasonable to expect the investigators to have taken more proactive steps in order to obtain her statements as a key witness and victim.

However, the Court has on many occasions found this remedy ineffective in situations where the applicants appealed against other procedural defects of the investigation. For example, the Court has found applications to a court ineffective where the proceedings have already been adjourned and reopened, as it would only have prompted the investigators to repeat yet another cycle of futile inquiries (see Savriddin Dzhurayev, cited above, \u00a7 194). Likewise, the remedy was found ineffective where the essence of the applicant\u2019s complaints lay in challenges to the investigators\u2019 inaction, resulting from the failure to take the necessary and timely steps and to keep the families informed of the progress and main procedural steps of the proceedings (see Aslakhanova, cited above, \u00a7 153, and Esmukhambetov and Others v.

The situation is thus different from the cases of Trubnikov and Dzhamaldayev cited in the preceding paragraph, in that there was no specific procedural act to appeal against. In cases such as the one at hand the domestic courts would be unable to issue specific guidelines to the investigating authorities, precisely due to the absence of such procedural act. Should the applicants appeal to a court against the investigators\u2019 actions, because of the nature of the matter, the need to react quickly and the limited scope of the court\u2019s review, such appeals do not appear able to redress the defects in the investigation. Accordingly, the Court finds that an application under Article 125 of the CCrP is ineffective in such circumstances and dismisses the Government\u2019s objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.

Russia, no.\u00a063638/09, \u00a7 98, 20 June 2013).

She told the police of the time and place where they had last been seen, the route that they had intended to take, their descriptions and details of their mobile phones and the vehicle they had been driving (see paragraph 15 above). The police were thus informed that earlier that night a group of four men in a vehicle had stopped responding to telephone calls while driving through St\u00a0Petersburg. However, it is difficult to discern in the first applicant\u2019s statements any indication of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the lives of the individuals concerned.",

In the days immediately following the first applicant\u2019s complaint, they sought information about recent accidents, possible detention or movement of these persons, examined the area, declared search for the missing persons and the vehicle and took steps to find and question the owner of the car driven by the first applicant\u2019s husband (see paragraph 20 above). As the documents examined by the Court demonstrate, the possible connection between the disappearance of the four men and the events involving the fourth applicant and other members of the Aushev family was pointed out to the investigators in January 2010 (see paragraphs 18 and 22 above).",
