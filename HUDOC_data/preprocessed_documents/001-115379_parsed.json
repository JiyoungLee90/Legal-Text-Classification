Accordingly, the applicant is still entitled to the enforcement of the judgments in her favour. The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicants, as far as possible, are put in the position they would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no.\u00a085). Having regard to the violation found, the Court finds that this principle also applies in the applicant\u2019s case. It, therefore, considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the judgment in her favour.",
