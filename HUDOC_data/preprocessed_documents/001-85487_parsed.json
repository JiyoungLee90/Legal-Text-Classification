As regards the issue of arbitrariness, it notes that the relevant principles were recently restated in the case of Saadi v. the United Kingdom (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 67-72). In that case the Grand Chamber held that the notion of arbitrariness in the context of Article 5 varied to a certain extent depending on the type of detention involved. In the context of sub-paragraphs (b), (d) and (e) the notion of arbitrariness also includes an assessment of whether detention was necessary to achieve the stated aim. The detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is justified only as a last resort where other, less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained (see Witold Litwa, cited above, \u00a7\u00a078; Hilda Hafsteinsd\u00f3ttir v. Iceland, no. 40905/98, \u00a7 51, 8 June 2004; and Enhorn v. Sweden, no.\u00a056529/00, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 2005I).",

A similar test is applied by the Court in the related Article 5 \u00a7 3 context of pre-trial detention when examining the relevance and sufficiency of the reasons given by the domestic authorities for maintaining pre-trial detention (see, Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0110-111, ECHR 2000XI, and McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a0543/03, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45, ECHR 2006...).",

The Court is also troubled by the District Court's conclusion that since the applicant did not have a permanent abode in  he was considered to be evading justice. It also notes that the District Court ordered the applicant's detention in a trivial private prosecution case concerning the alleged slander of a building administrator, an offence carrying a penalty of a fine or restriction of liberty (such as a community service order). It is true that the court was empowered under Article 259 \u00a7 4 of the CCP to impose such a measure in respect of offences which carried a penalty of less than one year's imprisonment, but subject to the proviso that it established the existence of other circumstances, for example that the accused was evading justice. However, in the present case the District Court's finding in the latter respect was manifestly without foundation. Furthermore, as stated above, the domestic authorities should always consider the application of other, less stringent, measures than detention. In the instant case the Krak\u00f3w\u2013\u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie District Court do not appear to have given consideration to any preventive measures other than detention. Thus, the Court finds that the detention order imposed on the applicant in these circumstances could not be considered a proportionate measure to achieve the stated aim of securing the proper conduct of criminal proceedings, having regard in particular to the petty nature of the offence which he was alleged to have committed (see, mutatis mutandis, Ambruszkiewicz, cited above, \u00a7 32).",

The judicial control must satisfy the requirements of promptness and be automatic (see, McKay, cited above, \u00a7 32).",

The automatic nature of the review is necessary to fulfil the purpose of the paragraph, as a person subjected to ill-treatment might be incapable of lodging an application asking for a judge to review their detention; the same might also be true of other vulnerable categories of arrested person, such as the mentally frail or those ignorant of the language of the judicial officer (see, among others, Aquilina v.  [GC], no. 25642/94, \u00a7 49, ECHR 1999III; Niedba\u0142a v. , no.\u00a027915/95, \u00a7\u00a050, 4\u00a0July 2000; and McKay, cited above, \u00a7 34).",

The detention order specified that the applicant was to be informed upon his arrest about his right of appeal. The applicant was arrested on 3 January 2003 and was subsequently detained on the basis of that order. The Court notes that following the applicant's arrest on reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence there was no automatic judicial control of his detention. In circumstances such as those that obtained in the present case, where the applicant was arrested on the basis of a detention order issued in his absence, the domestic law does not appear to provide for such an initial automatic review and makes it dependent on an application by the detained person. The Court notes that Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention does not provide for any possible exceptions from the requirement that a person be brought promptly before a judge or other judicial officer after his or her arrest or detention. To conclude otherwise would run counter to the plain meaning of this provision (see Harkmann v. Estonia, no.\u00a02192/03, \u00a7\u00a038, 11 July 2006). The Court further observes that the review of the lawfulness of the applicant's detention was initiated by the application made by his counsel on 9 January 2003. The Government's argument that the applicant's interests were duly represented in those judicial proceedings by his counsel is clearly deficient in the light of the explicit wording of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (\u201cshall be brought promptly before a judge\u201d).",
