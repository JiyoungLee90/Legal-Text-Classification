They pointed out that the applicant\u2019s dismissal had been based on the withdrawal by the State Commission of his clearances to access classified information and that that decision had been final. They explained that, consequently, the six-month time-limit had started on the date of notification of the State Commission\u2019s decision, that is to say 30 August 2006, and that the applicant had lodged his application on 3 September 2008, two years later.",

It stipulated that there would be a presumption that Article 6 applied, and laid down two conditions for the respondent State to be able to rely before it on an applicant\u2019s civil servant status in order to exclude him or her from the protection afforded under Article 6: the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question, and that exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State\u2019s interest (ibid.).",

Domestic law permitted the applicant to contest his dismissal from the post which he had held in the Intelligence Unit at the Army Headquarters (see paragraph 26 in fine above), and the Government did not dispute the applicability of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention to the procedure for contesting the applicant\u2019s dismissal. Having regard to the particular circumstances of the present case and in accordance with the criteria established in its case-law (see paragraph\u00a049 above), the Court considers that the dispute in question concerned the determination of a \u201ccivil\u00a0right\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and that that provision, under its civil head, is therefore applicable to the judicial proceedings for contesting the applicant\u2019s dismissal.",

That question had been examined by the State Commission, which had dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal (see paragraph 9 above). However, the Court considers that that procedure had not provided the guarantees set out in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention: the State Commission was not a body independent from the executive, given that its members were elected by the Council of Ministers at the proposal of the Prime Minister (see paragraph\u00a021 above); the Commission had at no stage informed the applicant of the reasons for the withdrawal of his clearances (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above), and it had taken its decision on 22 August 2006 without the applicant\u2019s knowledge (see paragraph 11 above).",

It cannot be overlooked that at no stage in the proceedings before the two different trial benches did the Supreme Administrative Court consider the question whether the withdrawal of the security clearances had been justified by the fact that the applicant had committed an offence. It merely referred to the State Commission\u2019s decision, emphasising that the latter had not been reasoned and that it was not subject to any legal remedy (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above). The Court considers that this renders the applicant\u2019s situation similar to that of the applicants in the cases of Myriana Petrova (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 40-44) and Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Ohers and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom, 10 July 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 76-79, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV, in which it found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on account of the refusal by the domestic courts to examine issues which were vital to the outcome of the disputes between the applicants and the administrative authorities, which refusal had been based on the fact that those questions had been determined in advance by the administrative authorities in such a way as to force the courts to accept their factual findings.",
