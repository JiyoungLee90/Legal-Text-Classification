In Warehouse 2 and Block B, of Safi Detention Centre, physical conditions were basic and he often lacked the most basic necessities, including clothing, particularly shoes, which were only replaced every four months. Recreational activity was limited, and the yard was taken over by adult males, making it difficult for a young person like him to play with them. Educational activities were virtually non-existent. There was a lack of information, difficulties communicating with the outside world, and obstacles in obtaining the most basic services. Moreover, the centre was overcrowded and lacked protection from abuse and victimisation. Fights often broke out between men of different origins, nationalities or tribes, and he also referred to an episode where he had been beaten up by a fellow detainee. Noting there was no privacy or security, Mr Burhaan Abdullahi\u00a0Elmi stressed that he felt very insecure in detention, and that his food was often stolen by detainees as was his blanket. He explained that Warehouse 2 was worse than Block B, it was like a big hall of people, hundreds of people, and he had a bunk bed in this big warehouse. He considered that the conditions in Warehouse 2 were very similar to those in Warehouse 1, which had been documented in a number of reports, including two CPT reports of 2007 and 2011. The first applicant also stated that he had difficulty communicating with a doctor in the absence of an interpreter and that he suffered from dizziness and eye problems.",

He noted that in October 2012 the detention authorities had not taken him to a hospital appointment; it had had to be rescheduled to March 2013. On that date, the doctor prescribed medication, however, up to the date of the introduction of the application (17 April 2013) this had not been forthcoming. He also referred to an incident in which he had been beaten up by a fellow detainee who had allegedly also previously attacked another detainee with a knife. He noted that when he arrived in detention he was given two bed sheets, a blanket, a T-shirt, and two pairs of underwear, but no shoes, not even flipflops. The second applicant further explained that they were fed chicken every day and that he was unable to keep in touch with his relatives, as the five-euro phone card distributed to them every two months only allowed four minutes of talk time to Somalia.",

In their view, this behaviour was clear evidence that he was no longer interested in pursuing the application, and thus the Court should strike out his application. In their second round of observations, following the declaration produced by the first applicant\u2019s legal representative, the Government highlighted that the signature on the declaration did not correspond to that on the application form; in consequence it could not be taken as a valid expression of interest to continue pursuing the application.",

In their further submissions they noted that they were regularly in contact - by telephone and with an interpreter - with the first applicant throughout the proceedings before this Court. They further explained that a photograph of the declaration signed by the first applicant (in February 2015) had been sent through a free instant messaging service for mobile telephones. They submitted that following the Government\u2019s contestation (August 2015) the first applicant\u2019s legal representatives again contacted the first applicant and his lawyer in Germany in order to obtain a further declaration. However, the first applicant informed them that he was unable to make the trip to his lawyer\u2019s office in Frankfurt to have the declaration and signature authenticated, as he had no money for the journey. The first applicant\u2019s legal representatives also submitted a signed declaration, dated 14\u00a0September 2015, by Ms Lena Ronte, an advocate practising in Germany, currently representing the first applicant in the proceedings in Germany. In the mentioned declaration she confirmed that the first applicant was residing in a reception centre in Schonbach, Germany, awaiting the outcome of his asylum proceedings. She confirmed that the first applicant\u2019s representatives before this Court had contacted her to obtain a fresh declaration by him but that she had been unable to meet him, although she had spoken with him by telephone.

Nevertheless, in the Court\u2019s view, while the signatures on the two documents are certainly different, it cannot be excluded that the first applicant, being Somali, was little accustomed to the Latin alphabet at the time of his signature in 2013. This situation may have evolved by the time the applicant signed his declaration in 2015 and thus the Court finds no reason to doubt its veracity in the present circumstances. Indeed, the Court considers that the submissions made by the first applicant\u2019s legal representatives, together with the first applicant\u2019s declaration in February 2015 as well as that of his lawyer in Germany dated September 2015, leave no doubt that the first applicant wishes to pursue his application.",

Other factors which had to be taken into consideration were their young age, their inability to communicate in any language apart from Somali, and the fact that they were detained in a facility with adult men from many different ethnic, linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Further, the detention centre was staffed by men, most having a security background, leaving a huge gap in the provision of social welfare services to detainees, in spite of their best efforts. In their view all the above took a greater toll, given their personal circumstances and situation while they were in detention.

In the present case, at the time of their detention both the applicants were minors. They noted that in Mubilanzila Mayeka and Kaniki Mitunga v.

The Government also contested the second applicant\u2019s allegation that he was not given shoes on arrival, as the emergency bag distributed on the first day contains flipflops.",

The Court observes that the Government did not provide any specific rebuttal to this allegation, nor did they submit any relevant documentation concerning the number of detainees present at the relevant time, or the size of the premises. The Court considers that in the absence of exact numbers and the relevant measurements of Warehouse\u00a02 being provided by any of the parties it cannot conclude with certainty that there existed overcrowding which was so severe as to justify in itself a finding of a violation of Article\u00a03. Nevertheless, the Court notes that even at the time of the CPT visit in 2011 Warehouse 1 was hosting more than 200 inmates (see paragraph 47 above). The Court thus considers that the numbers submitted by the applicants are credible. Those numbers indicate that Warehouse 2 hosted around 50% more individuals than it was intended to host, and in the Court\u2019s view this gives rise to a presumption that the applicants were detained in overcrowded conditions for around two months.",

Similarly, although not emphasised by the applicants, the CPT report considered that the sanitary facilities in the warehouses were in a deplorable state and that the conditions of detention there were \u201cappalling\u201d.

The Court reiterates that the necessity of detaining children in an immigration context must be very carefully considered by the national authorities (see Mahamed Jama, cited above, \u00a7 147). It is positive that in the Maltese context, when an individual is found to be a minor, the latter is no longer detained, and he or she is placed in a non-custodial residential facility, and that detention of minors should be no longer than what is absolutely necessary to determine their identification and health status (see paragraphs 31 and 36 above). An issue may however arise, inter alia, in respect of a State\u2019s good faith, in so far as the determination of age may take an unreasonable length of time - indeed, a lapse of various months may also result in an individual reaching his or her majority pending an official determination (ibid.).",

The Court observes that, as noted in Mahamed Jama, cited above, less than 10% of arrivals claimed to be minors in 2012 (that is when the applicants started their ageassessment procedure). In this connection, the Court considers that despite the fact that \u201cborderline\u201d cases may require further assessment, the numbers of alleged minors per year put forward by the Government cannot justify a duration of more than seven months to determine the applicants\u2019 claims. Indeed, the Government have not explained why it was necessary for the first applicant in the present case to wait for a few weeks for his first age-assessment interview (see paragraph 18 above) and to wait for around seven months to have a decision following a standard medical test. The Court notes that during this time the first applicant remained in detention, despite having been told orally that he had been found to be a minor six months before (see paragraph 18). Similarly the Government have not explained why, following his interview, the second applicant had to wait for five months to have the FAV test and to wait for another two and a half months for such a decision, and therefore for his release under a care order. Indeed, in the present case it transpires that in October 2012 the authorities were already aware that the first applicant was a minor, and yet he remained in detention until a care order was issued on 19 April 2013, while the second applicant remained in detention for at least another month after his age was determined. In this connection the Court notes that Government policy clearly states that vulnerable people are exempt from detention and that unaccompanied minors are considered as a vulnerable category (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above).",

A situation rendered even more serious by the fact that the applicants lacked any procedural safeguards (as shown by the finding of a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 4, at paragraph 124 above), as well as the fact that at no stage did the authorities ascertain whether the placement in immigration detention of the applicants was a measure of last resort for which no alternative was available (see, mutatis mutandis, Popov, cited above, \u00a7 119).",

The number of refugees, asylum-seekers, rejected asylum-seekers, stateless persons, trafficked persons and irregular migrants who have been jailed is at unprecedented levels in Europe. In some jurisdictions, detention is mandatory or based on presumptions in favour of detention. When the domestic legal framework is vague and open-ended, immigration authorities rely on discretionary administrative practices. Furthermore, detention is frequently applied as part of a policy to deter future asylum-seekers or to dissuade those who have commenced their claims from pursuing them. Sometimes it is even used as a punitive measure for irregular entry or presence in the country, lack of documentation or failure to comply with administrative requirements or other restrictions related to residency in the host country. Access to legal advice is virtually impossible, decisively affecting the asylum-seeker\u2019s ability to present his or her case. Possibilities of judicial review are in practical terms very limited, if available at all. This scenario alone results in en masse and needless detention.

The divorce between the ground of detention and its necessity leads to a ch\u00e8que en blanc given to State authorities to detain whenever they please, without assessing possible less intrusive alternatives, suited to each asylum-seeker.

In Chahal, the Grand Chamber had also read Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) as not demanding that detention be necessary. Accordingly, there is no requirement that the detention be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent the person concerned from committing an offence or fleeing. The Grand Chamber further held in Chahal that the principle of proportionality applied to detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) only to the extent that the detention should not continue for an unreasonable length of time. Thus, it held that \u201cany deprivation of liberty under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) will be justified only for as long as deportation proceedings are in progress. If such proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible\u201d.

This shows that the authorities had at their disposal measures other than the applicant\u2019s protracted detention to secure the enforcement of the order for his expulsion.\u201d In Mikolenko, another case concerning the detention of an adult pending deportation, the Court concluded that the grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention, imposed with a view to his deportation, did not remain valid for the whole period of his detention because the Estonian authorities had at their disposal measures other than the applicant\u2019s protracted detention in the deportation centre, since after his release he was obliged to report to the Board at regular intervals.",

It is high time that the Grand Chamber revisited the infelicitous Saadi approach in the light of international refugee and human-rights law and stated unequivocally, as the Chamber has done in the present case and other Chambers have done previously, that the detention of asylum-seekers is, as a matter of principle, a measure of last resort and may only be applied when no less intrusive alternative is possible.",

The logic is deeply entrenched in some quarters: one need only remember the shocking logo \u201cIn the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest\u201d. Treating asylum-seekers as criminals who lurk in wait for an opportunity to wreak havoc on European soil and should thus be locked up for the safety of the wider public, and in general portraying migrants as a non-white, non-Christian menace to European societies and as a lifethreatening \u201cpoison\u201d shows that Europe has not yet learned the lesson of the two world wars, and the many others that followed, during the twentieth century. The plight of people running away from war and other sorts of bestial, inhuman treatment is still not sufficient to touch the conscience of Europeans.",

If additional evidence of the excessive nature of the Maltese legal regime were still needed, the prolonged temporal extension of the detention, with unlimited prolongation possibilities in case of non-cooperating rejected asylumseekers, shows the Maltese regime at its worst. The time has come for the Maltese legislature to reshape the migration-related detention regime, among other things, by getting rid of the infamous Article 14 (2) of the Chapter 217 of the Laws of Malta.",

They were placed under detention in the Safi Barracks Detention Centre. Their situation was not different from that of thousands of other migrants in Malta, the aggravating factor in their case being their age. This is the first case in which the Court finds that the conditions of detention at the above-mentioned detention centre breach Article 3. As in Suso Musa, the Court also found that the placement in detention itself breached Article 5, but the important novelty in the present case is that the Court explicitly has applied the necessity test to the interpretation of the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), which it did not do in Suso Musa.
