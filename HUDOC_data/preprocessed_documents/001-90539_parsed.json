As regards the case of Mrs Sadchikova, the Court notes that the authorities\u2019 attempts to comply with the terms of the judgment took place not earlier than in 2005. There is nothing in her case to suggest that the authorities recognised a violation of her rights and afforded her redress. Nor is there any evidence that she had indeed refused to accept the payment. In such circumstances, the mere attempt to enforce the judgment after a significant delay cannot be regarded as depriving Mrs Sadchikova of her victim status. In respect of the other cases the Court notes that, even assuming that the agreements proposed by the local authorities contained an implicit recognition of a breach of the applicants\u2019 Convention rights, each of the applicants refused the terms of the proposed settlement, for which reason such agreements did not give rise to any binding undertakings on the part of the Government. Therefore, the applicants retained their victim status (see Chebotarev v. , no.\u00a023795/02, \u00a7\u00a020, 22 June 2006).",

It is therefore unclear whether such interviews took place in respect of them, at all. Turning to Mrs Gurova\u2019s interview, the Court observes that she was asked about the domestic judgment in her favour and her unsuccessful attempts to obtain its execution. There is nothing in the case materials to suggest that the interview trespassed into verifying the authenticity of her application and whether she wanted to continue it (see, by contrast, Dula\u015f v. Turkey, no. 25801/94, \u00a7 81, 30\u00a0January 2001, and Fedotova v. Russia, no. 73225/01, \u00a7\u00a049-51, 13 April 2006). The Court further finds no evidence in the submissions that Mrs Gurova was forced to give evidence to the prosecutor (see Tarariyeva v. Russia, no. 4353/03, \u00a7 121, ECHR 2006... (extracts)). In the absence of any additional factual information on the circumstances of these particular cases, the Court is unable to conclude that the interviews, or the manner in which the applicants had been summoned for them, involved any form of illicit and unacceptable pressure put on the applicants in order to dissuade them from pursuing their applications to the Court. The Court concludes that the Government have not breached their obligations under Article 34.",
