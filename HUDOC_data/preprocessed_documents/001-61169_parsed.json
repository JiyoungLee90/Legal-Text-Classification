[Secondly,] in the statements they gave after the incident, the soldiers did not say that they had seen one of the members of the organisation with his face uncovered. [In addition,] Mr G\u00fcne\u015f was not arrested during the incident in question [and] Mr Erdal, the co-defendant, a 'confessor' [former member of an illegal organisation turned informer] who admitted having taken part in the shooting, stated that Mr G\u00fcne\u015f had not been present at the time and that he did not know him. [Lastly,] there are also contradictions, indeed a blatant discrepancy, regarding the names of those who took part in the shooting, between Mr G\u00fcne\u015f's statements [obtained while he was in police custody] and those of his co-defendant. [Accordingly], it should be concluded that there is insufficient evidence for Mr G\u00fcne\u015f to be found guilty...\u201d",

While statements made during questioning may be taken into consideration by the judge in his assessment of the facts of a case, they must nonetheless be made voluntarily, and statements obtained through the use of pressure or force are not admissible in evidence. By Article 247 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as interpreted by the Court of Cassation, any confessions made to the police or the public prosecutor's office must be repeated before the judge if the record of the questioning containing them is to be admissible as evidence for the prosecution. If the confessions are not repeated, the records in question are not allowed to be read out as evidence in court and consequently cannot be relied on to support a conviction. Even a confession repeated in court cannot on its own be regarded as a decisive piece of evidence but must be supported by additional evidence.",

Only in this way will it be able to examine the substance of the applicant's main allegation that the charges against him (in particular, that of having taken part in an armed attack on 14 June 1992) could not have been found to have been made out if he had had a fair trial (see, mutatis mutandis, Sadak and Others v.

The Court's task under the Convention is to ascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among other authorities, Edwards v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 6 December 1992, Series A no. 247-B, pp. 34-35, \u00a7 34). All the evidence must normally be produced in the presence of the accused at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. However, the use as evidence of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 3 (d) and 1 of Article 6, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him either when he was making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see, among other authorities, Isgr\u00f2 v.\u00a0Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, Series A no. 194-A, p. 12, \u00a7 34, and Luc\u00e0 v. Italy, no. 33354/96, \u00a7\u00a7 40-43, ECHR 2001-II). The corollary of that is that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see, among other authorities, Sadak and Others, cited above, \u00a7 65).",

Italy, judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89, p. 14, \u00a7\u00a026). It further notes that although the applicant repeatedly and clearly asked for the confrontation to take place before the trial court (see paragraphs 48, 50 and 51 above), it does not appear from the file that that court took the necessary steps to ensure that the witnesses in question could be examined or could appear before it (see, among other authorities, Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v. Spain, judgment of 6 December 1988, Series A no. 146, p.\u00a033, \u00a7 78). Furthermore, a request to the courts delegated to take evidence might also have been refused on road-safety grounds. ",

Admittedly, they undertook a careful examination of the statements taken from the witnesses on commission and gave the applicant an opportunity to contest them, but this can scarcely be regarded as a proper substitute for direct examination and attendance.

The lack of any confrontation before the trial court deprived him in certain respects of a fair trial. The Court is fully aware of the undeniable difficulties of combating terrorism \u2013 in particular with regard to obtaining and producing evidence \u2013 and of the ravages caused to society by this problem, but considers that such factors cannot justify restricting to this extent the rights of the defence of any person charged with a criminal offence. In short, there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d). ",
