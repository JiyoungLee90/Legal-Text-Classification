He entered the flat three seconds later, having decided to use his machine gun and not his pistol because he needed light. He switched on his gun-light and saw Lefteris Andronicou  and Elsie Constantinou in the diagonally opposite corner. Lefteris Andronicou\u2019s knees were bent as if he were preparing to sit down. Elsie Constantinou was in front of Lefteris Andronicou, facing him. Officer no.\u00a02 could only see the left side of Lefteris Andronicou\u2019s body. He did not notice whether Lefteris Andronicou had a gun but believed that he did. He considered that he did not have time to ascertain whether his belief corresponded to reality. He distinguished Lefteris Andronicou and fired two to three times. The couple moved and \nOfficer no.\u00a02 could no longer see Lefteris Andronicou. He moved to the right and could then see Lefteris Andronicou\u2019s left side. Lefteris Andronicou was sitting on the floor and Elsie Constantinou was covering the right side of his body. Officer no.\u00a02 fired again at Lefteris Andronicou several times. He stopped shooting when Lefteris Andronicou was lying on the floor. He wanted to make sure that Lefteris Andronicou was no danger to him or to the young woman. Lefteris Andronicou\u2019s moves appeared to him to be menacing. Officer no.\u00a02 further testified that all his shots were aimed at the left side of Lefteris Andronicou\u2019s body, because this was the only side he could see. He affirmed that he had been trained to shoot to kill when shot at. He did not exclude that he might have fired one or two bullets when Lefteris Andronicou was already lying on the floor. It was later ascertained that Officer no.\u00a02 had fired thirteen bullets.",

In the witness\u2019s view, Lefteris Andronicou\u2019s second shot, like the first, was directed towards the door. The witness had reached this conclusion on the basis of the small number of pellets found in the flat. The noise time chart indicated that a number of distinct shots were fired after the MMAD officers entered the flat in the following sequence: one single shot, one triple shot and one double shot. These shots started 5.8\u00a0seconds and ended 8.5\u00a0seconds after the first tear gas shot. N.\u00a0Adan considered that Elsie Constantinou must have been wounded at that stage because her screams, which could be heard on the video recording, were significantly reduced after the six shots.

Furthermore, the Court agrees with the views of the Delegate of the Commission that the conclusions of the investigation conducted by the commission of inquiry, chaired as it was by the highest judicial appointee in the respondent State, could reasonably be considered to be decisive of the issue of liability. Those conclusions were fully reasoned and reached on the basis of strict rules\u00a0of evidence, following a meticulous investigation of the facts (see paragraphs\u00a06 and 96 above). While those conclusions were not binding on a domestic civil court, they were likely in practice to remove any reasonable prospects of success which a civil claim for damages may have offered the applicants.

The failure of the authorities to exercise all due care in evaluating the information at their disposal gave rise to a situation in which the MMAD officers entered the flat psychologically prepared to be confronted by a person about to kill his hostage and who was armed with other weapons. This fundamental mistake in the planning and control of the operation was compounded by the decision to equip the raiding team with machine guns and to send its members into a badly-lit room measuring 5 by 3.6\u00a0metres without any clear instructions on how to react in the event that Lefteris Andronicou might be holding on to Elsie Constantinou.",

The decision to use the MMAD officers was only taken after the failure of protracted negotiations and when it became clear from his threatening stance and Elsie Constantinou\u2019s cries for help that Lefteris Andronicou intended to kill her at a highly symbolic time and date and then take his own life.

The concern to avoid injury to the couple led in fact to the decision to use tear gas rather than stun grenades. The MMAD officers were moreover given clear instructions to use only strictly proportionate force and to fire only if the young woman\u2019s life or their own lives were in danger; nor was it unreasonable to equip the officers with machine guns given that these were fitted with torches which could light up the living-room.

It notes in this respect that the use of force by agents of the State in pursuit of one of the aims delineated in paragraph\u00a02 of Article\u00a02 of the Convention may be justified under this provision where it is based on an honest belief which is perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time but subsequently turns out to be mistaken. To hold otherwise would be to impose an unrealistic burden on the State and its law-enforcement personnel in the execution of their duty, perhaps to the detriment of their lives and the lives of others (see the McCann and Others judgment cited above, pp.\u00a058\u201359, \u00a7\u00a0200).

The officers were entitled to open fire for this purpose and to take all measures which they honestly and reasonably believed were necessary to eliminate any risk either to the young \nwoman\u2019s life or to their own lives. It transpired at the commission of inquiry that only two of the officers\u2019 bullets actually struck her. While tragically they proved to be fatal, it must be acknowledged that the accuracy of the officers\u2019 fire was impaired through Lefteris Andronicou\u2019s action in clinging on to her thereby exposing her to risk.

The offer of an ex gratia payment leaves the right allegedly violated in limbo and renders the relief a benevolent act of the State.

Both alternatives were fraught with foreseeable risks to the lives of to the occupants of the flat. The threatening innuendoes of Lefteris Andronicou as to what might happen at midnight, his violent behaviour towards Elsie Constantinou exhibited earlier in the day, coupled with his erratic and unpredictable conduct, made the decision of the police to mount the operation for the dual purpose of rescuing Elsie Constantinou and arresting Lefteris Andronicou a reasonable option in the circumstances. No blame is cast by the Commission on the police authorities for taking that decision. What the Commission found to be wrong was the planning of the operation. Because of its shortcomings, the lives of Lefteris Andronicou and Elsie Constantinou were exposed to risks that could have been avoided had the operation been planned more adequately and prudently. The planning of the operation, as I construe the report of the Commission, was deficient, betraying a lack on the part of the Cypriot authorities of the concern required by Article 2 for the lives of Lefteris Andronicou and Elsie Constantinou in four material respects.",
