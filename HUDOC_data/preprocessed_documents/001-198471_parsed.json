In that case it noted that the domestic court ordering the forfeiture of the applicant company\u2019s lorry had not, at any point, considered the legality of that forfeiture, in particular whether the value of the lorry corresponded to the seriousness of the offence, as required under Article\u00a0242 \u00a7 8 of the Criminal Code. Nor had the domestic court examined the conduct of the lorry driver and whether the applicant company, the lorry\u2019s owner, could or should have been aware of the smuggling. Lastly, the Court criticised the domestic procedural rules for not allowing the applicant company a chance to put its case to the national authorities and challenge the forfeiture. All this meant that the fair balance which had had to be struck between the protection of the applicant\u2019s right to property and the requirements of the general interest had been upset, in violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

While it could appear that the issue was discussed in the subsequent refusals of the prosecution authorities to seek the re-opening of the proceedings (see paragraph 13 above), these were not decisions taken by the body competent to make a binding assessment on the matter and order or not the forfeiture, namely the respective court. In addition, the Yambol Regional Court did not analyse whether the applicant company could or should have been aware of the smuggling committed by its drivers. Lastly, the applicant company was given no chance to challenge the forfeiture of its lorries in the domestic criminal proceedings against the three drivers. It is to be noted in that respect that the present case concerns the application of the same legal scheme as in \u00dcnsped Paket Servisi SaN. Ve TiC.

The compensation claim was not thus held to offer sufficient opportunity for bringing the relevant case before the competent national authorities (see Bowler International Unit v.

The Court refers additionally to its finding in \u00dcnsped Paket Servisi SaN. Ve TiC. A.\u015e.
