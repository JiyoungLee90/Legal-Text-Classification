The deferral must, however, be proportionate to its object and cannot become indefinite.

In [the applicant's] case, the MHRT answered 'Yes' to the question: 'Is the Tribunal satisfied that the patient is not now suffering from mental illness ... of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for the patient to be liable to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment?', but in their extended reasoning made it clear that any discharge must be subject to the provision of continuing treatment.

Otherwise, if nothing was done, the situation would arise that was identified in paragraph 67 of the judgment in Johnson, of indefinite deferral of the release that had been ordered by the MHRT. That deferral would arguably entail a breach of the [Convention]. The issue would depend on whether, once the MHRT had determined that her condition could and should be treated in the community, she was, in terms of the analysis in Winterwerp, suffering from a mental disorder of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement. I have already indicated the difficulty of this question. We received no submissions upon it, the argument being concentrated in another direction, and I certainly do not decide the issue here.",

If the ruling of the MHRT is frustrated, in a case where under the [Convention] jurisprudence the subject should no longer be detained, then the subject is deprived of her Article 5 \u00a7 4 protection, as (I think it to be clear) the [Court] would have held in Johnson had the issue not been determined already under Article 5 \u00a7 1: see paragraphs 69-72 of the judgment.",

That may appear surprising, not only in common-sense terms, but also in view of the emphasis placed in the jurisprudence of the [Convention] upon the judgment of the national authorities: see for instance the observations of the [Court] in Luberti v. Italy [judgment of 23 February 1984, Series A no. 75] at paragraph 27 as to the relevance in this context of the doctrine of the margin of appreciation; and the observations in paragraph 63 of the judgment in Johnson as to the respect to be paid to the discretionary judgment of those responsible for dealing with the mentally ill. The problem in this case arises, however, from the rigidity of the required procedure of the MHRT that is identified in paragraphs 16 and 36 of [Lord Phillips's] judgment. If the MHRT indeed had the power to review its decisions in the light of practical circumstances, as was envisaged by Woolf J in [Oxford], then difficulties of the present order would not arise; and provided that the national authorities made all reasonable efforts to comply with provisional decisions of the MHRT I very much doubt that any objection to such a procedure would arise under the [Convention]. That, however, is not the present state of domestic law: the decision of the MHRT being once and for all, that is the decision that Article 5 \u00a7 4 requires to be respected.",

This power the tribunal had. Nothing in Article 5 suggests that discharge subject to conditions is impermissible in principle, and nothing in the Convention jurisprudence suggests that the power to discharge conditionally (whether there are specific conditions or a mere liability to recall), properly used, should be viewed with disfavour. Indeed, the conditional discharge regime, properly used, is of great benefit to patients and the public, and conducive to the Convention object of restricting the curtailment of personal liberty to the maximum, because it enables tribunals to ensure that restricted patients compulsorily detained in hospital represent the hard core of those who suffer from mental illness, are a risk to themselves or others and cannot be effectively treated and supervised other than in hospital. If there is any possibility of treating and supervising a patient in the community, the imposition of conditions permit that possibility to be explored and, it may be, tried.",

Mr Johnson was a patient in whose case the Winterwerp criteria were found not to be satisfied from June 1989 onwards. While, therefore, it was reasonable to try and ease the patient's reintegration into the community by the imposition of conditions, the alternative, if those conditions proved impossible to meet, was not continued detention but discharge, either absolutely or subject only to a condition of liability to recall. His detention became unlawful shortly after June 1989 because there were, as all the doctors agreed, no grounds for continuing to detain him. The present case is quite different. There was never a medical consensus, nor did the tribunal find, that the Winterwerp criteria were not satisfied. The tribunal considered that the appellant could be satisfactorily treated and supervised in the community if its conditions were met, as it expected, but the alternative, if these conditions proved impossible to meet, was not discharge, either absolutely or subject only to a condition of recall, but continued detention. ...",

It was appropriate for her to be liable to be recalled for further treatment and that certain conditions be attached to any discharge, in particular that she should be subject to supervision by a consultant forensic psychiatrist. The tribunal's decision was that she should only be discharged if those conditions were met. The Government argued that it was wrong to assume that, when a tribunal ordered a conditional discharge, this meant that the nature of the disorder no longer warranted hospital confinement (the second Winterwerp criterion). They distinguished conditions precedent, namely those conditions, such as those relating to psychiatric supervision, where if the conditions were not met the patient's condition warranted continued detention, from other conditions, which although desirable were not essential to the decision to discharge or which only applied after discharge, as in Johnson (cited above).",

(see paragraphs 58-60 above) and they had issued guidelines permitting tribunals to monitor and reconsider decisions. In the Government's view, Contracting States also had a margin of appreciation in deciding what resources to provide in order to meet various social policy objectives. There was no unrestricted obligation to provide any resources which would allow the patient to be discharged. That did not mean that the decision on detention rested solely upon economic grounds but that the provision of resources in the community had to be taken into account in deciding whether the second Winterwerp criterion had been met.",

The formal questions answered by the MHRT are not framed in terms of the Winterwerp criteria but make findings relevant to the possibility of conditional, as well as absolute, discharge. As the substance of the reasoning from the MHRT showed, the discharge of the applicant was only regarded as appropriate if there was continued treatment or supervision necessary to protect her own health and the safety of the community. In the absence of that treatment, her detention continued to be necessary in line with the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e).",

In the situation under consideration, a failure by the local authority to use its \u201cbest efforts\u201d or any breach of duty by a psychiatrist in refusing care in the community would be amenable to judicial review.

These developments occurred after the facts in the present case, but they submitted that there was no evidence that the previous incompatibility had had an impact in practice on the applicant's rights. As regards speed, the Secretary of State was able to refer the matter back to a fresh tribunal under section 71 of the 1983 Act, and after the decision in I.H. the tribunal itself could consider the matter further in light of progress or otherwise in meeting the conditions. If the conditions had not been met but it appeared that the authorities had not been using their best endeavours to meet the conditions, it was open to the patient to seek judicial review of the authorities' failure to act, in which review the well-known principles of judicial review such as illegality and irrationality and the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998 would be taken into account.",

Turkey, judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1185, \u00a7 123, and Varbanov v. Bulgaria, no. 31365/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR 2000-X). Where, as in the present case, the MHRT finds that a patient's detention in hospital is no longer necessary and that she is eligible for release on conditions, the Court considers that new issues of lawfulness may arise where detention nonetheless continues, due, for example, to difficulties in fulfilling the conditions. It follows that such patients are entitled under Article 5 \u00a7 4 to have the lawfulness of that continued detention determined by a court with requisite promptness.",
