Delays were occasioned by the time needed for the applicant and a co-respondent's heirs to confirm their succession status. Thus, following the death of the applicant's husband the proceedings remained suspended for fourteen months. The case had to be adjourned on fifteen occasions because both parties failed to appear, thus delaying the proceedings for eleven months in total. The applicant was solely responsible for eight adjournments amounting to a cumulative delay of five months. The other parties caused delays on twenty-one occasions (a delay of nearly thirteen months). Certain delays were caused by the fact that the parties appealed against first-instance judgments. Lastly, the Government acknowledged that the national authorities were responsible for a cumulative period of fifteen months resulting from adjournments on account of the judges' unavailability or illness.",

The other respondent, Mr P, was responsible for twenty-one adjournments resulting in a cumulative delay of one year, eleven months and seven days. The court was responsible for six years, six months and fifteen days. Certain delays were caused by the court's failure to apprise the parties of hearings. Adjournments had lasted over a month each and were, at times, ordered despite a party's waiver of the right to be present. The case was arbitrarily re-assigned between district court judges. No penalties had been imposed on the defaulting party.

Whatever the applicant's responsibility for that delay may be, there is insufficient factual basis for the Court to conclude that the period from October 2001 to March 2003 was attributable to the applicant or the State in the circumstances of the case (see paragraphs 12 - 14 above).
