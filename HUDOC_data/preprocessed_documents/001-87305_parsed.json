D. had personally ordered detective officer E. to threaten the applicant with physical violence, which was to be carried out by another specially trained police officer. The measure had been aimed at finding out immediately where the applicant had hidden J., whose life he had considered to be at great risk. In order to save J.\u2019s life, E. had threatened the applicant in the manner ordered by D.",

However, the applicant would not be able to prove that the threats of torture uttered against him had caused mental damage necessitating psychological treatment. It was obvious that the officers\u2019 threat for a short period of time was negligible compared to the traumatisation caused by the fact that he had killed a child. Moreover, even assuming that the applicant would be able to prove that police officer E. had shaken him, as a result of which his head had hit a wall on one occasion, and had once hit him on the chest, allegedly causing a haematoma near his collarbone, the physical damage caused thereby would be too minor to necessitate the payment of compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The violation of the applicant\u2019s human dignity by the threat of torture did not warrant the payment of compensation either as the applicant had obtained sufficient satisfaction by the exclusion of his statements as evidence and the criminal conviction of the police officers responsible for the threats.",

In particular, that court had speculated that the applicant would not be able to prove that the threat to torture him had led to mental damage and had thus refused to take the necessary evidence (in the main proceedings). In addition to that, it was not obvious that the physical injuries the applicant claimed to have suffered in the course of the interrogation could be considered to be of secondary importance in view of the threats uttered against him. Moreover, the question whether the violation of the applicant\u2019s human dignity necessitated the payment of damages despite the satisfaction he had obtained as a result of the criminal conviction of the police officers involved was a difficult legal question on which no precedent existed in a judgment of a court of final instance, and which should therefore not be determined in legal-aid proceedings.",

Treatment has been held to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering (see Labita, cited above, \u00a7 120, and Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, \u00a7 118). It was the intention that the Convention should, by means of the distinction between torture and inhuman treatment, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, pp. 66-67, \u00a7 167, and Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 96). Moreover, a mere threat of conduct prohibited by Article 3, provided it is sufficiently real and immediate, may be in conflict with that provision.

According to the applicant, E. also threatened him with sexual abuse, hit him once on the chest and shook him so that his head hit the wall on one occasion, injuring him.

It is further clear that the threats of violence against the applicant were uttered by detective officer E., instructed by D., in the performance of their duties and were made for the purpose of extracting a statement from him, which must be regarded as an aggravating element (compare Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2279, \u00a7 64; and contrast Egmez v. Cyprus, no. 30873/96, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2000-XII). The Court would like to underline in this connection that in view of the absolute prohibition of treatment contrary to Article 3 irrespective of the conduct of the person concerned and even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation \u2013 or, a fortiori, of an individual \u2013 the prohibition on ill-treatment of a person in order to extract information from him applies irrespective of the reasons for which the authorities wish to extract a statement, be it to save a person\u2019s life or to further criminal investigations. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s treatment must be considered to have caused him considerable mental suffering, which is also illustrated by the fact that, having persistently refused to make correct statements until then, he confessed under the influence of such treatment where he had hidden J. Thus, the Court finds that the treatment the applicant was threatened with would, if carried out, amount to torture. However, the questioning lasted for some ten minutes only and, as was established in the criminal proceedings against the police officers (see paragraph 46 above), took place in an atmosphere of heightened tension and emotions owing to the fact that the police officers, who were completely exhausted and under extreme pressure, believed that they had only a few hours to save J.\u2019s life, elements which can be regarded as mitigating factors (compare Egmez, cited above, \u00a7 78, and Krastanov v. Bulgaria, no. 50222/99, \u00a7 53, 30 September 2004). Furthermore, the threats of ill-treatment were not put into practice and have not been shown to have had any serious long-term consequences for the applicant\u2019s health.",

Bulgaria, no. 39272/98, \u00a7\u00a7 150, 153, 166, ECHR 2003-XII; and Krastanov, cited above, \u00a7 48). Moreover, the Court has found that an applicant did not lose his status as a victim of a violation of his Convention rights merely as a result of a statement by a court that an illegally obtained item of evidence should not have been admitted in criminal proceedings, without any consequences having been drawn in terms of the defendant\u2019s Convention rights (compare Heglas v. the Czech Republic, no. 5935/02, \u00a7\u00a052, 1 March 2007 in respect of alleged violations of Articles 8 and 6 of the Convention). In cases in which the Convention violation has caused substantive pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage to the applicant, the Court has further found it decisive for an applicant\u2019s loss of victim status that the latter has received the payment of compensation which was reasonable as to quantum (compare Busa v. Hungary, no. 28453/95, Commission decision of 15 January 1997, in respect of a complaint under Article 3 against excessive use of force by the police; Murillo Saldias and Others v. Spain (dec.), no.\u00a076973/01, 28 November 2006, concerning a breach of the administrative authorities\u2019 positive obligations under Article 2; and Dalban, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044, in respect of a conviction in breach of Article 10).",

It notes in this connection that in the criminal proceedings against the applicant, the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court, in its decision dated 9 April 2003, expressly stated that the threat to cause the applicant pain in order to extract a statement from him had not only constituted a prohibited method of interrogation under Article 136a of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The threat had also disregarded Article 3 of the Convention, which underlay that provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 22 above). Likewise, the Federal Constitutional Court, referring to the Regional Court\u2019s finding of a violation of Article 3, confirmed that the applicant\u2019s human dignity and the prohibition on subjecting prisoners to ill-treatment (Article 1 and Article 104 \u00a7 1, second sentence, of the Basic Law) had been disregarded (see paragraph 38 above). In addition to that, in its judgment of 20 December 2004 convicting the police officers responsible for the methods of interrogation in question of incitement to coercion and of coercion, the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court found that such methods had not been justified as an act of necessity because they had violated the absolute protection of human dignity under Article 1 of the Basic Law, which also lay at the heart of Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 45 above). In view of this, the Court is satisfied that the domestic courts which were called upon to rule on this issue acknowledged expressly and in an unequivocal manner that the applicant\u2019s treatment when questioned by E. on 1 October 2002 had violated Article 3 of the Convention.",

Having regard to all the factors relevant for determining the sentence as taken into consideration by the Regional Court (see paragraph 46 above), the Court is not convinced that the \u2013 comparatively lenient \u2013 sentence imposed on the police officers calls into question the fact that substantive redress has been granted to the applicant as a result of the officers\u2019 criminal conviction. Moreover, the police officers suffered prejudice in their professional careers in that they were transferred to posts which no longer comprised a direct involvement in the investigation of criminal offences.",

The court argued that the applicant had not been previously instructed by the prosecution authorities that the use as evidence of the statements he had made as a result of the threats against him was excluded (see paragraphs 24-26 above). The Court considers that this exclusion of statements made under threat or in view of incriminating statements extracted previously is an effective method of redressing disadvantages the defendant suffered on that account in the criminal proceedings against him. By restoring him to the status quo ante in this respect, it serves to discourage the extraction of statements by methods prohibited by Article 3.",

The Court finds that, not least in view of the wide public approval of the treatment to which the applicant was subjected, the criminal conviction of the police officers responsible, which acknowledged in an unequivocal manner that the applicant had been the victim of prohibited ill-treatment, was essential in affording him redress in a manner other than by the payment of a sum of money.",

In any event, the investigation authorities had at their disposal items of evidence such as the blackmail letter and a note concerning the planning of the offence as a result of the fact that they had been secretly observing the applicant since he had collected the ransom.

The Court observes in this connection that the Regional Court, as confirmed by the Federal Court of Justice, expressly considered the applicant\u2019s statements at the trial to have been the essential, if not the only, basis for its findings of facts as regards the planning of the offence. These findings were supported by the testimony of J.\u2019s sister, the wording of the blackmail letter and the note found in the applicant\u2019s flat concerning the planning of the crime. In view of the fact that the applicant had been secretly observed by the police since he had collected the ransom, this additional evidence cannot be considered to have been secured as a result of the first confession extracted from the applicant. Moreover, as regards the carrying out of the offence, the  expressly found that its findings of fact on this issue were exclusively based on the applicant\u2019s confession at the trial. Further items of evidence were used by that court only to test the veracity of this confession. These included some impugned items of evidence, namely the results of the autopsy as to the cause of J.\u2019s death and the tyre tracks left by the applicant\u2019s car near the pond where the child\u2019s corpse had been found, as well as items of evidence which could have been secured independently of the first confession extracted from the applicant, namely the money from the ransom which had been found in his flat or paid into his accounts. In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that it was the applicant\u2019s new confession at the trial which was the essential basis for the Regional Court\u2019s judgment, whereas all other items of evidence, including the impugned real evidence, were of an accessory nature and were only used to test the veracity of this confession. As the applicant had fully confessed and incriminated himself by his statements, the accessory evidence could even be said not to have been used to his detriment. The Court observes in this connection that according to the evidence before the , even without his confession on the last day of the trial, there had been ample evidence to prove the applicant guilty at least of kidnapping with extortion.",

He indeed confessed at the outset of the trial and at its end in different terms, whereby he could be said to have varied his defence strategy.

It seems that the discussion of the applicability of the doctrine of \u201cthe fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d is of a rather theoretical nature in the present circumstances.

[T]he Regional Court \u201cstress[ed] the crucial importance of the applicant\u2019s confession for its findings concerning the execution of his offence, which might otherwise have led to only a less serious offence being proved\u201d (see paragraph 107 of the judgment). In this regard the majority also observed that \u201caccording to the evidence before the , even without his confession ..., there had been ample evidence to prove the applicant guilty at least of kidnapping with extortion\u201d (see paragraph 106). It appears that the use of the impugned evidence was of crucial importance in support of the charges, which were reclassified from kidnapping to premeditated murder as a result of the applicant\u2019s statements at the investigation stage. There is a difference between the punishment prescribed for kidnapping and the one for premeditated murder, in respect of which the applicant was sentenced. Indeed, the applicant now bears full responsibility for his terrible crime, as he stated he wished to.

The existence of such opportunities should be regarded as an issue relating to exhaustion of domestic remedies for the purposes of admissibility of the complaints and to the duties of the signatory States to the Convention under Article 13.

Such recourse should lead to conclusions as regards the presumption of innocence and the fairness of the criminal trial. The majority\u2019s approach risks introducing into the Court\u2019s jurisprudence the practice of reassessment of a violation of Article 3 that has already been established. More importantly, this approach is capable of undermining the absolute character of the prohibition in Article 3 and of opening the way for calculation of the appropriate extent of admissible coercion and its use in relation to particular accusations, contrary to the principles of a fair trial.",
