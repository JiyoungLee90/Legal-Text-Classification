Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention - with which it has close affinity -, that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system, whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law.\u00a0 In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7\u00a0December 1976, \u00a7 48, Series A no. 24).",

However, the Court is unable to accept the Government\u2019s objection that the applicant\u2019s failure to appeal against that decision to a court rendered his Article 3 complaint inadmissible. Apart from the fact that the decision of 6\u00a0February 2004 is no longer in force, having been quashed on 24 August 2007 by a decision of the Voronezh Regional Prosecutor\u2019s office authorising a new round of inquiry into the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment complaint, the Court observes that the decision of 6 February 2004 was preceded by at least two investigators\u2019 decisions with the same content and leading to the same outcome (see paragraphs 19 and 23 above). The applicant successfully challenged those decisions, obtaining their quashing and securing the reopening of the inquiry. The Court considers that in these circumstances, in order to exhaust domestic remedies the applicant could not have been required to lodge, over and over again, new appeals against each subsequent decision by which the prosecution authorities had closed the investigation. As the Court has found in a similar case, a requirement to introduce further appeals against successive decisions refusing the institution of criminal proceedings would be over-formalistic and place an excessive burden on the applicant (see Samoylov v. , no. 64398/01, \u00a7\u00a045, 2 October 2008). Moreover, the applicant has invoked before the Court essentially the same arguments as were considered by the domestic courts during the criminal proceedings against him and within the internal police and subsequent prosecution inquiries into the events of 16 July 2001, thus affording the domestic authorities the ample opportunity to remedy the alleged violation of his rights. It follows that the applicant must be considered to have exhausted the domestic remedies, in so far as he did not lodge a separate judicial complaint against the investigator\u2019s decision of 6\u00a0February 2004 (see, mutatis mutandis, C.M. v. Sweden, no. 20809/92, Commission decision of 15\u00a0February 1993, and, most recently, Akulinin and Babich v. Russia, no. 5742/02, \u00a7 33, 2 October 2008, and Vladimir Fedorov v. Russia, no. 19223/04, \u00a7 50, 30 July 2009), and that this part of the Government\u2019s objection as to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies should be dismissed.",

In this regard the Court first notes that if an individual raises an arguable claim that he has been seriously ill-treated by the police, a criminal complaint may be regarded as an adequate remedy within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Vladimir Fedorov v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7 58). Indeed, as a general rule, the State should be given an opportunity to investigate the case and give answer to the allegations of ill-treatment. At the same time an applicant does not need to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing the alleged breach (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 30 August 1996, \u00a7 68, Reports 1996IV). If the remedy chosen is adequate in theory, but in the course of time proves to be ineffective, the applicant is no longer obliged to pursue it (see Mikheyev v.

It thus decided to join that issue to the merits and will examine it now.

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. An obligation to investigate \u201cis not an obligation of result, but of means\u201d: not every investigation should necessarily be successful or come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimant\u2019s account of events; however, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Thus, the investigation of serious allegations of illtreatment must be thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of those responsible for them will risk falling foul of this standard (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev, cited above, \u00a7 107 et seq., and Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998VIII, \u00a7 102 et seq.). Finally, the investigation must be expeditious. In cases under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation has been at issue, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a0133 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV). Consideration was given to the starting of investigations, delays in taking statements (see Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no.\u00a023531/94, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2000-VI, and Tekin v. Turkey, 9 June 1998, \u00a7 67, Reports 1998-IV) and to the length of time taken for the initial investigation (see Indelicato v. Italy, no.\u00a031143/96, \u00a7 37, 18 October 2001).",

The prosecutor\u2019s role was critical not only to the pursuit of criminal proceedings against the perpetrators of the offence but also to the pursuit by the applicant of other remedies to redress the harm he had suffered (see paragraph 27 above). The Court notes that the prosecution authorities, who had been made aware of the applicant\u2019s alleged beating, initiated an investigation which has not yet resulted in criminal proceedings against the perpetrators of the beating. The investigation was closed and reopened and is currently pending. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the issue is consequently not so much whether there has been an investigation, since the parties do not dispute that there has been one, as whether it has been conducted diligently, whether the authorities have been determined to identify and prosecute those responsible, and accordingly whether the investigation has been \u201ceffective\u201d.",

In the present case the Court considers it established that the applicant brought the allegations of ill-treatment to the attention of the authorities during an interview on 16 July 2001, complaining to the military prosecutor of the use of violence by the police and submitting a successful request for a medical examination (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). Having attended the applicant\u2019s medical examination on 20 July 2001, the military prosecutor observed the physical sequelae which, according to the applicant, resulted from the beatings by the police. In this respect, the Court does not lose sight of the Russian law which imposes an obligation on domestic authorities to investigate cases when injuries to detainees are discovered (see paragraph 30 above). There is no indication in the law that the obligation only comes into play if a complaint of ill-treatment is lodged by a detainee himself. It appears that by not linking the obligation to investigate to the presence of a complaint from a detainee, that legal provision has been designated to protect the interests of detainees, individuals in a vulnerable situation who due to intimidation and fear of reprisal are not inclined to complain of unlawful actions on the part of State agents.",

They also disregarded the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s complaints that violence had been used against the applicant, citing a temporary lack of jurisdiction while the trial proceedings against the applicant were pending (see paragraph 16 above). Surprisingly, the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s complaint was addressed by the  Regional Police Department, a State authority whose employees were implicated in the events which were to be looked into (see paragraph 17 above). While the Court acknowledges the need for there to be internal inquiries by the police with a view to possible disciplinary sanctions in cases of alleged police abuse, it finds it striking that in the present case the initial investigative steps, which usually prove to be crucial for the establishment of the truth in cases of police brutality, were conducted by the police force itself (see, for similar reasoning, Vladimir Fedorov, cited above, \u00a7 69, and Maksimov v. , no. 43233/02, \u00a7 87, 18 March 2010). In this connection the Court reiterates its finding made on a number of occasions that the investigation should be carried out by competent, qualified and impartial experts who are independent of the suspected perpetrators and the agency they serve (see Ramsahai and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 325, ECHR 2007-..., and O\u011fur v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, ECHR 1999-III). Furthermore, although the thoroughness of the investigation will be examined below, the Court would already stress at this juncture that it is struck by the fact that, despite relying on the police officers\u2019 statements in the decision of 8 August 2002 and subsequent decisions, the investigator had not heard evidence from them in person. It appears that she merely recounted the officers\u2019 statements made during the internal inquiry. The Court, however, is mindful of the important role which investigative interviews play in obtaining accurate and reliable information from suspects, witnesses and victims and, in the end, the discovery of the truth about the matter under investigation. Observing the suspects\u2019, witnesses\u2019 and victims\u2019 demeanour during questioning and assessing the probative value of their testimony forms a substantial part of the investigative process.",

When a doctor writes a report after a medical examination of a person who alleges ill-treatment, it is extremely important that the doctor states the degree of consistency with the allegations of ill-treatment. A conclusion indicating the degree of support to the allegations of ill-treatment should be based on a discussion of possible differential diagnoses (non-ill-treatment-related injuries, including self-inflicted injuries, and diseases) (see Barabanshchikov v. , no. 36220/02, \u00a7 59, 8 January 2009).",

It appears from the presented materials that it was not until the reopening of the inquiry in 2007 that the investigating authorities heard the applicant in person for the first time. In addition, although excerpts from the applicant\u2019s and his father\u2019s complaints were included in the decisions on the refusals to institute criminal proceedings, the investigators did not consider their description of events to be credible, apparently because they reflected personal opinions and constituted an accusatory tactic by the applicant. However, the investigators did accept the police officers\u2019 statements as credible, despite the fact that their statements could have constituted defence tactics and have been aimed at damaging the applicant\u2019s credibility. In the Court\u2019s view, the prosecution inquiry applied different standards when assessing the statements, as those made by the applicant and his father were deemed to be subjective but not those made by the police officers. The credibility of the latter statements should also have been questioned, as the prosecution investigation was supposed to establish whether the officers were liable on the basis of disciplinary or criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v. Bulgaria, no. 46317/99, \u00a7 99, 23 February 2006).",

Furthermore the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant lodged his application before the Court on 20 May 2003, after the inquiry into his complaints of ill-treatment was closed for the first time. The Court is mindful of the fact that after 20 May 2003 the prosecution closed the inquiry on two other occasions. Having been closed for the third time on 6 February 2004, the investigation was only reopened in August 2007, after the present case was communicated to the Government.

Even in the most difficult circumstances, such as the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the victim\u2019s conduct (see Labita, cited above, \u00a7 119, and Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15\u00a0November 1996, \u00a7 79, Reports 1996-V). Article\u00a03 makes no provision for exceptions and no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 \u00a7 2 of the Convention even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 95, ECHR\u00a01999-V, and Assenov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a093).",

In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v.

It has never been argued that the applicant resisted arrest, attempted to escape or did not comply with lawful orders from the police officers. Furthermore, there is no indication that at any point during his arrest or subsequent detention at the police department he threatened the police officers, for example by openly carrying a weapon or by attacking them (see, by contrast, Necdet Bulut v. Turkey, no. 77092/01, \u00a7\u00a025, 20 November 2007, and Berli\u0144ski v. Poland, nos. 27715/95 and 30209/96, \u00a7 62, 20 June 2002).

The Court further observes that it has found a particularly grievous violation in the present case. The Court accepts that the applicant suffered humiliation and distress on account of the ill-treatment inflicted on him. In addition, he did not benefit from an adequate and effective investigation of his complaints about the ill-treatment. In these circumstances, it considers that the applicant\u2019s suffering and frustration cannot be compensated for by a mere finding of a violation. Nevertheless, the particular amount claimed appears excessive. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, it awards the applicant EUR 15,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
