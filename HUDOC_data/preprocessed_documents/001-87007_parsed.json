While they were about to enter the park, the applicants were stopped and searched by the police. The officers found fifty-three copies of a bulletin in a black plastic bag. As the applicants appeared suspicious, the police officers arrested them. The applicants were allegedly beaten up, insulted and threatened with death during their arrest. In particular, two police officers applied pressure to their necks from behind and made them lie down. Following the arrival of two more police officers, they dragged both applicants along the ground, kicked and slapped them and put them in a police car. Once in the car, the police officers continued to punch and slap them, hit them with wooden sticks, insult and threaten them. One of the police officers first sat on the head of Sevil Ula\u015f and then hit her against the roof of the car. When the applicants asked where they were being taken, one of the officers said: \u201cWe are taking you to a stream where your corpses will be found\u201d.",

In this connection, it notes that the applicants were arrested while entering a park where peace festivities were to take place. The police officers wanted to arrest them because they looked suspicious (see paragraph 6 above). However, the Government did not suggest that the festivities in question were the scene of violence or likely to give rise to unexpected developments to which the police officers had to react without prior preparation (see Eser Ceylan, cited above, \u00a7 30). In these circumstances, the Court considers that the Government have failed to furnish convincing or credible arguments which would provide a basis to explain or to justify the degree of force used against the applicants, whose injuries are corroborated by medical reports.",
