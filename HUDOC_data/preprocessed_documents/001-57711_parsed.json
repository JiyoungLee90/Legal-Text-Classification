It may be that there is to some extent a conflict here between the right of the parties to have their controversy judicially determined by the courts and the present appellants\u2019 property interest.

This contention of the Government is inconsistent with the attitude they adopted to the interpretation of section 6 in the second  case. In their statement of claim in that case the applicants pleaded that they could not \"by operation of law avail of the retrospective validity afforded by\" section 6(1) of the 1982 Act (see paragraph 25 above). In their defence the Government did not deny this plea (ibid.). Accordingly, the attitude of the Government, in their pleadings, was that they accepted that the applicants\u2019 outline permission was not validated by section 6(1). And it is clear that the Government did not argue to the contrary during the hearing of the case but maintained the same attitude. Mr Justice Lardner stated in his judgment that section 6(2) of the 1982 Act \"has been accepted by counsel for both sides ... as excluding the appellants from the benefit of section 6(1)\" (ibid.).",

No extension of the period of validity of the outline permission could have been obtained unless substantial works had been carried out before it expired, and such works could not have been commenced until detailed planning approval had been obtained (see paragraphs 16 and 29 above).

Such compensation was all the more called for because at the time of the transaction the authority of the Minister to take, on appeal, a decision contrary to the development plan was not disputed; the Government\u2019s argument that the Minister was acting in good faith can only add further weight to this point. The applicants were therefore entitled, in good faith for their part too, to rely on the validity of the permission which had moreover been entered into the appropriate register.
