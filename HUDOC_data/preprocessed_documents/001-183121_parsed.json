Italy ([GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08195, ECHR 2006II). The Court further notes that although proceedings that take place in the accused\u2019s absence are not of themselves incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention, a denial of justice nevertheless undoubtedly occurs where a person convicted in absentia is unable subsequently to obtain from the court which has heard his case a fresh determination of the merits of the charge, in respect of both law and fact, where it has not been established that he or she has waived his or her right to appear and to defend him or herself (see Sejdovic, cited above, \u00a7\u00a082 and Hokkeling v. the Netherlands, no. 30749/12, \u00a7 58, 14 February 2017).",

In the circumstances it finds it unnecessary to examine the relevance of paragraph 3 to the case since the applicant\u2019s allegations, in any event, amount to a complaint that the proceedings were unfair. It will therefore confine its examination to that point (see Shkalla, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067).",

Nor has it been shown that he explicitly or implicitly authorised his family members\u2019 actions on appeal or unequivocally waived his right to appear in court by deliberately evading justice (see Izet Haxhia, cited above, \u00a7 63). Furthermore, even though the Gjirokast\u00ebr District Court granted the applicant\u2019s request for leave to appeal out of time under Article 147 of the CCP, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court did not subsequently make any fresh determination of the criminal charges against him. They noted that his original conviction had become res judicata, without giving any other reasons whatsoever for their refusal to make a fresh determination of his conviction (see Sejdovic, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 82-85).",
