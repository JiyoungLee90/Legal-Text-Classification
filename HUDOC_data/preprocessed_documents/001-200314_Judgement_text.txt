The case originated in an application (no. 39071/08) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Valentyna Demydivna Stryzh (“the applicant”), on 6 August 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr A.O. Kuznyetsov, a lawyer practising in Zaporizhzhya. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention of a breach of equality of arms and excessive length of proceedings. Referring to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, she complained about deprivation of her property.
On 20 February 2013 notice of the application was given to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. Having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it (see, in respect of a similar approach, Nedilenko and Others v. Ukraine [Committee], no. 43104/04, § 5, 18 January 2018; Geletey v. Ukraine [Committee], no. 23040/07, § 4, 24 April 2018; and Shcherbakov v. Ukraine [Committee], no. 39708/13, § 4, 20 September 2018).
The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Zaporizhzhya.
On 26 December 2001 the applicant bought a flat in the city of Zaporizhzhya from Mr T. She paid 26,500 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH).
On 17 May 2005 the applicant was joined as a party to ongoing proceedings concerning a civil dispute between the seller of the flat and other interested parties. The applicant was joined to the proceedings as a codefendant because the claimants were making additional claims seeking to invalidate the purchase contract for the flat concluded by the seller and the applicant in 2001.
On 19 October 2005 the Zavodskyy District Court of Zaporizhzhya found, inter alia, that the purchase contract for the flat was invalid. It further found that Mr V.S. and Mr I.S. were the owners of that flat. The court ordered that Mr T. had to pay UAH 26,500 to the applicant. The applicant appealed.
On 13 December 2005 the Zaporizhzhya Regional Court of Appeal quashed the decision of 19 October 2005 as unlawful and dismissed the claims as unsubstantiated. The claimants appealed against that decision in cassation.
On 4 April 2006 the Supreme Court of Ukraine issued a ruling opening cassation proceedings and ordering that copies of the notice of cassation appeal were to be sent to the parties to the proceedings who, in turn, were to be invited to submit their replies by 4 May 2006.
On 24 October 2007 the case file was transferred to the Odessa Regional Court of Appeal for consideration.
The applicant was not notified of the cassation appeal and was not otherwise informed that the cassation proceedings had been opened.
On 3 April 2008 the Odessa Regional Court of Appeal, acting as a court of cassation, examined the case. The parties were not informed of the hearing. Having considered the cassation appeal and the case file, the cassation court quashed the decision of 13 December 2005 as unfounded and upheld the decision of 19 October 2005. On 2 May 2008 the applicant found out about the hearing and the decision of the cassation court.
On 3 July 2009 V.S. instituted court proceedings seeking the applicant’s eviction from the flat. On 21 April 2010 the Ordzhonikidzevskyy District Court of Zaporizhzhya ordered the applicant’s eviction. No appeal was lodged against that decision.
The relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure of 2004, as worded at the material time, read as follows:
