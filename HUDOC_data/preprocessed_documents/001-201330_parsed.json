It was further considered remarkable that the Taliban had not contacted the husband directly if they were unable to find his brotherinlaw, as they obviously knew the husband\u2019s address and, even if the family made it look as if their house was uninhabited, the Taliban could have gone to the husband\u2019s shop which he had continued to run.

Since the applicants had, moreover, not adduced any individualised arguments concerning problems which other Sikhs in their \u201cimmediate circle\u201d had experienced, the Deputy Minister had rightly taken the view that the applicants had not made a plausible case for believing that, upon their return to Afghanistan, they would run a real risk of treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraphs 58-59 below).",

The lawyer added that Sikhs in Afghanistan, and more particularly in Kabul, no longer constituted an ethnic/religious community whose members were capable of exercising their civil rights. They had withdrawn into the Gurdwara in the Karte Parvan district and there were reportedly also two Sikh families living in the Gurdwara in the Shor Bazar district. Moreover, all reports of States and NGOs on the position of Sikhs in Afghanistan were agreed on the end of the social relevance and independent functioning of the Sikh community in Afghanistan. The position of Sikhs in Afghanistan had become marginalised to such an extent that they could not reasonably be presumed capable of providing Sikhs returning from Europe with a safe reception within their community.",

In that context, they cited the section on Hindus and Sikhs from their Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Afghanistan of April 2016 (see paragraph 74 below), on the basis of which UNHCR considered that, depending on the individual circumstances of the case, members of the Sikh community may be in need of international protection. It was additionally noted in the letter that, since the aforementioned Guidelines had been published, the Sikh community in Afghanistan had continued to face threats and flee Afghanistan; it was estimated that in three decades 99% of the Sikh community had left the country. UNHCR further emphasised that when a group had been determined to be at risk, as the Deputy Minister of Security and Justice had done as regards Sikhs in Afghanistan, this reduced the requirement for other types of evidence such as past persecution. In UNHCR\u2019s view, it was sufficient for the applicant to establish the fact that he or she belonged to the group because of the risk of harm that had already been objectively established for members of that group. Based on this analysis as well as on the constantly worsening situation of Sikhs in Afghanistan, UNHCR urged the IND to reassess the applicants\u2019 refugee claim.",

This man had recently informed the UNHCR office in Kabul that he and his family were living with a friend in a relatively underprivileged and poor neighbourhood, near a Gurdwara, where other members of the Sikh community also resided (as well as Muslims). An attempt had been made to rob him and he had since been receiving threatening phone calls telling him that next time the callers would know what to do with him. They had also insulted his religion. The man had reported this incident to the police.

It held that some of the decisions invoked by the applicants concerned cases which were not sufficiently similar to theirs and that the other decisions to which they referred amounted to an erroneous application of the policy in force. As the impugned decision of the Regional Court, therefore, could not stand, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State went on to examine itself the grounds of appeal that had been submitted by the applicants to the Regional Court. It noted that according to the applicants, they ought to be granted a residence permit under the asylum policy in force, claiming that the following circumstances should qualify as \u201climited indications of problems\u201d within the meaning of that policy: only very few Sikhs remained in Kabul; as Sikhs, they would be immediately recognisable and subjected to violence; they would be homeless and economically disadvantaged; and due to the small number of Sikhs in Afghanistan and the fact that they had not been living in that country for some time, they would not be able to call on the remaining Sikhs for help. Reiterating that in order to be eligible for a residence permit under the terms of the policy in force, the applicants were required to demonstrate \u201climited indications\u201d, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State found that the circumstances adduced by the applicants were not \u201cspecific individual characteristics\u201d and nor did they relate to problems experienced by other Sikhs in their \u201cimmediate circle\u201d. Given that they had not been living in Afghanistan for some time, that their asylum accounts had been considered as lacking in credibility, and that they had not argued that others in their \u201cimmediate circle\u201d had experienced problems as Sikhs, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State concluded that they had not plausibly demonstrated the existence of \u201climited indications\u201d.",

However, there are also reports that the Sikh and Hindu communities face societal intolerance, which some commentators have attributed to \u2018extremist elements\u2019 who have moved from the provinces to Kabul and other cities. There are claims of non-Muslims facing pressure to convert to Islam from Muslim members of society. The Hindu population face fewer difficulties than the more visibly distinguishable Sikh population (whose men wear a distinctive headdress), with some Sikhs reportedly dressing as Muslims in order to avoid harassment. ... It is reported that some Sikhs have left for India due to economic difficulties and societal harassment, but others have no plans to leave, as they see Afghanistan as their home.",

Nevertheless, UNHCR had then, on the other hand, gone on to say that it was sufficient for an applicant to establish that he or she belonged to the group in question because the risk of harm for members of that group had already been objectively established. Since the information available on Sikhs in Afghanistan did not give the Government cause to conclude that merely belonging to this group entailed a real and foreseeable risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention, and since UNHCR did not explain on what information it based its conclusion, the Government saw no reason to agree with UNHCR\u2019s opinion.",

In that regard, UNHCR noted that Afghan Sikhs had been designated an \u201cat-risk group\u201d as well as a \u201cvulnerable minority group\u201d in Dutch asylum policy on account of the fact that they face societal discrimination, limitations in education and economic opportunities and are exposed to violent harm and that national law does not provide sufficient protection to their religion. However, in practice, this policy did not sufficiently meet Afghan Sikhs\u2019 protection needs as, inter alia, it still required an individualised fear of persecution. For that reason, UNHCR had drawn the attention of the Dutch authorities to the vulnerable situation of Sikhs in Afghanistan on several occasions, including in the letter of 13 April 2017 (see paragraph 26 above).",

The Court thus notes that Sikhs suffer discrimination from the State in matters relating to employment and political representation (see paragraphs\u00a069, 71, 74 and 84 above), and that cases are reported of Sikhs suffering abuse at the hands of the police and of the authorities being unable or unwilling to provide them with protection against harm or harassment amounting to persecution (see paragraphs 74 and 84 above). Moreover, whilst Sikhs are in principle able to practice their religion publicly, in practice it is difficult to do so (see paragraphs 67, 74, 77 and 83-84 above). In this context the Court takes note in particular of the societal discrimination, harassment, intimidation and intolerance that Sikhs are sometimes reported to encounter (see paragraphs 67, 69, 71-72, 74, 77 and 82-84 above), which some sources attribute to extremist elements within the Muslim population (see paragraphs 74 and 84 above). Sikh families are reported not to send their children to State-run schools due to the harassment to which those children are subjected (see paragraphs 74, 76-77 and 83-84 above). Nevertheless, it is also reported that the Afghan authorities provide the Sikh community with police protection during funeral ceremonies (see paragraphs 69, 74 and 83-84 above), that that community is free to build places of worship, that land for a cremation site has been made available (see paragraphs 83-84 above), and that the Afghan Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs is making efforts to provide free water, electricity, and repair services for a few Sikh temples (see paragraph 83 above). Also, at least one school for Sikh children, partially funded by the State, is open in Kabul (see paragraphs 69, 72, 74, 76 and 83-84 above). Moreover, according to the Sikh member of the lower house of the Afghan national assembly, the majority of the Muslim population is very supportive of the Sikh community, they have a positive relationship, and Sikhs are able to practise their religion publicly (see paragraph 84 above).",

In reaching that finding, it further attaches relevance to the fact that, whilst both UNHCR\u2019s 2016 Guidelines and the version of that document as updated in 2018 say that Afghan Sikhs may have international protection needs, the question whether that is indeed so for a particular person is explicitly stated to be dependent on the individual circumstances of the case (see paragraphs 74-76 above). The letters written by the officer in charge of UNHCR\u2019s office in the Netherlands also indicate that the issue of whether members of the Sikh community are in need of international protection depends on the circumstances of the particular case (see paragraphs 26 and 44 above), and the Court cannot clearly discern from that organisation\u2019s third party observations that it now takes a different view. Similarly, in its \u201cCountry Guidance: Afghanistan\u201d, EASO takes the view that Sikhs may have a well-founded fear of persecution in relation to certain risk-enhancing circumstances, but that organisation has not listed Sikhs in the category of individuals who would, in general, have a well-founded fear of persecution (see paragraph 79 above).",

The Court has held that the fact of past illtreatment provides a strong indication of a future, real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3, in cases in which an applicant has made a generally coherent and credible account of events that is consistent with information from reliable and objective sources about the general situation in the country at issue (see J.K. and Others v. Sweden, cited above, \u00a7 102). It notes, however, that the Deputy Minister of Security and Justice found that the applicants had not provided a credible account.

Turkey, no.\u00a040035/98, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2000-VIII). That scrutiny should entail a thorough assessment \u2013 in which account is taken of all the information brought to the authorities\u2019 attention (see F.G. v. Sweden [GC], no. 43611/11, \u00a7 156, 23 March 2016) \u2013 of the situation in which the individual is likely to find him- or herself on returning. Regarding the burden of proof in expulsion cases, it is the Court\u2019s well-established case-law that it is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he or she would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article\u00a03; and that where such evidence is adduced, it is for the Government to dispel any doubts about it (see Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7\u00a0129, ECHR 2008; NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, \u00a7 111, 17 July 2008; F.G. v. Sweden, cited above, \u00a7 120, and J.K. and Others v. Sweden [GC], no. 59166/12, \u00a7 91, 23 August 2016). Moreover, although a number of individual factors may not, when considered separately, constitute a real risk, the same factors may give rise to a real risk when taken cumulatively and when considered in a context of general violence and heightened insecurity. Both the need to consider all relevant factors cumulatively and the need to give appropriate weight to the general situation in the country of destination derive from the obligation to consider all the relevant circumstances of the case (see NA. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0130, and, more recently, N.A. v.

For a person belonging to a group so designated, limited indications suffice to make a plausible case that he or she fears \u201cserious harm\u201d within the meaning of section 29(1)(b) of the Aliens Act 2000 (see also C2/3.2 and 3.3 of the Aliens Act 2000 Implementation Guidelines). Serious harm within the meaning of that section includes treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraphs 54-64 of the judgment). We consider that this Dutch country-specific asylum policy is a nuanced one; it acknowledges the difficulties that religious minority groups, in particular Sikhs, encounter in Afghanistan and accepts that members belonging to such a group might be in need of international protection, depending on their individual circumstances, which is, in our view, in line with the UNHCR Guidelines and EASO reports (see paragraphs 73-81 of the judgment).

When applying this policy to the case at hand, the competent authorities concluded that the applicants had not complied with the relevant requirements since their accounts as regards any past ill-treatment suffered by themselves were found not to be credible and no human rights violations committed against other Sikhs in their \u201cimmediate circle\u201d had been established; the authorities concluded that they had therefore not succeeded in establishing the required \u201climited indications\u201d.

In other words: if no credence can be given to allegations of past ill-treatment of a person, this does not always and automatically lead to the conclusion that there is no evidence of a real risk of that person being subjected to treatment contrary to Article\u00a03 of the Convention upon return to his or her country of origin.

As a result, these individual circumstances were thus unable to have any impact on the outcome of that assessment.

Taking account of the fact that the assessment of the alleged Article 3 risk entails a full and ex nunc evaluation and that some time has elapsed since the final decisions were taken on the applicants\u2019 second asylum applications, we take the view that the competent domestic authorities are in a much better position to carry out this examination, to draw all the relevant threads together and to assess whether or not the applicants\u2019 individual circumstances \u2013 which are fact-sensitive \u2013 will, considered cumulatively and in the context of the general situation in Afghanistan and the specific situation of Sikhs in that country, amount to such serious discrimination and/or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment as to overstep the severity threshold of Article 3 of the Convention.",
