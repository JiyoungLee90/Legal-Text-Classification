While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see Pinto Pinheiro Marques v.\u00a0Portugal, no.\u00a026671/09, \u00a7\u00a043, 22\u00a0January 2015). The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10. The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive (see Mustafa Erdo\u011fan and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos.\u00a0346/04 and 39779/04, \u00a7 36, 27 May 2014). As regards value judgments which have been found by the national courts to be of a defamatory character, the Court has assessed the national court\u2019s findings on the question of whether the language used in the statement was of an excessive or dispassionate nature, whether an intention of defaming or stigmatising the opponent was disclosed, and if the statement had a sufficient factual basis (see, among others, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos.\u00a021279/02 and 36448/02, \u00a7\u00a7 56-57, ECHR 2007I; and Aurelian Oprea v. Romania, no. 12138/08, \u00a7\u00a071, 19\u00a0January 2016).",

In all these cases the Court considered that the applicants\u2019 statements had had a sufficient factual basis and thus had not been excessive. A similar position was taken by the Court in two other cases, within the academic domain, where the applicant had issued statements considering that an elected academic senate had been illegitimate (see Kharlamov v.

In the present case, the applicant was subjected to a criminal sanction and sentenced to 250 day fines, totaling EUR 2,000. In addition, he was ordered to pay EUR 3,000 in compensation to A.S. (see paragraph\u00a013 above). Having regard to the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s conviction to a criminal fine, coupled with damages, was not proportionate (see, mutatis mutandis, Amorim Giestas and Jesus Costa Bordalo v. Portugal, no. 37840/10, \u00a7 36, 3 April 2014).",
