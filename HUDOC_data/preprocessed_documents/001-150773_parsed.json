The investigator did not obtain a preliminary arrest warrant from a court, as required by Article\u00a029 of the Constitution and Article 165-2 \u00a7 4 of the CCP, but based his decision to arrest the applicant without a court order on Articles 106 and\u00a0115 of the CCP. According to the report, the applicant was arrested because he had been identified by eyewitnesses as a person who had committed a crime. The report did not indicate who had identified the applicant, or exactly what crime the eyewitnesses had observed the applicant committing. Given the absence of that basic information, the arrest report did not provide a meaningful guarantee to show that the applicant\u2019s arrest had been effected on the basis of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence (see Grinenko v. Ukraine, no. 33627/06, \u00a7\u00a083, 15\u00a0November 2012).",

The domestic authorities did not establish and substantiate any of the specific purposes for applying preventive measure in accordance with the domestic law. In that regard, the Court notes that on 7\u00a0December 2009 the investigator released the applicant from detention after finding that there was no information that he would abscond or hinder the investigation.

The Court reached that conclusion after finding that the failure of the domestic court to review the applicant\u2019s ongoing detention had not been justified by any valid reason. On the contrary, no issue has arisen where the applicants were released within a matter of hours before any judicial scrutiny of their detention could in practice have taken place (see, for example, Fox, Campbell and Hartley v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, \u00a7 45, Series A no. 182).",
