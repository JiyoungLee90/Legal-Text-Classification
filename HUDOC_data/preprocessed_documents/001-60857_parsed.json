In the District Court\u2019s view, the applicant could not reasonably be required to indicate where the coins were as he was not allowed to enter the premises of the defendant Ministry. Subsequently, the appellate court and the Supreme Court overturned this decision finding that the applicant had failed to show where the coins had been deposited when that Act had become operative on 1 April 1991. They concluded that the applicant had thereby failed to meet the condition set out in Section 5\u00a0(1) of the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitations Act of 1991, under which a person claiming restitution of movable property is required, inter alia to indicate where such property is.

The fact that the appellate court and the Supreme Court reached a different conclusion cannot affect the position as the applicant\u2019s claim was not unsubstantiated or devoid of any prospect of success from the very beginning. The Court therefore finds that the applicant had a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of having his claim satisfied which justifies considering it as a possession within the meaning of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01. Reaching a different conclusion on the ground that the applicant failed to show the location of the property when the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitations Act of 1991 became operative would be, having regard to the above circumstances, too formalistic and would render the protection of the rights under the Convention and its protocols ineffective and illusory.
