At the same time it accepted the defendant\u2019s counterclaim and ordered the applicant to vacate the flat. It also ordered her to reimburse the defendant 4,800 Croatian kunas (HRK) for the costs of the proceedings. The court found that the applicant had been absent from the flat between 14\u00a0August 1991 and 15 July 2001, that is, for a period exceeding six months, and that her absence had not been justified. In so deciding the court followed the case-law of the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 34-37 below), according to which, in cases where a third person moves into the flat, the bringing of legal proceedings in order to evict the occupant would demonstrate an intention to live in the flat and prevent the tenant\u2019s absence from being considered unjustified and resulting in a termination of the tenancy. However, the applicant had never instituted any proceedings to regain possession of her flat. Therefore, the condition for termination of her specially protected tenancy stipulated in section 99(1) of the Housing Act had already been met on 13 February 1992. That being so, the court held, while expressly relying on decisions of the Supreme Court nos. Rev-777/1995-2 of 21 December 1999 and Rev-391/02-2 of 18 February 2003 (see paragraphs 31-33 below), that she had not been entitled to purchase the flat under the Specially Protected Tenancies ( to Occupier) Act or to acquire the status of a protected lessee under the Lease of Flats Act. Accordingly, the court concluded that she had no title to the flat and ordered her eviction.",

In so far as there exists at national level a remedy enabling the national courts to address, at least in substance, any argument as to an alleged violation of a Convention right, it is that remedy which should be used (see Azinas v.

In that connection they first emphasized that the applicant, as an indigent person who faced eviction, had never contacted the Zadar Welfare Centre or requested to be provided with accommodation even though in the proceedings before the Court she claimed that she had no family members who could support her and provide her with a place to live. Nevertheless, the Government stressed, the competent social services were familiar with the applicant\u2019s situation, and were prepared, in the event of her eviction, to offer her social assistance by accommodating her in a nursing home for the elderly and the infirm or in a foster family. The administrative proceedings in which such assistance would be granted would be instituted by the Zadar Welfare Centre of its own motion, which would choose the accommodation facility and determine how the costs of such accommodation would be met. Those proceedings could also be instituted upon the applicant\u2019s request. Pursuant to the Social Welfare Act the costs of such accommodation were to be covered from the applicant\u2019s income. If her income was insufficient to cover the full cost, the difference had to be covered by those who were obliged to support her or, if they failed to do so, by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. In support of their allegations the Government submitted two reports of 21\u00a0August 2009 and 17 May 2011 prepared by the Zadar Social Welfare Centre for the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare concerning the applicant\u2019s situation.",

They further submitted that the applicant\u2019s income consisted of her pension, amounting to HRK 1,787.10 per month, and a social benefit amounting to HRK 350 per month. Apart from the social benefit and social assistance in the form of accommodation in a nursing home for the elderly or a foster family, the Government claimed that that the applicant could obtain other forms of social assistance available under the Social Welfare Act, such as a lump sum benefit, which could be granted several times, or payment of the costs of accommodation.",

In this connection, the applicant submitted that her son and his wife, who lived with her, were both unemployed. Her other two children (a\u00a0son and a daughter) lived in Switzerland and had to provide for their own families. In particular, her daughter had to support her unemployed husband and a son who still went to school, whereas her son, who was divorced, had to support three underage children who lived with their mother.

In this connection the Court notes that in his opinion of 19 June 2009, Dr I.M. stated that, in view of the applicant\u2019s poor health, it was necessary to spare her from any relocation. Moreover, in its decision of 28 October 2010 postponing enforcement, the Zadar Municipal Court, taking into account the applicant\u2019s age and her state of health, found that her eviction would probably cause her irreparable harm. In this connection, the Court is mindful of the applicant\u2019s advanced age - she is now seventy-eight years old - and of her poor health, as well as the fact that she has been living in the flat in question for many years. At the same time, the Zadar Municipal Court held that the postponement of enforcement would not cause any damage to the local authorities because the applicant regularly paid the rent for the flat.",
