There were Russian military checkpoints on the roads leading to and from the town. The area was under curfew. The abductors arrived as a large group late at night, which indicated that they had been able to circulate freely past curfew. The men interacted by gesturing, had chain of command and acted in a manner similar to that of special forces carrying out an identity check. They were wearing specific camouflage uniforms, were well-armed, and had portable radios and a dog. The men had broken into the applicants' houses and the houses of the applicants' neighbours without fear of being heard by law enforcement agencies located in close proximity to the houses. All the information disclosed from the criminal investigation file supported their assertion as to the involvement of State agents in the abduction. Since the applicants' sons had been missing for a very lengthy period, they could be presumed dead. That presumption was further supported by the circumstances in which they had been arrested, which should be recognised as life-threatening.",

They further argued that there was no convincing evidence that the applicants' relatives were dead. The Government raised a number of objections to the applicants' presentation of facts. The fact that the perpetrators of the abduction spoke unaccented Russian and were wearing camouflage uniforms did not mean that these men could not have been members of illegal armed groups. The Government further alleged that the applicants' description of the circumstances surrounding the abduction was inconsistent. In particular, the applicants had failed to inform the investigators that the abductors had used the UAZ vehicle and a dog, whereas they had submitted this information to the Court. In the Government's opinion these inconsistencies demonstrated that the applicants' allegations were unsubstantiated. In this connection they referred to the alleged discrepancies in the applicants' information provided to the Court and the applicants' witness statements given to the domestic investigation; however, the Government did not submit these witness statements to the Court. The Government asserted that the crime could have been attributable to illegal armed groups. They pointed out that groups of mercenaries of Slavic origin had committed crimes on the territory of the Chechen Republic and emphasised that the fact that the perpetrators had Slavic features and spoke Russian did not prove that they were attached to the Russian military. They also observed that a considerable number of armaments had been stolen from Russian arsenals by insurgents in the 1990s and that members of illegal armed groups could have possessed camouflage uniforms.",

It finds that the fact that a large group of armed men in uniforms was able to move freely through military roadblocks during curfew hours and proceeded to check identity documents in several households and then took the applicants' sons away from their home strongly supports the applicants' allegation that these were State servicemen conducting a security operation. In their application to the authorities the applicants consistently maintained that Aslan and Aslanbek Tasatayev had been detained by unknown servicemen and requested the investigation to look into that possibility (see paragraphs 24, 27, 34 and 55 above).",

The burden of proof is thus shifted to the Government and if they fail in their arguments, issues will arise under Article 2 and/or Article 3 (see To\u011fcu v.

The investigation in criminal case no. 25088 was instituted on 8 July 2001, which is one month and six days after Aslan and Aslanbek Tasatayev's abduction. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in lifethreatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were delayed or not taken at all. For instance, as can be seen from the decision of the domestic court of 14 May 2005, by that date the investigators had not identified or questioned any of the local residents who had stood watch at the guard posts on the night of the abduction and had been threatened by the abductors; they had not established the identity of the owner of the UAZ vehicle which had been moving around Urus-Martan that night; they had not identified and questioned the witnesses who had seen the abductors' vehicle driving into the yard of the military commander's office after the abduction and they had not questioned any of the servicemen who had been on duty in the military commander's office and the ROVD about their possible involvement in the abduction or subsequent detention of the applicants' sons (see paragraph 55 above). It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious matter (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.
