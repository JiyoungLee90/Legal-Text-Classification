It established what the Russian authorities had done in respect of the \u2019s decision.

It found that the Convention of the Commonwealth of Independent States of 6\u00a0March 1998 on the Transfer of Convicted Persons for Further Serving of their Sentences was not applicable to the applicant\u2019s case as it had not come into force in respect of  at the relevant time. It held that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office had issued the order for the applicant\u2019s release on 13 June 2000 by virtue of its competence and relevant regulations, notably the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the USSR of 10 August 1979 on the Procedure for Execution of Obligations arising for the USSR from the Convention on the Transfer of Convicted Persons to Serve their Sentences in a State of their Citizenship, signed in Berlin on 19\u00a0May 1978, and instructions of 25 October 1979 on enforcement of that decree. The court stated that the decision of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office discharging the applicant from serving the remainder of his sentence had been lawful. It held that there had been no fault on the part of the defendant authorities and that therefore there was no basis to grant the applicant\u2019s claim for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage. Nor did it find grounds for granting the applicant\u2019s claim for compensation in respect of pecuniary damage based on the loss of employment income. It noted that the applicant, who had been employed six months after his release, had failed to prove that he had been unable to find employment earlier through the fault of the defendant authorities. In rejecting the applicant\u2019s claims the court relied on Articles 151, 1069-1071 and 1099 of the Civil Code.",

The Court notes that the applicant was paid EUR 850 in legal aid by the Council of Europe. It further notes that the applicant undertook to pay his lawyer\u2019s fees after the Court\u2019s delivery of a final judgment in his case on the basis of the relevant agreement between them dated 7 April 2005. Having regard to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the whole sum sought by the applicant (EUR 3,000) for the proceedings before it, less the amount received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe. The Court thus awards EUR 2,150 for costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant on that amount.",
