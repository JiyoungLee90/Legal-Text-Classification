It finds that the fact that a large group of armed men in uniform introducing themselves as representatives of the military commander\u2019s office was able to move freely around the locality during curfew hours and proceeded to check identity papers in the houses of local residents is consistent with the applicants\u2019 allegation that its members were in fact State servicemen conducting a security operation. In spite of their submission to the contrary, the documents submitted by the Government indicate that the first applicant did inform the investigators that, in her opinion, her husband\u2019s killers were military servicemen (see paragraph 29 above). However, it appears that the investigators did not take any steps to check whether military servicemen were involved. The Government suggested that the persons responsible for Saidkhasan Dangayev\u2019s death could have been members of an illegal armed group that had also opened fire in the yards of two other representatives of local law-enforcement agencies in the evening of 23 October 2002. However, they failed to adduce any additional evidence relating to the investigation of those crimes or to explain what had been done in order to establish the identity of the perpetrators of those acts. The Government\u2019s conclusions thus seem speculative and do not contradict the applicants\u2019 allegation that a special operation was being carried out.",

The first applicant was granted victim status on 5 November 2002. However, it does not appear that any other steps were taken at that time to solve the crime. In particular, in spite of the first applicant\u2019s complaints about the possible involvement of military servicemen in her husband\u2019s death (see paragraph 29 above), the investigators neither questioned officers of the local military commander\u2019s office and other law enforcement agencies about their involvement in the identity check and the raid on the houses in Pogranichnaya Street on the evening of 23 October 2002 nor identified witnesses who had seen the UAZ vehicle used by the killers. It also appears, that regardless of the instructions provided by the district prosecutor in his decision of 6 February 2004 (see paragraph 37 above), the investigators failed to take such basic investigative measures as obtaining the registration log of the car and armoured vehicles which passed through the checkpoints along the Staropromyslovskiy main road during the night of 23 October 2002 and questioning the servicemen manning those checkpoints. It is obvious that if they were to produce any meaningful results these investigative measures should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a046477/99, \u00a7\u00a086, ECHR 2002II).",
