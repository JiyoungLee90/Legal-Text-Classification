However, this request, despite having been received at the Pula Municipal Court on 30 June 2004, was not enclosed in the case file until 15 July 2004, while the final hearing was held on 13 July 2004. At that hearing the applicant expressly stated that he would defend himself in person although in his opinion his constitutional rights were thus violated. He stated several times that he did not understand anything. In view of the applicant's mental state (see paragraph 8 above) and his express request to have a legal aid lawyer appointed during the trial proceedings, the Court concludes that it cannot be accepted that the applicant waived his right to be represented by a lawyer during the trial proceedings.",

It thus leaves to the Contracting States the choice of the means of ensuring that it is secured in their judicial systems, the Court's task being only to ascertain whether the method they have chosen is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial (see Imbrioscia v.\u00a0Switzerland, 24 November 1993, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 275, and Salduz v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7 51, 27 November 2008).",

The first condition \u2013 lack of sufficient means to pay for legal assistance \u2013 is not in dispute in the present case, as it was accepted by the national courts when they assigned a legal aid counsel to the applicant in the appeal proceedings. What must be determined is whether the interests of justice required that the applicant be granted such assistance. In this connection the Court notes firstly that the Pula Municipal Court ordered the applicant to undergo compulsory psychiatric treatment because he had been diagnosed as suffering from a severe mental illness. Secondly, the Court notes that in the criminal proceedings in question the applicant was charged with an offence committed against an employee at Pula Prison, where he was serving a prison term at the time. In the Court's view, the applicant's mental state and the fact that as a convicted prisoner he was charged with an offence against a prison employee warranted his legal representation in the proceedings at issue. Furthermore, the Court's case-law is clear on the principle that where deprivation of liberty is at stake, the interests of justice in principle call for legal representation (see Quaranta v. Switzerland, 24\u00a0May 1991, \u00a7\u00a034; Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7\u00a061, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III; and Talat Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey, no.\u00a032432/96, \u00a7\u00a056, 27\u00a0March 2007). The Court is also mindful of the fact that in a decision of 22 September 2005 the Pula Municipal Court stated that considerations of fairness required the assignment of a legal-aid lawyer to the applicant. However, the defence counsel assigned could have acted for the applicant only in the appeal proceedings since at that point the trial stage had already been completed. In the Court's view, however, the \u201cconsiderations of fairness\u201d, as expressed by the national courts, made legal representation of the applicant an even more stringent requirement at the trial stage, given the paramount importance of the nature of criminal proceedings before a trial court, where all the evidence is usually presented and the defendant has probably his or her only chance to be heard in person by a court.",

The competent national authorities are required under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) to intervene only if a failure by legal aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or sufficiently brought to their attention in some other way (see Kamasinski v.\u00a0Austria, 19 December 1989, Series A no. 168, \u00a7 65, and Daud v.\u00a0Portugal, 21 April 1998, Reports 1998-II, \u00a7 38).",

Neither of the lawyers mentioned had visited the applicant in prison or made any other contact with him. In this respect, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to \u201cguarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective\u201d and that assigning counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused (see Artico v. Italy, 13\u00a0May 1980, Series A no. 37, \u00a7\u00a033). The fact that a lawyer, T.S., lodged an appeal on behalf of the applicant could not have remedied the above shortcomings since he could hardly have been acquainted with the applicant's version of events in view of the fact that the applicant had remained silent during the trial.",

The case-law reveals that the Court has adopted this solution mainly when the victim had the possibility of obtaining satisfaction at the domestic level, when the violation found was of little significance, when the national authorities clearly expressed the will to reform the legislation or practice at the origin of the violation or when, as in this case, the victim had the possibility of requesting the reopening of the domestic proceedings or obtaining satisfaction at the domestic level.",

Italy (13 May 1980, Series A, vol. 37), where the Court also found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3(c) of the Convention because the applicant's officially appointed lawyer had failed to defend him effectively and also on account of the Court of Cassation's inaction, the applicant was awarded three million lira in respect of non-pecuniary damage. In Goddi v. Italy (9 April 1984, Series A, vol. 76) the applicant, who had been charged and placed in detention, had not been effectively defended by an officially appointed lawyer because of the inaction of the Bologna Court of Appeal. The Court awarded him five million lira. In Quaranta v. Switzerland (24 May 1991, Series A, vol. 205) the refusal of the president of the Vaud canton Criminal Court to appoint a lawyer to assist the accused during the investigation and at the trial hearing gave rise to a finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c). The respondent State had to pay the victim 3,000 Swiss francs. Lastly, in Granger v. the United Kingdom (28 March 1990, Series A, vol. 174), the Court awarded the applicant 1,000 pounds in compensation for the isolation and confusion he must have felt because he had been refused the assistance of an officially appointed lawyer.",
