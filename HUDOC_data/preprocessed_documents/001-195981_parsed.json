The award was by no means comparable to what has been awarded under Article 41 of the Convention in similar cases (see Scordino, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 181 and 202; Umarova and Others v.

Furthermore, in the civil proceedings referred to by the Government, the domestic courts were unable to conduct an investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the abduction \u2013 that is to say providing adequate redress (see Khashiyev and Akayeva v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, \u00a7 121, 24 February 2005).

The criminal proceedings in respect of all the cases were suspended and resumed on several occasions throughout the periods concerned. The applicants maintained reasonable contact with the authorities, cooperated with each investigation, and, where appropriate, took steps to inform themselves of the progress of the proceedings and to speed them up, in the hope of securing a more effective outcome (see paragraphs 29, 31, 116, 117, 150 and 175 above). Given the time that passed between each of the abductions and the initiation of the relevant criminal proceedings \u2013 as well as the active stance taken by the applicants in respect of the proceedings \u2013 the Court is satisfied that the applicants lodged their applications within a reasonable amount of time (see Varnava and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a016064/90 and 8 others, \u00a7 166, ECHR 2009).",

It observes, however, that the applicants remained active in trying to establish the whereabouts of their relatives throughout the entire period and consistently complained to various authorities about the abduction (see paragraphs 59, 61 and 65 above). Moreover, in 2010 and 2011 they asked the investigators to resume the criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 60 and 62 above), and in 2013 lodged a request for the investigators to question two more witnesses to the abduction of their relatives (see paragraph 64 above), but to no avail. The Court also notes that the applicants gave power of attorney to lawyers from a non-governmental organisation, Stichting Russian Justice Initiative, in September 2011 but that it was not until February 2013 that the latter lodged their application with the Court. Given the overall time frame between the incident and the lodging of the application with the Court \u2013 as well as the applicants\u2019 active stance in the proceedings \u2013 the above lull in the investigation cannot be interpreted as their failure to show due diligence and comply with the six-month requirement.",

                                                "content": "193.\u00a0\u00a0As for the application Adamovy (no. 33465/13), lodged eleven years and nine months after the abduction, the Court observes that the applicants took an active stance from the beginning; they informed the authorities about the abduction and carried out an unofficial search for their relatives (see paragraphs 72-73 and 78 above). There was a discernible lull in the investigation between January 2002 and June 2007 comprising five and a half years. Such a long period of inactivity on the part of the authorities could have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the pending investigation. The Court notes however that in 2005 the first applicant contacted the authorities who informed her that operational search activities were carried out (see paragraphs 81-83 above). Moreover, the prosecutor ordered the restoration of the investigation file destroyed by fire in December 2002 and to resume the proceedings only after the first applicant lodged a request therefor with the investigators in June 2007 (see paragraph 84 above). Subsequently the investigation was suspended and then resumed on several occasions as a result of, inter alia, the applicants\u2019 complaints to the domestic authorities and the courts (see paragraphs 89 and 98 above). Taking into account the applicants\u2019 explanations concerning their compliance with the six-month rule and their efforts to revive the dormant proceedings, and having regard to the complexity of the case and the nature of the alleged violations, the Court concludes that it was reasonable for the applicants to wait for developments that could have resolved crucial factual or legal issues (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2012). Therefore, the Court considers that the lulls that occurred in the domestic investigation cannot be held against the applicants or be interpreted as constituting a failure to show due diligence and to comply with the six-month requirement (see Sagayeva and\u00a0Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a022698/09 and 31189/11, \u00a7\u00a7 58-61, 8 December 2015).",
