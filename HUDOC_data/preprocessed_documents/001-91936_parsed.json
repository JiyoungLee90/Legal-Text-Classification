In 2007 its members decided to discontinue the organisation\u2019s registration on grounds of alleged pressure and intimidation by the State. In particular, they complained of the refusal of the Ministry of Justice to register amendments to the organisation\u2019s articles of association, the repeated freezing of its bank account, the arbitrary arrest of its members, attempts to shut down its newspaper, among other things. Several of the organisation\u2019s leaders requested political asylum in western countries. It was decided to continue the organisation\u2019s activity under the same name but without registering it with the State authorities. It was also decided that the new unincorporated association would become the former organisation\u2019s successor. After removal of the organisation from the Government\u2019s list of non-governmental organisations on 2 June 2008, Hyde Park\u2019s activities continued as before on the basis of its new articles of association. The association continued editing its newspaper, its Internet page and continued staging protests and demonstrations.",

As to the proportionality of the interference with the legitimate aim pursued, the Government argued that Hyde Park\u2019s articles of association, in its chapter concerning the organisation\u2019s activities, did not contain any provisions about the staging of protests and demonstrations. Moreover, according to the articles of association, the decision-making body of the organisation was its council. However, the request for authorisation was lodged by the organisation\u2019s president, not by its council. In addition, in limiting the applicants\u2019 freedom of assembly, the authorities took into account the interest of Moldovan students in  who could have suffered as a result of the applicants\u2019 staging a protest demonstration in front of the Romanian Embassy. According to the Government, the Romanian Government could have cut the number of scholarships for Moldovan students as a result of the applicants\u2019 actions.",

By virtue of the wording of the second paragraph of Article\u00a011, and likewise of Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Convention, the only necessity capable of justifying an interference with any of the rights enshrined in those Articles is one that may claim to spring from a \u201cdemocratic society\u201d (see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08689, ECHR 2003II, and Christian Democratic People\u2019s Party v.\u00a0Moldova, cited above).",
