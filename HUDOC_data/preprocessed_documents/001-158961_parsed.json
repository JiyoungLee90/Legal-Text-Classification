Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7\u00a7 104 et seq., ECHR\u00a01999IV, and G\u00fcl v. Turkey, no. 22676/93, \u00a7 89, 14\u00a0December 2000). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of those responsible will risk falling foul of this standard.",

During the inquiry, the prosecutors questioned all those who could have witnessed the alleged events and secured medical evidence. The first applicant was also questioned and given the opportunity to present his version of the alleged events. The inquiry resulted in a decision that the police had not injured the first applicant, and his version of the events was therefore rejected. However, the decision did not provide any explanation or information as to how the applicant had been injured. While it is true that the doctor questioned during the inquiry stated that the hypothesis that the first applicant had injured himself could not be excluded, the prosecutors did not look further into such a scenario or into any other possible cause of the applicant\u2019s injuries. Moreover, they did not suggest that the cause of the injuries could not be established in the circumstances. The Government\u2019s argument in the latter regard is not supported by any evidence or detailed explanation (see paragraph 73 above). The Court also notes that the failure to establish the cause of the injuries was one of the principal grounds for the domestic courts\u2019 decisions requiring the prosecutors to carry out a further inquiry in September 2006 and March 2007 (see paragraph 32 above). It remains unclear why the courts eventually upheld the prosecutors\u2019 decision of 16 May 2007, notwithstanding the fact that that aspect of the inquiry had not been duly addressed (see paragraph 35 above). Nor was it addressed in the course of the examination of the first applicant\u2019s complaint of ill-treatment during the trial.",

Where the events at issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch v.

In those circumstances, given the onus on the State to provide a plausible explanation for injuries sustained by a person under the control of the police, the Court concludes that the Government have not satisfactorily established that the first applicant\u2019s injuries were wholly caused otherwise than by ill-treatment while in police custody (see Adnaralov v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a010493/12, \u00a7 45, 27\u00a0November 2014).

Russia, no.\u00a059696/00, \u00a7\u00a083, 26 October 2006); that the diagnoses and care are prompt and accurate (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7 115, and Melnik\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a072286/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0104-06, 28 March 2006); and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy that seeks, to the extent possible, to cure the detainee\u2019s diseases or to avoid aggravating them, rather than to address them on a symptomatic basis (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 109 and 114; Sarban, cited above, \u00a7\u00a079; and Popo v.

Furthermore, in considering whether treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it has adversely affected his or her personality in a\u00a0manner incompatible with Article 3. Even the absence of such a purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of this provision (see Peers v.\u00a0Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68 and 74, ECHR\u00a02001-III, and Vala\u0161inas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a0101, ECHR\u00a02001-VIII).",

In view of the size of detainees\u2019 compartments in prison vans and of the transit cells (see paragraphs 54 and 55 above), the high number of the journeys undertaken by the applicants and the amount of time they spent either in prison vans or in transit cells in the SIZO, those complaints raise serious concerns under Article\u00a03. Furthermore, they were not refuted by the Government and are supported by the international and domestic reports examined by the Court in the cases of Yakovenko and Koktysh both cited above and by the findings of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment during its visit to Ukraine in September 2009 (see paragraphs 64-65 above). Similar conditions of a detainee\u2019s transportation and detention while in transit gave rise to the finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the Court\u2019s judgment in Andrey Yakovenko (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a098-103). The Court does not find any reason to take a different approach in the present case and considers that the conditions to which the first, third, fourth and fifth applicants were subjected were in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.",

The second period of his pre-conviction detention, which took place after that time, lasted until 13 August 2010. Having regard to its case-law applicable in comparable situations, the Court finds that those two periods of the second applicant\u2019s pre-conviction detention were non-consecutive and should be assessed separately (see Idalov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0129-130; Chuprikov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61-63; and Osakovskiy v.

It notes that the first period of his pre-conviction detention ended more than six months before the introduction of his application (12 December 2010), whereas the second period of his pre-conviction detention ended less than six months before that date. Consequently, the second applicant\u2019s complaints of the unlawfulness and length of the first period of his pre-conviction detention between 14\u00a0October 2005 and 25 May 2007 were lodged out of time and should be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Idalov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0129-130; and Osakovskiy v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a013406/06, \u00a7 78, 17 July 2014).",

Even if the domestic law of a member State provides that a sentence only becomes final on completion of all appeals, pre-trial detention comes to an end for the purposes of the Convention with the finding of guilt and the sentence imposed at first instance.

The scope of the proportionality test to be applied in a given case varies depending on the type of detention involved. In the context of detention pursuant to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), the Court has generally been satisfied that the decision to impose a sentence of detention and the length of that sentence are matters for the national authorities rather than for this Court (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, \u00a7 103, ECHR\u00a02000-I; and Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 71).

Thus, the five-year imprisonment terms, to which the applicants concerned were sentenced on 13 August 2010, had to be calculated as from 14 October 2005, the date of their arrest (see paragraphs 7 and 18 above). As they had been detained during the entire period between 14\u00a0October 2005 and 13\u00a0August 2010, they would have had to serve about two months of imprisonment, had the judgment of 13 August 2010 become effective.

There might be special considerations warranting, irrespectively of the duration of the imprisonment sentence, the convict\u2019s deprivation of liberty pending an appeal against the verdict (see Ruslan Yakovenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a065). Moreover, as long as the detention follows and has a sufficient causal connection with a lawful conviction, the decision to impose a sentence of detention and the length of that sentence are matters for the national authorities rather than for the Court under that provision (see, for instance, Monnell and Morris, cited above, \u00a7 47; Saadi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a071; and Ruslan\u00a0Yakovenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061).

However, it is an essential part of a detainee\u2019s right to respect for family life that the authorities enable him or, if need be, assist him, in maintaining contact with his close family (see Khoroshenko v.\u00a0Russia [GC], no.\u00a041418/04, \u00a7 106, ECHR 2015, and Trosin v. Ukraine, no. 39758/05, \u00a7\u00a039, 23 February 2012). At the same time, the Contracting States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with that Convention obligation with due regard to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals (see, for instance, Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a044362/04, \u00a7\u00a081, ECHR 2007V). The Court has found that Article 8 does not impose a duty to arrange co-habitation visits for the detainees and their spouses (see Aliev v. Ukraine, no.\u00a041220/98, \u00a7 188, 29 April 2003; Dickson, cited above; and EpnersGefners v. Latvia, no.\u00a037862/02, \u00a7\u00a062, 29\u00a0May 2012). It has also found no interference by the State with detainees\u2019 Article 8 rights in situations where they failed to provide sufficient evidence that they had solicited family visits which they claimed they had not received (see \u010cistiakov v. Latvia, no.\u00a067275/01, \u00a7\u00a086, 8\u00a0February 2007; Savenkovas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 871/02, \u00a7\u00a0101, 18\u00a0November 2008; and Epners-Gefners, cited above, \u00a7\u00a065).",

It transpires from the material submitted by the parties that the applicants concerned received a number of visits by their close relatives during their detention. They did not demonstrate that the restrictions on family visits, as imposed by the law, had adversely affected their ability to meet with their close relatives as often as they wished (see, mutatis mutandis, Zinchenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a063763/11, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0100-01, 13 March 2014, and, by contrast, Shalimov v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 20808/02, \u00a7\u00a088, 4 March 2010). The Court notes that the applicants concerned did not refer to any specific occasion on which their request for a family visit had been refused or remained without a reply. Neither the applicants concerned nor their close relatives complained that they had been denied in their visiting rights. Their allegation that, in order for their close relatives to be allowed to meet with them, they had had to consent to be questioned as witnesses in the applicants\u2019 case has not been supported by any evidence. In those circumstances, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine in abstracto whether the domestic regulations limiting the number of family visits, as applicable in the applicants\u2019 case, satisfied the requirements of Article 8 of the Convection. It finds that this part of the case should be rejected as manifestly illfounded, in accordance with Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",
