The Government submitted articles published in Croatia in that respect, dating from 2002 and 2003 (see paragraph 53 above). The applicant, knowing that his parents had disappeared in the course of the military operation in the Medak Pocket in September 1993, could not have remained unaware of those publications. In fact, as the son of persons who had gone missing during the military operation, he could have been expected to show due diligence and to turn to the Croatian authorities for information regarding their fate (see paragraph 100 above). Had he done so at any point after November 2001 when the ICTY indictment was filed against general R.A., and especially after late 2002 and/or beginning of 2003 when the Croatian authorities started investigating the crimes committed in the Medak Pocket (see paragraphs 12-14 above), he could have learned about the damage (the death of his parents), as well as about the perpetrators (the Croatian army soldiers). In other words, he could have obtained all the information necessary in order to seek damages from the State, and therefore even the subjective three-year statutory limitation period for lodging the civil claim for damages would have started to run (see Nijem\u010devi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 46). Indeed, the applicant need not have waited for the outcome of the criminal proceedings against the Croatian army generals for the crimes committed in the Medak Pocket because the State was ex lege liable for the damage perpetrated by its soldiers to third persons (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 47).",

As noted in the judgment, in such situations the Supreme Court\u2019s well-established practice is to calculate the objective five-year statutory limitation period for lodging a civil claim from the date on which the plaintiffs learned about the death of their family members, because it is only after learning about that circumstance that the injured party can suffer emotional pain (see paragraphs 40 and 50 of the judgment).",

The Supreme Court therefore had to rectify the lower courts\u2019 decisions as to the running of the statutory limitation period for the applicant\u2019s civil claim for damages. Once it had decided not to refer the case back to the lower courts, the Supreme Court found itself in a situation in which it was the first court called upon to fix the starting-point of the objective five-year limitation period. Not being able itself to take evidence and determine the relevant facts, the Supreme Court decided to calculate the objective statutory limitation period from the time at which an objective opportunity had arisen for the applicant to learn about the death of his parents and not, as required by the well-established practice of the domestic courts, from the date on which the applicant had actually learned about their death.",

Indeed, none of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgments on the subject, save for that in the applicant\u2019s case, mentions an objective possibility to learn about the death of a family member (see\u00a0paragraph 50 of the judgment). For example, in its judgment no.\u00a0Rev\u00a02617/11-3 of 11 March 2014, the Supreme Court explained that \u201c[t]he nonpecuniary damage on account of the emotional pain related to the death of a close person cannot occur before the injured party actually learns about the death of the close person, because owing to the nature of the matter it is only after learning about that circumstance that the injured party can suffer emotional pain\u201d (ibid.). By that judgment the Supreme Court quashed the lower courts\u2019 judgments calculating the statutory limitation period as running from 10 September 1995, when the corpse of the plaintiffs\u2019 family member had been found, deeming that it had not been established in the proceedings \u201cthat it was the plaintiffs who had found [his] body on 10\u00a0September 1995, that is, that on that day they had learned about his death\u201d (ibid.).",

This is especially problematic in the present case, since the Supreme Court drew its conclusion without ever giving the applicant a real opportunity to submit arguments as to when he had actually learned about the death of his parents.
