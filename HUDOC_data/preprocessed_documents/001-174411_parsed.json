The authorisation is drawn up in writing and the judge deciding whether to grant it has the right to access the documents on which the requested operative measure is based, subject to obtaining special leave from an operational investigation entity insofar as access to secret information is concerned. The court adjudicating on the criminal case must be provided with all the information obtained as a result of the operational investigation activities (see \u0160antare and Labaz\u0146ikovs, cited above, \u00a7 57).",

However, as in \u0160antare and Labaz\u0146ikovs, the Court cannot speculate as to whether the information furnished by the Government in the present case attested to the existence of a written authorisation in the form of a decision (see \u0160antare and Labaz\u0146ikovs, cited above, \u00a7 60). Like the applicants in that case, the present applicant also wished to verify whether there had been a judicial decision authorising the interception (see paragraph 15 above). While the prosecutors at all levels informed him that such a decision existed, they did not provide any details allowing him to verify that such a decision had indeed been made, such as a reference number of that decision or the name of the judge who had adopted that decision (see \u0160antare and Labaz\u0146ikovs, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-61). The Court cannot but note that, although one prosecutor stated that the interception of the applicant\u2019s telephone conversations had been carried out on suspicion of large-scale tax evasion, the criminal proceedings against the applicant concerned large-scale smuggling of oil products, aggravated forgery and money laundering in an organised group (contrast paragraphs 6 and 8 with 14 above).

The Court has recognised that, while Article\u00a08 protects the confidentiality of all communication between individuals, it will afford \u201cstrengthened protection\u201d to exchanges between lawyers and their clients, as lawyers would be unable to defend their clients if they were unable to guarantee that their exchanges would remain confidential (see Michaud, cited above, \u00a7 118). While the Government contended that not every conversation between a lawyer and his client was privileged, the Court sees no reason to distinguish between the different categories of communication with lawyers which, whatever their purpose, concern matters of a private and confidential character (see Campbell, cited above, \u00a7\u00a048, which concerned correspondence). The Government in the present case did not submit that there was any reason to suspect that this channel of communication was being abused or that the applicant\u2019s defence counsel was not complying with the rules of his profession. In sum, the mere possibility of abuse is outweighed by the need to respect the confidentiality attached to the lawyer-client relationship (ibid., \u00a7\u00a052).",
