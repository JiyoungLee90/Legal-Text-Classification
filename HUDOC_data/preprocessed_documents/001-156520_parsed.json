Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 152, ECHR 2000XI; and Horvat v. Croatia, no. 51585/99, \u00a7 37, ECHR\u00a02001VIII). Remedies available to a litigant at domestic level for raising a complaint about the length of proceedings are \u201ceffective\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 if they prevent the alleged violation or its continuation, or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred. A remedy is therefore effective if it can be used either to expedite a decision by the courts dealing with the case, or to provide the litigant with adequate redress for delays that have already occurred (see Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, \u00a7 17, ECHR 2002VIII; Hartman v.\u00a0the\u00a0Czech \u00a0Republic, no. 53341/99, \u00a7 81, ECHR 2003VIII (extracts); and S\u00fcrmeli v.

Such redress may, in particular, be granted by a reduction of, or exemption from, costs and expenses which an applicant would have had to pay otherwise in the legal proceedings at issue (see, for instance, Normann v.

The issue of an applicant\u2019s victim status is indeed linked to the question of whether a domestic remedy is effective \u2013 in which event the applicant is obliged to exhaust that remedy \u2013 in that the applicant\u2019s ability to claim to be a victim will depend on the adequacy and sufficiency of redress the domestic remedy will have afforded him or her for the breach of the Convention right (compare Scordino v.

Filling a gap in Liechtenstein law which, in its view, did not provide for compensation for damage suffered by a complainant as a result of a breach of the reasonable-time requirement, the Constitutional Court developed a right for the complainant to be exempted from, or be reimbursed, certain costs of the procedure, in particular lawyer\u2019s costs and expenses and court costs as redress for such damage (see in detail paragraphs 40-45 above).",

It notes, in particular, that the proceedings were stayed from 1 October 2009 until their termination on 2 April 2014 in view of individual applications brought by the applicant pending before the Constitutional Court and before this Court, none of the parties to the proceedings having requested that the proceedings be continued. However, the Court reiterates in this respect that even in civil proceedings, where it is for the parties to take the initiative with regard to the progress of the proceedings, the national courts are not dispensed from ensuring compliance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention as regards the reasonable-time requirement (see, for example, Duclos v.\u00a0France, 17 December 1996, \u00a7 55, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996VI; H.T. v. Germany, no. 38073/97, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, 11 October 2001; and Laudon v.\u00a0Germany, no. 14635/03, \u00a7 71, 26 April 2007). Moreover, when staying proceedings pending the outcome of different proceedings, the domestic courts must duly establish the relevance of those proceedings for the case before them (compare, inter alia, H.T. v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036). Having regard to the fact that at the time of the Supreme Court\u2019s remittal on 1 October 2009, the proceedings as a whole had already been pending for more than eight years and that this Court communicated the applicant\u2019s application (on 12 July 2013) only in respect of the allegedly unreasonable length of the proceedings, the Court considers that the domestic courts did not duly further the proceedings at issue.",
