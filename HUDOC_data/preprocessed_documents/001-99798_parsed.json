In particular, the Court observes that the detention order of 27 March 2008 did not set any time-limit for the applicant's detention. Under the provisions governing the general terms of detention (Article 108 of the Criminal Procedure Code), the time-limit for detention pending investigation was fixed at two months. A judge could extend that period up to six months. Further extensions could only be granted by a judge if the person was charged with serious or particularly serious criminal offences. However, upon the expiry of the maximum initial detention period of two months (Article 109 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Procedure Code), no extension was granted by a court in the present case. The applicant has been in detention pending extradition for over two years. During that period no requests for extension of his detention have been lodged. Thus, the national system has failed to protect the applicant from arbitrary detention, and his detention cannot be considered \u201clawful\u201d for the purposes of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention.",

Given the irreversible nature of the harm that might occur if the alleged risk of torture or ill-treatment materialised and the importance which the Court attaches to Article 3, the notion of an effective remedy under Article 13 requires (i) independent and rigorous scrutiny of a claim that there are substantial grounds for believing that there was a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 in the event of the applicant's expulsion to the country of destination, and (ii) the provision of an effective possibility of suspending the enforcement of measures whose effects are potentially irreversible (or \u201ca remedy with automatic suspensive effect\u201d as it is phrased in Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v. France, no. 25389/05, \u00a7\u00a066 in fine, ECHR 2007-V, which concerned an asylum seeker wishing to enter the territory of France; see also Jabari v.

Latvia (dec.) [GC], no.\u00a048321/99, \u00a7\u00a099, ECHR 2002-II). Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that the decision of the Prosecutor General's office to extradite the applicant was upheld on appeal by the  regional court and the Supreme Court.
