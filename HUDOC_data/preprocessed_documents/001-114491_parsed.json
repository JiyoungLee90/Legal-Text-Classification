The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and cooperation of all concerned are always important ingredients. Whilst the national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such cooperation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited, since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, as should, more particularly, the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article\u00a08 of the Convention (see P.P. v.

Nonetheless, it observes that no effective measures were taken by the authorities to create the necessary conditions for executing the judgment in question, whether meaningful coercive measures against Mr\u00a0O.A. or steps to prepare for the return of the child to the applicant. Although coercive measures involving a child are not desirable in this sensitive area, the use of sanctions must not be ruled out in the event of unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the child lives (see IgnaccoloZenide, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 105-06).",
