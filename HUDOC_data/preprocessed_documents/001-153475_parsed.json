This required reasonable opportunities to undertake courses aimed at helping prisoners to address their offending behaviour and the risks they posed. While Article 5 \u00a7 1 did not impose any absolute requirement for prisoners to have immediate access to all courses they might require, any restrictions or delays encountered as a result of resource considerations had to be reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, bearing in mind that whether a particular course was made available to a particular prisoner depended entirely on the actions of the authorities (see \u00a7\u00a0218 of the judgment).",

The report of an August 2008 meeting referred to the applicant\u2019s fear of participating in group activities and the need for extra psychological assessment (see paragraph\u00a015 above). By January 2009, the applicant was categorically refusing to participate in courses and to discuss his specific sentence targets with his offender supervisor. As a result, his offender supervisor considered it imperative that he be psychologically assessed (see paragraphs 16-17\u00a0above). His refusal to engage with his sentence plan targets to reduce his risk was recorded in his Sentence Planning and Review Report of 2\u00a0February 2009 (see paragraph 20 above).",

This was achieved when the applicant began the ETS in May 2009, completing it in June 2009 (see paragraph 23 above). Bearing in mind reasonable waiting times and the applicant\u2019s own opposition to participation in course work, the delay of fifteen months following the expiry of his tariff for access to a second rehabilitative course cannot be considered unreasonable.",

At some point, he participated in an assessment for the HRP but was ultimately deemed to be unsuitable for that course (see paragraph\u00a026 above). The CALM course had previously been identified as potentially suitable, but once again the applicant had shown some reluctance to participate (see paragraph 32 above). That reluctance, together with an issue relating to availability of staff, appears to have delayed his assessment for that course. In particular, at some point prior to April 2011, the applicant refused a prison transfer which would have enabled him to be assessed for the CALM course. There was also evidence that the applicant was prioritising his work over addressing his areas of risk (see paragraph\u00a034 above). He subsequently commenced the course, completing it in October 2011 (see paragraph 36 above). Taking into account the courses which had already been provided to the applicant, and having regard to his own responsibility for at least part of the delay in affording him access to the CALM course, there was no unreasonable delay in this respect.",
