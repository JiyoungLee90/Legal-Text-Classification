According to Th.K., he blocked Kountouriotou Street with his car. As he and his colleague were taking up their positions, a person came out of the passenger seat of the Seat Ibiza, whom Th.K. perceived from the corner of his eye. At the same time, he heard A.X. shouting that the person exiting the car was carrying a gun. He heard gunshots coming from the place where the Seat Ibiza was parked and then a gunshot coming from the direction of his colleague, whom he saw with his gun pointed towards the sky. He then saw a person running away in the opposite direction and heard a fresh gunshot fired from that direction. After Th.K. had fired two shots, he heard a fresh gunshot and saw dust rising from the upper side of the rear windscreen of the police car, indicating that the bullet had hit that part of the car. He fired another shot and then he sought better cover next to his colleague. They both moved behind a \u201cpiloti\u201d (pilotis\u00a0are supports that\u00a0raise a building from the ground, creating an open ground-floor level) of a nearby building and called for back-up. The above-mentioned sequence of events is in accordance with Th.K.\u2019s testimony of 2 October 2012. In his earlier testimony dated 10 March 2010, officer Th.K. had cited the events in a similar way, except for the fact that he mentioned he had fired four shots and that testimony had been repeated in order no.\u00a0A5/2012 of the public prosecutor at the Court of First Instance. In his testimony dated 10 March 2010, officer A.X.\u2019s account of the incident was similar, except that according to him, after he heard gunshots coming from the direction of the Seat Ibiza, Th.K. returned fire several times and then shot a bullet into the air.",

Taking into account the distortion of the bullet and the damage sustained by the police car, it was estimated that the police car had been damaged by the second bullet and that the person who had fired those two bullets had been on the pavement nearby 48 Kountouriotou Street. Of the three bullets that had been fired by the Beretta pistol owned by officer Th.K., one was found on the balcony of the first floor of the block of flats at 48 Kountouriotou Street and one was found by the entrance to the same block of flats; the metal fragment that formed part of the external case of the third bullet was found at 52 Kountouriotou Street. Lastly, the Seat Ibiza had a hole in the right rear pillar (as seen from the driver\u2019s seat) and another hole at the rear windscreen. The form, location and general features of the holes led to the conclusion that they had been caused by a single bullet fired from a gun outside the car; the bullet had been fired at the car from its right side towards its left side and had had a slightly downward trajectory. After estimating that the person firing the shot had been located on the right side of the car, the investigators did not find the bullet in question, despite searching the area.",

Those people allegedly belonged to a terrorist organisation called Revolutionary Fight (\u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u0391\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2). In the case file the incident culminating in the death of Lambros Fountas, who had allegedly been a member of that organisation, is described, with some differences as compared with the version mentioned in the orders of the Athens public prosecution office (see paragraphs 7 and 11). In particular, the Seat Ibiza was reported as having been parked in Kefallinias Street and not in Kountouriotou Street and the hand grenade was described as having been found in a little bag inside the jacket that the deceased was wearing. In the case file, there are also documents describing the evidence collected from the applicant\u2019s house and from the houses of other relatives of the deceased, and the evidence collected following the lifting of the secrecy in respect of communications data of the deceased. The case file was given the number AF-10/541. Under decision no.\u00a05/2010 of the plenary composition of the Athens Council of Appeal Judges, a special investigator conducted a main investigation against those six people.",

[but also] gunshots from the unknown perpetrator in the driver\u2019s seat, given that a Glock shell was found at the scene. Consequently, during the above-mentioned surprise attack involving gunshots fired against them, it is obvious that the above-mentioned officers were acting in defence and that the use of their guns was therefore necessary and lawful in this case in order to defend themselves. Moreover, the combined review of the evidence shows that the bullet (fragment thereof) that hit the body of the deceased Lambros Fountas came from the BERETTA pistol of officer Th. K. As to whether the above-mentioned police officer observed or not the necessary measure of defence by choosing to fire a neutralisation gunshot against Lambros Fountas, instead of using another, milder method of defence in order to avert the attack, and more specifically instead of firing a warning or immobilisation gunshot, the following must be said: if one takes into account the above-mentioned conditions and circumstances under which the attack took place, and especially that it was manifested in a way that was linked to an immediate risk of death or grave injury of the above-mentioned officers, that is to say suddenly, at night and with consecutive shots fired from a small distance, then it is considered that the means selected, that is to say the neutralisation shot, was absolutely necessary in order to avert the attack. In addition, it was lawful, pursuant to the above-mentioned provision of Article\u00a03\u00a0\u00a7\u00a06\u00a0 (a) of Law no. 3169/2003, according to which the neutralisation gunshot is allowed, if that is required, in order to avert an attack that is linked to an imminent risk of death or grave injury of a person. In the present case, the shots fired by officers Th.K. and A.X. are considered to have been justified in order to counter an attack against them, because any milder methods (such as a warning or an \u201cimmobilising\u201d shot) would not have provided any guarantee that the attack would be countered securely, immediately and effectively so as to protect their own lives and physical safety; for that reason and on the basis of the above-mentioned considerations, the sworn administrative inquiry concluded that the above-mentioned officers had acted lawfully within the scope of their official duties and did not bear any disciplinary responsibility for the use of their service guns.\u201d",

The public prosecutor refrained from issuing a ruling and ordered a further preliminary inquiry, owing to the fact that officer Th.K. had not been summoned to be heard as a suspect at the stage of the initial preliminary inquiry but only as a witness.

A5/2012 issued by the Athens public prosecution office and case file AF-10/541. In particular, the Athens public prosecution office had identified as the applicant\u2019s son the person who had got out of the passenger\u2019s seat of the Seat Ibiza and shot twice towards the policemen. However, case file\u00a0AF10/541 had not made clear who had been in the passenger\u2019s seat; therefore, the applicant considered any other conclusion to be arbitrary. He argued that the gun and hand grenade found next to his son\u2019s body could not have belonged to him and considered it curious that the bullet that had been shot from the Glock had never been found. He contested in general the sequence of events described in the order of the Athens public prosecution office, arguing that other people could have been present on the scene and could have placed the guns next to his son\u2019s body. He also claimed that there had been a trail of blood stains leading from 48 Kountouriotou Street to 52 Kountouriotou Street \u2013 that is to say for roughly forty metres; in his view, this proved that his son\u2019s death had not been immediate and that the policemen had left him without any medical help.",

It is not disputed between the parties that the applicant\u2019s son lost his life as a result of the use of force by State agents. Given the circumstances in question, the State was under an obligation to initiate and carry out an investigation that fulfilled the procedural requirements of Article 2. Civil proceedings initiated at the initiative of the victim\u2019s relatives would not have satisfied the State\u2019s obligation in this regard (see, mutatis mutandis, Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2002II). The Court has repeatedly held that the procedural obligation of the State under Article 2 to conduct a thorough, official, effective and prompt investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force cannot be substituted by the payment of damages. The Court has confirmed that an action for damages, either to provide redress for a death or for a breach of an official obligation during the related investigation, is not capable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any findings as to the identity of the perpetrators and still less of establishing their responsibility (see Mili\u0107 and\u00a0Others v.

In any event, the fact that it had been found next to him did not mean that it had necessarily belonged to him.

This means that it must be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts, a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances and of identifying and \u2013 if appropriate \u2013 punishing those responsible (see Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, \u00a7 301, and Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7 172). This is not an obligation of result, but of means (see Nachova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 160, ECHR 2005VII); Jaloud v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 47708/08, \u00a7 186, ECHR 2014; and Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7 173). The authorities must take whatever reasonable steps they can to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy that provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of the clinical findings, including the cause of death. (As regards autopsies, see, for example, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7 106, ECHR 2000-VII; on the subject of witnesses, see, for example, Tanr\u0131kulu v.

Moreover, where there has been a use of force by State agents, the investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances (see, for example, Kaya v.\u00a0\u00a0Turkey, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 87, Reports 1998-I). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death will risk falling foul of this standard (see Av\u015far v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0393-395, ECHR\u00a02001VII (extracts); Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0301; and Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7 174).",

While none of those witnesses was an eye-witness, it cannot be said that the prosecuting authorities accepted without question the version supplied by the law-enforcement officers implicated in the events. They not only questioned numerous witnesses, but also ordered several forensic examinations, including an autopsy and a set of ballistics tests (see paragraphs 12-21 above). The fact that the ballistics tests were not conclusive in respect of some aspects of the case (namely which gun had caused the holes in Seat Ibiza) was not, in itself, such as to make further investigations necessary, given that it was for the public prosecutor to assess the pertinence of the explanations given by the various experts.",

As regards the applicant\u2019s allegation that he had been informed by the coroner that his son had been shot from a distance of three to four metres (see paragraph 20 above), the Court notes that this information was not corroborated by any evidence in the case file. Similarly, the applicant complained that there had been a trail of blood measuring approximately fifty metres \u2013 that is to say from where the Seat Ibiza had been parked (by 48 Kountouriotou Street) to the place where his son\u2019s body had been found (by 52 Kountouriotou Street). However, from the pictures included in the case file and sent to the Court, as well as from the sketch of the scene drawn by the police officers in charge of collecting the evidence that day, no trail of blood stains of such a length can be discerned. The blood stains are visible around the body of the deceased and from 50 Kountouriotou Street to 52 Kountouriotou Street. Therefore, the coroner\u2019s conclusions that the death of the applicant\u2019s son was immediate cannot be called into question on the basis of the evidence presented to the Court.",

To hold otherwise would be to impose an unrealistic burden on the State and its law-enforcement personnel in the execution of their duty, perhaps to the detriment of their lives and those of others (see McCann and others, cited above, \u00a7 200). In a number of cases the Court has expressly stated that as it is detached from the events at issue, it cannot substitute its own assessment of the situation for that of an officer who was required to react in the heat of the moment to counter an honestly perceived danger to his life or the lives of others; rather, it must consider the events from the viewpoint of the person(s) acting in self-defence at the time of those events (see, for example, Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, no. 50196/99, \u00a7 139, ECHR 2005II (extracts); and Giuliani and\u00a0Gaggio, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 179 and 188). Consequently, in those Article 2 cases in which the Court specifically addressed the question of whether a belief was perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time, it did not adopt the standpoint of a detached observer; instead, it attempted to put itself into the position of the person who used lethal force, both in determining whether that person had the requisite belief and in assessing the necessity of the degree of force used (see, for example, Makaratzis v.\u00a0Greece [GC], no. 50385/99, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66, ECHR 2004XI; Ol\u00e1h v. Hungary (dec.), no. 56558/00, 14 September 2004; and Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, \u00a7 189). Moreover, in applying this test the Court has not treated reasonableness as a separate requirement but rather as a relevant factor in determining whether a belief was honestly and genuinely held (see Armani\u00a0Da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 5878/08, \u00a7 246, 30\u00a0March 2016, and the case-law cited therein). In this regard, it is particularly significant that the Court has never found that a person purporting to act in self-defence honestly believed that the use of force was necessary but proceeded to find a violation of Article 2 on the ground that the belief was not perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time. Rather, in cases of alleged self-defence it has only found a violation of Article 2 where it refused to accept that a belief was honest or where the degree of force used was wholly disproportionate (ibid, \u00a7 247 and the case-law cited therein).\u00a0\u00a0It can therefore be elicited from the Court\u2019s case-law that the principal question to be addressed is whether the person had an honest and genuine belief that the use of force was necessary. In addressing this question, the Court will have to consider whether the belief was subjectively reasonable, having full regard to the circumstances that pertained at the relevant time. If the belief was not subjectively reasonable (that is, it was not based on subjective good reasons), it is likely that the Court would have difficulty accepting that it was honestly and genuinely held (ibid., \u00a7 248).",

In doing so, they assessed a number of items of relevant evidence \u2013 namely the professional obligations of the officers, the degree of danger that the attack represented, the nature of the threatened harm and the circumstances under which the attack took place. The prosecutors also considered the question of whether officer Th.K. had exceeded the level of reasonable force in defending himself and provided reasons for the implicated officer\u2019s submission that his use of force had been reasonable. In this regard, the Court has to examine whether the test applied by the public prosecutors, namely whether the use of force had been justified and whether the police officer in question had exceeded the level of reasonable force, is compatible with the requirement that an honest belief be perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time under Article 2 of the Convention. It is clear from domestic law and the orders of both the Public Prosecutors (see paragraphs 25 and 29 respectively) that the focus of the test applied was on the fact that officer Th.K. was acting in defence. At the same time, the Public Prosecutors examined whether another, milder method of defence could be used and whether Th.K. could be said to have exceeded the necessary level of defence. Bearing in mind that the Court has previously declined to find fault with a domestic legal framework purely on account of a difference in wording which can be overcome by the interpretation of the domestic courts (see Perk and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a050739/99, \u00a7 60, 28\u00a0March 2006, and Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0214-15), it cannot be said that the test applied by the Greek authorities falls short of the standard required by Article 2 of the Convention. It is also clear that in the present case the public prosecutors carefully examined the subjective reasonableness of the belief that the attack the police officers received justified the level of force used by focusing on the circumstances at hand, namely the surprise element of the attack, the darkness, the continuous gunshots fired at the policemen from a short distance and the lack of safe cover, and concluded that Th.K. reasonably believed that a neutralisation shot had been necessary. Consequently, it cannot be said that the domestic authorities failed to consider, in a manner compatible with the requirements of Article 2 of the Convention, whether the use of force by the implicated police officers had been justified in the circumstances.",

While the Court has previously held that disclosure or publication of police reports and investigative materials may involve sensitive issues with possible prejudicial effects on private individuals or other investigations and, therefore, cannot be regarded as an automatic requirement under Article 2, it still considers that a delay of four years before the Data Protection Authority was excessively long.
