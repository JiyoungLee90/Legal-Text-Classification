The rent review boards are composed of a chairman (a judge) and two lay assessors and the Housing and Tenancy Court, a court in the strict sense, whose composition varies, always has judges among its members - including the president, who has a casting vote. In this case, the court was composed of four members, two judges and two lay assessors. Moreover, the latter are not appointed for a specific case, do not know in advance to which files they will be assigned and take a judicial oath.

One reason is that, before the Court, Mr Langborger has not attacked or tried to refute the Commission\u2019s finding that there was no reason to doubt the independence of the Housing and Tenancy Court vis-\u00e0-vis the executive and the parties (see paragraphs 128 and 133 of the Commission\u2019s report).

Secondly, it has to be assessed whether these fears can be held objectively justified (see the Hauschildt judgment of 24 May 1989, para. 48). This assessment will frequently include a weighing of interests. This is because what is at stake is often not only the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the parties, but also the interest in having a judicial organisation that is rational and operates smoothly.",

If this assumption were correct, then the lay assessors could hardly be considered impartial at all! There is, however, no factual basis for the assumption: as the Swedish Supreme Court has pointed out, the lay assessors should not feel bound by the interests which they can be said to represent; they should carry out their duties as independent judges and not as representatives of party interests (see paragraph 24 of the \u2019s judgment).

Both the wording and the drafting history of section 2 of the 1978 Act make it clear that the Swedish legislature intended that exemption from the compulsory system of collective bargaining should be granted only exceptionally: the test it laid down in section 2 is a narrow one and, moreover, leaves considerable discretion to the Housing and Tenancy Court.",
