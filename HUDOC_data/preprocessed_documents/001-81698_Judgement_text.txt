The case originated in an application (no. 73192/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mrs M. Wawrzynowicz (“the applicant”) on 25 February 2001.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 8 December 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits and on the claims for just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention.
The Government submitted a unilateral declaration and invited the Court to strike out the application, in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.
The applicant was born in 1940 and lives in .
On 12 March 1993 she lodged an application with the Poznań District Court. She sought interest on the sum of money awarded to her by the court on 30 September 1991. The proceedings were related to other proceedings concerning the division of the matrimonial property of the applicant and her former husband, in particular their apartment. Apparently the apartment had been vested to the applicant's former husband by a judgment of 1992. Other sets of proceedings concerned their mutual liabilities in this regard.
Hearings were held on 25 May 1993 and 31 August 1993. Subsequently, the applicant extended her claim.
On 5 October 1993 the court decided to transfer the case-file to the . On 15 January 1994 the  transferred the case-file back to the Poznań District Court.
On 9 May 1994 the applicant requested the court to adjourn the hearing scheduled for 10 May 1994.
On 29 July 1994 and 21 November 1994 the applicant's lawyer submitted pleadings setting out details of the claim.
Subsequent hearings were held on 27 September 1994, 24 January 1995, 27 March 1995, 24 April 1995, 17 May 1995 and 19 June 1995.
On 26 June 1995 the Poznań District Court delivered a judgment. It allowed the applicant's claim in part. On 2 September 1995 the applicant appealed.
On 1 December 1995 the  quashed the judgment and remitted the case.
A hearing of 10 April 1996 was adjourned to 18 October 1996. A hearing of 18 October 1996 was cancelled because a judge sitting in the case was ill. Subsequent hearings were held on 20 December 1996 and 11 March 1997. It appears that the files of cases related to the present proceedings, requested by the parties on 11 March 1997, had not been submitted to the court. They were eventually submitted on 13 May 1997 and 6 March 1998.
Subsequent hearings were held on 29 May 1998, 8 November 1999, 10 January 2000, 10 February 2000 (adjourned), 31 August 2000 and 12 October 2000.
On 7 December 2000 the Poznań District court delivered a judgment. It allowed the applicant's claim in part. On 10 April 2001 the applicant appealed.
On 7 September 2001 the  dismissed the appeal. The judgment was final.
On 9 March 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Poznan Court of Appeal about the excessive length of two sets of proceedings, including the one complained of in the present case (further referred to as “the first set of proceedings”). She invoked section 18 of the 2004 Act (see domestic law part below) and requested the court to find that the length of the proceedings, which had lasted eight and four years respectively, had been unreasonable. She further submitted that she had lodged a complaint about the length of the proceedings with the European Court of Human Rights.
On 21 April 2005 the Court of Appeal rejected the complaint without examining its merits. The court found (referring to the second set of proceedings) that the complaint had not been lodged while the impugned proceedings were still pending. The court further noted that the [second set of] proceedings had terminated in 2000, which was before the applicant had lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights. Therefore, the applicant had not complied with the provisions of sections 5 or 18 of the 2004 Act and her complaint had to be rejected. The court did not refer to the first set of proceedings mentioned in the applicant's complaint.
Apparently, following the communication of the application, the Government drew the Court of Appeal's attention to the fact that the applicant's complaint concerning the length of the first set of proceedings had not been examined. On 31 March 2006 the president of the court informed the Government that the court would deal with this part of the complaint.
On 31 May 2006 the Poznan Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's complaint concerning the first set of proceedings. The court considered that the applicant had failed to indicate circumstances that would justify her request, as required by section 6 of the 2004 Act. The court found that the mere fact, relied on by the applicant, that the proceedings had lasted over eight years, could not suffice to find that the proceedings had lasted longer that was necessary. Therefore, according to section 9 of the Act, the complaint had to be rejected without requiring the plaintiff to complete it.
On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force. A party to pending proceedings may ask for the acceleration of those proceedings and/or just satisfaction for their unreasonable length under section 2 read in conjunction with section 5(1) of the 2004 Act.
Section 12 provides for measures that may be applied by the court dealing with the complaint. The relevant part provides:
“1.  The court shall dismiss a complaint which is unjustified.
If the court considers that the complaint is justified, it shall find that there was an unreasonable delay in the impugned proceedings.
At the request of the complainant, the court may instruct the court examining the merits of the case to take certain measures within a specified time. Such instructions shall not concern the factual and legal assessment of the case.
If the complaint is justified the court may, at the request of the complainant, grant ... just satisfaction in an amount not exceeding PLN 10,000 to be paid by the State Treasury. If such just satisfaction is granted it shall be paid out of the budget of the court which conducted the delayed proceedings.”
Section 6 § 2 provides that a complaint must include:
1) a request to find that there was an unreasonable delay in the impugned proceedings;
2) circumstances that would justify the request.
According to section 9 of the Act, when a complaint does not meet the requirements of section 6 of the Act, it must be rejected without prior summons to the plaintiff to complete the shortcomings in the complaint.
Under section 18 of the Act, within six months after the entry into force of the Act, that is, from 17 September 2004, anyone who had lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights complaining of a violation of the 'reasonable-time' requirement contained in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was entitled to lodge a length of proceedings complaint provided for by the Act, if the application to the Court had been lodged when the proceedings were still pending and if it had not yet been declared admissible by the European Court.
Under Article 130 of the Code of Civil Procedure if a statement of case or a pleading fails to comply with formal requirements, the party shall be summoned to complete or remedy the formal shortcomings within a one-week time-limit.
