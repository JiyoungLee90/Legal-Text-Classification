This Law provided for a sufficient remedy capable of redressing the Convention grievances of the applicants who had suffered damages during the authorities\u2019 struggle against terrorism.

This twofold violence resulting from the acts of the two parties to the conflict forced many people to flee their homes.

Accordingly, the Court must reach its decision on the basis of the available evidence submitted by the parties (see Pardo v.

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Dula\u015f and Y\u00f6yler, both cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65 and 87 respectively).",

However, the investigation in question was limited to asking the Gendarmerie Headquarters to provide information about the applicants\u2019 allegations (see paragraph 14 above). It does not seem that any attempt was made to interview members of the security forces during the course of investigation, despite the fact that the applicants had clearly accused gendarmes of burning their houses and possessions. Nor does it appear that the authorities considered visiting the scene of the alleged events in order to verify the applicants\u2019 allegations. Rather, they were content to rely on the information given by the security forces. It is noteworthy in this connection that the Court has consistently found a general reluctance on the part of the authorities to consider the possibility that members of the security forces could have perpetrated such acts (see the above-mentioned judgments of Sel\u00e7uk and Asker, \u00a7 68, \u0130pek, \u00a7\u00a0206; Y\u00f6yler, \u00a7 92).
