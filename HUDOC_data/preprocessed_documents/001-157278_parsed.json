As to the amount of compensation, the Court reiterates that, whereas the method of calculation does not have to follow exactly the guidelines established by the Court in the pilot judgment (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a042525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7 172, 10 January 2012), what is important is that the proposed sums are not unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases. Without prejudging its decision on the admissibility and merits of the case, the Court considers that the declaration does not provide a sufficient basis for concluding that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols does not require it to continue its examination of the case (see Sorokin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 67482/10, 10 October 2013).",
