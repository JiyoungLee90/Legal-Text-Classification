The case originated in an application (no. 50371/09) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Krastyu Vasilev Mihaylov (“the applicant”), on 29 April 2009.
The applicant passed away on 18 November 2013 and his heirs, his wife Kalinka Vasileva Mihaylova and his son Vasil Krastev Mihaylov, expressed the wish to pursue the application in his stead.
The applicant was represented by Ms S. Stefanova and Mr A. Atanasov, lawyers practising in Plovdiv. After the applicant’s death Ms Stefanova also represented his heirs. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Y. Stoyanova, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 10 January 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1927.
He owned a house with a yard in Plovdiv, which were expropriated in 1982 on the basis of section 98 (1) of the Territorial and Urban Planning Act of 1973 (Закон за териториалното и селищно устройство) with a view to constructing a residential building. The expropriation decision stated that the applicant was to be compensated with a two-room flat and a garage in a building which the municipality intended to construct.
On an unspecified date the flat due in compensation was constructed and delivered. However, the applicant never received the garage which had also been due to him.
In April 2008 the applicant complained to the Plovdiv municipality of the failure to provide him with a garage. By a letter of 11 June 2008 the deputy mayor of Plovdiv informed him that the municipality had no garages available and that it was currently constructing a building with underground garages, one of which could be offered to him.
In February 2010 the applicant wrote once again to the municipality, and was informed in reply that the construction of the building mentioned earlier had not been completed.
In 2014 the municipality offered the applicants’ heirs a garage, which the latter refused as it was situated at more than ten kilometers from their place of residence.
The relevant domestic law and practice have been summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kirilova and Others v. Bulgaria (nos. 42908/98, 44038/98, 44816/98 and 7319/02, §§ 72-79, 9 June 2005).
