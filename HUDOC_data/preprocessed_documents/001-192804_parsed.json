After examining the evidence forming the basis for the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention, it concluded that \u201cstrong evidence that an offence had been committed\u201d had not been sufficiently established in the case before it. Next, the Constitutional Court examined whether there had been a violation of the right to liberty and security in the light of Article 15 of the Constitution. On this point, it noted firstly that in a state of emergency, the Constitution provided for the possibility of taking measures derogating from the guarantees set forth in Article 19, to the extent required by the situation. It observed, however, that if it were accepted that people could be placed in pre-trial detention without any strong evidence that they had committed an offence, the guarantees of the right to liberty and security would be meaningless. Accordingly, it held that Mr Altan\u2019s pre-trial detention was disproportionate to the strict exigencies of the situation and that his right to liberty and security, as safeguarded by Article 19 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution, had been breached.",

More generally, Article 5 is, together with Articles\u00a02, 3 and 4, in the first rank of the fundamental rights that protect the physical security of the individual, and as such its importance is paramount (see Buzadji, cited above, \u00a7 84).",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. The Court must further ascertain in this connection whether domestic law itself is in conformity with the Convention, including the general principles expressed or implied therein, notably the principle of legal certainty (see Mooren v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a011364/03, \u00a7 72, 9 July 2009, with further references).",

This consideration, set out in particular in cases concerning the right of judges to freedom of expression, is equally relevant in relation to the adoption of a measure affecting the right to liberty of a member of the judiciary. In particular, where domestic law has granted judicial protection to members of the judiciary in order to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions, it is essential that such arrangements should be properly complied with. Given the prominent place that the judiciary occupies among State organs in a democratic society and the growing importance attached to the separation of powers and to the necessity of safeguarding the independence of the judiciary (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e S\u00e1 v.\u00a0Portugal [GC], nos.\u00a055391/13 and 2 others, \u00a7 196, 6 November 2018), the Court must be particularly attentive to the protection of members of the judiciary when reviewing the manner in which a detention order was implemented from the standpoint of the provisions of the Convention.",

In fact, the latter offence was not taken into consideration by the magistrate who subsequently questioned the applicant and ordered his pre-trial detention (see paragraphs\u00a019-20 above). The applicant was therefore deprived of his liberty primarily on suspicion of membership of FET\u00d6/PDY, a structure considered by the investigating authorities and the Turkish courts to be an armed terrorist organisation that had premeditated the coup attempt. The Constitutional Court found that those aspects constituted the factual and legal basis for the finding by the investigating authorities that there had been a case of discovery in flagrante delicto.

Its purpose is to ensure that the judicial system in general and its members in particular are not subjected, while discharging their judicial functions, to unlawful restrictions by bodies outside the judiciary, or even by judges performing a supervisory or review function. In this connection, it is important to note that Turkish legislation does not prohibit the detention of a member of the Constitutional Court, provided that the safeguards enshrined in the Constitution and Law no.\u00a06216 are observed.

It should be noted that during the state of emergency, the Council of Ministers, chaired by the President and acting in accordance with Article\u00a0121 of the Constitution, passed thirty-seven legislative decrees (nos.\u00a0667-703). The decrees did indeed place significant restrictions on the procedural safeguards laid down in domestic law for anyone held in police custody or pre-trial detention (for example, extension of the police custody period, and restrictions on access to case files and on the examination of objections against detention orders; see paragraph 13 above). However, in the present case the applicant was taken into police custody and subsequently into pre-trial detention mainly on suspicion of membership of an armed terrorist organisation, an offence punishable under Article\u00a0314 of the Criminal Code. It should be noted in particular that the legislation applicable in his case, namely Article 100 of the CCP and the provisions governing the status of judges at the Constitutional Court, was not amended during the state of emergency.

Admittedly, the magistrate sought to justify his decision by referring to Article 100 of the CCP and to the evidence in the file. However, he simply cited the wording of the provision in question and listed the material in the file (namely the evidence as it stood, the records included in the file, the decisions of 17 July 2016 by the presidents\u2019 offices at the Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court, the reports on searches and seizures and the entire contents of the case file), without taking the trouble to specify the individual items in question, even though they concerned not only the applicant but also thirteen other suspects.

It held, in particular, that the guarantees of the right to liberty and security would be meaningless if it were accepted that people could be placed in pre-trial detention without any strong evidence that they had committed an offence (see paragraph\u00a064 above). This conclusion is also valid for the Court\u2019s examination (see Mehmet Hasan Altan, cited above, \u00a7 140).",

Indeed, this consideration played a significant role in the Court\u2019s analysis above (see paragraphs 134-36 and 140 above). This does not mean, however, that the authorities have carte blanche under Article\u00a05 to order the detention of an individual during the state of emergency without any verifiable evidence or information or without a sufficient factual basis satisfying the minimum requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) regarding the reasonableness of a suspicion. After all, the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the suspicion on which deprivation of liberty must be based forms an essential part of the safeguard laid down in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) (see, mutatis mutandis, O\u2019Hara, cited above, \u00a7 34).",

That being so, the suspicion against him at that time did not reach the required minimum level of reasonableness. Although it was imposed under judicial supervision, the detention order was based on a mere suspicion of membership of a criminal organisation. Such a degree of suspicion cannot be sufficient to justify an order for a person\u2019s detention. In these circumstances, the measure in issue cannot be said to have been strictly required by the exigencies of the situation. To conclude otherwise would negate the minimum requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) regarding the reasonableness of a suspicion justifying deprivation of liberty and would defeat the purpose of Article 5 of the Convention.",
