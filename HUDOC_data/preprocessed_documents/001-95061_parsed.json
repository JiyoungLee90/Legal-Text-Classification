Moreover, on 26\u00a0June 2003 the applicant altered his claims so significantly that, in the Government's opinion, the proceedings could be regarded as having commenced anew, and therefore the period to be taken into account should start on this date. The Government also pointed out that on several occasions court hearings had been postponed due to the defendants' failure to appear, for which the State was not responsible. The Government further conceded that a period of inactivity between 13 October 2003 and 22\u00a0December 2005, totalling one year, eight months and twenty-six days, could be imputed to the authorities; however, they gave objective reasons for this, namely judges' sickness, annual leave, dismissal from service and their exceptional caseload.

As regards the Government's argument that the case was complicated by the fact that the applicant repeatedly altered his claims, it was only on two occasions, and namely on 26 June 2003, when the applicant modified his claims, and on 4 October 2005, when the applicant requested additional time for submission of evidence, that the court postponed the hearings because of the applicant. The Court reiterates in this respect that the applicant cannot be blamed for taking full advantage of the resources afforded by national law in the defence of his interest (see, for instance, Kutsenko v. Russia, no. 12049/02, \u00a7 50, 1 June 2006).",

As it has been noted above, during this period a court hearing was postponed twice due to the applicant's conduct. The aggregate delay totalled to approximately five months. As regards the conduct of the authorities, the Court notes that out of ten hearings fixed during the aforementioned period, six hearings were postponed because the judges to whom the applicant's case was assigned were unavailable for various reasons (see paragraphs 13, 15 and 16 above), which protracted the proceeding for overall period of approximately one year and nine months. The Court finds that this period of inactivity is imputable to the State, as it is the States' duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v. Austria, no. 30546/96, \u00a7 21, 3 October 2000).",
