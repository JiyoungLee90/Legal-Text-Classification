In addition, the expert had exceeded his duties by expressing a view on questions of fact and of law instead of merely carrying out a chemical analysis. Consequently, the defence requested further investigative measures, namely the drawing of new samples from the two tanks which had been seized, the taking of evidence from several other experts, including Mr Niessner, and the consultation of the minutes of the quality control panel. The defence also alleged that the rules laid down for a tasting had not been complied with. Again, the court-appointed expert had not explained the differences between the conclusions of the two institutes. He had merely expressed his view that those of the Food Institute were erroneous and that those of his own Institute were correct.",

The Court notes, moreover, that it does not appear from the file that the defence raised any objection, either at the first hearing of 4 October 1983 when the District Court appointed Mr Bandion, or at the second hearing of 22 November 1983 when Mr Bandion made an oral statement and was asked to draw up a report; it was not until 14 February 1984, after Mr Bandion had filed his report, which was unfavourable to Mr Brandstetter, that the latter\u2019s lawyer criticized the expert for his close links with the Agricultural Institute (see paragraphs 14-17 above).",

Nor does the file disclose other grounds for so considering him.

Taking them as its starting point, the defence followed the line of reasoning that (1) it could be proved that the seals on the bottles containing the counter-samples were untouched when Mr Niessner started their analysis; (2) accordingly, the counter-samples could not have been tampered with; and (3) it followed that Mr Niessner had analysed the same wine as the Agricultural Institute and that the analyses of that Institute must have been wrong. In order to prove these allegations the defence requested that Mr Niessner should be heard, both as a witness and as an expert (paragraph 26 above).",

They suggest that this practice must have been known to the applicant\u2019s lawyer who, accordingly, could have enquired whether in the applicant\u2019s case a croquis had been filed. If so, he could have requested leave to inspect the file under section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and thus could have commented on it.
