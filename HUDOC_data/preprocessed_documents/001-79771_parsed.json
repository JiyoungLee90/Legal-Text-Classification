A firefighter had testified that the power of the fire brigade's hoses might possibly have altered the shotguns' position. In any event, the court found that the position of the shotguns was not decisive. What was decisive was the fact that J. had brought the guns when making his way out and that A. and L. had been convinced that the guns were pointing towards them. The court also attributed importance to the fact that J. had crawled out through the door although he could have opened it and walked out. The manner of exit strongly suggested that he had not planned on surrendering. On the contrary, the court drew the conclusion that J. had tried to exit the building undetected with a view to breaking through the cordon and escaping into the dark woods. As to whether any blame could be attributed to A. and L. for not waiting one or two seconds before shooting in order to be able to target the lower part of his body, the court observed that the forensic examination and a reconstruction of the events had disclosed that A.'s sector of fire had ended one metre to the left of the doorway and the sector available to L. had ended 0.2 metres to the left of the doorway. Having regard to the narrowness of the sectors of fire and the inside of the armoured vehicle and the fact that J. could have disappeared from their sectors of fire at any moment, the court concluded that A. and L. had fired their guns in self-defence.",

He had previously been involved in a siege situation and in other violent crimes. He was known to have acted violently towards the police and even towards members of his own family, having shot at his own brother previously, and was also known to have had mental health problems. In addition, the circumstances at the scene were extremely difficult due to the weather and other conditions. The applicable law was in conformity with Article 2 of the Convention. The police could interfere with a person's constitutional rights only if it was permitted by law. In the present case, as noted by the domestic courts, the police officers in question had had justifiable reasons for believing that J. had made an illegal threat and committed an assault and possibly a robbery. In addition, J. had been proven to be dangerous to the public at large and especially to those present at the scene. This entitled the police to apprehend him and take him into custody. The Government made reference to Andronicou and Constantinou v. Cyprus (judgment of 9 October 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VI, p. 2107, \u00a7 192) and McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no.\u00a0324, p. 58, \u00a7 200), in which the Court had stated that the use of force may be justified where it is based on an honest belief which is perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time but which subsequently turns out to be mistaken. In the present case the situation during the operation fulfilled the requirements of Article 2 \u00a7 2 (a) and (b). The police officers had been trying to effect a lawful arrest while protecting themselves, the other persons at the scene and the residents of the island. As concluded during the pre-trial investigation and the consideration of the charges and also during the proceedings before the domestic courts, had J. been allowed to escape armed, the lives of even more people would have been in danger. Therefore, the perception of the situation and the actions taken in the present case had not been proved to be mistaken.",

Further, the recording also revealed that when the commander of the Special Task Force, Superintendent H., had ordered that J. be shot immediately in the legs, Senior Constables A. and L. had just fired their shotguns, hitting J. in the head with 9 x 9 millimetre lead shots. The order to shoot him in the legs had been valid only in the event of his trying to break through the cordon situated fifteen metres from the house.

The negotiator could hardly be called a professional and J.'s brother and police officer S.K., who were familiar to J., had been denied the chance to speak to him when they arrived at the scene. The police had failed to search the house and to use the police dog. The closing of the telephone lines could hardly be characterised as giving J. a night's rest. Public order and safety had not been jeopardised because all the residents of the island and other people on the island apart from the authorities had been evacuated.

J., already injured, had been crawling out of the burning house in order to save himself at the last minute. He could easily have been apprehended if that was what the police had wanted to do.

The operation had begun following an emergency call and when more details about the situation had emerged, it had been scaled up into a major operation. It had been planned and directed by high-ranking and experienced police officers who had been at the scene from an early stage. Those in charge at the scene had kept the line of action under constant review in the light of the changes in the situation and circumstances. All the action had been based on official action plans and guidelines prepared for special operations such as the one in question. Practical training based on those action plans had been carried out on several occasions, the most recent night-time practice operation having taken place only two months prior to the operation in question. At the scene there had been several highly experienced specialists in different fields, including specially trained police personnel and negotiators. The Supreme and Provincial Police Commands had been kept constantly informed of the details of the situation and its seriousness. After the second night of the siege the Provincial Police Command had been present and monitored the operation at the scene. Further assistance had been requested and received from the coast guard, the border guard and the defence forces, in the form of vehicles and other equipment. The Government made reference to Andronicou and Constantinou v. Cyprus (cited above, \u00a7 183), in which the Court had found no violation although the operation had displayed some shortcomings, such as lack of crowd control and lack of a dedicated telephone line between the negotiator and the perpetrator.",

In the present case, there existed pre-approved plans of action for the operation, regulations on the use of firearms, an established chain of command and a clear operational structure. All the actions had been authorised by senior officers. No rank-and-file police officers had acted on their own, nor had any unnecessary force been used despite J.'s continuous actions and threats aimed at those present at the scene. Over a period of two nights and two days, the use of force by the police had been limited to three shots aimed at J., all of which had been fired during the last hour of the siege. One shot had been aimed at J.'s foot and the other two shots had been fired in the final moments of the siege when he had been leaving the building with two long-barrelled guns in his hands.

J. had ignored previous warnings to give himself up and, in defiance of these warnings, he had fired numerous shots in the air and at the police officers. He conveyed on occasions a clear impression that he would continue to use his gun. It is to be noted that the earlier warnings for him to surrender went unheeded. Further, it is to be noted that it was not the intention of Senior Constables A. and L. to kill J., but to immobilise him by wounding him.

Following the ordering of the use of tear gas to break J.'s resistance on the second day and the removal of the windows and the curtains, it would appear that later in the afternoon the police were unwilling to take any further action, but tried to defuse the situation without recourse to lethal force or to tactics which might provoke a violent response from J. The fact that J. set the house on fire exacerbated the situation. This could not have been foreseen. He was seen walking around inside the house carrying a rucksack and breaking furniture in an uncontrolled manner. While it is true that the police shot at J. inside the house with the intention of injuring him, they did so in order to induce him to exit the burning house and surrender so that he could be apprehended.",

Despite this, it was possible to collect details of the bullet holes in and around the building. The investigation, which started immediately after the siege, was carried out by the National Bureau of Investigation which specialises in the investigation of serious crime. There is no indication that the investigators were not independent from those taking part in the police operation. While it is true that on 2 February 1995 the National Bureau of Investigation issued a press release stating that there were grounds for investigating whether the suspect had committed suicide, the Court notes that about a week later, on 8 February 1995, the National Bureau of Investigation, having received the report concerning the cause of death, began to investigate whether anyone involved in the siege had acted in an unlawful manner. The decisions made and the actions taken during the operation were also studied by a permanent investigation team set up by the Ministry of the Interior, which reviewed the operation in question hour by hour. The report was finalised within one year of the operation.",

As for the complainants' investigation requests which were turned down and their criticism of the conduct of the investigation, the Court would note that whilst it is of the utmost importance that a complete and accurate picture emerges of the events leading up to a killing by State agents, the evidence to be gathered to that end must be filtered in accordance with its relevance. What is important for the Court is the fact that the family had at its disposal as much information as was commensurate with the defence of its interests in the national proceedings, namely clarifying the facts surrounding the death of J. and securing the accountability of the police officers involved for any alleged acts and omissions.",
