Finally, the Court agrees that\u00a0some delays in the procedure before the Supreme Court could be explained by the fact that, during the material time the Supreme Court had to deal with an increased workload and that subsequently the authorities had taken remedial actions (see, Kepa v. Poland (dec), no. 43978/98, 30 September 2003).
