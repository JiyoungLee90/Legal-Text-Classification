The Government further submitted that both camouflage uniform and weapons could easily have been available to paramilitary groups in . They referred to a number of domestic decisions in respect of members of illegal armed groups who had committed crimes dressed in camouflage uniform and had identity documents of law-enforcement or other State authorities. The Government further noted that, as had been established by the domestic investigation, Mr Anzor Sambiyev had been a member of an illegal armed group. They alleged that he could have been killed by other members of the illegal armed group so as to prevent a possible information leak or by other persons on account of a feud for instance. The Government also claimed that the domestic investigation had met the Convention requirement of effectiveness, as evidenced by the questioning of witnesses by the investigating authorities and requests sent by them to other State agencies.",

In particular, on 15 July 2004 the Grozny District Prosecutor's Office issued the applicants with a certificate stating that on 10 April 2004 a group of persons wearing camouflage and masks armed with automatic weapons and accompanied by two APCs and two \u201cUral\u201d vehicles abducted Mr Anzor Sambiyev. However, the investigating authorities failed to establish the identity of Mr Anzor Sambiyev's abductors. In the Court's view, the information obtained by the investigation to the effect that no special operations had been conducted in Stariye Atagi on the dates in question is not sufficient to refute the allegations that these were servicemen. The supposition that, being a member of an illegal armed group, he could have been abducted by other members or by unrelated persons, is likewise too vague to disprove them.",

Furthermore, it could only be detrimental to the prospects of establishing the circumstances of the case and ensuring the accountability of those responsible. The Court further notes that it has no information about any efforts to trace the APCs and the Ural vehicles after they had left Stariye Atagi. The Court considers that the above failures of the investigating authorities constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",

However, in the letter of 26 November 2005 the Grozny District Prosecutor's Office invited the first applicant to study the case file. From the text of the letter it appears that the invitation was contained in previous correspondence as well.

However, they still failed to investigate the applicants' allegations properly. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy relied on by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities' conduct (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0358, and Imakayeva v. , no.\u00a07615/02, \u00a7\u00a0164, ECHR 2006...
