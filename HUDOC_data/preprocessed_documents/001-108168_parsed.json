It was not a case which turned on a contest between the evidence of the police and that of the appellant, and it would have been hard to suggest that the case was one in which unconscious prejudice, even if present, would have been likely to operate to the disadvantage of the appellant, and it makes no difference that the officer was the foreman of the jury. In the event, confronted with this question at very short notice, defence counsel raised no objection. I conclude, not without unease, that having regard to the parliamentary enactment the Court of Appeal reached the right conclusion in this case, and I would dismiss the appeal.\u201d",

In this context the instinct (however unconscious) of a police officer on the jury to prefer the evidence of a brother officer to that of a drug-addicted defendant would be judged by the fair-minded and informed observer to be a real and possible source of unfairness, beyond the reach of standard judicial warnings and directions. The second appellant was not tried by a tribunal which was and appeared to be impartial.

He will reflect that, up and down the land, day in day out, we take risks when we hand the critical decisions on guilt or innocence to juries. We take the risk that, consciously or subconsciously, men on juries may be unduly sympathetic to a man charged with rape who claims that he and the woman just got carried away by their physical urges. We take the risk that, consciously or subconsciously, a juror who has herself been the victim of sexual abuse may tend to side with the woman who claims that she was sexually assaulted by the defendant. We take the risk that, consciously or subconsciously, a gay juror may tend to believe the gay man who says that he was assaulted by the defendant in a homophobic attack. We take the risk that, consciously or subconsciously, a homophobic juror may just reject the gay man\u2019s evidence. We take the risk that, consciously or subconsciously, a juror who is an undergraduate may sympathise with a victim who is an undergraduate at the same university. We take the risk that, consciously or subconsciously, a black juror may tend to believe the evidence of a black witness as opposed to the account given by an Asian defendant. We take the risk that, consciously or subconsciously, a juror who was convicted of drug dealing and was sentenced to four years in prison in the early 1990s may sympathise with a defendant accused of supplying drugs. Having reflected on these and similar situations, the observer will realise that, in effect, Parliament has now added two to the long list of situations where there is indeed a risk, where it is indeed possible, that, consciously or subconsciously, a juror may be partial. But he will also realise that Parliament must have considered that in these two situations, like so many others, the risk is manageable within the system of jury trial as we know it.\u201d",

It would, after all, be wrong to pretend that in these various situations there is not a real, as opposed to a fanciful, possibility that the jurors in question may be biased. For instance, there is plainly a real possibility, in the sense of it being something that could well happen, that a homophobic juror may just reject the gay man\u2019s evidence. But the law regards that risk as being manageable and, so, acceptable. The law caters for the risk. It takes steps to minimise it by making jurors take an oath or affirm that they will \u2018faithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence\u2019. It makes them sit and listen to the evidence in a solemn setting. It requires the judge to give them a direction that they must assess the evidence impartially. Of course, it would be na\u00efve to suppose that these safeguards will always work with every juror. The law is not na\u00efve: it stipulates that there should be 12 men and women on a jury. The assumption is that, among them, the twelve will be able to neutralise any bias on the part of one or more members and so reach an impartial verdict \u2013 by a majority, if necessary. If any of the jurors consider that the jury will be unable to do so, then they must tell the judge, who can then deal with the matter \u2013 by discharging the jury, if necessary. So the mere fact that there is a real possibility that a juror may be biased does not mean that there is a real possibility that the jury will be incapable of returning an impartial verdict.\u201d",

No important issue turned on a conflict between police and defence evidence and there was no closer link between the police witnesses and the police juror than that they all served in the Metropolitan Police. It would be possible, perhaps, to conclude that Parliament had intended that no police officer should serve on a jury involving police witnesses from the same police force as that in which he served. Given the independence of each police force, that would have the attraction of consistency with the approach adopted earlier in relation to the CPS and other prosecuting bodies. With some hesitation, however, but because of the greater distance between the police and the prosecution process, I feel able to agree with my noble and learned friend, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, that there is not sufficient to raise the appearance of bias in this case.

Although it might have been preferable for the judge to have asked more questions of the juror, it seems to us that we should accept the answer as conveyed to the judge that the juror knew nothing about the case, and by that we mean in his professional position. If he had inside information about the case or the background to the case as a result of his position as a police officer in Wembley, we take the view that he would have told the court official. Likewise the judge made it clear in his summing up that the jury had to decide the case on the evidence and we imagine he had said that on other occasions. If the juror was aware of information which did not form part of the evidence in the case then it seems likely to us that he would have publicly made that clear. Unlike in the , jurors are only rarely questioned in this country. Jurors are often told the names of witnesses in case they know them and are usually questioned before being empanelled on long complex trials, such as terrorism and fraud cases, but not otherwise. The system here proceeds on the assumption that a juror will reveal any difficulties that he or she may have in impartially approaching the case being tried and that other jurors will play a role in ensuring impartiality. No appeal would succeed on the speculative basis that a juror may have been partial towards a witness. We see no need for any further enquiries to be made.\u201d",

Lord Mance did not regard such a significant conflict of evidence as an automatic ground for disqualification and in this respect, he may be seen as having been in a majority with Lord Roger of Earlsferry and Lord Carswell who dissented in the result.\u201d",

We have studied the transcript. He asked defence counsel whether there was any \u2018attack on police officers\u2019 so as to enable him to decide whether to \u2018enquire whether any of the jury members are serving officers or part of the prosecution services\u2019. Counsel responded that there might well be criticism of the police and that it might be advisable to avoid any potential risks, and so the necessary enquiries should be made. Counsel accepted, however, that there would be no direct attack on any individual police officer, although he later said that there would be suggestions that police officers were \u2018incorrect factually or otherwise\u2019. He then added that there would be observations that he would make towards the end of the case which would not fall \u2018particularly kindly on police ears\u2019. In answer to a further direct question by the Common Serjeant, counsel confirmed that there was \u2018certainly not going to be any accusation of deliberate fabrication\u2019. That response led the Common Serjeant to observe that this represented the dividing line on the issue. As we have indicated, counsel\u2019s answer at this stage was unfortunate. The reality was that, however uncomfortable it might be forensically, it was, as we look at the case now with the benefit of hindsight, inevitable that at least one of the officers would have to be addressed directly on the basis that his evidence was not true.",

Second, before commencing service, he was required to swear an oath or to make a solemn affirmation that he would faithfully try the case and give a true verdict according to the evidence (see paragraph 86 above). Third, he and his fellow jurors would have been advised, in accordance with the standard jury guidance, to bring any concerns to the attention of the trial judge and not to discuss the case with anyone outside the jury (see paragraphs 87-88 above). Fourth, in line with normal practice, A.T. would have received directions from the trial judge as to how to approach the case and the evidence presented (see Pullar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040).\u00a0 Fifth, A.T. drew to the attention of the trial judge the fact that he was a police officer and knew M.B. and the trial judge arranged for A.T. to be questioned, allowing more detailed information as to his acquaintance with M.B. and his knowledge of the applicants to be ascertained (see paragraph 12 above). Thus far, the safeguards operated in the manner intended to guarantee the applicants\u2019 right to a fair trial. The effectiveness of such safeguards can be seen in cases such as Gregory and Pullar, both cited above. The question in the present case is whether these safeguards were sufficient to exclude objectively justified concerns regarding the jury\u2019s impartiality arising from the continued presence of A.T. on the jury.",

Indeed, of the jurisdictions surveyed, only in New York and Belgium are police officers permitted to serve on juries (see paragraphs 103 and 121 above), and it is to be recalled that in both jurisdictions, unlike in England, peremptory challenges are permitted (see paragraphs 104 and 122 above). Significantly, within the United Kingdom, the Scottish Government, following a consultation exercise conducted after the changes in England and  had entered into force, decided against making any change to the Scottish legislation which precludes police officers from serving (see paragraph 94 above). In , as recently as 1996 it was decided to exclude police officers from jury service (see paragraph 95 above) and that remains the position today. The Court further observes that the question of participation of police officers on juries has been examined in detail by several law reform commissions since the introduction of the amended legislation in  and Wales (see paragraphs 97-100, 110-117 and 124-125 above). Both the Irish and New South Wales commissions pointed to the high number of civil trials in  compared to their respective countries, where a greater proportion of trials were of criminal matters (see paragraphs 98 and 110 above). The Law Reform Commission of Western Australia highlighted the rigorous jury vetting practices in place in the United States, which did not exist in England or in  (see paragraph 112 above). Other reports commented on studies demonstrating the existence of a police culture of group loyalty and a tendency to assume guilt and on the problems encountered in  since the amendment of the 1974 Act (see paragraphs 99, 112, and 115-116 above). None of the commissions recommended allowing police officers to serve as jurors (see paragraphs 100, 108, 111, 115, 117 and 125 above).",

In the present case, A.T. had known M.B. for ten years and although not from the same station, had on three occasions worked with him in the investigation of the same incident (see paragraph 12 above). Further, the other witnesses who supported M.B.\u2019s account of events were also police officers (see paragraph 11 above). The Court recalls the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the first applicant\u2019s defence witness was not a witness of good character and that his explanation for the records of the use of his mobile phone and the discovery of heroin in his car \u201cbordered on the farcical\u201d (see paragraph 25 above). However, it is not for this Court to make its own assessment of the evidence presented at trial and, in particular, of the first applicant\u2019s explanation for the evidence against him. Such assessment was for the members of the jury, who were required pursuant to Article 6 to be impartial.",
