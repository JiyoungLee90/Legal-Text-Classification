Statements alleging that a person has broken the law, committed a dishonest act, behaved unethically or broken the rules of business etiquette tarnish that person\u2019s honour, dignity and business reputation (section 7). Resolution no.\u00a03 requires courts hearing defamation claims to distinguish between statements of fact, which can be checked for truthfulness, and value judgments, opinions and convictions, which are not actionable under Article 152 of the Civil Code since they are an expression of a defendant\u2019s subjective opinion and views and cannot be checked for truthfulness (section 9).",

Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case. In other words, the absence of any \u201csignificant disadvantage\u201d can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant. However, the applicant\u2019s subjective perception cannot alone suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, with further references, C.P. v. the United Kingdom (dec.) no. 300/11, \u00a7 42, 6\u00a0September 2016). A violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest (see Korolev v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a025551/05, ECHR\u00a02010-V).",

As for the legitimate aim sought, the Government have referred to \u201cthe protection of the reputation and rights of Moscow City Council\u201d (see paragraph 24 above). The Court points out in this connection that the issue of whether a legal entity could enjoy the right to reputation (including the scope of such right) is debatable (for details see Frisk and Jensen v. Denmark, no. 19657/12, \u00a7\u00a7 42-50, 5 December 2017). Be that as it may, in the instant case, it is prepared to assume that this aim can be relied on. At the same time the Court considers it appropriate to emphasise that there is a difference between the reputational interests of a legal entity and the reputation of an individual as a member of society. Whereas the latter may have repercussions on one\u2019s dignity, the former are devoid of that moral dimension (see, mutatis mutandis, Uj v. Hungary, no.\u00a023954/10, \u00a7 22, 19 July 2011). This difference is even more salient when it is a public authority that invokes its right to reputation. In view of that, a mere institutional interest of the Moscow City Council in protecting its \u201creputation\u201d does not necessarily attract the same level of guarantees as that accorded to \u201cthe protection of the reputation ... of others\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kharlamov v.

Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, \u00a7 132, ECHR 2015), Article 10 of the Convention affords journalists protection, subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism (see Pentik\u00e4inen v.\u00a0Finland [GC], no. 11882/10, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2015). The same considerations would apply to an NGO assuming a social watchdog function (see Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g, cited above, \u00a7 159). A high level of protection of freedom of expression, with the authorities therefore having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation, is normally accorded where the remarks concern a matter of public interest (see B\u00e9dat v. Switzerland [GC], no.\u00a056925/08, \u00a7 49, 29 March 2016). Politicians and civil servants acting in an official capacity are subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals (see Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, \u00a7\u00a047, ECHR\u00a02001III, and Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7\u00a080, ECHR 2004XI). A careful distinction needs to be drawn between facts and value judgments. The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, \u00a7 98, ECHR\u00a02004XI, and Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7 126, ECHR 2015). When examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of \u201cprotecting the reputation ... of others\u201d, domestic authorities must strike a fair balance when protecting two conflicting values that are guaranteed by the Convention, namely, on the one hand, the right to freedom of expression protected by Article 10 and, on the other, the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8 (see, among many other authorities, Med\u017elis Islamske Zajednice Br\u010dko and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], no.\u00a017224/11, \u00a7 77, 27 June 2017). When analysing an interference with the right to freedom of expression, the Court must, inter alia, determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that these authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 and relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Perin\u00e7ek v. Switzerland [GC], no.\u00a027510/08, \u00a7 196, ECHR 2015 (extracts)).",

The Court reiterates that limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to a public authority than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of a body vested with executive powers must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion (see, mutatis mutandis, \u015eener v. Turkey, no. 26680/95, \u00a7\u00a040, 18 July 2000, and Lombardo and Others, cited above, \u00a7 54). As the executive authority of a federal constituent entity, Moscow City Council should be expected to display a high degree of tolerance to criticism. Nevertheless, not only did the domestic courts fail to consider the position of the claimant as a public authority in the context of the defamation proceedings against the newspaper\u2019s editorial board, they expressly rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that Moscow City Council had not even been named in the impugned statements (see paragraph 12 above). The Court points out in this connection that for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the party suing in defamation is a requisite element (see, mutatis mutandis, Dyundin v. Russia, no. 37406/03, \u00a7\u00a044, 14 October 2008, and Kunitsyna, cited above, \u00a7 42). The District Court\u2019s reasoning, endorsed by the City Court, appears to be based on the tacit assumption that interests relating to the protection of reputation prevail over freedom of expression in all circumstances (see Novaya Gazeta and Milashina, cited above, \u00a7 69). By failing to weigh the two competing interests against each other, the domestic courts failed to perform the requisite balancing exercise (see Skudayeva, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

Indeed, if the balancing exercise had been carried out by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for theirs (see Perin\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0198). However, in the absence of such a balancing exercise at national level, it is not incumbent on the Court to perform a full proportionality analysis. Faced with the domestic courts\u2019 failure to provide relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the interference in question, the Court finds that they cannot be said to have \u201capplied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 of the Convention\u201d or to have \u201cbased themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts\u201d (see, with further references, Terentyev, cited above, \u00a7 24). The Court concludes that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression was not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",
