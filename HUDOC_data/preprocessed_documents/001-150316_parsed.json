They claimed that the police officers had lawfully used physical force against the applicant and handcuffed him because he had resisted arrest and kicked the officers in the abdomen and the face. The injuries had been caused by the fact that the applicant had voluntarily run at the glass doors of the cupboard. After the cupboard had fallen on him he had been brought to hospital and diagnosed with a cerebral injury. Later, at the remand prison, he had also been diagnosed with bruises to his face and head. A pre-investigation inquiry into the allegations of ill-treatment had been carried out. It had been established that the officers of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Department of the Federal Drug Control Service had used legitimate and necessary force against the applicant to overcome his active resistance to arrest, and that shortly after that the applicant himself had run at the cupboard. The forensic expert examination had concluded that the bruises and injuries to the applicant\u2019s face, head and waist could have resulted either from a blow with a blunt hard object or from falling on and hitting such an object. The diagnosis of cerebral injury had not been confirmed. The applicant\u2019s injuries had not amounted to \u201cdamage to health\u201d.
