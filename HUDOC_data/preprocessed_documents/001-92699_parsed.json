The Regional Court\u2019s conclusion that the applicant might abscond, reoffend or interfere with the proceedings had not been supported by relevant facts or evidence. The  had disregarded such pertinent facts as the applicant\u2019s positive references, permanent residence and employment and her family situation. It had failed to take into account the recent death of her brother, which mitigated the risk of her absconding as in such circumstances she naturally wished to be with her family. As the investigation had been completed and the witnesses questioned, the risk of interfering with the proceedings was also negligible. The results of the drug test were irrelevant for the assessment of the risk of reoffending, as the test had been performed immediately after the arrest, that is more than a year before, and the applicant had never been medically certified as being a drug addict. The Supreme Court further referred to the applicant\u2019s frail health and \u201cher well-founded complaints about the inhuman conditions of her detention, which caused her humiliation and imperilled her health\u201d. Finally, it found fault with the  for its failure to consider the possibility of applying a more lenient preventive measure, although the applicant had asked to be released on bail.",

They further referred to the judgment of the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court of Orel of 2 June 2004, awarding Mr R. RUB 30,000 as compensation for unlawful detention lasting fifty-six days, for four of which he had been without food. Mr S. had been awarded RUB 3,000 for the inadequate conditions of his detention by the judgment of the Supreme Court of the  of 14 March 2006. It had been also open for the applicant to complain to a prosecutor, such complaint being, in the Government\u2019s opinion, an effective remedy.

They stated that 13% of complaints about the allegedly inadequate conditions of detention had been considered well-founded in 2007, while in the first half of 2006 the prosecutors had recognised 18% of such complaints as well-founded.",

The number of inmates per cell had been greater than that suggested by the Government and she had not always had a bed to herself. She drew the Court\u2019s attention to the fact that the Government had submitted extracts from the registration logs showing the number of detainees on certain dates only, and claimed that the Government had deliberately chosen days when her cell had not been overcrowded, and omitted those when it had been filled beyond its design capacity. Given that the other cells in the detention facility had been severely and routinely overpopulated, as the Government had admitted, it was implausible that her cell had never been affected by that problem. The applicant also challenged the Government\u2019s description of sanitary conditions as factually untrue. Her cells had been dim, cold, stuffy and smelly. Toilet facilities had offered no privacy. The artificial light had never been turned off, disturbing the applicant\u2019s sleep. Although the Government denied the presence of insects, it transpired from the certificate of 10\u00a0April 2008 issued by the detention facility administration that the cells had been regularly cleansed to reduce the number of rodents and insects (see paragraph 35 above). The use of the word \u201creduce\u201d implied, in the applicant\u2019s opinion, that the cells had been infested with parasites and that the disinfection carried out by the facility administration had been unsuccessful, as the population of parasites had been thereby reduced rather than exterminated. The applicant further stated that there had been no real opportunity for outdoor exercise because the exercise yards had been overcrowded and also covered with metal bars that severely limited access to fresh air. In support of her submissions the applicant produced a statement by Ms\u00a0B. who had been detained in cell no.\u00a032 of the same facility from 15\u00a0January to 6 June 2007, and a statement by Ms K. who had been held in a neighbouring cell.",

Those statements were supported by extracts from the registration logs showing the number of detainees in the cells (see paragraph 32 above). The Court however notes that the Government preferred to submit the extracts for certain dates only and finds such incomplete and selective evidence unconvincing. It observes that the Government did not refer to any source of information on the basis of which they had made the assertion that the applicant\u2019s cells had never accommodated more than eight persons and did not submit documents on the basis of which that assertion could be verified. The directors\u2019 certificates and extracts from the logs are therefore of little evidential value for the Court (see, for similar reasoning, Sudarkov v. , no. 3130/03, \u00a7 43, 10\u00a0July 2008).

She was moreover afforded less than three square metres of personal space and on occasions her personal space was reduced to less than two square metres. Even when the cell was filled below its design capacity and accommodated seven or eight inmates, such occurrences being undisputed by the Government, the applicant was afforded three square metres or less of personal space. The applicant was confined to her cell day and night, save for one hour of daily outdoor exercise. The Court reiterates in this connection that in previous cases where the applicants had at their disposal less than three square metres of personal space, it found that the overcrowding was so severe as to justify in its own right a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.

Until his conviction, the accused must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continued detention ceases to be reasonable. A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons to justify the continued detention (see, among other authorities, Castravet v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a023393/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030 and 32, 13\u00a0March 2007; McKay\u00a0v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a0543/03, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2006-...; Jab\u0142o\u0144ski\u00a0v.

Although the applicant\u2019s refusal to name her accomplices cannot serve as a justification for her detention, as she was not obliged to cooperate with the authorities and she cannot be blamed for having taken full advantage of her right to silence (see Mamedova, cited above, \u00a7 83, and, mutadis mutandis, Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v. Turkey, 8 June 1995, \u00a7 66, Series A no. 319A, and W. v. Switzerland, 26 January 1993, \u00a7\u00a042, Series A no. 254A), the Court accepts that the authorities could justifiably consider that the risk of interference with the investigation was initially present, taking into account that the applicant was suspected of being the leader of an organised criminal group. In cases concerning organised crime the risk that a detainee if released might put pressure on witnesses or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings is often particularly high. These factors can justify a relatively longer period of detention. However, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure (see Osuch v. Poland, no.\u00a031246/02, \u00a7\u00a026, 14 November 2006; and Celejewski v. Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 4\u00a0May 2006). The Court is convinced that in the particular circumstances of the present case the applicant\u2019s presumed leadership of an organised criminal group may be regarded as a sufficient ground to justify her detention while the investigation was pending. The investigation was conducted with due expedition and completed within a year, which does not appear excessive having regard to the relative complexity of the case, the number of defendants, and the need to obtain a considerable amount of evidence. However, after the evidence had been collected, the witnesses interviewed and the investigation completed, the reference to the risk of interfering with the proceedings became less relevant. In the Court\u2019s opinion, after the completion of the investigation in September 2007 it was no longer sufficient to outweigh, on its own, the applicant\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

It therefore concludes that the domestic courts did not point to any aspects of the applicant\u2019s character or behaviour that would justify their conclusion that she presented a persistent risk of fleeing from justice or reoffending.

This Convention provision proclaims not only the right to \u201ctrial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial\u201d but also lays down that \u201crelease may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial\u201d (see Sulaoja v.\u00a0Estonia, no. 55939/00, \u00a7 64 in fine, 15 February 2005, and Jab\u0142o\u0144ski, cited above, \u00a7 83). The Court considers that after the investigation had been completed the domestic authorities should have discussed with particular attention the possibility of bail as a guarantee against absconding. However, they had not considered such a possibility until May 2008, that is about eight months after the termination of the investigation, although the applicant had offered to post bail many times.",
