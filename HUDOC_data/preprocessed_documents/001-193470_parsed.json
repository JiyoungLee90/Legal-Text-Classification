From 21 January 2010 the Code had provided for one short visit every three months both for male and female life prisoners. From 8 April 2014 the Code had provided, both for male and female life prisoners, for one short visit every month and one long visit every three months. The Government thus concluded that from 2003 until 2014 all life prisoners, irrespective of their gender, had had equal visiting rights. They further stated that even though Article 151\u00b2 of the Code specified that female prisoners were subject to a regime prescribed for prisoners held in medium-security colonies, both male and female life prisoners were entitled to have visits on an equal basis, as life prisoners did not have the rights provided for other categories of convicts.

Even though Article 151 of the Code had set equal rights for male and female life prisoners, Articles 18 and 139 of the Code had given female life prisoners additional benefits. The resulting discrimination in visiting rights had emanated from a conflict between those legal provisions. The Government had only referred to Article 151 of the Code and had not mentioned Articles 18 and 139 of the Code. They had not proved that the difference in the security regimes for male and female life prisoners as set out in the Code had not led to a difference in their visiting rights.

Although Article 151 provided that all life prisoners were entitled to one short visit every six months, Article 139 provided that prisoners serving their sentences in medium-security colonies were entitled, inter alia, to have one long visit every three months. Article\u00a0151\u00b2, as introduced by the 2010 amendments, also provided that female life prisoners were to be subject to the regime prescribed for prisoners held in medium-security colonies (that is, the regime provided for in Article 139).
