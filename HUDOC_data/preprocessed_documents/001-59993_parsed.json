The Government further maintained that both the applicant and the plaintiff had considerably contributed to the length of the proceedings in that they had refused to settle the case, that they had challenged most of the decisions delivered in the case including those of purely procedural nature, and that they had not co-operated with the experts. As regards the behaviour of the applicant in particular, the Government pointed out that he had repeatedly requested the exclusion of the Senica District Court judges. Finally, the length of the proceedings was also caused by a reform of the judiciary in 1997 as a result of which the number of the Senica District Court judges had been reduced by half.
