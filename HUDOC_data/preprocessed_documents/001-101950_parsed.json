The applicants raised an additional ground of appeal based on the long delay by the authorities in addressing their request to receive shares in the Brewery. The applicants further averred that the original process required by section 18 of the Privatisation Act necessitated that an expert valuation be performed and that the authorities had failed to comply with the requirements of the law. Furthermore, the applicants argued that both versions of section 18 of the Privatisation Act provided for a right of appeal against the valuation used as a basis for determining the number of shares to be granted to an applicant. Lastly, the applicants claimed that neither they nor the courts had ever been presented with the full privatisation valuation of the Brewery, as the information had been classified.
