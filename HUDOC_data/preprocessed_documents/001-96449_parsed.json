This obligation is not confined to cases where it has been established that the killing was caused by an agent of the State. The mere fact that the authorities have been informed of the death will give rise ipso facto to an obligation under Article\u00a02 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances in which it occurred (see Sabuktekin v. Turkey, no.\u00a027243/95, \u00a7\u00a098, ECHR 2002II (extracts); Kavak v. Turkey, no. 53489/99, \u00a7 45, 6\u00a0July 2006; and Al Fayed v. France (dec.), no. 38501/02, 27 September 2007). The investigation must be capable of establishing the cause of the injuries and the identification of those responsible with a view to their punishment. Where death results, the investigation assumes even greater importance, having regard to the fact that the essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life (see mutatis mutandis, Paul and Audrey Edwards v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2002II).",

This suggests that the failure to initiate a criminal investigation as soon as it became clear that a hit-and-run offence resulting in the victim's death had occurred may have limited the authorities' ability to carry out all reasonable investigative measures aimed at discovering the identity of the driver responsible for the applicant's son's death.

The Court notes that B.H. told the prosecutors that his relative I. had been driving the car at the time of the accident, and identified the place where I. lived. However, it appears from the documents submitted to the Court that no attempt was made to find that person and verify his whereabouts at the time of the accident. The Court also notes that if it was considered that B.H. had been driving the car, it appears from the documents that nobody was prosecuted for letting an underage person without a driving licence drive a car. Similarly, the owner of the car at the time of the event was only questioned as a witness and was never charged with any crime, even though in the official version of events it still remains unclear who was driving the car, which belonged to R.H. at some stage. In a subsequent letter to the applicant on 10 October 2004 the Prosecutor General's Office also acknowledged deficiencies in the investigation (see paragraph 11 above).",

Moreover, following his complaints the investigation was reopened, but continued for another three years. In such circumstances, the Court considers that a challenge in court to the decision of 14\u00a0November 2001 to suspend the investigation could not offer sufficient redress since the court could only order the investigator to reopen the investigation (see, for example, Corsacov v. Moldova, no. 18944/02, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 21-32 and 34-44, 4 April 2006), which was exactly what he obtained from the Prosecutor General's Office.
