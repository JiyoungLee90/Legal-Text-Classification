According to a \u201cspecialist\u201d consulted in relation to A\u2019s medical documents, A was highly sensitive, emotionally unstable, selective in her contacts, and had a high level of anxiety.

Her father might not necessarily have been beaten up in her presence. The fact that she had been in a car for a long time was irrelevant for the stress she had suffered. Therefore, the internal investigation did not establish the FSKN officers\u2019 guilt in relation to the temporary damage to A\u2019s health which had occurred during B\u2019s arrest.",

On 22\u00a0October 2008 the Krasnodar Regional Court upheld the District Court\u2019s decision on the applicant\u2019s appeal. It stated that in certain circumstances force could be used lawfully by law-enforcement officers. Moreover, no injuries had been recorded on B. The conclusion of the FSKN internal investigation about the lack of guilt on the part of the FSKN officers in the applicant\u2019s temporary health disorder had been based on a specialist\u2019s opinion concerning her reaction to a conflict situation.

The original copy of the record of the test purchase of drugs, on the basis of which the criminal proceedings had been instituted, was missing. The available copy of the record was different from the original (in particular, indicating a different place at which E.N. had handed over the drugs to the FSKN officers) and therefore fictitious. In order to establish the circumstances of the drugs sale, investigator R.K. questioned P.M., one of the attesting witnesses to the sale of drugs. According to P.M.\u2019s witness statement, he had testified falsely, at the request of the FSKN officers, to having seen the transfer of drugs from B to E.N. and from E.N. to the FSKN officers on 30 May 2008. That day P.M. had not met the FSKN officers and had not witnessed any transfers of drugs. On 31 May 2008 FSKN officer S.S. had taken him and another attesting witness, A.Sh., to a place near school no. 1 in Apsheronsk. When they had arrived, B had been standing handcuffed near a car. There had been a bag containing money in the car. P.M. had not seen who had put it there. Then they had gone to B\u2019s home in order for a search to be carried out, but they had not been let in by B\u2019s wife. They had gone to the FSKN office where P.M. had been shown a plastic bag and had been told that the bag with drugs had been sold by B to E.N., who had then handed it over to the FSKN officers. P.M. remembered signing documents at the FSKN officers\u2019 request without reading them.",

The applicant claimed that her health disorders had been caused by her exposure to a scene of violence against her father, who had not resisted his arrest, involving his being knocked to the ground and beaten up, notably being kicked repeatedly to his torso. The Government contested the applicant\u2019s allegations, claiming that B\u2019s arrest did not involve any use of force against him and that the authorities could not therefore be held responsible for any harm suffered by the applicant. In doing so the Government relied on the records of B\u2019s detention facility and the statements made in the course of the preinvestigation inquiry into the applicant\u2019s allegations by:",

It cannot be excluded that the alleged force used against B \u2013 notably being knocked to the ground and kicked several times \u2013 could have left no visible traces on his body. The Court notes in this regard that \u2013 according to B and witness R.G. (see paragraphs 10 and 13 above) \u2013 the FSKN officers who arrested B, including the one who allegedly used force against him, were dressed in tracksuits (see also the statements by attesting witnesses A.Sh. and P.M., FSKN officer E.N. and Apsheronsk police officers K.A. and M.I., who mentioned that the arresting officers had been in civilian clothing, paragraphs 31 and 35-37 above). This suggests that they may have been wearing trainers, which might not have caused the same blunt-trauma bruising and abrasions as army-type boots (see, for example, Ksenz and Others v.

FSKN officer A.Z., who carried out the FSKN internal investigation, dismissed R.G.\u2019s statements as unreliable. He alleged that R.G. was a drug user who had been arrested in the past for administrative offences of drugs consumption. Moreover, there had been no confirmation from his employer that R.G. had indeed been working in the area on 31 May 2008 (see paragraph 40 above). The Court does not find A.Z.\u2019s assessment convincing, since he belonged to the same unit as the FSKN officers who were allegedly at fault, which raises an issue as to the independence of such an investigation. Apart from the fact that R.G.\u2019s alleged drugs consumption or his employer\u2019s failure to submit the relevant certificate would not as such be sufficient grounds to discard his statements, no details were given as regards any administrative proceedings against him. Furthermore, R.G., whose testimony was very important for establishing the facts, was never interviewed by the investigative committee, which instead relied on A.Z.\u2019s assessment. The same is true in respect of a \u201cspecialist\u201d (whose name, qualifications and other details were not provided) allegedly consulted by A.Z. and on whose opinion A.Z. had relied in concluding that the applicant had a pre-existing neurological pathology which made her prone to psychological trauma as a result of even a minor stressful situation (see paragraph 40 above), to hold that her health disorders had been caused by her having observed B being arrested without any use of force against him. This conclusion was adopted by the official pre-investigation inquiry without ever questioning the \u201cspecialist\u201d.",

The latter contended that B\u2019s shirt had been open and slightly torn, and that the shirt buttons had been missing. K.A.\u2019s and M.I.\u2019s statements therefore confirm the applicant\u2019s allegation that during her father\u2019s violent arrest his shirt had been torn and its buttons ripped off.

However, when examined as a witness a year later in relation to the criminal proceedings against B, P.M. acknowledged that he had testified falsely, at the request of the FSKN officers, that he had seen the transfer of drugs and money. He also acknowledged that on 31\u00a0May 2008 he and A.Sh. had been taken to the place of B\u2019s arrest after B had been apprehended (see paragraph 43 above).

The Court has held, however, that the mere carrying out of a pre-investigation inquiry, not followed by a preliminary investigation, is insufficient for the authorities to comply with the requirements of an effective investigation into credible allegations of illtreatment by the police under Article 3 of the Convention (see Lyapin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a046956/09, \u00a7 136, 24 July 2014, and, more recently, Samesov v.

The authorities responded to the applicant\u2019s credible allegations of treatment proscribed by Article 3 by carrying out a pre-investigation inquiry and refused to institute criminal proceedings and carry out a fully-fledged investigation. This was endorsed by the domestic courts, thereby departing from their procedural obligation under Article 3. The preinvestigation inquiry did not provide the Government with a proper basis to discharge their burden of proof and produce evidence capable of casting doubt on the applicant\u2019s credible allegations concerning her exposure to the violent arrest of her father, which the Court therefore finds established (see Olisov and Others v.
