On that basis, any writing, whether political, philosophical, novelistic or even poetical, was governed by the applicable rules in such matters, with regard both to public order and to the protection of individuals. However, the court added that \u201cthe application of the rules on defamation in respect of a press article or other text directly expressing the view of its author requires, if the text is a work of fiction, an examination of the question whether the civil parties are actually the individuals concerned by the offending remarks, and then of the meaning attributed by the author to the words of his characters in the light of the ideas that he expounds in reality in his work\u201d. As to the second point \u2013 the first being manifestly established \u2013 the court found as follows: \u201c... a distinction has to be made between the offending passages on pages 10, 86, 105, and, lastly, 136, the only extracts now to be taken into account: some of them express the view of the narrator and coincide with the author\u2019s ideas as they emerge from the work as a whole, whilst others can be attributed only to the character making the remarks in question, in so far as the author genuinely distances himself from those remarks throughout the work, either through the narrator or by other means.\u201d",

It was those events which had provided the inspiration for the novel by the first applicant, whose cause had been defended by the signatories of the petition, reacting in a democratic spirit and out of vigilance towards the far-right movement. The third applicant explained that the column \u201cRebonds\u201d was specifically reserved for the opinions of commentators from outside the newspaper who expressed their views with the intention of triggering debate and provoking reactions among readers. He added that the column, in principle, was not supposed to be objective or impartial but to convey opinions and therefore entailed the freedom to hold those opinions. He argued that the free discussion of political matters should not be hindered by excessive requirements relating to the protection of the rights of others or the prevention of disorder.",

On the other hand, the fact that the name of the imaginary person corresponds to that of a living person is not sufficient for the latter to allege defamation, even if there are certainly similarities of character and diffusion (Algiers Court of Appeal, 20 February 1897). Such situations mostly give rise to proceedings for civil liability and damages are awarded whenever there has been prejudice, that is to say when the public has unavoidably been led to associate the living person with the imaginary person and where an error of judgment can be attributed to the author (Paris Court of Appeal, 24\u00a0April 1936, and Paris Court of Appeal, 8 November 1950).

However, in the Court\u2019s view this does not objectively justify the third applicant\u2019s fears as to a lack of impartiality on the part of the judges. The first judgment of the Court of Appeal, dated 13 September 2000, had found to be defamatory certain passages of the book written by the first applicant and published by the second. On this point that judgment had become res judicata. The second judgment of the Court of Appeal, dated 21\u00a0March 2001, was bound to apply that authority to this aspect of the dispute, whilst the question of the good or bad faith of the third applicant, who was responsible for the publication of a petition approving that book and criticising the conviction of the first two applicants, remained open and had not been prejudiced by the first judgment. It would therefore be excessive to consider that two judges who sat on the bench which successively delivered the two judgments in question could taint the court\u2019s objective impartiality. In reality, as regards the characterisation of the text as defamation, any other judge would have been bound by the res judicata principle, which means that their participation had no influence on the respective part of the second judgment. And as regards the issue of good faith, which was a totally different issue in the two cases even though they were connected, there is no evidence to suggest that the judges were in any way bound by their assessment in the first case (see, mutatis mutandis, Thomann v. Switzerland, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 35, Reports 1996III).",

In the light of this jurisprudence, protection of reputation entails an obligation for the State to enforce a corresponding right guaranteed by the Convention with the same status as freedom of expression. Any defamatory statement amounts to interference with the right guaranteed by the Convention and can only be justified if it satisfies the requirements of permissible restrictions on the exercise of such right, that is to say, it must be prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society, corresponding to a pressing social need, proportionate to the aim pursued, etc. Therefore it will be more difficult to defend a defamatory statement for purposes of Convention protection when it is examined as interference with a right recognised under the Convention, rather than as a necessary restriction on freedom of expression.",

To my mind this principle means simply that in those areas mentioned above, and in respect of politicians, certain exaggeration in allegations of fact or even some offending effect should be tolerated and should not be sanctioned.

But the opposite argument is equally strong: the suppression of untrue defamatory statements, apart from protecting the dignity of individuals, discourages false speech and improves the overall quality of public debate through a chilling effect on irresponsible journalism. Moreover, such debates may be suppressed if the potential participants know that they will have no remedy in the event that false defamatory accusations are made against them. The prohibition of defamatory speech also eliminates misinformation in the mass media and effectively protects the right of the public to truthful information. Furthermore, false accusations concerning public officials, including candidates for public office, may drive capable persons away from government service, thus frustrating rather than furthering the political process.",

Such restraint should include the duty to investigate defamatory allegations before rushing into print and the obligation to give an opportunity to the persons affected by their defamatory stories to react and give their own version. Furthermore they should remain legally accountable to the persons concerned for any false defamatory allegations. Like any power, the mass media cannot be accountable only to themselves.

On numerous occasions the Court has referred to the key importance of freedom of expression as one of the preconditions for a functioning democracy (see \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem v. , no. 23144/93, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000III). This assertion of the social function of freedom of expression constitutes the basic philosophy of the Court\u2019s Article 10 case-law. It follows that the right to freedom of expression is not only a safeguard against State interference (an individual right), it is also a general fundamental principle of life in a democracy.

In particular, the question whether words or expressions attributed to fictional characters are to be regarded as defamatory is made to depend on whether the author is to be seen as having sufficiently distanced himself in the novel from the words spoken.

In this connection, public figures and politicians, on account of the responsibilities they bear, are exposed to criticism as a matter of course and are therefore required to show greater tolerance towards polemical discourse or even insults directed against them. The founding judgment concerning the criticism of politicians is clearly that of Lingens v. Austria (8 July 1986, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 103) and since then there has been a high degree of consistency in the Court\u2019s case-law with regard to the application of this fundamental principle. The recent declaration of the Committee of Ministers on freedom of political debate in the media fundamentally adheres to the Court\u2019s case-law and explains its raison d\u2019\u00eatre: \u201cPolitical figures have decided to appeal to the confidence of the public and accepted to subject themselves to public political debate and are therefore subject to close public scrutiny and potentially robust and strong public criticism through the media over the way in which they have carried out or carry out their functions.\u201d The Court has applied these principles in cases where the factual circumstances were similar to those of the present case. For instance, in Lopes Gomes da Silva v. Portugal (no. 37698/97, ECHR 2000X) the applicant had been convicted for describing a person reported to be standing in the Lisbon City Council elections as \u201cgrotesque and ... buffoonish ... such an incredible mixture of crude reactionaryism ..., fascist bigotry and coarse anti-Semitism\u201d (\u00a7 10) and the Court found that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention. Mutatis mutandis, in Karman v. Russia (no. 29372/02, 14 December 2006) the Court found that the conviction of a journalist who had described a politician as a \u201clocal neofascist\u201d had entailed a violation of Article 10 of the Convention. In D\u0105browski v.  (no. 18235/02, 19 December 2006) the Court also found that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention in respect of an article that had led to a journalist\u2019s conviction for describing a deputy mayor as a \u201cmayor-burglar\u201d.",

On this point we refer in particular to the case of Oberschlick v.  (no. 2) (1 July 1997, Reports 1997IV) where the Court considered that \u201ccalling a politician a Trottel in public may offend him\u201d but that, in the instant case, \u201cthe word [did] not seem disproportionate to the indignation knowingly aroused by Mr Haider\u201d (\u00a7 34). Similarly, in Wirtschafts-Trend Zeitschriften-Verlags GmbH v.

He therefore had to display a particularly high degree of tolerance in this context (\u00a7 37). Of course, such an observation should be kept in the context of the present case and of those cases that have given rise to the judgments of the Court cited above, and we do not suggest that it be applied generally.

As a general rule, the Court considers that the necessity of a link between a value judgment and its supporting facts may vary from case to case according to the specific circumstances (see De Haes and Gijsels v.
