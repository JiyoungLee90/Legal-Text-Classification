In this regard, the Court notes that the nature of the alleged violation in the present case is such that it would not be possible to eliminate the effects of the infringement of the applicant's right to a fair trial without reopening the domestic proceedings. Moreover, the Court observes that the domestic law allows the reopening of criminal proceedings in the event of a finding of a violation of the Convention by the Court. However, it appears that there is no provision allowing the reopening of domestic proceedings on account of a decision by the Court to strike a case out of the list (see paragraph 25 above).",

It marks out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the organs of the Convention and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see, amongst other authorities, Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 34979/97, ECHR 2000I).",

If, as the applicant alleged, he tried to avail himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently became aware of circumstances which rendered the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 to take the start of the six-month period as the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances. In the instant case, the applicant lodged his appeal against the first-instance court's decision on 12 August 2005. However, he did not receive any reply to his appeal. Moreover, it appears that he did not make any further enquires with the Court of Appeal about the status of his appeal and whether or not it had been examined. In other words, it has not been shown that, following the lodging of the appeal, the applicant was diligent in pursuing his complaints before the appellate court. Taking into consideration the fact that the Court of Appeal should have examined this type of appeal within three days of its receipt (see paragraph 24 above), the Court considers that the applicant must be considered to have become aware of the lack of any effective examination of his appeal in the few months directly following the lodging of his appeal, in other words by the end of 2005 at the latest. However, he did not lodge the application with the Court until 29 January 2007, despite the fact that he had not received any reply to his appeal since 12 August 2005 (compare Bayram and Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v. Turkey (dec.), no. 38587/97, 29 January 2002, and Bercaru v. Romania, no.\u00a08870/02, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34, 16 September 2008). Therefore, the Court considers that the applicant ought to have become aware of this situation long before lodging this application with the Court on 29 January 2007. Furthermore, the applicant has failed to substantiate the existence of specific circumstances which might have prevented him from observing the timelimit laid down in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Belgium (Article 50), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85). As has been found above, the proceedings before the Supreme Court did not comply with the requirements of fairness, as the applicant was deprived of the opportunity to exercise any of his rights under Article 6. In such circumstances, the most appropriate form of redress would, in principle, be the reopening of the cassation appeal proceedings in order to guarantee the examination of his appeal in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Somogyi v. Italy, no. 67972/01, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2004IV; Shulepov v. Russia, no. 15435/03, \u00a7 46, 26 June 2008; Maksimov, cited above, \u00a7 46; and Abbasov. cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42).
