In German case-law, membership of an organisation regarded as being inimical to the Constitution was merely a possible reason for doubting a civil servant\u2019s constitutional loyalty, and every case had to be examined in detail. The Ministry\u2019s overall judgment did not satisfy this requirement. The applicant had always actively upheld the free democratic system - in 1968, for example, when the University of Heidelberg had been occupied; or in 1970 in Ulm, when he had retrieved the flag of the German Democratic Republic and handed it over to the public prosecutor; or again, as a member of the Land Parliament. The same was true of his writings. He could not be held responsible for NPD statements or actions which might be regarded as inimical to the Constitution. In any case, the party approved of the free democratic system within the meaning of the Basic Law. When the Land Minister appointed him as a probationary civil servant, he knew that he had been a member of the Federal Executive Committee (since 1971), a member of the Land Executive Committee (since 1968), the Land Executive Committee\u2019s district agent for North Baden (since 1971) and chairman of the Rhine-Neckar branch of the NPD (since 1965). It was thus illogical that his commitment to the NPD should be seen as making him personally unsuitable and justifying his dismissal. The same inconsistency was apparent in earlier statements by the Minister. In December 1972, he had repeatedly stated - in the Land Parliament, on television and in interviews with the press - that Mr. Kosiek was not opposed to the Constitution and that his four-year record in Parliament showed as much.",

In this respect, the Land Administrative Court of Appeal shared the views of the Koblenz Court of Appeal, which had analysed the book in detail (see paragraph 14 above).

In contrast, neither the European Convention nor any of its Protocols sets forth any such right. Moreover, as the Government rightly pointed out, the signatory States deliberately did not include such a right: the drafting history of Protocols Nos. 4 and 7 (P4, P7) shows this unequivocally. In particular, the initial versions of Protocol No. 7 (P7) contained a provision similar to Article 21 para. 2 of the Universal Declaration and Article 25 of the International Covenant; this clause was subsequently deleted. This is not therefore a chance omission from the European instruments; as the Preamble to the Convention states, they are designed to ensure the collective enforcement of \"certain\" of the rights stated in the Universal Declaration.",

At the time his employer recommended to the Ministry that he should be given tenure, Mr. Kosiek had completed approximately one year of the probationary period he had to serve before he could be given a permanent post (see paragraph 16 above). The Ministry, however, considered that he had not proved himself, because he did not fulfil the condition - as required under sections 6 and 8 of the Land Civil Servants Act (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above) - that he would consistently uphold the free democratic system within the meaning of the Basic Law. This is one of the personal qualifications required of anyone seeking a post as a civil servant - whether temporary or established - in the Federal Republic of Germany. This requirement applies to recruitment to the civil service, a matter that was deliberately omitted from the Convention, and it cannot in itself be considered incompatible with the Convention. The Minister originally considered that the requirement had been fulfilled, since he had appointed the applicant as a lecturer with the status of probationary civil servant (see paragraph 15 above). After a fresh examination of Mr. Kosiek\u2019s political activities and of his publications, however, the Ministry came to the conclusion that Mr. Kosiek - who, as \"a prominent NPD official\", \"had approved of NPD aims which were inimical to the Constitution\" (see paragraph 17 above) - did not meet one of the conditions of eligibility laid down in the Act for the post in question, as a result of which it decided not to give him tenure and so dismissed him from his post as a probationary civil servant (sections 38(2), 6 and 8 of the Land Civil Servants Act; see paragraphs 17-18 above); the domestic courts before which proceedings were brought adopted essentially the same approach, except for the Stuttgart Administrative Court (see paragraphs 21, 23, 24 and 26 above).
