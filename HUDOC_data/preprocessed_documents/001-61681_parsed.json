Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.\u00a0The Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, the McKerr v. the United Kingdom decision, no. 28883/95, 4 April 2000). Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic authorities and, as a general rule, it is for those authorities to assess the evidence before them (see Klaas v. Germany, judgment of 22 September 1993, Series A no. 269, p. 17, \u00a7 29).

The other Prosecutor in the case, Mr Aktaran, had accepted that he had made an inquiry into the wrong licence number of the vehicle in which Mr \u015een had been abducted, due to a typing error, but had not taken the matter further. No inquiry had been made based on the colour of that car.

It reiterates in this connection that only legal costs and expenses necessarily and actually incurred can be reimbursed under Article 41 of the Convention. The Court is not satisfied that in the instant case all the costs and expenses were necessarily and reasonably incurred. For instance, it considers excessive the number of lawyers working on the case and the number of hours of work they claimed.
