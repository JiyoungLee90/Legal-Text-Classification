This means that it leaves offences on the statute book or creates new offences only if such punishment of behaviour harmful to society is still found absolutely necessary and indispensable after the strictest criteria have been applied. The criminal provision which has been challenged is included in the group of acts considered unlawful in order to protect - to an extent thought to be unavoidable - a young, maturing person from developing sexually in the wrong way. ('Homosexual acts are only offences of relevance to the criminal law inasmuch as a dangerous strain must not be placed by homosexual experiences upon the sexual development of young males ...' Pallin in Foregger/Nowakowski (publishers), Vienna commentary to the Criminal Code, 1980, para. 1 on Article 209 ...). Seen in this light, it is the conviction of the Constitutional Court that from the point of view of the principle of equality contained in section 7 para. 1 of the Federal Constitutional Law and section 2 of the Basic Constitutional Act those legislating on the criminal law cannot reasonably be challenged for taking the view, by reference to authoritative expert opinions coupled with experience gained, that homosexual influence endangers maturing males to a significantly greater extent than girls of the same age, and concluding that it is necessary to punish under the criminal law homosexual acts committed with young males, as provided for under Article 209 of the Penal Code. This conclusion was also based on their views of morality, which they wanted to impose while duly observing the current policy on criminal justice which aims at moderation and at restricting the punishment of offences (while carefully weighing up all the manifold advantages and disadvantages). Taking everything into account, we are dealing here with a distinction which is based on factual differences and therefore constitutionally admissible from the point of view of section 7 para. 1 of the Federal Constitutional Law, in conjunction with section 2 of the Basic Constitutional Act.\u201d ",

The Constitutional Court held that the second argument differed from the arguments which it had examined in its judgment of 3\u00a0October\u00a01989 and that it was therefore not prevented from considering it. It noted that Article 209 concerned only consensual homosexual relations between men aged over nineteen and adolescents between fourteen and eighteen years of age. In the fourteen-to nineteen-year age bracket homosexual acts between persons of the same age (for instance two sixteen-year-olds) or of persons with a one-to five-year age difference were not punishable. However, as soon as one partner reached the age of nineteen, such acts constituted an offence under Article 209 of the Criminal Code. They became legal again when the younger partner reached the age of eighteen. Given that Article 209 did not only apply to occasional relations but also  covered ongoing relationships, it led to rather absurd results, namely a change of periods during which the homosexual relationship of two partners was first legal, than punishable and then legal again and could therefore not be considered to be objectively justified.

However, modern science had shown that sexual orientation was already established at the beginning of puberty. Moreover, different ages of consent were not in line with European standards. In this respect they referred in particular to Recommendation 924/1981 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe which had advocated equal ages of consent for heterosexual and homosexual relations. Protection of juveniles against sexual violence and abuse was sufficiently afforded by other provisions of the Criminal Code, irrespective of their sexual orientation.",

Nine were clearly in favour of repealing Article 209, an important argument for the experts in the fields of medicine, psychology and psychiatry being that sexual orientation was, in the majority of cases, established before the age of puberty, which disproved the theory that male adolescents were recruited into homosexuality by homosexual experiences. Another recurring argument was that penalising homosexual relations made AIDS prevention more difficult. Two experts were in favour of keeping Article 209: one simply stated that he considered it necessary for the protection of male adolescents; the other considered that despite the fact that there was no such thing as being recruited into homosexuality, not all male adolescents were already sure of their sexual orientation and it was therefore better to give them more time to establish their identity.",

There was an equal vote at the close of the debate (91 to 91). Consequently, Article 209 remained on the statute book. ",

In particular, the applicant pointed out that in April 1997, in September and December 1998 and again in July 2001, the European Parliament had requested Austria to repeal Article 209. Similarly, the Human Rights Committee, set up under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, has found that Article 209 was discriminatory.

The amendment in question entered into force on 14 August 2002. However, this development does not affect the applicant's status as a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. In this connection, the Court reiterates that a decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a victim unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see, for instance, Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, \u00a7 44, ECHR\u00a01999-VI). In the admissibility decision of 22 November 2001 in the present case, the Court accepted that the applicant, who has always asserted that he felt attracted by men older than himself, was prevented by Article\u00a0209 of the Criminal Code from entering into any sexual relationship corresponding to his disposition. Accordingly, it found that he was directly affected by the maintenance in force of Article 209 until he attained the age of eighteen. Having regard to the present situation, the Court considers that the Constitutional Court's judgment, which is based on other grounds than those relied on in the present application, has not acknowledged let alone afforded redress for the alleged breach of the Convention. Nor can it be said that the \u201cmatter has been resolved\u201d within the meaning of Article 37 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Convention.

However, this approach has been out-dated by the 1995 Parliamentary debate on a possible repeal of that provision.
