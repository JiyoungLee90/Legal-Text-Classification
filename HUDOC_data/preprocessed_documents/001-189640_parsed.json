The forensic expert at the Vilnius branch of the Mykolas Romeris University Forensic-Medicine Institute concluded that there were strangulation marks on the neck and bruising on the back. The neck injuries could have been inflicted several minutes prior to death as a result of the neck being squeezed by the bed sheet. As to the bruising on the back, this could have been caused when the body hanging in the noose went into convulsion hitting off hard blunt surfaces. The expert concluded that there were no objective indications which could have denied M.P.\u2019s cause of death as having been asphyxiation when the neck had been squeezed in a noose. The expert noted that there were no signs of strangulation by hands; he also indicated that it had been a one-time constriction on the neck.",

Pursuant to domestic law as applied in this case, persons detained in several cells at Bir\u017eai police station had to be constantly monitored through spy holes. Even so, on the basis of the medical report the court nevertheless underlined that M.P. had died within a couple of minutes of the moment when the noose had closed around his neck, that is to say within a very short time. It would have been physically impossible for D.M. and R.S. to constantly monitor, through the holes in the cell doors, all the persons detained at the police station, including M.P.

The court considered that there still remained certain contradictions, in particular, whether the short gaps within the video recording had occurred owing to a technical problem or because of another cause. It was also necessary to ascertain whether the video files had been provided in sequence. Moreover, no clear answer had been obtained from the medical expert as regards the possible reasons for M.P.\u2019s injuries in the light of the results of the second reconstruction (see\u00a0paragraphs 27 and 30 above). A supplementary medical evaluation had to be performed in which the specialists would be provided with all the existing information about M.P.\u2019s injuries so that the mechanism of his death could be determined and the question of whether there had been signs of violence against M.P. answered. The applicant and her lawyer were given the opportunity to pose questions to the experts. Lastly, the court underlined that a person\u2019s death, and even more so a death in a police station, was \u201ca particular situation (yra ypatingas atvejis)\u201d, which had to be thoroughly examined.",

They conducted the examination from 26\u00a0May to 28\u00a0November 2014 and produced report no.\u00a0EKM\u00a052/14(01). The experts firstly concluded that M.P. could have died as had been demonstrated during the second reconstruction, which had been performed on 14\u00a0December 2010 (see paragraph 27 above). They also noted that M.P.\u2019s neck organs could have been placed under pressure because of his own weight, and also underlined the fact that, when a person\u2019s body is in a certain position, his or her weight is sufficient to bring about suffocation. The experts also explained that the death of M.P. should have occurred while he was in a vertical or similar position, as proven by the location of the post-mortem discolouration, and that the bruises on M.P.\u2019s back could have been caused when he was in the noose and his back came into contact with the frame of the bunk bed during his convulsions. As to the injuries to M.P.\u2019s wrists, which the applicant alleged had been inflicted during handcuffing, the experts had explained that those had appeared after the first autopsy when M.P.\u2019s hands had been bound during preparation of his body for burial, which was the usual practice. On the basis of the documentary evidence \u2013 photographs of M.P.\u2019s corpse from the scene, the bailiff\u2019s statements of 16\u00a0April 2008 (see paragraph\u00a015 above) and the additional autopsy report (see paragraph 14 above) \u2013 the experts also categorically and officially stated that there had been no bruising around M.P.\u2019s eyes, unlike what had been claimed by the applicant.",

For the prosecutor, suicide as the cause of death was also corroborated by the statements of M.P.\u2019s lawyer, who stated that on 14 April 2008 M.P. had been acting calmly, had been responsive, had not complained about anything and had not been agitated (see paragraph 8 in fine above). Among other things, the prosecutor also noted that an empty box of matches had been found in M.P.\u2019s cell, and that the cell had had a toilet and burned matches could have been disposed of there (see paragraphs 11, 21 and 26 above). Although the blanket which had been given to the forensic expert on 15\u00a0April 2008 (see paragraph 13 above) had not been found during the later stages of the pre-trial investigation, there was sufficient data to confirm that M.P. had put his neck into a noose made from a blanket, and there was no evidence that someone had forced him to do that or that someone had hanged him.",

The court noted that numerous pieces of evidence had been collected and examined. It also emphasised that two of the applicant\u2019s main criticisms had been answered. Firstly, after the last re-opening of the pre-trial investigation an examination of the video recordings was performed by a forensic expert, who had disproved the applicant\u2019s allegation that the video recordings from Bir\u017eai police station had been tampered with (see paragraph\u00a042 above). Secondly, report no.\u00a0EKM\u00a052/14(01) (see paragraph 43 above), as well as earlier medical reports (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above), had reached the same conclusions \u2013 that M.P. had died as a result of being strangled in a noose. The court noted that those medical reports had explained that M.P. could have died in the manner which had been demonstrated in the second reconstruction, and also noted that there had been no signs of injuries on M.P.\u2019s body which he could not have inflicted himself. The applicant\u2019s allegation that M.P.\u2019s death could have been caused by someone else had been examined throughout the criminal investigation but no evidence of that had been found. The court also noted that the prosecutor had reached reasoned conclusions after having performed a comprehensive analysis of the gathered evidence. Although the applicant had expressed doubts in respect of the evidence gathered, in her appeal she had not presented any new arguments regarding what particular pre-trial investigation actions had not been performed, what data had not been evaluated, or what investigative actions, had they been performed, would have clarified any important circumstances in this case. Lastly, the court concluded that during the pre-trial investigation all actions provided by law had been used to obtain evidence. Even so, there was \u201cno unquestionable data (neabejotini duomenys)\u201d that a crime had been committed.",

Indeed, as is apparent from the material provided by the parties, the applicant did not even ask to be recognised as a civil plaintiff during the criminal proceedings, instead concentrating on the possible causes of her son\u2019s death. In this context the Court also cannot but note that the applicant considered that not only had her son\u2019s life not been protected at Bir\u017eai police station, but she went as far as to accuse the police officers of having tortured and murdered him. The applicant maintained that view until the very end of the criminal proceedings regarding the circumstances of her son\u2019s death (see\u00a0paragraphs\u00a024 and 45 above). This, for the Court, was an argument about intentional loss of life, the opposite to what has been suggested by the Government in their objection (see paragraph 56 above). The Court also observes that the applicant continued to challenge, until the end, the prosecutor\u2019s decisions not to start a criminal case against Police Officers D.M. and R.S. for failure to carry out official duties (see paragraph 32 above), which appears to have been her alternative theory for the cause of her son\u2019s death. In the light of these arguments and taking into account the matters voiced overall by the applicant, the Court finds it sufficient that the applicant pursued the criminal-law avenue in order to provide the domestic authorities with an opportunity to put right the alleged violation. The Government\u2019s objection as to the applicant\u2019s failure to use the available domestic remedies must therefore be dismissed.",

It finds it noteworthy that all six times the prosecutor discontinued the investigation it was reopened following appeals by the applicant (see paragraphs\u00a018, 24, 26, 33, 37, 40 and 41 above). The applicant went as far as asking that a pre-trial investigation be opened against the prosecutors for purportedly having failed to conduct the criminal investigation diligently (see paragraph 29 above). Furthermore, and unlike in the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment relied on by the Government (see paragraph 61 above), the criminal investigation in the instant case did not end as being time-barred. Thus the applicant was not deprived of the benefit of having a final court decision on the merits of her complaint that the criminal investigation had not been effective (see paragraph\u00a046 above). Consequently, on the facts of the case the Court cannot see how a civil claim for damages alleging an ineffective criminal investigation, that is to say the same issue which the applicant had already raised before the criminal courts for seven years, might have reasonably led to a different outcome.

Nevertheless, as established by the prosecutors and the courts, there was no evidence of violence against M.P. to corroborate the applicant\u2019s hypothesis of a violent crime (see paragraph 34 above). The speculative nature of the applicant\u2019s suggestions was also pointed out by the medical expert (see paragraph 30 above). The signs which the applicant attributed to proof of violence, such as signs of strangulation or marks on M.P.\u2019s wrists or bruising on his back, or alleged black eyes, had been examined by the forensic experts who had given plausible explanations for their presence or, alternatively, had categorically noted their absence (see paragraphs 10, 14 and 43 in fine above).

That being so, as established during the pre-trial investigation, no circumstances triggering such a duty on the part of the authorities\u2019 were present in the instant case. In particular, as affirmed by M.P.\u2019s lawyer, on 14\u00a0April 2008 his client communicated in a calm manner, he was not agitated and he had no complaints (see paragraph 8 above). No signs of calamity at Bir\u017eai police station at the time of M.P.\u2019s death were reported by the other detainees at that station (see paragraph 34 above). The fact that M.P. had had no history of attempted suicide was also confirmed by the applicant in her statement to the prosecutor (see paragraph\u00a012 above). Nor did the applicant assert that her son was a particularly vulnerable individual, which would have put the onus on the authorities to monitor him particularly closely (see, mutatis mutandis, Volk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 86-94, and, a contrario, Ketreb v. France, no. 38447/09, \u00a7\u00a7 75-99, 19 July 2012). The Court also observes that the paramedics arrived at the scene within minutes, but no resuscitation was possible because M.P. had already been dead for several hours (see paragraph 10 above; compare and contrast \u010cesnulevicius v. Lithuania, no. 13462/06, \u00a7\u00a088, 10 January 2012).

The fact that the pre-trial investigation had been re-opened six times only proved that there had been flaws and that the investigating authorities had buried the facts proving her son\u2019s murder at Bir\u017eai police station. During that period the officers had audaciously told lies, had falsified video recordings and documents, and, during the pre-trial investigation, had hid the murder weapon. The applicant also fervently challenged the results of the medical expert examinations of the circumstances of her son\u2019s death, asserting that M.P.\u2019s corpse had not been examined in an objective manner. The applicant pointed to the absence of burnt matches in M.P.\u2019s cell which had led her to conclude that he had been forced to write the suicide note by the Bir\u017eai police officers.",

As a result, convincing arguments had been provided with regard to disputed injuries allegedly sustained by the applicant\u2019s son, and ruling out the possibility that a crime had been committed against him. Even if some of the decisions by the prosecutor to discontinue the pre-trial investigation had been quashed, this had not been because they had been totally unsubstantiated or arbitrary \u2013 as they had been to a large extent based on the expert conclusions and the suicide note \u2013 but because further investigative actions had had to be carried out. The six re-openings of the investigations had to a major extent been caused by the actions of the applicant, who had raised new complaints or asked that new aspects be investigated after a significant lapse of time. When conducting additional investigative measures no essential evidence had been revealed. By allowing most of the applicant\u2019s appeals the domestic authorities had demonstrated particular sensitivity and readiness to investigate her claims. Given that M.P.\u2019s death had been an exceptional case as it had occurred in a police station, it had been necessary to take not only reasonable but also all possible investigative actions in order to comprehensively investigate it. The Government relied on the Court\u2019s judgment in Keller v. Russia (no.\u00a026824/04, 17\u00a0October 2013), where the Court, having taken into account the authorities\u2019 ability to eventually address and correct the raised and identified shortcomings, had not found a procedural violation of Article\u00a02 of the Convention despite nine rounds of investigation.",

The entire criminal investigation was conducted by the prosecutor\u2019s office, an authority which was institutionally independent from the police officers involved in the relevant events, and the prosecutors\u2019 decisions had been scrutinised by the courts. The prosecutors\u2019 capacity to establish the truth was also noted by the courts, which dismissed the applicant\u2019s argument that the prosecutors lacked competence to uncover alleged crime (see paragraphs 29 and 36 above).",

Be that as it may, and despite these delays in the proceedings, the Court observes that the prosecutor and also the courts entertained the applicant\u2019s requests and eventually addressed, corrected or explained those shortcomings (see\u00a0paragraphs 14, 20, 24, 26, 28-30, 33, 34, 37, 38, 41 and 44 above; see also Keller, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0100). In that vein it also notes that measures such as a court order to obtain evidence from the applicant had been taken (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a020 above). The Court also points out that four medical examinations by experts from different institutions, an examination by the bailiff and two reconstructions regarding the causes of M.P.\u2019s death in the light of the applicant\u2019s assertion of ill-treatment at the hands of the police officers had been performed, some of them at the applicant\u2019s request (see\u00a0paragraphs 13, 14, 27, 30 and 43 above). In the course of the criminal investigation and subsequent court proceedings, the authorities identified all of the actors who could give evidence in respect of the circumstances of M.P.\u2019s death and conducted multiple interviews with these people, as well as a confrontation between the applicant and the police interrogator, with a view to establishing the exact circumstances of the incident (see\u00a0paragraphs\u00a012, 33 and 34 above).",

The reasonableness and lawfulness of the conclusions reached by the prosecutor and the measures taken in the course of the criminal investigation were subsequently examined and accepted by the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court, which also excluded any suspicion of coercion or ill-treatment of M.P. preceding his death. As pointed out by that court, everything possible had been done to establish the circumstances of the death. It is true that the blanket used by M.P. for hanging himself and which was found in his cell (see paragraph 13 above) apparently went lost during the later stages of criminal proceedings. However, the Court does not consider that, albeit regrettable, this fact, as such, is capable of undermining the efficiency of the investigation because, in any case, there was sufficient data to confirm that M.P. had put his neck into a noose made from a blanket (see paragraphs 44 and 46 above; see also, mutatis mutandis and in relation to the loss or destruction of evidence in criminal cases examined by the Court under Article 6 of the Convention, Sangiorgi v. Italy (dec.), no.\u00a070981/01, 5\u00a0September 2002, and Sofri and Others v. Italy (dec.), no.\u00a037235/97, ECHR 2003-VIII). Furthermore, as observed by the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court, in her last appeal the applicant had not indicated what particular pre-trial investigation actions, capable of clarifying any important circumstances in the case, had not been performed and/or what data had not been evaluated (see paragraph\u00a046 above).",
