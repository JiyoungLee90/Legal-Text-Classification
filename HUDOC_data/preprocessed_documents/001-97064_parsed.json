He argued that he had worked on a German farm and submitted three documents in support of his claim. The first document was a certificate issued by the Ruszcza Catholic Parish on the basis of its parish records. The certificate stated that between 1942 and 1945 there had been a farm in Wad\u00f3w owned by Z.K. (married name: Hochsman) and administered by W.\u00a0Hochsman, a German national.

First, the Appeal Commission stated that section 11 of the German Foundation Act (\u201cthe GFA\u201d), which set out the categories of eligible persons, was not directly applicable to the applicant. However, following the agreement made in the framework of the so-called \u201copenness clause\u201d (tzw. klauzula otwarto\u015bci; section 9 \u00a7 8 of the GFA) the Polish Foundation with the approval of the German Foundation agreed to extend the category of eligible claimants to other groups, including relocated persons (osoby dyslokowane). That category included forced labourers who had been deported within the territory of the  and crossed the border between the administrative entities established by the occupying authorities. The additional condition for relocated persons was to produce documents which attested that they had worked on a farm under German administration or for a German company. Relevant evidence to that effect should have been produced on the basis of the local archives, indicating which documents had been relied on.",

They contended that the exclusion of judicial review of decisions by the International Organisation for Migration (one of the partner organisations) had violated their right to an effective remedy under Article 19 \u00a7 4 of the German Basic Law.

The court held further that the exclusion by section 11 \u00a7\u00a03 of former prisoners of war from the scope of those eligible for benefits under the Foundation Act had not been discriminatory, since under the Hague Convention prisoners of war could be compelled to perform labour. In this respect the court observed that the legislator was allowed to distinguish, when awarding compensation, between victims of general hardships caused by the war and victims of particular ideological persecution by the Nazi regime, especially as the funds of the Foundation were limited.",

The agreement reached in the negotiations, in particular in respect of the categories of persons who were eligible and the establishment of the German Foundation as a means of providing funds to victims, was subsequently incorporated in the German Foundation Act of 2 August 2000. Section 10 of the Act stipulated that partner organisations, including the Polish Foundation, were entrusted with evaluation of claims and disbursement of payment to eligible claimants. The same provision stipulated that the German Foundation was neither authorised nor obligated in respect of the approval and disbursement of payments by the partner organisations. The particular feature of the second compensation scheme was that the eligibility conditions had been specified in the GFA, while at the same time the examination of the relevant applications was to be carried out by the partner organisations, including the Polish Foundation. The Court considers that for all practical purposes, decisions to qualify applicants as coming under a particular eligibility category and to grant payments in respect of the claimants who resided in Poland were taken by the Polish Foundation (see Wo\u015b v. Poland (dec.), no. 22860/02, \u00a7 66, ECHR 2005IV; Jakowicz v. Poland (dec.), no. 16778/02, \u00a7 76 in fine, 13 October 2009).

It follows that while processing the applications the Polish Foundation was bound to follow the substantive criteria as specified in the GFA and had no power either to review its reasonableness or to unilaterally modify or extend them. Thus, the Polish Foundation and, a fortiori, the Polish State cannot bear responsibility in cases where an applicant, due to the scope of the substantive eligibility conditions as such, was not included in the group of persons entitled to certain benefits. The Court emphasises that the Polish Foundation exercised only a certain measure of discretion when assessing the facts of individual cases and the evidence submitted by the claimants. Its assessment of those elements was decisive for the outcome of the proceedings before the Foundation. The Court considers that the responsibility of the  may be engaged exclusively as regards those cases where the dispute concerns the application of the eligibility conditions to the facts of individual cases in the area falling within the Foundation\u2019s margin of discretion. Accordingly, in each case it is necessary to determine whether a claimant challenges the eligibility conditions or the assessment of facts and evidence by the Polish Foundation and whether that assessment remained within the Polish Foundation\u2019s margin of discretion.",

Poland (dec.), cited above, \u00a7 80). In the case of Jakowicz the Foundation dismissed the applicant\u2019s claims, which went beyond the scope of the substantive eligibility conditions and as such were outside the Foundation\u2019s remit. By contrast, in the present case the Foundation refused the applicant\u2019s claims while exercising its discretion as to the assessment of relevant facts which had a direct bearing on the determination of the applicant\u2019s eligibility status. Thus, the present case can be distinguished from the Jakowicz case on the ground that it concerned a dispute as to the assessment of relevant facts and not a challenge to the substantive eligibility conditions.

Such claims could be established exclusively through domestic law, and in such a case the legislator enjoys a wide margin of discretion, as noted above. In this respect the Court observes that the conditions and procedures with which a claimant had to comply before a payment could be awarded by the Polish Foundation were first agreed in the course of multilateral negotiations, then laid out in the GFA and subsequently transposed into the regulations binding on the Foundation via the Partnership Agreement of 16\u00a0February 2001 and any subsequent agreements concluded in the framework of the so-called openness clause. The Polish Foundation\u2019s statutes were subsequently amended with a view to implementing the provisions of the GFA and the Agreement of 16\u00a0February\u00a02001. Thus, the Foundation\u2019s regulations stipulated the conditions which had to be fulfilled by a person seeking benefits. It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court in its Resolution of 27 June 2007 found that the basis of the rights of a person seeking payment from the Polish Foundation were the Foundation\u2019s statutes, the rules of the Verification Commission and the relevant provisions of the GFA. The Court is mindful of the particular character of the legal regime governing the second compensation scheme which defined the categories of eligible claimants. Nevertheless, it finds that the Polish Foundation\u2019s regulations could be considered to create a right for a claimant arguably fulfilling the relevant eligibility conditions to claim compensation from the Foundation (see,\u00a0mutatis mutandis, Wo\u015b v. Poland (dec.), cited above, \u00a7\u00a083).",

Sweden, 1 July 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports 1997IV and Wo\u015b v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 75). The Court points out that in the somewhat similar area of social security and welfare benefits, many domestic legal systems provide for those benefits to be paid - subject to the fulfilment of the conditions of eligibility - as of right (see Stec and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, ECHR\u00a02005X, \u00a7 51).

In reaching that conclusion, the Court had regard, inter alia, to the similarities between the compensation claims asserted before the Foundation and disputes over entitlement to social security and welfare benefits, which generally fall within the scope of Article 6 (see Mennitto v.

The Court consequently finds that the applicant\u2019s right to claim compensation from the Foundation on account of his forced labour could be considered \u201ccivil\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

In their view, this assertion was further confirmed by the Supreme Court\u2019s Resolution of 27 June 2007. The Court observes, however, that the Supreme Court in its authoritative decision, given by a panel of seven judges, stated firmly that, prior to its Resolution, interested persons had been deprived of the possibility of challenging the Foundation\u2019s decisions in a court. The Supreme Court found that the prevailing trend in the case-law of the civil courts was for exclusion of judicial review in respect of those decisions. It noted that the Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 14 January 2005 and the Szczecin Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 12 July 2006 took a different approach. However, those decisions did not affect the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion as to the earlier lack of availability of judicial review. The Court notes that it was only the Supreme Court\u2019s Resolution which, having regard, among others, to the Wo\u015b judgment, reinterpreted the notion of a \u201ccivil case\u201d and acknowledged that such claims could be heard by civil courts. Accordingly the Court finds that prior to 27\u00a0June 2007 the availability of judicial review in respect of the Foundation\u2019s decisions had not been sufficiently established and that the applicant could not be reproached for failing to institute civil proceedings against the Foundation (see Wo\u015b v.

At the same time, in order to file a constitutional complaint a claimant is obliged to obtain a final decision from a court or an administrative authority (see Article 79 of the Constitution). More importantly, the Court points out that a constitutional complaint could be recognised as an effective remedy only where the individual decision which allegedly violated the Convention had been adopted in direct application of an unconstitutional provision of national legislation (see Szott-Medy\u0144ska v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 47414/99, 9 October 2003, and Pachla v. Poland (dec.), no. 8812/02, 8 November 2005).

They reiterated that Article 6 \u00a7 1 was not applicable to the proceedings at issue and thus the operation of the Foundation\u2019s bodies could not be examined under this provision. They further argued that the Foundation\u2019s organs which dealt with the applicant\u2019s case had been established in accordance with section 19 of the GFA and the Agreement of 16 February 2001 between the German and the Polish Foundation. Section 19 of the GFA stipulated that the partner organisations were to create appeals organs which were independent and subject to no outside instruction. The Partnership Agreement contained further detailed regulations in this respect. In so far as the appeal procedure was concerned, the Polish Foundation operated within the legal framework provided for by the GFA and the Partnership Agreement.",

The latter could review decisions taken by the partner organisation after the appeal procedure had been concluded. To this end the Polish Foundation had to allow the German Foundation access to the relevant documents at any time. If grossly incorrect decisions were discovered during such inspection, the Polish Foundation had to reopen the procedure and remedy the issue in a new decision. Furthermore, the German Foundation could quash the decisions of the Polish Foundation and reopen a case. The Government stressed that the German Foundation could have ordered an audit of the Polish Foundation. Therefore, it was the German Foundation which exercised real control over the Polish Foundation. The role of the Polish authorities was limited to assessing whether the Polish Foundation operated in conformity with the law.",

Even assuming that the German Foundation could to some extent verify the correctness of the decisions taken by the Polish Foundation, there is no evidence that it had been involved in reviewing decisions taken in the applicant\u2019s case. Thus, the Court, having regard to Article 10 of the GFA, reaffirms that for all practical purposes, decisions to grant payments in respect of the claimants who resided in Poland were taken by the Polish Foundation (see Wo\u015b v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), cited above, \u00a7 66; Jakowicz (dec.), cited above, \u00a7 76 in fine).",

Malta, 27\u00a0August 1991, \u00a7\u00a039, Series A no. 210; and Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a025781/94, \u00a7\u00a0233, ECHR 2001IV). In the present case, as regards structural guarantees, the Court notes that the members of the Verification Commission and the Appeal Commission were appointed and dismissed by the Foundation\u2019s management board and, in respect of the latter, in consultation with the Foundation\u2019s supervisory board. The Foundation\u2019s statutes also specified that the rules governing the operation of the Foundation\u2019s adjudicating bodies were to be set out in the regulations drafted by the management board and adopted by the supervisory board. The Foundation\u2019s governing bodies were in turn appointed and dismissed by the Government Minister at his or her full discretion (see paragraph 23 above). Furthermore, a degree of control and supervision over the Foundation was exercised by the Government Minister. Furthermore, it appears that the members of the Verification Commission and the Appeal Commission did not have tenure. Thus, the Court considers that the independence of the Foundation\u2019s adjudicating bodies, despite the Government\u2019s arguments to the contrary in respect of the Appeal Commission, was open to serious doubt. As regards procedural guarantees, it appears that the adjudicating commissions had no clear and publiclyavailable rules of procedure (see H v. , 30 November 1987, \u00a7 53, Series A no. 127B) and did not hold public hearings. For these reasons, they cannot be regarded as tribunals within the meaning of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1.",

However, the Court notes that until June 2007 the domestic courts\u2019 prevailing position, as confirmed in the Supreme Court\u2019s Resolution of 27 June 2007, was that judicial review by either administrative or civil courts in respect of the Foundation\u2019s decisions was excluded (see paragraphs 41-42 and 44 above). At this juncture, the Court observes that the Government also criticised the applicant for having failed to institute judicial proceedings against the Foundation in the civil courts prior to the adoption of the Supreme Court\u2019s Resolution. It notes, however, that the applicant was not obliged to pursue his claims before the courts, as such action would obviously have been futile, having regard to the settled caselaw of the domestic courts at the relevant period.",

The Supreme Court revisited the existing practice and held that claims against the Polish Foundation in respect of Nazi persecution were civil claims in the formal sense. Accordingly, the civil courts had jurisdiction to examine such claims. The Court very much welcomes such a positive development in the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law which, at least in part, was prompted by its judgment in the Wo\u015b case. However, as noted above (see paragraph 71 above), the applicant in this case was not required to attempt to seek judicial review of the Foundation\u2019s decisions as such a possibility arose only after he had lodged his application.",
