Given that to date any attempts to establish contact step by step had failed, his daughter was to reside with him immediately.

That rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention, that there is an effective remedy available in the domestic system in respect of the alleged breach. The only remedies which Article 35 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and which, at the same time, are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these various conditions are satisfied (see, among many other authorities, Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, \u00a7 15, ECHR\u00a02002VIII).",

Given the different nature and aims of the two provisions, the finding that a remedy is effective for a complaint about the length of proceedings under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is not decisive for the question whether this is also the case for a complaint under Article 8.",

Austria (dec.), no. 45983/99, 14 February 2006). The Court, while finding that failure to make use of the application under section 91 of the Courts Act led to non-exhaustion in respect of the length complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1, did not decide on the question whether section 91 of the said Act might also provide an effective remedy in respect of the complaint under Article 8. Instead, it noted that the applicant had reiterated her request to be granted custody several times and had, moreover, twice sought an interim order in order to prevent her husband from taking their son to Turkey. As such requests called by their very nature for a speedy decision, the Court was satisfied that the applicant had made sufficient use of remedies for her complaint under Article 8 of the Convention.",

On 15 June 2012, the Leoben Regional Court granted the applicant\u2019s appeal on the ground that the condition that accommodation be made available was no longer applicable and ordered D.P. to hand over the child within fourteen days, with enforcement measures to be taken in case of failure to comply. D.P. did not comply with the order but made use of the possibility of lodging an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court, which was rejected by that court on 13\u00a0September 2012 as the legal issues has already been clarified in the first set of proceedings.",

The Wiener Neustadt District Court attempted to obtain the co-operation of both parents, while threatening to make use of coercive measures should no negotiated solution be found. The first attempt was made on 4 October 2012, when the Wiener Neustadt District Court ordered both parents to indicate within two weeks whether they were prepared to take part in a hearing with the aim of finding an agreed solution for the child\u2019s return. The applicant indicated that he was not prepared to take part in the hearing. It appears that no steps were taken in November 2012.

Although almost a year had gone by since the applicant\u2019s request for his daughter\u2019s return, the Leoben District Court remained inactive for five and a half months until mid-February 2011, when it contacted the applicant and then the Italian central authority in order to establish whether accommodation for the applicant\u2019s daughter and her mother would be made available. Given that the Venice Youth Court\u2019s judgment had provided alternatives for the child\u2019s return either with or without her mother, the Court can accept that the Austrian courts gave preference to the first alternative which involved a less drastic interference with the family life between the applicant\u2019s daughter and her mother. However, no explanation has been provided for the District Court\u2019s failure to take action for a protracted period. The Court notes that in return proceedings far shorter delays give rise to concern. In the context of the Hague Convention any inaction lasting more than six weeks may give rise to a request for a statement of reasons for the delay (see, for instance, Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7102). The delay here at issue weighs all the more heavily, given that contacts between the applicant and his daughter had already broken off in mid-2009, The District Court must have been aware that any further delay might have irremediable consequences for the relationship between them.",

However, he only requested its enforcement on 19 March 2012. The request was refused by the Leoben District Court. While it is a normal occurrence for a court decision to be set aside on appeal, the Court notes that the District Court\u2019s decision triggered a new round of appeal proceedings before the Leoben Regional Court, which decided in the applicant\u2019s favour and finally opened up the possibility for D.P. to lodge a further appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court, although the relevant legal issues had already been resolved in the first set of proceedings.",

As follows from the considerations set out above, this situation was in part attributable to the lack of expedition in the Austrian courts\u2019 own handling of the case. Moreover, there had not been any contacts between the applicant and his daughter during this period.

Ultimately, faced with the unbending position of both parents, the District Court proceeded to the implementation of coercive measures.

To begin with, there was the lack of any reply by the Italian authorities in the first set of proceedings. The applicant\u2019s choice, though understandable, to make a request for enforcement of the Venice Youth Court\u2019s second judgment, meant that the whole range of remedies was again available to the parties. Finally, the fact that contact between the applicant and his daughter had been interrupted since mid-2009 made the authorities\u2019 task all the more difficult. The unbending position of both parents added further to the difficulty of the case. This became particularly apparent in the second set of proceedings, which were marked by the District Court\u2019s attempts to bring about co-operation between the parties, with the aim of avoiding coercive measures against the applicant\u2019s daughter. However, the Court reiterates that that the lack of co-operation between separated parents is not a circumstance which by itself may exempt the authorities form their positive obligations under Article 8 (see Diamante and Pelliccioni v. San Marino, no. 32250/08, \u00a7 176, 27 September 2011).",

In that context, it is of particular importance to note that so far no final decision has been taken which would conclude that return would be against the child\u2019s best interests. The issue whether circumstances have changed to such an extent that an enforcement of the Venice Youth Court\u2019s judgment is no longer justified is currently pending before the Venice Youth Court.",

In that connection, the Court has also repeatedly noted that the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent who does not live with it (see, for instance Keegan v.

Moreover, in a recent case relating to proceedings under the Hague Convention, the Court examined whether the procedural framework provided by the State was adequate to give effect to the object and purpose of that Convention (see, L\u00f3pez Gui\u00f3 v.\u00a0Slovakia, no. 10280/12, \u00a7\u00a7 106-111, 3\u00a0June 2014).

Moreover, as long as the return decision remains in force the presumption stands that return is also in the interests of the child (see, X. v. Latvia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 96-97).
