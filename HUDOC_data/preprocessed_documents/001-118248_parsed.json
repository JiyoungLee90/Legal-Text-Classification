In making settlement proposals the State Attorney\u2019s Office was guided by the forty-five\u00a0percent threshold established in the Court\u2019s case-law. The Court\u2019s decisions in such cases as Zajc and 4 others v. Slovenia (dec.), nos. 13992/03 etc., 6\u00a0May 2008, and Ke\u0161elj and 6 others v.

The Government also submitted a copy of a domestic court\u2019s judgement issued under the 2006 Act in one of the cases the Court had previously declared inadmissible for being premature (Carevi\u0107 v. Slovenia (dec.), no. 17314/03, 3 June 2008). In that case the domestic court had awarded the applicant compensation for non-pecuniary damage relying on comparable cases decided by the Court and applying the principle that the compensation was considered reasonable if it amounted to forty-five percent of the sum that would have been awarded by the Court.",

The order became enforceable on 16\u00a0October 2002. Since M.E. failed to comply with the access arrangements set out in the order, the Unit, at the applicant\u2019s request, ordered their enforcement subject to an administrative fine of approximately EUR 25 being imposed on her. As this was of no avail, several further requests for enforcement were made by the applicant thereafter and further administrative fines amounting to up to EUR 145 were imposed on M.E. (see paragraphs 14-16 above). However, these fines were never executed and the related decisions were ultimately quashed on procedural grounds. The access order, which had been enforceable since October 2002, therefore remained unenforced. New access arrangements were then determined by the interim access order, which was issued in the court proceedings in May 2006.",
