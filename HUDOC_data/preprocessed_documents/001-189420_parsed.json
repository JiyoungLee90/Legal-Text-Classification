Although Ar.M. withdrew from the case once the judge\u2019s identity became known and K.B. represented the British Council throughout the proceedings, the fact still remains that Ar.M. worked for the law firm Prudence, which represented the British Council. Moreover, the law firm was founded by the sister of Judge A.M. and managed by his brother-in-law.",

Croatia, no. , \u00a7 29, 27\u00a0June 2017). An automatic disqualification on the basis of such ties is not necessarily required. It is, however, a situation or affiliation that could give rise to misgivings as to the judge\u2019s impartiality. Whether such misgivings are objectively justified would very much depend on the circumstances of the specific case, and a number of factors should be taken into account in this regard. These should include, inter alia, whether the judge\u2019s relative has been involved in the case in question, the position of the judge\u2019s relative in the firm, the size of the firm, its internal organisational structure, the financial importance of the case for the law firm, and any possible financial interest or potential benefit (and the extent thereof) on the part of the relative (see Nicholas v. Cyprus, no. 63246/10, \u00a7 62, 9 January 2018). Given the importance of appearances, however, when such a situation (which can give rise to a suggestion or appearance of bias) arises, that situation should be disclosed at the outset of the proceedings and an assessment should be made, taking into account the various factors involved in order to determine whether disqualification is actually necessitated in the case. This is an important procedural safeguard which is necessary in order to provide adequate guarantees in respect of both objective and subjective impartiality (ibid., \u00a7 64).",

It is not known whether the sister and brother-in-law were actively involved in the case (compare Huseyn and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos.  and 3 others, \u00a7 168, 26 July 2011, and Bellizzi v.
