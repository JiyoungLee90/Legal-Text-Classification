In this regard, the Court reiterates that the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the alleged criminal activities of the applicant may be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings (see, G\u00f3rski v. , no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4\u00a0October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention (see, Celejewski, cited above, \u00a7 37). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources and to determine the facts and degree of alleged responsibility of each of the co-defendants, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the applicant's detention during the period necessary to terminate the investigation, to draw up the bill of indictment and to hear evidence from the accused. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning organised criminal gangs, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-accused, or otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high.",

However, the subsequent decisions to prolong the applicant's detention pending trial underlined the fact that these fears were well-founded, since the witnesses had informed the trial court about having been threatened by the defendants (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). Thus the Court accepts that the risk of intimidating witnesses actually existed and justified holding the applicant in custody at the later stages of the trial.",

In this regard, the Court observes that the proceedings were of considerable complexity, regard being had to the number of defendants, the extensive evidentiary proceedings and the implementation of special measures required in cases concerning organised crime. Nevertheless, the hearings in the applicant's case were held regularly and at short intervals. Furthermore, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the obstructiveness on the part of the defendants, including the applicant (see paragraphs 18 and 29 above), and some defence counsel had a negative impact on the progress of the trial. For these reasons, the Court considers that the domestic authorities handled the applicant's case with relative expedition.",
