The case originated in an application (no. 8024/08) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by EVT Company, a company based in Serbia (“the applicant company”), on 19 January 2008.
The applicant company was represented by Mr M. Cvetanović, a lawyer practising in Leskovac. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 8 March 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows.
On 28 April 1995 the applicant company filed a civil suit against S.M. (“the debtor”) for the payment of debt. On 2 February 2005 the Commercial Court (Trgovinski sud) in Leskovac ordered the debtor to pay to the applicant 6,590 Serbian dinars (RSD), which was approximately 82 euros (EUR) at the time of the delivery of the judgment, plus statutory default interest on account of the debt and RSD 92,442 (approximately EUR 1,154) for the costs of the civil proceedings. By 15 September 2005 this judgment became both final and enforceable.
On 24 October 2005 the applicant company filed with the Municipal Court (Opštinski sud) in Leskovac a request for the enforcement of the Commercial Court judgment by means of an inventory, valuation and sale of the debtor’s movable assets. On 26 October 2005 the Municipal Court issued an enforcement order. On 9 December 2005 the enforcement order was upheld on appeal.
On 16 March 2006 the bailiff made an inventory of certain movable assets found on the debtor. On 30 March 2006 the said property was seized. On 28 April 2006 the debtor sought return of the seized property, alleging that it belonged to a third person and offering other assets in its stead. On the same day the seized property was returned to the debtor, although no replacement assets were seized.
In the period from 20 July 2006 to 28 May 2007 the bailiff visited the debtor’s house and business premises six times, but no further attempts were ever made to make an inventory of her movable assets.
In the meantime, on 6 and 20 February, 2 October and 21 November 2006 the applicant company filed complaints about the delay in the enforcement proceedings with the Presidents of the Municipal, District and Supreme Courts, the Supreme Court’s Supervisory Board, the Supreme Council and the Ministry of Justice. On 25 October 2007 the Supreme Court’s Supervisory Board found that the impugned enforcement proceedings were excessively long and ordered their prompt completion.
On 15 November 2007 the applicant company filed a request for a change of means of enforcement in view of the failure of the authorities to enforce the judgment on the debtor’s movable assets. It proposed that the enforcement be carried out by means of seizure and sale of a family house registered in the name of the debtor’s husband. On 13 February 2008 the Municipal Court rejected the applicant company’s request and referred it to institute civil proceedings for determination of the debtor’s part in the family house in question. On 18 August 2008 this decision was upheld on appeal.
Since the applicant company’s request for a change of means of enforcement was rejected, the enforcement order of 26 October 2005 remained in force. No further steps were ever made to enforce that order.
This Act was in force from 22 February 2005 until 17 September 2011.
.  Article 5 provided that the court had to conduct the enforcement proceedings urgently, failure of which made the judge liable for unconscientious or unprofessional conduct.
Article 8 provided that the court could order the enforcement by those means and on those objects proposed in the request for enforcement or in the request for change of means of enforcement.
Articles 23 and 24 provided that a third person who claimed to have the property rights on an asset seized from a debtor in enforcement proceedings could lodge an objection or file a civil suit seeking declaration that a particular asset could not be subject of enforcement.
Under Article 58 a party to enforcement proceedings could have complained to the court against illegal or irregular acts of bailiffs, which acts could then be quashed.
Articles 69 – 97 set out in detail the enforcement by inventory, valuation and sale of a debtor’s movable assets. Article 73 § 2 specified that the debtor was considered the owner of property found in his or her possession unless a third party informed the court and proved his or her property rights on it. Article 73 § 5 provided that the spouses were considered owners of equal shares in all movable assets found in their house, flat, business premises or other immovable property. In addition, Article 79 provided that the court must terminate the enforcement proceedings if no assets which could be subject to enforcement were found during inventory.
Articles 98 – 153 set out in detail the enforcement by sale of the debtor’s immovable assets. Article 100 in particular, provided that the creditor had to submit, together with the request for enforcement, a certificate from the land registry that the immovable asset was registered in the debtor’s name.
On 17 September 2011 the new Enforcement Procedure Act came into force thereby repealing the Enforcement Procedure Act 2004. Article 358 provides that the enforcement proceedings instituted before this Act came into force will be continued pursuant to the provisions of the Enforcement Procedure Act 2011.
