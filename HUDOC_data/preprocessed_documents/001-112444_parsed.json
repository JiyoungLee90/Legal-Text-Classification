The court had erred in that it held that this provision should, by analogy, also be applied to roads, parking areas and similar infrastructure. This interpretation resulted from the functional interpretation of this provision according to which its purpose was to make it possible for housing co-operatives to acquire ownership of land owned by third parties. Thus, the courts had held that it would be inconsistent with that object and purpose to allow a claim for a compulsory sale order against the owner only with respect to the land on which houses had been built. The applicant argued that this approach, which disregarded the literal and clear text of the provision concerned and resorted instead to a functional interpretation, was unlawful.",

The principle that a tribunal shall be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is long-established in the caselaw of the Court (see, for example, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v.\u00a0Belgium, 23\u00a0June 1981, \u00a7\u00a058, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a043).",

In other words, the Court has recognised the difficulty of establishing a breach of Article\u00a06 on account of subjective partiality and for this reason has, in the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues, focused on the objective test. However, there is no watertight division between the two notions, since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (the objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (the subjective test).",

The Supreme Court was called upon to determine whether the judgment by which the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal had followed the legal view previously expressed by the judgment of that court in which Judge D.Z. sat as judge rapporteur. The Court is of the opinion that this legal view was decisive for the outcome of the case and the Supreme Court acknowledged it in its judgment (see paragraph 16 above). Thus, the same judge sitting on the bench of the Supreme Court was called upon to decide whether or not his legal interpretation or application of substantive law made in the previous decision given in the same case was to be upheld or not.",
