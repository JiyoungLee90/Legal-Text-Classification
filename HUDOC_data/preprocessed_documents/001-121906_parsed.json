A.L.N. said that the applicant had been informed of the steps likely to be taken to ensure her daughter's welfare on account of the applicant's lack of means. A.L.N. expressed the view that the temporary fostering of G.'s two brothers by the applicant's great-uncle should be discontinued on the (unsubstantiated) grounds that the latter was not suited to the task. She noted in her report that the applicant travelled every day to the vicinity of the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar children's home, where the child protection services had put in place a provisional arrangement consisting of three visits supervised by carers and by the police, away from the home, \u201cin anticipation of possibly violent conduct\u201d on the part of the applicant. The social worker stated in her report that the applicant had been given an unspecified sum of money in order to travel to Majorca and to Madrid. According to the social worker, the applicant had at first asked for the money but then refused it, throwing it on the ground. She had subsequently asked for money again, this time to travel to Granada, but had returned it three hours later out of a sense of pride. According to the report, during the three supervised visits the applicant had encouraged G. to continue crying and shouting in order to get what she wanted, had constantly accused the professionals of not providing her daughter with the appropriate assistance, had spoken to her daughter in a compulsive and incoherent manner, had not accepted the visiting hours and had screamed when the end of the visits approached, threatening also to take photographs in order to publicise the situation in a television programme. Describing the applicant's conduct during her visits to the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar children's home as \u201cviolent\u201d, and taking the view that it was disrupting the child's stability and development, A.L.N. proposed suspending the visits and moving G. to a different home, the address of which should not be disclosed to the applicant.",

Her appearance was very dirty, she wore clothes that were inappropriate for the summer weather and her skin was dry and marked with scars and scratches. She said that she lived among the reeds (en las ca\u00f1as), speaking of them as if they were her house; she also displayed anxiety about food and was receptive to any sign of affection. This provided ample justification for automatically placing her under guardianship and declaring her to have been abandoned. The child's situation is not new since both her older brothers are in foster care with a great-uncle owing to the risks to which they were being exposed. The file does not contain any objective evidence to suggest that the appeal [against the declaration of abandonment] should be allowed, particularly bearing in mind that a possible error could be damaging to the child, who deserves all possible protection, and that this consideration must prevail over any other interests.\u201d",

The judgment referred to the assessment of the evidence by the first-instance judge no. 16 and noted, among other things, that the psychological expert report submitted by the applicant on 18 December 2009 contained only information provided by the applicant herself, such as her supposed ability to look after her children, without explaining why two of her other children had been placed in foster care with her great-uncle. The judgment further observed that the report, while stating that the applicant did not suffer from any mental illness or disability, had noted her impulsive and irascible nature.

The possibility of placing the child in foster care within the extended family, which had at first been considered, had subsequently been rejected because the applicant's great-uncle was already overburdened. In the absence of any other options the administrative authorities had taken the decision to place the child with a foster family, a decision that had subsequently been endorsed by the courts. The mother had been represented by a lawyer throughout the judicial proceedings and her testimony had been taken into consideration, as had the evidence that had been adduced. The facts had been examined by the domestic courts in a completely non-arbitrary manner and all the decisions had been duly accompanied by reasons. In the Government's view, the child's abandonment had been genuine and had warranted the intervention of the administrative authorities, a fact subsequently acknowledged by the domestic courts.

Such a step must be supported by sufficiently sound and weighty considerations in the interests of the child (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7\u00a0148, ECHR 2000VIII). It has repeatedly held that Article 8 includes a parent's right to the taking of measures with a view to his or her being reunited with the child and an obligation on the national authorities to take such action (see, for example, Eriksson v. Sweden, 22 June 1989, \u00a7 71, Series A no. 156, and Olsson v. Sweden (no.\u00a02), 27\u00a0November 1992, \u00a7 90, Series A no. 250). Taking a child into care should normally regarded as a temporary measure to be discontinued as soon as circumstances permit, and any measures implementing temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the natural parents and the child (see K. and T. v.\u00a0Finland [GC], no. 25702/94, \u00a7 178, ECHR 2001VII). The positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible will begin to weigh on the competent authorities with progressively increasing force as from the commencement of the period of care, subject always to its being balanced against the duty to consider the best interests of the child. Furthermore, the positive obligations are not confined to ensuring that children can rejoin their parents or have contact with them, but also extend to all the preparatory steps to be taken to that end (see, mutatis mutandis, Kosmopoulou v. Grece, no.\u00a060457/00, \u00a7 45, 5 February 2004, and Amanalachioai v. Romania, no. 4023/04, \u00a7\u00a095, 26 May 2009).",

The Court notes that the judge rejected this proposal on the grounds that the applicant's greatuncle was not a suitable candidate for fostering minors, without giving any reasons for this assertion, but simply stating that the applicant's greatuncle would be \u201coverburdened\u201d since he was already taking care of the applicant's other two children (see paragraph\u00a034 above). As the applicant's great-uncle was not granted leave to take part in the proceedings, he did not have an opportunity to express his views on the subject.",

It observes that, despite the fact that the prosecutor with responsibility for minors supported the applicant in opposing the child's placement in pre-adoption foster care, that option was chosen on the sole ground of the lack of contact between the child and her mother over a period of several years, although the contact between them had ceased precisely as a result of the administrative and judicial decisions taken. The Court notes that in arriving at the conclusion, in its judgment of 18 June 2010, that the psychological expert report submitted by the applicant was not sufficient to demonstrate her capacity to look after her children, and in finding that there was no convincing evidence that the lack of attention initially observed in relation to the child would not recur, the appellate court did not deem it necessary to commission other reports or expert findings on the applicant's psychological state or her ability to raise her child. The Court considers that taking a child into care should normally be regarded as a temporary measure to be discontinued as soon as circumstances permit and that any measures of implementation of temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the natural parent and the child (see Johansen v. Norway, 7 August 1996, \u00a7 78, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III). It notes, however, that the applicant was forced to prove that she was a good mother to her child and that when she submitted evidence to that end the competent courts considered, without any supporting arguments, that it was insufficient to outweigh the assessment of the administrative authorities, which in the meantime had been upheld by a judicial decision.",

The Court observes in that regard that the passage of time made it very difficult to reverse a situation which could have been remedied by means other than separating the child from her mother and declaring her to have been abandoned.",

The applicant and her daughter last saw each other on 27 September 2005, and since then the applicant has constantly sought access to her daughter, both before the competent administrative bodies and before the domestic courts.",
