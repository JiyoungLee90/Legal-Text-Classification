After considering the first applicant\u2019s submissions, the court noted that the father had proposed that Marko would stay with him, while the first applicant would be authorised to use a house in Aranova for periods of fifteen to thirty consecutive days during the first year and subsequently for one summer month every other year (the first applicant would have to cover her own travel expenses and one half of the rent of the house in Aranova), during which time Marko would be staying with his mother, while the father would retain the right to visit him on a daily basis. Marko would be enrolled in a kindergarten which he had attended before his removal from . He would also attend a swimming pool he had used before his departure from . The father furthermore undertook to ensure that the child would receive adequate psychological help and would attend Russian-language classes for Russian children. The court considered such an arrangement adequate to fulfil the requirements of the Regulation and ordered an immediate execution of its decision to return Marko to  and to have him reside with his father. The court also pointed out that it would be preferable if the first applicant accompanied Marko on his way to Italy but, should that prove to be impossible, his return would be arranged by the Italian embassy in Latvia.

The Commission indicated that its role was not to analyse the substance of the Italian authorities\u2019 decisions \u2013 it was limited to appraising the compliance with the procedure which led to the adoption of those decisions with the procedural requirements of the Regulation. Nothing in the Regulation forbade the Italian authorities to come to a conclusion that was opposite to the one reached by the Latvian authorities. Quite to the contrary, the Commission considered that the Regulation gave the country of the child\u2019s residence prior to the abduction \u201cthe final say\u201d in ordering the return, even if his or her new country of residence had declined to order the return. In this regard the Commission noted that the R\u012bga Regional Court, when adopting the decision of 24 May 2007 (see above, paragraph 23), had referred to the Law of Civil Procedure, section 64419\u00a0(6)\u00a0(2) of which permits refusal to return a child if the child is well settled in Latvia and his or her return is not in his or her interests. The Commission questioned the Latvian court\u2019s alleged failure to invoke the \u201cmuch more binding\u201d Article 13 of the Hague Convention, which in their opinion demonstrated that the Latvian courts had devoted attention to Marko\u2019s situation in Latvia instead of the potential consequences of his return to Italy. In short, the Commission had \u201cnot discovered any indications\u201d that life in  together with his father would expose Marko to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation. What is more, the Commission considered that the Rome Youth Court in its decision of 21 April 2008 had directly addressed the R\u012bga Regional Court\u2019s concerns that the measures envisaged for Marko\u2019s protection upon his return to Italy were too vague \u2013 the Italian court had set out specific obligations on the father which would allow for balanced development of the child and for him to have contact with both parents.",

As to the applicability in the present case of the exception to the general obligation to return a wrongfully removed child that is contained in Article 13\u00a0(b) of the Hague Convention, the respondent Government analysed three possible justifications for non-return: firstly, the argument that Marko had settled in Latvia and adapted to life there and that his best interests required his continued residence with his mother; secondly, the allegation that the father had not had any contact with the child; and, thirdly, that because of the length of the Italian procedures the return of Marko to Italy and the restoration of the status quo ante was no longer possible.",

Furthermore, the Court has more than once found that an order for return, even if it has not been enforced, in itself constitutes an interference with the right to respect for family life (see, for example, Neulinger and Shuruk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a090-91, and Lipkowsky and McCormack v.

In the opinion of the Court, the order to drastically immerse a child in a linguistically and culturally foreign environment cannot in any way be compensated by attending a kindergarten, a swimming pool and Russian-language classes. While the father\u2019s undertaking to ensure that Marko receives adequate psychological support is indeed laudable, the Court cannot agree that such an external support could ever be considered as an equivalent alternative to psychological support that is intrinsic to strong, stable and undisturbed ties between a child and his mother.",
