The District Court rejected her request without giving any specific reasons thereon and further concluded in its judgment that the applicant\u2019s allegations about the lack of violence in her behaviour did not correspond to the evidence collected and that she had failed to prove her own version of events - whereas the other version of the events had been proved by the respondent.

In doing so it repeated the wording of the request to the effect that the case involved the interests of unspecified students in the school, and that holding the trial in public would adversely affect their education (see paragraph 8 above). Yet, it did not further elaborate on either of these points. The appeal court was also silent on the issue. Notably, there was no indication on how public proceedings concerning a labour dispute might have adversely affected the interests of juveniles. In this connection,\u00a0the\u00a0Court observes that the wording of the last sentence of\u00a0paragraph\u00a01\u00a0of\u00a0Article 6 of the Convention does not imply that the exclusion of the public with a view to protecting the interests of juveniles should be proved to be \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d in the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d of the case. However, even that reading does not absolve the judicial authorities from the general obligation to state reasons for their decision. In\u00a0the Court\u2019s view, sufficient reasons should be adduced by domestic courts in order to justify shielding the administration of justice from public scrutiny. This is a vital safeguard against arbitrariness. Moreover, this position is also endorsed in Russian law which requires a court to give a reasoned decision in respect of the holding of hearings in camera (see paragraph 29 above). Nevertheless, the\u00a0District Court failed to make any specific case for stating that the closure of the proceedings to the public was necessary to protect the interests of juveniles.",

Firstly, it is worth noting that the District Court held in camera not only the last hearing of 7\u00a0February 2003, mentioned by the Government, but all other hearings as well. Secondly, the holding of the hearings in camera was not linked to the intention of any specific minor, for example, Ms I. to testify in court. It can be seen from records of the case that Ms\u00a0I. was not examined during the court hearings, while Mr Kh. and Ms B. were heard in the absence of the parties. Thirdly, it does not appear from the Government\u2019s submissions that during the hearings the court sought to protect from the glare of publicity any private or otherwise sensitive information which was not mentioned later in the text of the judgment or the appeal decision, the latter being held in public. For example, in B. and P. v the United Kingdom (cited above, \u00a7 38) the Court held that proceedings in cases concerning the residence of the children following the divorce or separation of the parents were \u201cprime examples\u201d where private court hearings might be justified, in order to protect the privacy of the children and associated parties and to avoid prejudicing the interests of justice. In such cases, it is essential that the parents and other witnesses feel able to express themselves candidly on highly personal issues without fear of public curiosity or comment (ibid). However, that was not the position in the present case. In sum, the Court cannot see from the vague reasons adduced by the national court how the holding of the hearings in public \u201cwould have adversely affected Ms I.\u2019s mental condition, her relationship with the classmates\u201d and, more generally, \u201ctheir education\u201d.",
