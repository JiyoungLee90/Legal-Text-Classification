This is all the more evident as the only possibility left open to the monasteries is either to consent or to object to the sale of their urban property or the granting of a right in rem relating to it by the ODEP, without being able to decide the matter for themselves: such a decision belongs exclusively to the ODEP, which has unfettered discretion to determine, without even consulting the monasteries, the sale of agricultural land and \u2018the present and future utilisation\u2019 of their immovable property such as is provided for in section 7 of Law no. 1700/1987. As to the monasteries\u2019 movable property, some of which is extremely valuable (icons in monastery museums, precious relics, shares, etc.), they are managed by the ODEP without any restrictions whatever. Furthermore, it should be noted that Law no. 1700/1987 does not specify how the income from monastic property is to be applied; on the other hand, it appears from sections 2(2), 3(1)(B) and 9 of Law no. 1700/1987 that the State\u2019s revenue from the \u2018utilisation or granting of the use of monastic and Church property\u2019 is to be transferred to a private-law entity set up under section 9 which does not have any ecclesiastical objectives.

In the first place, the Government argued that the applicant monasteries were not non-governmental organisations within the meaning of Article 25 (art. 25) of the Convention. They pointed to the Orthodox Church\u2019s and its institutions\u2019 historical, legal and financial links with the Hellenic nation and State, which were reflected in the 1975 Constitution itself and in legislation, and to the considerable influence which the Greek Church currently had on the State\u2019s activities. The attribution of legal personality in public law to the Church and its constituent parts - including the monasteries - showed the particular importance attached to ecclesiastical matters. Furthermore, the Greek Orthodox Church and its institutions played a direct, active part in public administration; they took enforceable administrative decisions whose lawfulness was subject to review by the  like any other public authority\u2019s decisions. The monasteries were hierarchically integrated into the organic structure of the Greek Church; they were founded, merged or dissolved by a decree adopted after consultation of the archimandrite and approval by the Standing Holy Synod, on a proposal by the Minister for Education and Religious Affairs. The decisions of monastery councils had to be ratified by the supervising Church authority before they could take effect. Lastly, it was not decisive that the monasteries had legal personality distinct from that of the Church, witness the fact that it was possible for a State\u2019s international responsibility to be engaged on account of acts by legal entities distinct from that State.",

Like the Commission in its admissibility decision, the Court notes at the outset that the applicant monasteries do not exercise governmental powers.

Their objectives - essentially ecclesiastical and spiritual ones, but also cultural and social ones in some cases - are not such as to enable them to be classed with governmental organisations established for public-administration purposes. From the classification as public-law entities it may be inferred only that the legislature - on account of the special links between the monasteries and the State - wished to afford them the same legal protection vis-\u00e0-vis third parties as was accorded to other public-law entities. Furthermore, the monastery councils\u2019 only power consists in making rules concerning the organisation and furtherance of spiritual life and the internal administration of each monastery (section 39(4) - see paragraph 15 above).",

The expression \"deemed to be the property of the ... State\" did not mean that the State actually acquired ownership of the relevant property; that issue remained in abeyance until the rights asserted by the monasteries were satisfactorily established in law. The conclusion derived from a literal approach of this kind was confirmed by the context of the provision, in particular the legal protection afforded to the monasteries by section 4(4) and (7) of Law no. 1700/1987, which allowed them to prove their assertions before an objective and impartial authority, namely the courts. Moreover, it was for the State to choose the appropriate means of determining doubtful legal situations in the matter of ownership and to establish the procedure for that purpose.",

Section 3(1)(A) taken together with section 1(1) thus deprives them of the possibility of relying, in order to adduce proof to the contrary, on all the means of acquiring property provided for in Greek law and by which the applicant monasteries possibly accumulated their property, including adverse possession and even a final court decision against a private individual.

Undoubtedly, title deeds acquired during the Byzantine and Ottoman empires have been lost or destroyed.
