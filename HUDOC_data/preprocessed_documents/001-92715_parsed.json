It was the only copy of the judgment available to them for the preparation of their appeals. The Government did not dispute that. The Court notes further that it was not disputed by the parties that the Supreme Court as an appeal instance had based its examination on the thirty-one-page copy of the judgment (\u201ccopy 2\u201d), which it had received from the Chelyabinsk Regional Court. Furthermore, it transpires from the parties\u2019 submissions that copy 2 had been typed later than copy 1 and had rectified mistakes present in copy 1.",

It has found that there was indeed a substantial number of discrepancies between the two documents. In its opinion, however, these discrepancies are not material, and it has been unable to identify any change that would substantiate the applicants\u2019 complaints. The overwhelming majority of differences in the texts concern rectifications of spelling or grammar, or the addition of information that is not in itself significant. The Court notes that the applicants complain, inter alia, of the following changes, many of which occurred more than once: hand-written words in copy 1 have been typewritten in copy 2; correction of the initial letter of a sentence to upper-case; the use of the word \u201cas\u201d in place of the original hyphen; figures have been given as numerals rather than written in full (and vice versa); the inclusion of a given individual\u2019s initials with the surname in copy 2; the omission of a given individual\u2019s initials in copy 2; corrections of grammatical cases to comply with the rules of written Russian; the order in which individuals\u2019 surnames are listed; \u201cst.\u201d used in copy 2 instead of \u201cstreet\u201d (as in copy 1); altered word order in certain sentences; splitting up of a single long sentence into two sentences; the joining of two separate sentences as a single sentence; abbreviations written out in full; dates given in figures rather than in full; time references expressed in different forms; the correction of typing errors in individuals\u2019 names; a home address has been written in different ways; the regrouping of paragraphs; etc.",

According to the applicants, other discrepancies had intensified the accusations against them, making the perception of the judgment by the appeal court more unfavourable, and had rendered references to pages and lines in their appeals meaningless. However, a detailed examination of the discrepancies alleged to be significant indicates that most of the limited number of differences in question concern the order in which the defendants\u2019 names were listed, the use of different verbal forms (imperfective or perfective aspects, passive or active voice) or the use of plural rather than singular nouns (and vice versa). Certain words have been substituted (taken/undertaken, audio-cassettes/audio-recordings). The other examples are discussed below. The Court further notes that the applicants did not give specific examples of the connection between the discrepancies in the judgments and the points of their appeals. No tangible argument can be elicited from their submissions as to how these discrepancies had affected the appeal court\u2019s examination of the case to their detriment.",

In copy 1 of the judgment the same sentence refers to six million roubles. However, the applicants gave no indication to the Court as to the precise connection between this piece of evidence and their conviction, nor as to the impact of this discrepancy on their appeals. It is unclear why a lesser amount of money being involved, as indicated in the copy of the judgment examined by the appeal court, could have led to an assessment less favourable for the applicants. In another example the applicants complained of a difference in the spelling of the initials of one of the victims. However, it is unclear what problem this might have created for the applicant since in both copies that person is clearly identified with a reference to his post as a manager of a specific company. In another instance the applicants complained that copy 2 omitted one sentence mentioning audiotapes as evidence and individuals whose speech had been recorded. However, the text below in that copy contains a detailed description of what was recorded on those audiotapes, including the names of the relevant persons. Similarly, a missing paragraph of an article of the Criminal Code, under which, along with other provisions, the applicant Mr\u00a0Karyagin had been convicted, appears further down in the operative provisions of copy 2 of the judgment.",
