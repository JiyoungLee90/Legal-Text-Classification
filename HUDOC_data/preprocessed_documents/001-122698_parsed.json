Ukraine, no. 72286/01, \u00a7\u00a7 69-71, 28 March 2006; Yakovenko v. , no. 15825/06, \u00a7\u00a7 75-76, 25 October 2007; Koktysh v.

As regards the Government\u2019s additional contention that the domestic court\u2019s decision of 4 February 2009 was evidence of the efficiency of the judicial remedy, the Court notes that a copy of that decision has not been provided. Moreover, it appears that the Government are referring to the decision which has been examined by the Court in the same context and found to be of no relevance for the issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies since it was a single example of successful litigation in a case in which a violation had previously been found by this Court (see Petukhov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a043374/02, \u00a7 74-78, 21 October 2010, and Ustyantsev v. Ukraine, no.\u00a03299/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a056-58, 12 January 2012). In sum, there is no ground to assume that in the present case the use of the remedies mentioned by the Government could effectively address the applicant\u2019s issues. The Court therefore does not see any reason to depart from its previous approach, and dismisses the Government\u2019s objection.",

Ukraine, no. 32362/02, \u00a7\u00a7 56 and 57, 20 May 2010, with further references). The length of a period of detention may be a relevant factor in assessing the gravity of the suffering or humiliation caused to a detainee by the inadequate conditions of his detention. However, the relative brevity of such a period alone will not automatically exclude the treatment complained of from the scope of Article 3 if all other elements are sufficient to bring it within the scope of that provision (see Mkhitaryan v. , no. 22390/05, \u00a7 55, 2 December 2008).",

In particular, the Government disputed the applicant\u2019s submissions about overcrowding in the cell. They maintained that the cell in fact measured 17.7 sq. m, and that during the period under examination the overall number of detainees held therein did not exceed fifteen persons while between 19 June and 9 July 2007 the cell was usually occupied by thirteen detainees. The Government\u2019s figures therefore suggest that for most of the period of the applicant\u2019s detention there was less than 1.5 square metres of space per inmate in the applicant\u2019s cell. For the Court those figures indicate that the applicant was held in a severely overcrowded cell (see, for example, Yakovenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a084, and G.O. v. Russia, no.\u00a039249/03, \u00a7\u00a069, 18 October 2011).
