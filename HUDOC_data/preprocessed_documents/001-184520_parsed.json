The court considered that the available evidence was sufficient to hold that the applicant may have committed the crimes of which he was suspected. It held that the applicant might commit new crimes because he: was suspected of having committed a very serious crime that could lead to a long period of imprisonment; had no strong social ties; was unemployed and not enrolled in an educational institution; was not married; had been convicted two times before for crimes concerning the illegal possession of narcotic and psychotropic substances (which constituted a negative character trait); and acknowledged that he had been using narcotic and psychotropic substances. Moreover, there was a risk that the applicant might try to abscond, given that he had relations abroad. The court also found that the applicant might interfere with the criminal investigation because he was living with another suspect in the case, was buying narcotic and psychotropic substances from other persons, his role in the criminal organisation was quite active and there was a risk that he might try to influence other witnesses or suspects or that those persons might try to influence him. The court also stated that the case was extremely complex and a number of procedural actions had to be performed. It appears that the applicant did not appeal against this decision.",

The court also observed that although during the applicant\u2019s detention no investigative actions had been carried out with regard to the applicant, the records of the pre-trial investigation showed that various investigative actions had been performed in order to establish grounds for the suspicion in respect of the applicant (vehicles had been inspected, a chemical analysis of the substances found during the search of the applicant\u2019s flat had been performed, expert conclusions had been received, and other suspects \u2013 who had given testimony about the applicant \u2013 had been questioned).

However, the court held that there was no indication that the applicant might try to interfere with the criminal investigation, so it decided to strike it out from the list of grounds on which the applicant had been detained. Nevertheless, the grounds for detention listed in domestic law were alternatives \u2013 that is to say the existence of only one was enough for detention on remand to be imposed. The court also noted that in the course of the past three months, numerous procedural actions had been carried out: a number of suspects had been questioned, eyewitnesses had been identified, additional questioning of suspects had taken place, verification of testimony given at the crime scene had taken place, items significant for the pre-trial investigation had been examined, additional tasks (including the investigation of certain objects) had been scheduled, descriptions of the suspects had been collected. The court was convinced that sufficient grounds to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention on remand existed.",

He argued that before his arrest he had had a permanent place of residence with his father and a permanent income because he had been working as a long-distance driver, and that he had strong social ties and had not known any of the other suspects. He also claimed that the investigation was inactive and that there were no grounds to further detain him. However, on 16 September 2010 the applicant\u2019s appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. The court stated that when ordering detention on remand, a court was not establishing the applicant\u2019s guilt, and that the standard of evidence required for detaining him was thus lower. The court considered that there was enough information to believe that the applicant had committed the crimes he had been accused of. The court also agreed that the applicant might abscond or commit new crimes. Moreover, the court stated that it could not impose a more lenient restrictive measure because it could only uphold or quash the first-instance decision. The court also observed that, under domestic law, detention on remand could last longer than six months only when the case was especially complex or of a large scale. It found that in the applicant\u2019s case those conditions had been met: the investigation concerned a criminal offence committed by a criminal organisation, there were more than fifty suspects, and it was necessary to carry out numerous investigative actions.",

The applicant denied that he would commit new crimes just because he was unemployed. It was the applicant\u2019s view that if that were so then every unemployed person could be detained. He also claimed that his previous conviction should not have been taken into account when prolonging his detention on remand because he had been paying a fine imposed on him in that case and no one could be punished for the same offence twice. He also had a father and a brother, which showed his strong social ties. Finally, he had only been questioned twice in the nine months he had been detained.",

The court thus decided to re-categorise the applicant\u2019s offence under Article 260 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to twelve years of imprisonment and ordered him to pay a fine of EUR 4,443.",

The court held that the lower courts had drawn the right conclusions about the applicant\u2019s criminal activities. However, the Supreme Court assessed the sentence imposed in the light of the applicant\u2019s complaint about the length of criminal proceedings against him. The court held that the proceedings in respect of the applicant had lasted from 23 February 2010, when he had been arrested, until the adoption of the present judgment \u2013 that is to say seven years, eleven months and fourteen days, which was an extremely long period of time and could only be justified by exceptional circumstances. The court noted that the case had been extremely complex because there had been thirty-two co-accused, the case file had comprised 138 volumes, the firstinstance judgment had amounted to 480 pages and the judgment of the appellate court had amounted to 197 pages. In such a case the length of proceedings could be justified, but only if the relevant authorities reacted to the complexity of the case appropriately and undertook all relevant measures without undue delays. The court held that in the instant case the process followed by the Court of Appeal had not been effective. The firstinstance judgment had been delivered on 22 May 2014, and the case had been received at the Court of Appeal on 10\u00a0November 2014. However, at the first hearing on 19 February 2015 the Court of Appeal had decided to adjourn the case until 7 October 2015. During the hearing on 6 November 2015 the Court of Appeal had decided to apply to the relevant German authorities to be allowed to question one witness in Germany, and the next hearing was scheduled for April 2016. The reply from Germany had been received by the Court of Appeal on 10 February 2016; however, during the hearing on 7 April 2016 the next six scheduled hearings had been cancelled owing to the fact that the lawyers of eleven of the co-accused had been involved in other cases. The Court of Appeal had delivered its judgment on 24 April 2017. The length of the criminal proceedings in the present case was extremely important because the applicant had been detained on remand for almost four years. The Supreme Court held that in accordance with the case-law of the Court, the fact that the applicant had been held in detention on remand for such a long period of time, required particular diligence on the part of the authorities dealing with the case to administer justice expeditiously. The Supreme Court made references to the caselaw of the Court (Mato\u0144 v. Poland [Committee], no. 30279/07, \u00a7 29, 9\u00a0June 2009; Paskal v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 24652/04, \u00a7 58, 15 September 2011; Pawlak v.\u00a0Poland [Committee], no. 28237/10, \u00a7 46, 13 January 2015; and Tomczyk v.\u00a0Poland, no. 7708/12, \u00a7 41, 13 January 2015). The Supreme Court thus held that the unjustifiable length of criminal proceedings constituted grounds to impose a more lenient sentence on the applicant and ordered the applicant\u2019s imprisonment for eleven years and six months and ordered him to pay a fine of EUR 4,443.",

One of the characteristics of sufficient redress which may remove a litigant\u2019s victim status relates to the amount awarded as a result of using the domestic remedy. The Court indicates that an applicant\u2019s victim status may depend on the level of compensation awarded at domestic level on the basis of the facts about which he or she complains before the Court (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0180 and 202).",

Although the Court cannot apply the presumption of overcrowding automatically, it has, however, already accepted the conclusions of the CPT that overcrowding in Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison was further aggravated by deplorable conditions \u2013 dilapidated and dirty cells and furnishings, a lack of sufficient heating in winter, and poor ventilation (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 65 and 142, see also paragraph 63 above).

During the pre-trial investigation, fifty-eight expert reports had been ordered; there had been fifty examinations of certain objects; ninetyfour examinations of relevant items and twenty searches had been carried out; restrictive measures had been applied; the suspects had been questioned 194 times; eight persons had been detained; witnesses had been questioned forty-four times; witnesses and suspects had participated in the identification of 196 persons from photographs and had visited the crime scene twenty-four times to give testimony; and a search warrant had been issued in respect of one suspect and the authorities had applied to the authorities of Israel with an extradition request in respect of another suspect. During the examination of the criminal case on the merits, the chairman had set dates for twenty forthcoming hearings and had cooperated with the police and the prosecutors to inform the persons concerned of the dates of the hearings; the dates of those hearings had been coordinated six months in advance; the Vilnius Regional Court had taken steps to inform other courts of the dates of the hearings so that other hearings would not interfere with them and to ask for additional lawyers from the State Guaranteed Legal Aid Service in order to ensure that the hearings would not have to be adjourned owing to the lawyers being occupied by other cases; and the victims and witnesses had been brought to the court. Moreover, the hearings before the Vilnius Regional Court had been held regularly and there had been two to three hearings scheduled per month. The only longer breaks had been made during the summer period in 2012 and 2013 because of the holidays of participants in the proceedings, and the other hearings had been adjourned or cancelled for objective reasons: illnesses of judges, lawyers or suspects, or the inability of lawyers or suspects to participate. The Government referred to the case of Lisovskij (cited above) and argued that unlike that case, in the applicant\u2019s case the authorities had taken appropriate measures to schedule the hearings more efficiently and to ensure shorter intervals between them.",

The applicant had lodged eleven appeals against the extension of his detention on remand and had asked that a less restrictive measure be imposed but none of them had been satisfied. The applicant stated that he had had strong social ties with his father and brother and although he had quit his job before his arrest, he had been constantly looking for another job, and that the conclusions drawn by the courts about his income from criminal activities had thus been groundless. He furthermore claimed that after he had been placed under house arrest on 17 February 2014, he had found a job and had been given a positive character reference by his employer.",

The alleged loss of the applicant\u2019s victim status involves an examination of the nature of the right in issue, the reasons advanced by the national authorities in their decision, and the persistence of adverse consequences for the applicant after the decision (see Freimanis and L\u012bdums v.\u00a0Latvia, nos. 73443/01 and 74860/01, \u00a7 68, 9 February 2006).",

He was detained for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention until the restrictive measure imposed on him was changed on 17 February 2014 from that of detention on remand to house arrest (see paragraph 43 above). The Court reiterates that conditions of house arrest under Lithuanian law differ rather significantly from those which it has previously assessed, where it held that the imposition of house arrest, in view of its degree and intensity, had amounted to deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention (see Lisovskij, cited above, \u00a7 71, and the references therein; compare and contrast Buzadji v.\u00a0the Republic of Moldova\u00a0[GC], no. 23755/07, \u00a7\u00a7 104-05, ECHR 2016 (extracts)). In the present case the applicant was allowed to leave his home for most of the day (except for between 11 p.m. and 9 a.m.), he was allowed to work, and there were only limited restrictions on his public and social life (see paragraph 43 above); thus, the period to be considered as constituting that during which the applicant was deprived of his liberty ended at the point when the restrictive measure imposed on the applicant was changed from that of detention on remand to house arrest. Accordingly, the period of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand to be considered in the present case was three years, eleven months and twentyfive days (from 23 February 2010 until 17 February 2014).",

It is clear that the applicant in the present case had become a victim before he lodged the application with the Court. It was for the State to provide the applicant with adequate and sufficient redress in respect of his complaint in a timely manner \u2013 that is to say, before the Court examined the case. The Supreme Court did that by (i) acknowledging in a sufficiently clear manner the strain caused by the long duration of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand, and (ii) by balancing this consideration in favour of the applicant (see paragraph 51 above). In particular, the Supreme Court acknowledged the delays in the criminal proceedings against the applicant, assessed the authorities\u2019 actions throughout those proceedings and, having found that the courts had not acted with sufficient diligence, reduced the applicant\u2019s sentence by six months (see paragraph 51 above). It can therefore be said that the applicant was afforded explicit and quantifiable redress for the delays in proceedings and the long duration of his detention (see, a contrario, Anatoliy Tarasov, cited above, \u00a7 54).
