The authorities followed up on the applicant\u2019s complaint only after eighteen days (the applicant had to go on hunger strike to speed them up).

Russia, no.\u00a046956/09, \u00a7\u00a013435, 24\u00a0July 2014), a pre-investigation inquiry such as the one held in the present case could not be qualified as an effective investigation.",
