The reasons appear to have been limited to paraphrasing the reasons for detention provided for by the Code of Criminal Procedure, without explaining how they applied in the applicant\u2019s case. The courts did not explain why they believed that the applicant would abscond or re-offend, nor did they explain how she could tamper with evidence or witnesses. The automatic and blanket prolongation of the applicant\u2019s detention is further proved by the first several decisions \u2012 of March and April 2012 (see paragraph 9 above) \u2012 in which the courts re-used the same text. Besides that, the Court cannot but observe that the applicant\u2019s detention for almost twenty months appears to have been contrary to Article 186 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which limited the duration of pre-trial detention of minors to four months. The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that the applicant\u2019s detention on remand for almost twenty months was excessively long and was not based on relevant and sufficient reasons. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.",
