The case originated in an application (no. 49706/99) against Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Croatian national, Mr Rajko Rajak (“the applicant”), on 23 February 1999.
The applicant was represented by Mr Zoran Novaković, a lawyer practising in Zagreb (Croatia). The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Lidija Lukina-Karajković.
The applicant alleged that, contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, civil proceedings instituted by him had not been heard within a reasonable time.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 12 October 2000 the Chamber declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant but not the Government, filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).
On 18 June 1975 the applicant filed a civil action with the Rijeka District Court (Okružni sud Rijeka) against “Brodograđevna industrija 3. Maj”, a publicly-owned company in Rijeka, claiming payment for technical improvements and rationalisation of the working process. The District Court held hearings on 15 January and 8 June 1976.
On 16 December 1977 the case file was transmitted to a court expert who submitted his opinion on 5 January 1981.
On 9 December 1981 the Rijeka District Court decided that it did not have jurisdiction and consequently transferred the case to the Rijeka District Commercial Court (Okružni privredni sud u Rijeci). As that court also denied its jurisdiction, a conflict of jurisdiction arose and on 24 March 1982 the Supreme Court of Croatia (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) transferred the case to the Rijeka Employment Tribunal (Osnovni sud udruženog rada u Rijeci).
On 26 October 1982 the Rijeka Employment Tribunal held a hearing and on the same day delivered a judgment rejecting the applicant’s claim. The applicant appealed against the judgment, and on 11 May 1984 the Employment Appeal Tribunal (Sud udruženog rada Hrvatske) quashed the first instance judgment and remitted the case to the Rijeka Employment Tribunal.
That court held hearings on 2 April and 11 June 1985. On the latter date the court delivered its judgment, partly granting the applicant’s claim. Both the applicant and the defendant appealed against the judgment. On 27 December 1985 the Employment Appeal Tribunal again quashed the first instance judgment and remitted the case to the Rijeka Employment Tribunal, instructing it to allow the parties to question the expert at an oral hearing.
The Rijeka Employment Tribunal held hearings on 1 April, 11 November and 22 December 1986 and on 20 January 1987.
In the meantime, according to the Government, the Samobor Social Welfare Centre (Centar za socijalni rad u Samoboru) appointed to the applicant a guardian ad litem and instituted proceedings for a guardianship order. In those proceedings an expert opinion was requested from a neuro-psychiatrist working in the Vršac hospital. However, the expert died and the request for the guardianship order was withdrawn. The applicant then moved to Zagreb.
The applicant contests the Government’s submissions and claims that the presiding judge in his case before the Rijeka Employment Tribunal was the one who initiated the proceedings for the guardianship order. It was not due to the death of the expert appointed in that case that the proceedings were terminated, but due to the fact that on 30 September 1988 the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) rejected the request to issue a guardianship order as there had been no evidence presented before the court which could put into question the applicant’s capacity to represent his interests.
On 22 June 1986 the applicant unsuccessfully challenged the Rijeka Employment Tribunal for bias and requested that his case be dealt by a different court.
The next hearing in the Rijeka Employment Tribunal took place on 13 January 1987.
After the hearing on 17 March 1987 the court delivered its judgment granting the applicant’s claims in part. Both the applicant and the defendant appealed against the judgment. On 18 January 1990 the Employment Appeal Tribunal quashed once more the first instance judgment and remitted the case to the Rijeka Employment Tribunal.
The applicant then challenged all employment tribunals in Croatia for bias and requested that a non-Croatian court deal with his case. On 18 October 1991 the Employment Appeal Tribunal rejected his request.
In 1991 all employment tribunals were abolished and the case was transferred to the Rijeka Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Rijeci).
During the hearing held on 30 June 1992 the applicant specified his claim seeking USD 280,000 for technical improvements and USD 1,500,000 for non-pecuniary damage caused by mental suffering. He also claimed USD 500,000 for pecuniary damage caused by the defendant’s failure to make use of his patents, which would have brought the applicant USD 500,000 per year, and USD 60,000 for loss of earnings.
During the hearing held on 15 September 1992 the Rijeka Municipal Court, upon the applicant’s motion, decided that it had no jurisdiction regarding certain of the applicant’s claims.
On 27 September 1993 the Rijeka Municipal Court decided that another expert opinion be submitted by the Rijeka Engineering Faculty (Strojarski Fakultet u Rijeci). The applicant objected and asked that an expert opinion be submitted by an institution from Slovenia.
On 11 February 1993 the Supreme Court of Croatia (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) quashed the above decision.
At the next hearing on 1 April 1996, the Rijeka Municipal Court considered that a new expert opinion was needed and appointed a company from Samobor (Croatia) to act as an expert. The applicant objected and requested that D. B. be appointed as expert instead. The court also ordered the applicant to pay an advance for expenses related to the expert opinion.
By letter of 21 March 1998 the applicant made further specifications to his claim.
During the next hearing on 18 May 1998 the court decided that the decision appointing the expert would be issued in writing.
On 22 July 1999 the court adjourned the case until 1 October 1999 as the applicant’s counsel was on annual leave. During the hearing on 1 October 1999 the defendant was ordered to submit further documentation to the case file.
During the hearing on 1 March 2000 the court concluded the trial.
On 12 May 2000 the court pronounced judgment rejecting the applicant’s claim due to his failure to pay the advance for expenses for the new expert opinion.
On 29 May 2000 the applicant appealed against the judgment. On 25 October 2000 the Rijeka County Court (Okružni sud u Rijeci) quashed the first instance judgment. The case appears to be presently pending before the court of first instance.
