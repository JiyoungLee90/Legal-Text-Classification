Italy judgment of 26 February 1993, Series A no. 257-B, p. 20, \u00a7 27). To that end Article 6 requires a tribunal falling within its scope to be impartial. Impartiality normally denotes absence of prejudice or bias and its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways. The Court has thus distinguished between a subjective approach, that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction or interest of a given judge in a particular case, and an objective approach, that is determining whether he or she offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 1\u00a0October 1982, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a053, \u00a7\u00a030 and Kyprianou v.

The principle that a tribunal shall be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is long established in the case-law of the Court (see, for example, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p.\u00a025, \u00a7\u00a058).",

In this respect even appearances may be of some importance (see Castillo Algar v.\u00a0Spain, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, p.\u00a03116, \u00a7 45 and Morel v. France, no. 34130/96, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2000VI). When it is being decided whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular body lacks impartiality, the standpoint of those claiming that it is not impartial is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether the fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Ferrantelli and Santangelo v.\u00a0Italy, judgment of 7 August 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 951-52, \u00a7 58, and Wettstein v.

In particular, it is not prima facie incompatible with the requirements of this provision if the same judge is involved, first, in a decision on the merits of a case and, subsequently, in proceedings in which the admissibility of an appeal against that decision is examined (Eur. Comm. HR, R.M.B. v. the United Kingdom, No. 37120/97, dec. 9 September 1998). The assessment of whether the participation of the same judge in different stages of a civil case complies with the requirement of impartiality laid down by Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to be made on a case-to-case basis, regard being had to the circumstances of the individual case and, importantly, to the characteristics of the relevant rules of civil procedure applied to the case. In particular, it is necessary to consider whether the link between substantive issues determined in a decision on the merits and the admissibility of an appeal against that decision is so close as to cast doubt on the impartiality of the judge.",
