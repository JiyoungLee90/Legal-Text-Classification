Furthermore, it had not been argued that the applicant was a public figure. While the article primarily concerned J.N., it did not refer to him as a person carrying out any active political functions. Therefore, the interference in the applicant\u2019s private life could not be justified by a reference to society\u2019s right to be informed of the activities of a public person. Having found a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to private life, the court ordered the editor-in-chief to publish an apology on pages one, four and five of the magazine, and to pay compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the amount of 700\u00a0Latvian lati (approximately 1,000 euros (EUR)).",

The 2003 article had also featured the applicant\u2019s photographs, to which she had not objected. The applicant\u2019s attitude towards publicity had also been demonstrated in a subsequent interview, published in a different magazine in 2005, where she had given information about her private life, relationship with J.N., stance towards marriage, and her opinions as an activist for gender equality.

While freedom of expression includes the publication of photographs, this is nonetheless an area in which the protection of the rights and reputation of others takes on particular importance, as the photographs may contain very personal or even intimate information about an individual and his or her family (see Lillo-Stenberg and S\u00e6ther cited above, \u00a7\u00a030, and Rothe v. Austria, no.\u00a06490/07, \u00a7\u00a047, 4\u00a0December 2012). The task of imparting information necessarily includes \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d, as well as limits which the press must impose on itself spontaneously. Wherever information bringing into play the private life of another person is in issue, journalists are required to take into account, in so far as possible, the impact of the information and pictures to be published prior to their dissemination. Certain events relating to private and family life enjoy particularly attentive protection under Article\u00a08 of the Convention and therefore merit particular prudence and caution when covering them (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a089 and 140).",

However, such protection may cede to the requirements of Article\u00a08 where the information at stake is of a private and intimate nature and there is no public interest in its dissemination. Articles aimed solely at satisfying the curiosity of a particular readership regarding the details of a person\u2019s private life, however well known that person might be, cannot be deemed to contribute to any debate of general interest to society (see\u00a0Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 89 and\u00a0100, see also Standard Verlags GmbH v.

While J.N. did hold a post in a political party, at the time of the impugned article that party held no seats in Parliament and J.N. did not exercise any official functions. Furthermore, at the time of the impugned article, in November 2004, time had passed since the events covered by the press in 2003, such as the dissolution of J.N.\u2019s marriage and the fact that he had the first child with the applicant (see paragraph 6 above). Accordingly, it has not been substantiated that J.N.\u2019s private life as such was among the issues that affected the public in November 2004 (compare Tammer\u00a0v.\u00a0Estonia, no.\u00a041205/98, \u00a7\u00a068, ECHR\u00a02001I).",

The domestic courts considered that J.N. was a public figure. Such status was not attributed to the applicant.

A fortiori, a failure to challenge a less intrusive article cannot be relied on to justify more invasive articles in future (see Egeland and Hanseid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62). Furthermore, even when persons have made public some private information about themselves, the manner in which it is subsequently portrayed has to be justified in the circumstances of the case (see Tammer, cited above, \u00a7 66). The person having given interviews does not dispense the State from its positive obligation to protect the person\u2019s privacy, as seeking to avail of media to share information in a setting the person has selected cannot, in principle, be held against him or her (compare Peck v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a044647/98, \u00a7\u00a086, ECHR 2003I, where the applicant made media appearances to expose and complain about a wrongdoing against him).",

Noting particularly the differing levels of intrusion, the Court considers that the failure to challenge that article could not have been relied on in the impugned proceedings concerning the covertly taken photographs that depicted a very private moment in the applicant\u2019s life with her second baby. The Court also observes the narrative and temporal gap between the two articles: the impugned article addressed the birth of the applicant\u2019s second child and could not have been viewed as showing that the awaited event mentioned in the 2003 article, which concerned the applicant\u2019s pregnancy with the first child, had taken place (contrast the domestic courts\u2019 reasoning in paragraphs 15 and 21 above). Lastly, the applicant\u2019s subsequent interview in a different magazine approximately a year after the impugned article did not change the nature of the interference caused by the publication of that article and could not have been relied on to justify the prior disclosure of private information (compare Peck, cited above, \u00a7\u00a086). Also the applicant\u2019s acknowledgment that the public took an interest in her owing to the public-person status of her partner could in no way be viewed as a posterior consent to the publication of the covertly taken photographs.",

With respect to the present case the Court considers that the applicant did not lay herself open to the possibility of having her photograph taken in the context of an activity that was likely to be recorded or reported in a public manner. The domestic courts did not take into account that the applicant needed to traverse the public space between the hospital\u2019s entrance and her car in order to bring her newborn child home. This inherently private event was not an activity with respect to which the applicant should have anticipated publicity. In such circumstances an effective protection of a person\u2019s image presupposes obtaining the consent of the person concerned at the time the picture is taken and not only if and when it is published. Otherwise an essential attribute of personality is retained in the hands of a third party and the person concerned has no control over any subsequent use of the image (see Reklos and Davourlis (cited above), \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037 and 40).",

The Court draws attention to the applicant\u2019s submissions, which were not contested by the Government, that after leaving the hospital grounds she had noticed that they had been covertly filmed from a car with tinted windows, which had followed them to their home and had continued observing them in their garden. The Court observes that the domestic courts did not address the fact that such an experience, particularly so soon after childbirth, could have caused feelings of anguish and helplessness. Similarly, they did not analyse whether such conduct was compatible with the duties and responsibilities associated with the exercise of the freedom of expression, triggering the State\u2019s positive obligation to adopt measures securing respect for private life.",
