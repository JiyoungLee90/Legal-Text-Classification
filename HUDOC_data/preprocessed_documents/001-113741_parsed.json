According to the decision to bring charges, two police officers, N.J. and G.A., had seen a young man running down the street at around 2:15 a.m. with a mobile phone in his hand, being \u201cchased\u201d by two women (who turned out to be his wife and a friend). Before the young man could get into a car parked at the end of the road, the two police officers had stopped and questioned him to find out why he was running and to whom the mobile phone belonged. At that point the applicant had got out of the car and, together with another young man, B., his friend, had begun to verbally and physically attack the police officers. The police had been unable to calm them down and the applicant and his friend had torn the police officers\u2019 shirts and jumpers during the struggle. The police had called for backup and, after several colleagues had arrived as reinforcements, had managed to arrest the offenders. Once placed in custody in a temporary detention centre, the offenders had continued to verbally and physically attack the police. In particular, the applicant had delivered a punch to the left eye of a police officer, A.Ts., who had accompanied him to the investigation room to take care of some procedural matters.",

This institutional connection between the investigators and those implicated by the applicant in the incident, in the Court\u2019s view, raises legitimate doubts as to the independence of the investigation conducted (see Tsintsabadze v. Georgia, no. 35403/06, \u00a7 78, 15 February 2011). The fact that the prosecutor made no attempts to scrutinize the investigator\u2019s account of the incident further undermines the effectiveness of the investigation (see, Matko v.

It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to examine the circumstances for or against the existence of such an imperative interest, and to set them out in their decisions on any applications for release.

Having regard to the lack of such sufficient reasoning in the domestic court\u2019s decision to remand the applicant in custody (see, a contrario, \u0160uput v. , no.\u00a049905/07, \u00a7\u00a0100, 31 May 2011), the Court is not prepared to accept that the danger of absconding constituted a valid ground for the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention.

It notes that the applicant\u2019s friends were among the key witnesses in the criminal case against him. In such circumstances, the applicant\u2019s ability to influence them could not be excluded and consequently, the Court cannot but consider the existence of such a risk as real.",
