In Kudla v. Poland (judgment of the Grand Chamber, 26 October 2000, application no.\u00a030210/96) the ECtHR has expressed the view that the domestic remedy that is available to the applicant for protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time can be considered effective in terms of Article 13 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ... if it prevents the alleged violation or its continuation or provides adequate redress for any violation that had already occurred (\u00a7 158). In the ECtHR\u2019s view, Article 13 of the Convention offers an alternative: a remedy is effective if it can be used to either expedite a judicial decision before the violation occurs, or ensure adequate redress for delays that have already occurred (\u00a7 158).",

Since it therefore appears that the court president can find such a request well-founded only if he or she agrees with the requesting party that the court did not decide within a reasonable time, it seems that the purely acceleratory remedy in question may be granted only if the length of proceedings has already been excessive. Accordingly, it would appear that if a party to judicial proceedings would resort to it in order to prevent the impending violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, such request would be dismissed as ill-founded. It follows that this purely acceleratory remedy can only prevent further violations of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time in the proceedings in which such a violation has already occurred.",

Austria, no. 30160/96, 30 January 2001; Basic v. Austria, no. 29800/96, ECHR 2001I; and Rau\u0161 and Rau\u0161-Radovanovi\u0107 v. Croatia (dec.), no.\u00a043603/05, 2 October 2008). Those remedies can be lodged sixty days (in Croatia) or six months (in Austria) after the institution of such proceedings. They are thus clearly capable of preventing a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time before it occurs.\u201d",

That being so, and having regard to the relevant principles established in its case-law, in particular that an acceleratory remedy, when used to speed up proceedings which have already lasted too long, will be considered effective only if accompanied by a compensatory remedy (see\u00a0paragraph 94 above), the Court considers that the purely acceleratory remedy under the 2013 Courts Act when applied alone, without the possibility of recourse to the complementary remedy cannot be considered effective.",
