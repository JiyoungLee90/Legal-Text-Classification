Further, in its Greens and M.T. judgment, the Court explained that the award made in respect of costs in that case was limited to the proceedings before it and reflected the fact that extensive written submissions had been lodged in the context of the written proceedings in the case. By contrast, the present cases were processed by the Court under a simplified procedure and, following the Firth and Others judgment, the Court\u2019s approach to such follow-up cases was clear. In particular, the Court does not accept that there was any need for legal assistance to consider the implications of the Firth and Others judgment, since that judgment was both concise and unambiguous.",
