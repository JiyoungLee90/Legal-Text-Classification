Of even greater significance was the fact that the police rejected the proposal of the applicant to confess in return for the release of G, which the solicitor conveyed to the applicant. With no room for ambiguity or misunderstanding in this respect, the response of the police was sufficient to refute the argument about inducement or threat. Nor did the Court of Appeal accept that, during the course of the interviews, the police resorted to implied inducement or threat. It considered that, as found by the trial judge, the transcripts showed the police trying to appeal to his better nature and to his essential humanity. This interpretation of the evidence was borne out by the applicant\u2019s gesture of remorse following the fifteenth interview (see paragraph 14 above). It was also supported by the fact that the applicant had retained a degree of precision and control over the admissions he was prepared to make. He provided certain precise details to the police about his own actions but gave nothing away about the other persons implicated in the murder. The fact that he did not ask about G\u2019s release after admitting the murder further suggested that there was no element of inducement. It concluded on this point:",

He then summarised the position in the different jurisdictions of the United Kingdom, noting that in each of them provision was made for solicitors to be present during questioning. In view of all of this material, he saw a \u201csignificant shift in the acknowledgment of this right across other diverse legal regimes\u201d:",

To the reservation that this position has not been definitively spelled out, I believe that if the settled and current trend of dealing with the availability of legal protection should continue, then it is more likely than not that the outcome of any case where the precise point was directly in issue would support the conclusion which I have arrived at. Of course this anticipation may be wrong, but, even if so, the existing state of jurisprudence is of such force in this regard that such of itself is highly influential in calling for such a right. ...\u201d",

Viewed in that light, I am driven to the conclusion that such an important and fundamental standard of fairness in the administration of justice as the right of access to a lawyer must be deemed to be constitutional in it origin, and to classify it as merely legal would be to undermine its importance and the completeness of the protection of it which the courts are obliged to give.\u201d",

It is clear that the ECtHR takes such a view. It must, of course, be recalled that, in many civil law countries, there are formal parts of the investigative process which are judicial or involve prosecutors who have a quasi-judicial status. The line between investigation and trial is not necessarily the same in each jurisdiction. Furthermore, it is important to emphasise a potential distinction between a formal investigation directly involving an arrested suspect and what might be termed a pure investigative stage where the police or other relevant prosecuting authorities are simply gathering evidence.",

Thereafter the suspect is no longer someone who is simply being investigated by the gathering of whatever evidence might be available. Thereafter the suspect has been deprived of his or her liberty and, in many cases, can be subjected to mandatory questioning for various periods and, indeed, in certain circumstances, may be exposed to a requirement, under penal sanction, to provide forensic samples. It seems to me that once the power of the State has been exercised against a suspect in that way, it is proper to regard the process thereafter as being intimately connected with a potential criminal trial rather than being one at a pure investigative stage. It seems to me to follow that the requirement that persons only be tried in due course of law, therefore, requires that the basic fairness of process identified as an essential ingredient of that concept by this Court in State (Healy) v.\u00a0Donoghue applies from the time of arrest of a suspect. The precise consequences of such a requirement do, of course, require careful and detailed analysis. It does not, necessarily, follow that all of the rights which someone may have at trial (in the sense of the conduct of a full hearing of the criminal charge before a judge with or without a jury) apply at each stage of the process leading up to such a trial. However, it seems to me that the fundamental requirement of basic fairness does apply from the time of arrest such that any breach of that requirement can lead to an absence of a trial in due course of law. In that regard it seems to me that the Irish position is the same as that acknowledged by the ECtHR and by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d",

The applicant submitted that he was vulnerable as he was inexperienced in the interrogation process. The absence of his solicitor from the interrogations meant that the police were able to pressure him to give his confession which was ultimately relied upon at trial. The applicant recognised that he had been cautioned and advised of his right to remain silent at the beginning of each interview. He argued, however, that the interviewers sought to undermine his caution in a manner calculated to instil fear and anxiety and erode his will not to self-incriminate. In view of the above, he was deprived of a fair trial.",

Turkey ([GC], no.\u00a036391/02, \u00a7\u00a055, ECHR 2008). Concerning inducement, they emphasised that under Irish law, a strict exclusionary rule applies to any statement made involuntarily by an accused (see the People (DPP) v. McCann, [1998] 4\u00a0IR\u00a0397). As regards the protection against self-incrimination, the Government contested the applicant\u2019s version of events. Pointing to the finding of the trial court, which had viewed the video recordings of the interviews, it emphasised that the latter had found that the applicant was in full control of himself throughout the interviews and that he had made the admissions he did because he chose to do so. That was, furthermore, the position articulated by the applicant in his 20th interview. The Government concluded that even assuming that the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer had been restricted, with reference to the factors set out in Ibrahim and\u00a0Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a0574, 13\u00a0September 2016) the overall fairness of his trial was not irretrievably prejudiced.",

The lawyer must be able to confer with his or her client in private and receive confidential instructions. Second, suspects have the right for their lawyer to be physically present during their initial police interviews and whenever they are questioned in the subsequent pretrial proceedings. Such physical presence must enable the lawyer to provide assistance that is effective and practical rather than merely abstract, and in particular to ensure that the defence rights of the interviewed suspect are not prejudiced (see Beuze, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 132-134 and Soytemiz v.

Firstly, the evidence against the applicant was not restricted to the details of the crime he provided or to his admissions. At trial, that evidence formed part of a substantial prosecution case against the applicant, including ballistic evidence, evidence about the car the applicant had travelled in on the night of the murder, the evidence which had been provided by Ms. G. to whom the applicant had made inculpatory remarks prior to his arrest and further evidence by a witness, C., to the effect that she had been present when the killing had been ordered and who, the day after the murder, had heard the applicant confirm that he had carried it out (see paragraph 23 above). The Supreme Court\u2019s examination of this aspect of the applicant\u2019s trial was also very thorough and by a majority of six to one it concluded that the applicant\u2019s conviction was based on a voluntary confession of his guilt, supported by significant independent evidence (see, for example, paragraph\u00a038 above). Secondly, it cannot be said that the applicant\u2019s statements were made without him having had access to legal assistance. As indicated previously, he consulted with his lawyer prior to his police interviews and during the days when he was being interviewed. After the fourteenth interview he consulted with his lawyer in person and during the fifteenth interview, just before making his first admission, questioning was interrupted in order to facilitate further consultation. Thus, while one aspect of his right had undoubtedly been restricted, he had been provided with legal assistance from the outset.",

The directions of the trial judge were of particular importance given that their purpose was to enable the jurors to assess the consequences, for the overall fairness of the trial, of any procedural defects that may have arisen at the investigation stage. The trial judge instructed the jury to be careful when considering the evidence and underlined their obligation to examine neutrally the question of whether the applicant had been induced to confess to the crime, with a detailed explanation of what that meant in the circumstances. The judge also warned the jury that it may be dangerous to convict a person on confession evidence alone without corroboration. The judge went on to explain in detail why that was the case, and what corroboration evidence meant in the circumstances. The applicant also had an opportunity to challenge the content of the Judge\u2019s Charge before the Court of Appeal which that court rejected (see paragraph 30 above).",

Such a restriction was determined to have irreparably prejudiced the proceedings and thereby constituted a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention.

Accordingly, in accordance with (what I consider to be the \u201ccorrect\u201d interpretation of) Salduz, the Court ought to have determined that, due to the absence of any compelling reasons to justify the applicant\u2019s restricted access to a lawyer (paragraph 84), there has been a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) in this case.",

The Beuze case introduced a two-step test, in accordance with which the Court ought first of all to consider whether there are compelling reasons that justify restricting an applicant\u2019s access to a lawyer. In the absence of such compelling reasons, the Court will merely apply a \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d to the second stage of the test (Beuze, paragraph 145), which requires an assessment of the overall fairness of the proceedings. In accordance with Beuze, regardless of the reasons (or lack thereof) for restricting an applicant\u2019s access to a lawyer, the Court will thus always conduct an assessment of the overall fairness of the proceedings in question in order to determine whether there has been a violation of Article 6.",

The most primitive calculation thus suggests that for every hour of police interview the applicant had on average 1 minute and 21 seconds of communication with his solicitor; therefore, for every hour of \u201cdrowning in an avalanche of questions\u201d, as Ha\u0161ek elegantly put it, the applicant only received 1 minute 21 seconds of legal \u201cadvice\u201d. Can we accept that this allowed for a meaningful exchange of information? That this allowed for the consideration of different defence strategies? Can we allege that a thorough discussion of the applicant\u2019s previous interview and preparation for the subsequent one took place each time? It is noteworthy that even during the applicant\u2019s crucial 15th interview, prior to making his confession, his communication with his solicitor lasted for only 4 minutes. In such circumstances, could the applicant\u2019s solicitor have explained in detail all of the consequences of his confession or have carefully discussed all the options open to the applicant?",

In the present case, not only was it impossible to establish any \u201cclose tie of trust and sincerity\u201d, and not only was any required effectiveness obviously missing, but in principle the circumstances constituted a complete mockery of legal assistance. Whilst it is not at all my task to assess the solicitor\u2019s professional conduct in this case, consideration of the restriction of the applicant\u2019s defence rights is undoubtedly relevant to an assessment of the overall fairness of proceedings.
