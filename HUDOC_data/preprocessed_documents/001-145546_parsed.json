The Court\u2019s role is to rule not on guilt under criminal law or on civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the High Contracting Parties of their engagements to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or predetermined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see, inter alia, Nachova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], nos.\u00a043577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 147, ECHR 2005-VII, and Mathew v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a024919/03, \u00a7 156, ECHR 2005IX).",

Furthermore, whilst they had never encountered any difficulties before, their papers had suddenly no longer been in order. This was further evidence that the actions of the Russian authorities had been sufficiently numerous and well organised to conclude that there had been a pattern of violations, ruling out the contention that these had been exceptional and isolated cases. The existence of an administrative practice became especially obvious if regard was had to the increased number of Georgian nationals expelled in the autumn of 2006 compared with the previous or following months and years. This was also corroborated by the fact that the respondent Government had not contested that they had suspended postal services with Georgia, and that on 5 November 2006 the Federal Assembly (bicameral legislature) of the Russian Federation had toughened the measures enacted against violations of immigration law. Lastly, the applicant Government referred to the reports of several international governmental and non-governmental organisations (including in particular that of HRW) and the media on the problem of racism and xenophobia in the Russian Federation generally as well as the anti-Georgian policy which had manifested itself in the autumn of 2006.",

The applicant Government referred in particular to the annual report of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Russian Federation for 2006. Lastly, requests for lists of Georgian pupils with a view to identifying their parents had been sent by Russian officials to a number of schools in the Russian Federation. The fact that the persons making such requests, which were clearly illegal, had not been duly punished was further proof of the discriminatory policy conducted against Georgian nationals in the autumn of 2006.",

Moreover, the Georgian nationals had not been summoned before the relevant authorities of the Ministry of the Interior and a large number of them had been able to leave the Russian Federation by their own means. Lastly, every Georgian national against whom proceedings had been brought for an administrative offence and who had been the subject of an administrative expulsion order had had his or her case individually examined in accordance with Russian law. The respondent Government challenged the credibility of the statements of the Georgian witnesses in that connection and referred to those of the Russian officials. According to the respondent Government, the present case more closely resembled the case of Sultani v. France (no. 45223/05, ECHR 2007IV (extracts)) because, as in that case, the respondent Government had organised, in October 2006, special direct flights transporting Georgian nationals between Moscow and Tbilisi on the basis of agreements with the Georgian embassy in the Russian Federation, owing to the fact that air links between the Russian Federation and Georgia had been suspended. The expulsion of illegal immigrants and persons who had otherwise infringed the statutory provisions on residence in Russian territory was a sovereign right and an obligation of the Russian State in order to guarantee national and international security.",

All the above-mentioned factors lead to the conclusion that mass expulsion was clearly employed for ulterior motives and should thus per se constitute an abus de droit.

These facts cannot be disregarded, especially in conjunction with the conditions and treatment that the expellees were subjected to first in the detention facilities and subsequently in the buses/vans. Specifically, harsh transport conditions became a tool for the relevant authorities to inflict excessive humiliation on the deportees. Witnesses noted that the buses transporting them to the airport were very dirty; there was no fresh air; deportees were not given access to a toilet; in some cases electric shocks were applied them; and police officers extorted money for various needs (see Annex, \u00a7\u00a7 7-9, 11).

In fact, many of the victims referred to in the case file are refugees from Abkhazia, Georgia. It is widely acknowledged that former inhabitants of Abkhazia, who came to Russia as a result of the 1992-93 armed conflict, were largely affected by the persecution campaign. The case of Manana Jabelia, a Georgian refugee who died in the detention facility, is selfevident. She was held in detention contrary to the Moscow City Court\u2019s decision overturning her expulsion order.

The message was so clear and evident that half the unlawful residents preferred to leave Russia voluntarily. That fact was mentioned in the judgment, but not properly assessed in accordance with the Court\u2019s caselaw. For example, in the case of De Bruin v. the Netherlands (no.\u00a09765/09, 27 July 2013, inadmissibility decision) the Court confirmed the State\u2019s authority to withdraw previous official tolerance, stating: \u201cit cannot follow, however, that a \u201cright\u201d to commit acts prohibited by law can arise from the absence of sanctions, not even if public authority renounces the right to prosecute. Such renunciation, even if delivered in writing to a particular individual, is not to be equated with a license granted in accordance with the law\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 58).",

This position of the Court can be interpreted as follows: although the Russian authorities expelled only unlawful residents, they violated the Convention prohibition on collective expulsion. This is a self-contradictory position. The Georgian Government had their own logic, persuading the Court that there had been a collective expulsion and that the expelled persons had valid permits to stay in Russian territory. This is why the Georgian Government complained under Article 1 of Protocol 7. However, the Court (as a master of its own procedure) preferred to take a completely different approach, which creates fresh doubts as to the justification, in terms of the rule of law, of the findings of violations.",

There had been a real climate of panic and Georgians had not dared go out into the street any more. Even Russian citizens of Georgian origin who had been working for Georgian businesses had contacted the consulate. In his view, the procedures followed were unlawful because Georgian nationals had been arrested without any court decision and even people aged under 18 had been placed in detention. He gave the example of a woman who had been detained with her five-month-old baby. During that period Georgian nationals were being arrested everywhere: in the street, near the consulate and near the Georgian Orthodox Church. The existence of a massive campaign was also evidenced by the fact that before the end of September 2006 the consulate had issued between 10 and 15 travel documents per day whereas after that date, some 150 documents were being issued per day. Those documents were necessary to secure the expulsion of Georgian nationals and the Federal Migration Service of the Russian Federation had co-operated with the consulate to that end.",

If it was an expulsion order, the defendant received a copy of the order and was taken to the detention centre for foreigners before being expelled.
