They had the option to indicate in which county they had voted and whether they had participated in the referendum and if so whether they had cast a valid or invalid ballot. These messages appeared together with the photograph. Furthermore, the application generated infographics, broken down by county, about the participation rate and the number of valid and invalid votes. The pictures and messages were accessible to other users of the application. The posting and sharing of photographs were anonymous and each user could publish only one photograph. By using the application, the voters sent the non-recoverable encrypted code (hash value) generated by the mobile device\u2019s identifier, and the picture (with a message hardcoded on it), to the operator of the application.

The Guidelines [of the National Election Commission] did not have binding force and could not constitute a legal basis for the decision. According to the petitioner\u2019s reasoning, its conduct in providing publicity for the application and calling on voters to use the application fell on the one hand within the sphere of protection of freedom of expression, and on the other hand called on voters to exercise their right to freedom of expression, protected by Article IX \u00a7 1 of the Fundamental Law. The right to freedom of expression was not an unlimited fundamental right. However, regard being had to a number of Constitutional Court judgments, it could only be restricted in so far as necessary and proportionate in relation to another fundamental right or constitutional principle, and any restriction should be capable of achieving the stated aim. The secrecy of the vote had not been infringed by the application since the content of the vote could not be linked to the voter. The secrecy of the vote entailed the right for voters to ensure that no one could gain knowledge of how they had voted, but it did not create an obligation for voters not to share details of their vote with others. Irrespective of the above, the application, which provided a forum for voters to share the content of their vote with others, was incapable of infringing the secrecy of the vote.

In the view of the reviewing court, the secrecy of voting (voting rights) as regulated by Article 2 \u00a7 1 means, firstly, that the right of all voters to a secret vote \u2013 not detectable by anybody \u2013- must be secured. Secondly, a system must be developed that does not make it possible to establish how a voter has cast his or her ballot. The K\u00faria does not agree with the reasoning of the impugned decision according to which the application and its functions \u2013 and in particular the uploading of photographs, the sending of messages, the participation in voting, and the sending of notifications by voters \u2013 were openly aimed at infringing the secrecy of the vote and the referendum. The provisions of the Act on Initiating Referenda, the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative and the Referendum Procedure, and of the Electoral Procedure Act, as well as the procedural rules on voting, clearly ensure that voters cast a secret ballot. The application attached to the present petition does not allow access to the personal data of the users, and is thus incapable of linking a cast ballot to a voter. The NEC reached the same conclusion. In the light of the above, the secrecy of the ballot was not infringed by the application or by the use thereof, and the NEC\u2019s decision to uphold the complaint in that respect was unlawful.",

This means that rights are to be exercised by their holders in conformity with their aim and content. Only such exercise of rights is protected by law, where besides the formal entitlement the real content of the right can be recognised.

Given the features of social media, this type of photograph-sharing links the cast ballot with the voter, since the photograph appears under the name of the user. By contrast, the application in the present case explicitly provides a possibility for individuals to share ballot photographs, and the content of their vote, with others without revealing their identity; therefore it is even less liable to breach the secrecy of the ballot than photographs shared on Facebook or other social media. If the development and advertising of the application were declared unlawful, this would result in voters sharing their ballot photographs on social media in a manner linking them with their vote, which would increase rather than decrease the hypothetical likelihood of electoral fraud.\u201d",

In its decision no. 1/2007 (I.18) the Constitutional Court established that the requirement to provide balanced, unbiased and objective information could constitute a restriction on the editorial freedom of the broadcast media, but that these restrictions were relevant only for the specific characteristics of the broadcast media and were not applicable to the printed media. As regards the printed media, the starting-point of the Constitutional Court has always been the unlimited freedom of founding a newspaper; accordingly, the power of the media to influence cannot serve as a ground for restriction.

In its case-law the Court has established that Article 10 applies not only to the content of information but also to the means of dissemination, since any restriction imposed on the latter necessarily interferes with the right to receive and impart information (see, inter alia, Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v. Turkey, no. 3111/10, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2012). In respect of the printed media, the Court has found that publishers, who do not necessarily associate themselves with the opinions expressed in the works they publish, participate in the exercise of freedom of expression by providing authors with a medium (see \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a022479/93, \u00a7 49, ECHR 1999VI). In the context of new media, the Court has previously held that a Google service designed to facilitate the creation and sharing of websites within a group constituted a means of exercising freedom of expression (see Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7 49). Similarly, a video-hosting website represented an important means of exercising the freedom to receive and impart information and ideas. The blocking of these services was found to have deprived users of a significant means of exercising their right to freedom to receive and impart information and ideas (see Cengiz and Others v. Turkey, nos. 48226/10 and 14027/11, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2015 (extracts)). In a similar vein, the running by the applicants of a website which made it possible for users to share digital material such as movies, music and computer games was considered as putting in place the means for others to impart and receive information within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention. The applicants\u2019 conviction for putting in place a means of disseminating information was therefore held to constitute interference with the right to freedom of expression (see Neij and Sunde Kolmisoppi v.\u00a0Sweden (dec.), no. 40397/12, 19 February 2013).",

The notion of \u201cquality of the law\u201d requires, as a corollary of the foreseeability test, that the law be compatible with the rule of law; it thus implies that there must be adequate safeguards in domestic law against arbitrary interferences by public authorities (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, \u00a7 67, Series A no. 82, and Olsson v.

That person must be able \u2013 if need be with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. While certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see Delfi AS, cited above, \u00a7 121, and Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di\u00a0Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, \u00a7 141, ECHR 2012). The criterion of foreseeability cannot be interpreted as requiring that all detailed conditions and procedures governing the interference be laid down in the substantive law itself, and the requirement of \u201clawfulness\u201d can be met if points which cannot be satisfactorily resolved on the basis of substantive law are set out in enactments of lower rank than statutes (see Association Ekin v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a039288/98, \u00a7 46, ECHR\u00a02001-VIII). A law which confers a discretion is thus not in itself inconsistent with the requirement of foreseeability, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Gillow v. the United Kingdom, 24 November 1986, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 109).",

In this connection the Court reiterates that free speech is essential in ensuring \u201cthe free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\u201d. For this reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds be permitted to circulate freely (see Orlovskaya Iskra v. Russia, no.\u00a042911/08, \u00a7\u00a0110, 21 February 2017). This is especially true when the freedom of expression at stake is that of a political party. As the Court has repeatedly stated, political parties play an essential role in ensuring pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy. Restrictions on their freedom of expression therefore have to be made the subject of a rigorous supervision (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98 and 3 others, \u00a7\u00a7 87-88 and\u00a0100, ECHR 2003II).

A rigorous supervision here not only serves to protect democratic political parties from arbitrary interferences by the authorities, but also protects democracy itself, since any restriction on freedom of expression in this context without sufficiently foreseeable regulations can harm open political debate, the legitimacy of the voting process and its results and, ultimately, the confidence of citizens in the integrity of democratic institutions and their commitment to the rule of law.",

The Constitutional Court and the K\u00faria made reference to general principles including the abuse of rights and applied them in the MKKP\u2019s case.",

This is not a case about punishment for taking ballot photographs, as it was presented by the applicant (see paragraph 102 of the judgment), an approach then followed by the majority. It is a case about showing disrespect for the democratic decision-making process. I therefore believe that the authorities\u2019 reaction was foreseeable by the applicant.",
