The duration of the proceedings concerning children takes on a particular significance, because there is always a danger that any procedural delay will result in the de facto determination of the issue before the court (see H. v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1987, \u00a7\u00a7 89-90, Series A no. 120, and P.F. v.

The authorities\u2019 duty to take measures to facilitate reunion is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with children who have lived for some time with the other parent may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures to be taken (see Nuutinen, cited above, \u00a7 128). The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case (see, Kosmopoulou v. Greece, no. 60457/00, \u00a7 45, 5 February 2004). Moreover, in cases such as the present one, where the child resists contact with one parent, Article 8 of the Convention requires States to try to identify the causes of such resistance and address them accordingly. It is an obligation of means, not of result. The cooperation and understanding of all concerned will always be an important ingredient (see K.B. and Others v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a036216/13, \u00a7 144, 14 March 2017). However, lack of cooperation between separated parents is not a circumstance which can by itself exempt the authorities from their positive obligations under Article 8. It rather imposes on the authorities an obligation to take measures to reconcile the conflicting interests of the parties, keeping in mind the best interests of the child as the primary consideration (see Ribi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 27148/12, \u00a7\u00a094, 2\u00a0April 2015).",

The right of a child to express his or her own views should not be interpreted as effectively giving an unconditional veto power to children without any other factors being considered and an examination being carried out to determine their best interests; such interests normally dictate that the child\u2019s ties with his or her family must be maintained, except in cases where this would harm his or her health and development (see Raw and Others v. France, no.\u00a010131/11, \u00a7\u00a094, 7 March 2013).",

The applicant has been unable to live with her daughter since May 2013, when she left her marital home (see paragraph\u00a05 above).

By the time the mandatory counselling started, the child had been separated from her mother and had no contact with her for one year and eight months (from May\u00a02013 to January 2015). Such a significant lapse of time must have furthered the alienation between the applicant and her daughter thus rendering the counselling more difficult.

Moreover, the Government did not challenge the applicant\u2019s contention that at the meeting the representative of the child protection authority substantially remained a passive observer (see paragraph\u00a012 above). This inaction cannot be justified and ran counter to that authority\u2019s obligation to assist the applicant in her efforts to re-establish contact with her child. By that time, the child protection authority was aware that the child allegedly refused to see her mother (see paragraph\u00a07 above). The authority thus should have anticipated that preparatory measures needed to be put in place (see paragraph 41 above and Strumia v.\u00a0Italy, no. 53377/13, \u00a7 110 in fine, 23 June 2016).
