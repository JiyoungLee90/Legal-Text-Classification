In contrast to that scenario, however, there is no statutory or jurisprudential indication that such a\u00a0claim would ensure that an applicant is awarded compensation for an alleged lack of proceedings compatible with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. The known domestic caselaw appears rather to suggest that compensation under that heading is awarded in respect of the fact of being detained rather than the fact of not having a procedure available during such detention to permit the lawfulness of that detention to be examined.
