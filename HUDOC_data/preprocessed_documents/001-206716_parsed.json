To establish whether \u201can issue\u201d arose under Article 8 of the Convention the Court assessed whether the revocation of the citizenship was \u201carbitrary\u201d and the \u201cconsequences\u201d of revocation for the applicant (see \u00a7\u00a7 85, 90 and 91 ibid).\u00a0\u00a0In the case of K2 v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 42387/13, \u00a7\u00a7 52-64 7 February 2017), which followed, the Court accepted that the revocation of citizenship amounted to an interference and applied the two-steps test to determine whether there has been a breach of Article 8 of the Convention. Subsequently, in the case of Alpeyeva and Dzhalagoniya (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011027) the Court firstly applied the \u201cconsequences\u201d criteria to determine if there had been an interference with the applicant\u2019s rights and then used the \u201carbitrariness\u201d test to determine if there had been a breach of Article 8 of the Convention. That approach was confirmed in the case of Ahmadov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan (no.\u00a032538/10, \u00a7\u00a7 46-55, 30 January 2020). In the case of Ghoumid and Others v. France (no. 52273/16 and 4 others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-44, 25 June 2020) the Court held that nationality is an element of a person\u2019s identity. To establish whether there had been a violation of Article\u00a08 of the Convention the Court examined as to whether the revocation of the applicant\u2019s nationality had been arbitrary. Then, it assessed the consequences of that measure for the applicant.",

Whereas what generally counts in cases involving Article 8 issues is the above-mentioned fair balance, in most of the case-law on denial or revocation of citizenship only the seriousness of the negative consequences for the applicant is assessed (see Karassev, cited above; Genovese, cited above, \u00a7 33; Ramadan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 90-93; K2\u00a0v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 62-63; Alpeyeva and Dzhalagoniya, cited above, \u00a7 111-15; and Ahmadov, cited above, \u00a7 46).

The notion of necessity further implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, regard being had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the relevant competing interests\u00a0...\u201d (see, among many other authorities, Strand Lobben and Others, cited above, \u00a7 203). The conditions relating to the existence of procedural safeguards and the manner in which the authorities acted, as applied in the case law on denial or revocation of citizenship, can be part of the assessment of whether the interference was \u201cnecessary\u201d.
