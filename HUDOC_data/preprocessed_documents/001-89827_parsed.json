The article had been published on the front page of the newspaper as the sensation of the day, with the aim of increasing sales. The Vilnius City Third District Court noted that publication had humiliated her and caused her significant non-pecuniary damage. The court concluded that, by printing the article and doing so in a humiliating manner, the newspaper had deliberately sought the negative consequences or had intentionally allowed for such consequences. Taking into account the above considerations, the court applied Article 54 \u00a7 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public, multiplied the statutory sum of LTL 10,000 (about EUR 2,896) by three, and awarded the applicant LTL\u00a030,000 (about EUR\u00a08,676) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.",

The relations of the sick with the persons who live nearby are based on the knowledge about the disease we have today and on the understanding of the related dangers. The nature of the disease and the known data about it reasonably raise concern on the part of the people who live in close proximity, to many of whom this question becomes pertinent not from curiosity, but from concern for their personal safety. These are significant arguments, which demonstrate great concern in society, and which attest to the relevance of the question. It should be taken into account that persons who live in proximity [to the applicant] have expressed concern for their safety, which is endangered by the [applicant\u2019s] behaviour, which does not always meet moral standards. In such circumstances the publication of data which breaches a [person\u2019s] privacy, even though such publication violates the [legal] norms which protect privacy, cannot be regarded as an end in itself or intentional, which would be a basis for the application of much stricter liability.

The applicant argued that her right to privacy had been violated not only by the mere existence of the statutory provision, but also by the way in which the courts had interpreted and applied it. Taking into account the financial strength of the newspaper and the vague prospects of success of any litigation in the absence of established domestic case-law, the existence of such a low limit was conducive towards the violation of her rights, as the newspaper was aware that under no circumstances would it be required to pay large sums in compensation for breaches of this kind. The applicant concluded that this statutory limit could not be deemed a necessary and proportionate means to achieve any of the legitimate aims enumerated in Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",

The Court takes particular note of the fact that the applicant lived not in a city but in a village, which increased the impact of the publication on the possibility that her illness would be known by her neighbours and her immediate family, thereby causing public humiliation and exclusion from village social life.

In the Court\u2019s view the opposite holds true: respecting the confidentiality of health data is crucial not only for the protection of a patient\u2019s privacy but also for the maintenance of that person\u2019s confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general. Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from seeking appropriate treatment, thereby endangering their own health and, in the case of transmissible diseases, that of the community (see Z v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a095). In this respect the Court attaches particular significance to the fact that, according to the newspaper, the information about the applicant\u2019s illness had been confirmed by the medical staff of Pasvalys hospital (see paragraph 6 above). However, it is of special importance that domestic law provides appropriate safeguards to discourage any such disclosures and the further publication of personal data.",

This view is confirmed by the fact that the impugned ceiling on judicial awards of compensation contained in Article 54 \u00a7 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public was repealed by the new Civil Code soon after the events in the present case (see paragraph 32 above).",

Unlike the practice in Article 10 cases, in a case concerning Article 8 consideration of the economic power of the opponent does not seem relevant, since it is not a question of punitive damages but of assessing the damage actually suffered by the applicant.",

Austria, cited above). While I accept that each case is different, I think that at least that case may serve to provide an approximate calibration, and lead the Court to the conclusion that the amount awarded by the Lithuanian courts, pursuant to the legislation in force, can reasonably be taken to cover the non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant and that, in any event, the domestic decisions gave the applicant appropriate protection.",
