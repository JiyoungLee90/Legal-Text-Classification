It rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that the public prosecutor\u2019s request for prolongation should be declared inadmissible or that the requested prolongation should be mitigated on the ground that Articles\u00a05 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights had been violated.

However, in view of the length of the delay, the nature of the TBS order and weighing all relevant interests involved, the Court of Appeal saw no reason to declare the public prosecutor\u2019s request inadmissible. In balancing all the relevant interests, the Court of Appeal took into account, on the one hand, the applicant\u2019s interest in having a speedy decision and his right to be protected against arbitrariness and, on the other, the interests of society in a prolongation of the TBS order. As regards the latter consideration, it had particular regard to the fact that the applicant still required treatment and to the seriousness of the offences committed by him on which basis the TBS order had been imposed.
