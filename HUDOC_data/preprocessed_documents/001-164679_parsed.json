In addition, the report specified that the contusion on the applicant\u2019s abdomen could have been caused either by a blow from an object or by bumping into an object (tiek suduodant, tiek atsimu\u0161ant), and that the injuries to the applicant\u2019s left wrist and shoulder joints could have resulted from his offering resistance while being apprehended. The report also concluded that the injuries to the applicant\u2019s wrist, shoulder joints and abdominal area were not likely to have been caused by falling down (neb\u016bdingi su\u017ealojimams, padarytiems nugriuvus). The examination could not determine the exact sequence of the injuries, but noted that they could have all been caused at the same time and that at that time the applicant could have been in various positions.",

On the other hand, the prosecutor considered that the applicant\u2019s statements had been inconsistent: during one questioning he had said that the officers had hit him inside the guard booth and during another he had said that they had hit him outside; he had also stated that officer L.B., who had arrived on the scene later, had been wearing a uniform, but L.B. had denied this; lastly, the applicant had claimed that neither N.B. nor a police dog had been present during the incident, but the contrary had been proven by N.B.\u2019s official report and consistent statements of all the officers. The prosecutor also noted that the witness V.V. had not seen the officers hit the applicant. Lastly, the prosecutor held that the injury to the applicant\u2019s abdomen was not sufficient to find that he had been kneed by the officers, because the medical examination had shown that such an injury could have been caused either by being hit with an object or by bumping into an object.

In respect of a person who is deprived of his or her liberty, or, more generally, is confronted with lawenforcement officers, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is, in principle, an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 86-88, and the cases cited therein).",

During later interviews, he provided essentially the same details about the events inside the booth, and added that the officers had also twisted his arms outside (see paragraphs 18, 19 and 22 above). The Court sees those two statements not as contradictory but as complementing one another. While it accepts that the domestic authorities had legitimate reasons to doubt the applicant\u2019s claims that N.B. had not been present during his arrest, it nonetheless considers that that does not, in and of itself, make the rest of the applicant\u2019s statements unreliable, especially since the incident took place at night and the officers, including N.B. himself, provided conflicting accounts as to N.B.\u2019s role during the applicant\u2019s arrest \u2013 in particular, whether N.B. had gone inside the booth or stayed outside, whether he had witnessed the applicant\u2019s attempt to punch an officer or had been mistaken about it, and whether he had had any role in handcuffing the applicant (see paragraphs\u00a017, 19, 21, 31 and 41 above and paragraph 70 below).

In their later interviews, V.B. and J.D. still did not mention swear words, but they both stated that the applicant had attempted to punch V.B. inside the booth (see paragraphs\u00a015 and 16 above). The applicant\u2019s swearing was brought up for the first time by N.B., several months after the arrest (see paragraph 17 above). During the same interview N.B. also stated that the applicant had punched an officer, without specifying the location, but he later retracted that statement, claiming that he \u201cmay have been mistaken\u201d about the punching because it had been dark (see paragraph 31 above). In addition, during a confrontation with the applicant N.B. stated that nothing had happened inside the booth, but later he said that he had not gone into the booth and had not seen if anything had happened there (see paragraphs 21 and 41 above).",

It has already noted that there were several important discrepancies in the accounts of the incident provided by the police officers (see paragraphs 70-71 above), and the applicant in his appeals to the domestic authorities alleged even more such contradictions (see paragraphs\u00a024 and 36 above). The Court observes that the three officers V.B., J.D. and N.B. during their interviews provided different versions of how they had first approached the applicant, how the applicant had responded to the officers\u2019 requests, and how he had resisted, what exact physical actions had been used against him, how many people had been inside the guard booth, in what order they had been standing there, and what exactly had happened inside (see paragraphs 10, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 31, 40 and 41 above). Even though additional interviews and confrontations were carried out in order to eliminate those contradictions, none of the domestic decisions established a definitive account of the incident, instead merely declaring that the officers\u2019 statements had been \u201cconsistent and logical\u201d. The contradictions were never explicitly addressed in any of the domestic decisions, and the credibility of the officers \u2013 unlike that of the applicant \u2013 was never called into question (see also Miclea v. Romania, no.\u00a069582/12, \u00a7 42, 13\u00a0October\u00a02015). In this connection the Court also notes that several of the written statements submitted by the officers and the written records of their testimonies contained practically identical texts (see paragraphs 10, 15, 16 and 40 above), which seriously undermines their credibility (see Chmil v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 20806/10, \u00a7 89, 29\u00a0October 2015, and Hilal Mammadov v. Azerbaijan, no. 81553/12, \u00a7 96, 4\u00a0February 2016). In such circumstances, the Court finds it particularly troubling that all the domestic decisions to discontinue the investigation relied exclusively on the statements of the police officers (see paragraphs 23, 32, 35, 39, 42, 45 and\u00a046 above). Accordingly, the Court is not persuaded that the domestic investigation was thorough and capable of establishing the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s injuries and the responsibility of the police officers involved (see Iljina and Sarulien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 52).",

The Court has held on numerous previous occasions that the repetition of such decisions usually discloses a serious deficiency in the proceedings (see Wierciszewska v. Poland, no. 41431/98, \u00a7 46, 25 November 2003; Drozd v. Ukraine, no. 12174/03, \u00a7 66, 30 July 2009, and Kapustyak v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 26230/11, \u00a7 78, 3 March 2016).",

The Court finds it disconcerting that such a procedural error had not been identified at an earlier stage of the proceedings, either by the prosecutors or the courts. Not only did that unnecessarily prolong the duration of the investigation, as the case had to be transferred to another territorial prosecutor\u2019s office and the interviews with V.B. and J.D. had to be repeated. It also diminished the investigation\u2019s ability to establish the circumstances surrounding the applicant\u2019s arrest, because both the officers stressed that they could no longer remember all the details, owing to the passage of time (see paragraph 44 above), while none of their earlier and more precise statements could be used.",
