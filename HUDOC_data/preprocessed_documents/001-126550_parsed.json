They also argued that the Russian authorities\u2019 conduct, both prior to and after the applicant\u2019s disappearance, demonstrated their knowledge of and involvement in the applicant\u2019s abduction and forced repatriation. They referred in particular to the way in which the applicant had been kept in detention on what they considered as an obviously contrived charge of attempted murder (see paragraphs 5861 above), and the subsequent lack of any investigative actions in that respect until the date on which that extremely serious charge had, for no apparent reason, been replaced with a less serious one, allowing the applicant to be released from custody. They further submitted that the authorities deliberately delayed notifying the applicant\u2019s lawyer that a new charge had been served on the applicant in order to prevent her attendance at this event on the day of the applicant\u2019s disappearance. Lastly, the authorities had not undertaken a single investigative action in the wake of the applicant\u2019s disappearance, but had merely shuffled the complaints between offices.",

The Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case. Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny, even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place (see, with further references, El\u00a0Masri, cited above, \u00a7 155).",

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article\u00a019 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see, with further references, Nachova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 147, ECHR 2005VII; Iskandarov v.

The applicant\u2019s situation should thus be viewed as extremely vulnerable, given notably the risk of illtreatment he was running in connection with the criminal prosecution in his home country (see paragraphs 122-135 below). That fact alone, taken in conjunction with the applicant\u2019s history, compels the Court to regard that account of events with great caution. It would not, therefore, give credence to the information contained in the text read out by the applicant unless it were corroborated by other evidence. Yet, the respondent Government have not provided any element to support that account, while a wealth of material at the Court\u2019s disposal casts serious doubt on the veracity of the story presented on Tajik television.",

Indeed, their statements sit well with the applicant\u2019s previous story. The Court also observes that the respondent Government did not refute the submissions by the applicant\u2019s representatives that the applicant had had ample opportunities to make a quicker and safer trip to Tajikistan without undergoing a highly risky and clandestine journey in a manifestly unlawful manner through four national borders without any identity document.

According to the story broadcast, the first thing the applicant did following his release was to go to the local market in order to borrow RUB 15,000 (EUR 370) from unknown persons without contacting his lawyers and next-of-kin in accordance with their prearranged plan (see paragraph 66 above). That the applicant\u2019s release was deliberately organised without his lawyer and next-of-kin being present (see paragraphs 67-68 above) strengthens those suspicions, and the Government have done nothing to allay them. For example, they could have provided CCTV footage captured in SIZO50/12 of Zelenograd and the surrounding area to prove at least that the applicant left the remand centre of his own free will and without any hindrance by the authorities or third persons. The authorities were explicitly requested shortly after the applicant\u2019s release to preserve that valuable evidence but failed to do so (see paragraph 81 above), thus prompting the Court to draw further inferences against the version that the applicant left Russia for his home country voluntarily.",

In addition, the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office received letters from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International about the applicant\u2019s case, setting out specific reasons against his extradition. The fact that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office sent the witness statements to its Tajik counterpart for investigation and requested additional diplomatic assurances demonstrates that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office took heed of that material. Against that background, it is difficult for the Court to understand that the extradition order signed on 16\u00a0February 2011 by the Deputy Prosecutor General neither made an assessment of the risk of ill-treatment faced by the applicant, nor mentioned the existing allegations of such a risk (see paragraph 40 above).

It goes beyond any doubt that the Russian authorities were well aware \u2013 or ought to have been aware \u2013 of such a risk when they decided to release the applicant from SIZO50/12 of Zelenograd. The applicant\u2019s background, the Tajik authorities\u2019 behaviour in his case, and not least the recurrent similar incidents of unlawful transfers from Russia to Tajikistan to which the Russian authorities had been insistently alerted by both the Court and the Committee of Ministers (see paragraphs 62 and 64 above) were worrying enough to trigger the authorities\u2019 special vigilance and require appropriate measures of protection corresponding to this special situation. The Government confirmed that the warning message mentioning, inter alia, the present case had been duly conveyed to all competent law-enforcement authorities on 3\u00a0February\u00a02012 (see paragraph 63 above). The authorities nonetheless failed to take any measure to protect the applicant at the critical moment of his unexpected release from the remand centre on 29 March 2012. Even more striking is the fact that the authorities\u2019 deliberate failure to inform the applicant\u2019s representative in due time about the sudden modification of the criminal charges and the planned release from detention (see paragraphs 6768 above) deprived him of any chance of being protected by his representative and next-of-kin. Nor did the competent authorities take any measures to protect the applicant after having received insistent official requests to that effect by the applicant\u2019s representatives immediately after his disappearance on 29 March 2012 (see paragraph\u00a071 above). As a result, the applicant was withdrawn from the Russian jurisdiction and the Tajik authorities\u2019 aim of having him extradited to Tajikistan was achieved in a manifestly unlawful manner.",

The investigation thus appears to be stalled in the Zelenograd Investigation Division without having produced any tangible result. A year after the incident, the only investigative measure the Court has been informed of was a request to check the information about the illegal crossing of the Russian State border by the applicant or his crossing the border against his will. According to the Government, that request was sent by the Zelenograd Investigation Division to the State Border Service of the FSB in January 2013, that is, nine months after the impugned events (see paragraph\u00a080 above). The authorities also gave every appearance of wanting to withhold valuable evidence \u2013 CCTV footage from the remand centre \u2013 satisfying themselves with an uncorroborated reference to a technical failure (see paragraph 81 above).

In most of these, the applicants face a genuine threat to life and limb, with the ensuing real risk of grave, irreversible harm in breach of the core provisions of the Convention. This vital role played by interim measures in the Convention system not only underpins their binding legal effect on the States concerned, as upheld by the established case-law, but also commands the utmost importance to be attached to the question of the States Parties\u2019 compliance with the Court\u2019s indications in that respect (see, inter alia, the firm position on that point expressed by the States Parties in the Izmir Declaration and by the Committee of Ministers in its Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)83 in the above-mentioned case of Ben Khemais). Any laxity on this question would unacceptably weaken protection of the core rights in the Convention and would not be compatible with its values and spirit (see Soering, cited above, \u00a7\u00a088); it would also be inconsistent with the fundamental importance of the right of individual application and, more generally, undermine the authority and effectiveness of the Convention as a constitutional instrument of European public order (see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 100 and 125, and, mutatis mutandis, Loizidou v.\u00a0Turkey (preliminary objections), 23\u00a0March 1995, \u00a7\u00a075, Series A no. 310).",

Notwithstanding that request, the applicant was forcibly repatriated to Tajikistan between 29\u00a0March and 7\u00a0April 2012. As a result, the Tajik authorities\u2019 aim of extraditing the applicant, which the interim measure had sought to prevent pending the Court proceedings, was fully achieved.

This brings the Court to conclude that the responsibility for the breach of the interim measure also lies with the Russian authorities. Indeed, the Court cannot conceive of allowing the respondent State to circumvent an interim measure such as the one indicated in the present case by using another domestic procedure for the applicant\u2019s removal to the country of destination or, even more alarmingly, by allowing him to be arbitrarily removed to that country in a manifestly unlawful manner (see Savriddin Dzhurayev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0217).
