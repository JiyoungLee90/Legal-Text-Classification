The resulting delay of approximately two years and eleven months between 23 August 2001, when the Centre was first requested to carry out the examination, and 30 July 2004, when the trial court eventually received the completed expert examination, was thus attributable to the domestic authorities.

As regards the conditions of her detention and the complaint concerning the lawfulness of that detention, the Court recalls that the applicant's detention ended on 22\u00a0June\u00a01999, whilst the present application was lodged on 10 April 2002, that is, more than six months later. It follows that these complaints were introduced out of time. Finally, as to the measure of restraint in the form of an undertaking not to leave her place of residence during the proceedings, the Court recalls that it is not in itself questionable that the State may apply various preventive measures restricting the liberty of an accused, including deprivation of liberty, in order to ensure the efficient conduct of a criminal prosecution. In the Court's view, an obligation not to leave the area of one's residence is a minimally intrusive restriction of liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Nagy v.\u00a0Hungary (dec.), no. 6437/02, 6 July 2004). Since it does not appear that the applicant actually sought to leave the area of her residence and was refused (see, Fedorov and Fedorova v. Russia, no. 31008/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a044-46, 13\u00a0October 2005) or that the overall duration of that measure \u2013 seven years and two months to date \u2013 was unjustifiably long (see, by contrast, Luordo v.\u00a0Italy, no. 32190/96, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2003IX; Goffi v. Italy, no. 55984/00, \u00a7\u00a020, 24 March 2005; and Bassani v. Italy, no. 47778/99, \u00a7 24, 11\u00a0December\u00a02003), the Court is unable to conclude that the measure in question was arbitrary or otherwise disproportionate.",
