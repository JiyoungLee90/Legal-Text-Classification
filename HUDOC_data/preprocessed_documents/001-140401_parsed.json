When questioned as a witness, the applicant had always appeared when summoned by the investigator. Nor had the investigator at the time in any way restricted the applicant\u2019s ability to travel. Accordingly, the applicant had happened to be in Moscow when the investigator had decided to indict him and could not have received the summons or appeared for questioning.

Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are actual indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty laid down in Article 5 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Kud\u0142a v.

In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds are \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings (see Labita v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a7 152 and 153, ECHR 2000IV).

When deciding whether a person should be released or detained, the authorities are obliged to consider alternative measures of ensuring his appearance at trial (see Jab\u0142onski v.
