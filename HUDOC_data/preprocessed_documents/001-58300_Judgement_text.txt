The case originated in an application against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Vincenzo Ledonne (“the applicant”), on 4 April 1997. The application was registered on 23 April 1997 under file no. 35742/97.
The applicant complained that, contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, criminal proceedings brought against him had not been heard within a reasonable time.
On 4 March 1998 the Commission (First Chamber) decided to give notice of the application to the respondent Government and invited them to submit their observations on its admissibility and merits.
The Government submitted their observations on 22 May 1998, to which the applicant replied on 11 June 1998.
Following the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 § 2 thereof, the application falls to be examined by the Court.
In accordance with Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Second Section. The Chamber constituted within the Section included ex officio Mr B. Conforti, the judge elected in respect of Italy (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 26 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court), and Mr C. L. Rozakis, the President of the Section (Rule 26 § 1 (a)). The other members designated by the latter to complete the Chamber were Mr M. Fischbach, Mr P. Lorenzen, Mrs M. Tsatsa-Nikolovska, Mr A. Baka and Mr E. Levits (Rule 26 § 1 (b)).
On 1 December 1998, the Chamber declared the application admissible2.
The applicant is an Italian national, born in 1939 and resident in Cosenza. He is represented before the Court by Mr Domenico Callea, a lawyer practising in Reggio Calabria.
On 5 December 1990 a certain Mr B. requested the Public Prosecutor that criminal proceedings be instituted against the applicant for libel.
On 18 September 1991 the Locri (Reggio Calabria) Public Prosecutor informed the applicant of the charge against him and requested him to appear on 10 October 1991 in order to be questioned.
On 18 June 1992 the Locri Public Prosecutor summoned the applicant to appear before the Bianco (Reggio Calabria) Magistrate at a hearing on 27 April 1993. This summons was served on the applicant on 8 January 1993.
On 27 April 1993 the applicant applied for the summons to be declared null and void on the ground that it had not been served on the lawyer of his choice. In an order of the same day, the Bianco Magistrate ordered that a fresh summons be served. On 18 November 1993 the applicant objected that the Bianco Magistrate had no jurisdiction to deal with the case.
In a judgment of the same day, filed with the registry on 2 December 1993, the Bianco Magistrate declared that the case was outside its territorial jurisdiction and ordered the file to be forwarded to the Cosenza Magistrate.
On 31 August 1994 the Cosenza investigating judge summoned the applicant to appear before the Cosenza Magistrate at a hearing on 4 April 1995.
On that date the proceedings were adjourned to 16 May 1995 at the applicant’s request. On 16 May 1995 the case was postponed to 19 September 1995 because the lawyers of the Cosenza Bar Association were on strike.
On 24 October 1995 the applicant requested for the second time that the summons be declared null and void on the ground that it had not been served on the lawyer of his choice. In an order of the same day, the Cosenza Magistrate ordered that a fresh summons be served and scheduled a hearing for 2 February 1996, at which the proceedings were adjourned to 18 June 1996 at the applicant’s request. On 18 June and 13 December 1996 evidence from the applicant and some witnesses was taken.
On 21 February 1997 the parties presented their final pleadings.
In a judgment of the same day, filed with the court registry on 26 February 1997, the Cosenza Magistrate acquitted the applicant.
