Even in such circumstances, in his appeal to the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Court of Appeal the applicant noted that a number of legal provisions had been breached by Judge B. when adopting his decision. In particular, he referred to an alleged breach of Article 2651 of the Code of Administrative Offences (\u201cthe CAO\u201d \u2013 see paragraphs 13 and 17 above) and of Article 6 of the Convention. The Court also notes that Article 2651 of the CAO expressly provides, at paragraph 3, that a judge can be recused when there are circumstances raising doubts as to his or her impartiality. Moreover, under Article 276 of the CCP (see paragraph 16 above) the applicant\u2019s objections to the minutes of the hearing had to be annexed to the file that was sent to the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Court of Appeal.
