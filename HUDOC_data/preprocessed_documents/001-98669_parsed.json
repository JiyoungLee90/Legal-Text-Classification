He was assigned to the reserve regiment of the Latvian Division.

The prosecution submitted that the Regional Court had made a number of serious errors of fact and law: it had neglected the fact that Latvia\u2019s incorporation into the USSR was contrary to the Latvian Constitution of 1922 and to international law, and was therefore unlawful, and that the Republic of Latvia had continued to exist de jure. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s conduct in 1944 could and should have been analysed under Latvian and international law, rather than Soviet law. Further, the prosecution criticised the Regional Court\u2019s assessment of the evidence in the case. In its view, the court had relied on a series of assertions by the applicant that were not only unsupported by any evidence, but also contrary to the tenor of the evidence, notably the applicant\u2019s claims that the villagers from Mazie Bati were armed collaborators of the German military administration who had helped the Wehrmacht to wipe out Major Chugunov\u2019s Red Partisans; that an ad hoc Partisan tribunal had been set up within the applicant\u2019s detachment of Red Partisans; and that the purpose of the Mazie Bati operation was not summary execution but the arrest of the villagers.",

The indictment alleged that they were responsible for having gassed thousands of inhabitants of Kharkov and its region, of committing brutal atrocities against civilians, of having burnt villages and exterminated women, old people and children as well as of having executed, burnt alive and tortured the wounded and prisoners of war. The prosecution relied on the rules of war laid down by international conventions (the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations and the 1929 Geneva Convention, noting that Germany had ratified both) and universally accepted provisions of international law. The indictment not only referred to the responsibility of the German Government and Command, but to the individual responsibility of the accused (referring to the \u201cLeipzig trials\u201d). After admitting their own and their hierarchical superiors\u2019 guilt, the three accused were sentenced to death by hanging. The fairness of the trials may have been called into question later, but they were widely reported. The USSR awaited the end of the war before resuming such trials: trials were also held in Kyiv, Minsk, Riga, Leningrad, Smolensk, Briansk, Velikie Luki and Nikolaev.",

The spy who secretly and without uniform passes the military lines of a belligerent in time of war, seeking to gather military information and communicate it to the enemy, or an enemy combatant who without uniform comes secretly through the lines for the purpose of waging war by destruction of life or property, are familiar examples of belligerents who are generally deemed not to be entitled to the status of prisoners of war, but to be offenders against the law of war subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals.\u201d",

These included the inhumane treatment of prisoners, the employment of poisoned weapons, the improper use of flags of truce, and similar matters. Many of these prohibitions had been enforced long before the date of the Convention; but since 1907 they have certainly been crimes, punishable as offences against the laws of war; yet the Hague Convention [(IV)] nowhere designates such practices as criminal, nor is any sentence prescribed, nor any mention made of a court to try and punish offenders. For many years past, however, military tribunals have tried and punished individuals guilty of violating the rules of land warfare laid down by this Convention. ... In interpreting the words of the [Kellogg-Briand Pact], it must be remembered that international law is not the product of an international legislature, and that such international agreements as the [Kellogg-Briand Pact] have to deal with general principles of law, and not with administrative matters of procedure. The law of war is to be found not only in treaties, but in the customs and practices of States which gradually obtained universal recognition, and from the general principles of justice applied by jurists and practised by military courts. This law is not static, but by continual adaptation follows the needs of a changing world. Indeed, in many cases treaties do no more than express and define for more accurate reference the principles of law already existing.\u201d",

The killing of the women, unless they were taking part in hostilities as combatants, was not in any circumstances justified, as it would always have been contrary to the most elementary considerations and laws of humanity and dictates of public conscience. In that regard, the Government specifically took issue with paragraphs 141 and 142 the Chamber judgment.",

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, so as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused\u2019s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused\u2019s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law.

As regards foreseeability in particular, the Court notes that, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be in any system of law including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in certain Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2001II; K.H.W. v. Germany [GC], no. 37201/97, \u00a7 85, 22 March 2001; Jorgic v.

Having regard to the subject matter of the case and the reliance on the laws and customs of war as applied before and during the Second World War, the Court considers it relevant to observe that the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to the Convention indicate that the purpose of the second paragraph of Article 7 was to specify that Article 7 did not affect laws which, in the wholly exceptional circumstances at the end of the Second World War, were passed in order to punish, inter alia, war crimes so that Article 7 does not in any way aim to pass legal or moral judgment on those laws (see X. v. Belgium, no. 268/57, Commission decision of 20 July 1957, Yearbook 1, p. 241). In any event, the Court further notes that the definition of war crimes included in Article 6 (b) of the Charter of the IMT Nuremberg was found to be declaratory of international laws and customs of war as understood in 1939 (see paragraphs 118 above and 207 below).",

While arms and munitions supplied by the German military administration were found in the deceased villagers\u2019 homes, none of those villagers were carrying those or any arms.

The Court has therefore proceeded on the basis that the applicant and his unit were \u201ccombatants\u201d.

The Lieber Code 1863 (see paragraphs 63-77 above) outlined a multitude of offences against the laws and customs of war and prescribed punishments, and individual criminal responsibility was inherent in numerous of its Articles. While it was an American Code, it was the first modern codification of the laws and customs of war and was influential in later codification conferences, notably in Brussels in 1874 (see paragraph 79 above). The Oxford Manual 1880 forbade a multitude of acts as contrary to the laws and customs of war and explicitly provided for \u201coffenders to be liable to punishment specified in the penal law\u201d. These earlier codifications, and in particular the Draft Brussels Declaration 1874, in turn inspired the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations. These latter instruments were the most influential of the earlier codifications and were, in 1907, declaratory of the laws and customs of war: they defined, inter alia, relevant key notions (combatants, lev\u00e9e en masse, hors de combat), they listed detailed offences against the laws and customs of war and they provided a residual protection, through the Martens Clause, to inhabitants and belligerents for cases not covered by the specific provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Regulations. Responsibility therein was on States, which had to issue consistent instructions to their armed forces and pay compensation if their armed forces violated those rules.",

International and national law (the latter including transposition of international norms) served as a basis for domestic prosecutions and liability.

It considers, having regard notably to Article 23 (c) of the Hague Regulations, that, even if the deceased villagers were considered combatants or civilians who had participated in hostilities, jus in bello in 1944 considered the circumstances of their murder and ill-treatment a war crime since those acts violated a fundamental rule of the laws and customs of war protecting an enemy rendered hors de combat.

Basically, one could say that up to 1944 general international law \u2013 as a combination of existing general international agreements and State practice \u2013 had resolved the issue of individual responsibility (and not only State responsibility), and that only the post-war period fine-tuned procedural issues, such as the question of the statute of limitations for war crimes.",

Hence no one can speak of retrospective application of substantive law, when a person is convicted, even belatedly, on the basis of rules existing at the time of the commission of the act. Considering, as the Court leaves one to believe, that the procedural issue of the statute of limitations is a constituent element of the applicability of Article 7, linked to the question of retrospective application and sitting alongside, with equal force, the conditions of the existence of a crime and a penalty, can lead to unwanted results which could undermine the very spirit of Article 7.",

And this is, to our mind, that while, admittedly, the question of prescriptibility was not necessarily resolved in 1944 \u2013 although this did not afford the applicant the possibility of taking advantage of such a lacuna \u2013 the ensuing developments, after the Second World War, have nevertheless clearly demonstrated that the international community not only consolidated its position in strongly condemning heinous war crimes, but also gradually formulated detailed rules \u2013 including procedural ones \u2013 dealing with the way in which such crimes should be dealt with by international law. These developments constitute an uninterrupted chain of legal productivity, which leaves little room to consider that the international system was not prepared to pursue the condemnation of crimes committed during the war; at that stage, of course, the silence on the issue of prescriptibility was deafening. This can also be established from the adoption of the 1968 Convention, which \u201caffirmed\u201d the imprescriptibility of these crimes.

The discussion of the merits of the case was therefore limited to Article 7, as the Grand Chamber noted in paragraph 184 of the judgment. That being so, however, the Court must, without taking the place of the domestic courts, review the application of the Convention provisions in question, in other words ensure that the criminal penalties imposed on the applicant were prescribed by law and were not retrospective.

At the time of the events, the 1926 Soviet Criminal Code, which became applicable in Latvian territory by a decree of 6 November 1940 (see paragraph 41 of the judgment), did not contain any provisions on war crimes as such. The Code was replaced on 6 January 1961 by the 1961 Criminal Code, after the events in issue, and a Law passed on 6 April 1993, after Latvia had regained its independence in 1991, inserted provisions on war crimes into the 1961 Criminal Code, permitting the retrospective application of the criminal law in respect of such crimes and exempting them from limitation (sections 6-1, 45-1 and 68-3 inserted into the 1961 Criminal Code \u2013 see paragraphs 48 to\u00a050 of the judgment). In these circumstances, it is difficult to find a legal basis existing in national law at the time of the events and, if we are correct in our understanding of the judgment, in particular paragraphs 196 to 227, the majority found such a legal basis only by reference to international law, even after taking into account the enactment of the 1993 Law (see paragraph\u00a0196 especially). This was also the approach taken by the domestic courts, at least by the Supreme Court Senate in its judgment of 28 September 2004, the final decision in the case at national level. The decision was chiefly based on Article 6 (b) of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, and on the 1968 United Nations Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity (for the reasoning of the Supreme Court Senate\u2019s decision, see paragraph 40 of the judgment).",

As Egbert Myjer rightly notes in his concurring opinion cited above, not all crimes committed during wars can be considered \u201cwar crimes\u201d; the criminal law must be rigorous, and the Court has often observed that it must not be extensively construed to an accused\u2019s detriment, for instance by analogy, since this would run counter to the nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege principle (see, for example, Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, \u00a7 52, Series A no. 260-A).

The London Agreement setting up the International Military Tribunal (IMT) dates from 8\u00a0August 1945. The Charter of the IMT Nuremberg, annexed to the London Agreement, empowered it to try and to punish persons who, acting in the interests of the European Axis countries, had committed certain crimes, including war crimes. Article 6 (b) of the Charter provided the first legal definition of war crimes, and as has been noted in paragraph 6 of this opinion, the national courts took the view that these provisions applied to the applicant. The judgment of the IMT Nuremberg asserts that the classification of such crimes does not result solely from Article 6 (b) of the Charter, but also from pre-existing international law (in particular, the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and the 1929 Geneva Convention); however, the question arises whether this declaratory sentence, which is clearly retrospective in effect, should be construed as having erga omnes effect for the past or whether its scope should, on the contrary, be limited to the IMT\u2019s general jurisdiction ratione personae, or even to its jurisdiction solely in respect of persons tried by it. This question is crucial, for while the applicant was indeed prosecuted for acts he had allegedly committed or been an accomplice to, he was clearly not acting in the interests of the \u201cEuropean Axis countries\u201d as he was fighting against them. If we rule out the possibility of applying the criminal law extensively and by analogy, it is difficult to accept without some hesitation that the \u201cNuremberg Principles\u201d may serve as a legal basis here.",

Accordingly, we consider that it was not until after the facts of the present case that international law laid down the rules of jus in  with sufficient precision. The fact that the Nuremberg trial punished ex post facto the persons brought before the IMT does not mean that all crimes committed during the Second World War could be covered retrospectively, for the purposes of Article 7 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, by the definition of war crimes and the penalties attached to them. The \u201cgeneral principles of law recognised by civilised nations\u201d were, in our opinion, clearly set forth at , and not before \u2013 unless one were to assume on principle that they pre-existed. If so, from what point did they exist? The Second World War? The First? The War of Secession and the Lieber Code?

Only when the Law of 6 April 1993 was passed \u2013 almost fifty years after the events \u2013 was the (1961) Criminal Code amended so that the statutory limitation of criminal liability did not apply to persons found guilty of war crimes. We therefore consider that the non-applicability of this limitation in the applicant\u2019s case entailed retrospective application of the criminal law, which in our view is not normally compatible with Article 7.",

Firstly, though, as stated above, we consider that the acts in issue could not be classified as war crimes in 1944 in the absence of a sufficiently clear and precise legal basis, and, secondly, prosecution in respect of those acts was statute-barred from 1954. We are therefore not persuaded by this reasoning, which amounts to finding that the non-applicability of statutory limitations to criminal offences is the rule and limitation the exception, whereas in our view, the reverse should be true. Exempting the most serious crimes from limitation is a clear sign of progress, as it curbs impunity and permits punishment. International criminal justice has developed significantly, particularly since the setting up of ad hoc international tribunals, followed by the International Criminal Court. However, without a clear basis in law it is difficult to decide ex post facto that a statutory limitation should not apply.",

We would simply note that the applicant\u2019s conviction was based on international law. In that regard, the analogy drawn in the judgment (paragraph 236) with K.-H.W. v. Germany ([GC], no. 37201/97, 22 March 2001) does not seem decisive to us either. That case concerned facts occurring in 1972 which were punishable under the national legislation applicable at that time, and the Court found that they should also be assessed from the standpoint of international law \u2013 that is, however, as existing in 1972 and not 1944.
