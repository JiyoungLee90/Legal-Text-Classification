The case originated in an application (no. 14284/08) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ms Ruža Tomić, Ms Ljeposava Kovačević, Ms Dobrinka Jovanović, Mr Marko Tomić and Mr Janko Tomić (“the applicants”), on 18 February 2008.
The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Mijić.
This case is, like Čolić and Others v. , nos. 1218/07 et al., 10 November 2009, and Runić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 28735/06 et al., 15 November 2011, about the non-enforcement of final and enforceable domestic judgments awarding war damages to the applicants.
On 30 August 2010 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicants were born in 1932, 1954, 1957, 1963 and 1963, respectively and live in Milići.
On 13 March 2001 the Srebrenica First Instance Court ordered the Republika Srpska (an Entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina) to pay the applicants 31,500 convertible marks (BAM), within 15 days, in respect of war damage together with default interest at the statutory rate. That judgment became final on 20 April 2001. On 1 April 2002 the Banja Luka District Court issued a writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju).
The applicants complained of non-enforcement to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the ”). On 26 June 2007 the  found a breach of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The applicants did not claim compensation, but even if they had done so, their claim would have most likely been refused (see, for example, the Constitutional Court’s decisions AP 774/04 of 20 December 2005, § 438; AP 557/05 of 12 April 2006, § 195; AP 1211/06 of 13 December 2007, § 79; and AP 244/08 of 8 December 2010, § 37).
After the extensive information campaign explaining the available options for the settlement of the Republika Srpska’s public debt (including its debt arising from domestic judgments), on 18 January 2010 Ms Ljeposava Kovačević, Mr Marko Tomić and Mr Janko Tomić informed the authorities that they agreed to be paid only the legal costs in cash and the principal debt and default interest in bonds. On 15 June 2010 government bonds were issued to them. They have already sold some or all of their bonds on the Stock Exchange
Ms Dobrinka Jovanović was not issued government bonds.
9 The relevant domestic law and practice were outlined in Čolić and Others (cited above, §§ 10-12) and Runić and Others (cited above, § 11).
On 13 January 2012 the Domestic Debt Act 2012 entered into force, thereby repealing the Domestic Debt Act 2004. As regards the payment of war damage, it envisages the same solution as the old Act, with the change in the maturity of government bonds which is now 13 years instead of 14 years. The new Act is, however, irrelevant for the present case: as regards the applicants who were issued government bonds, Ms Ljeposava Kovačević, Mr Marko Tomić and Mr Janko Tomić, the applicable provisions are those from the Domestic Debt Act 2004, which was in force at the time bonds were issued. As regards Ms Dobrinka Jovanović, she did not accept issuance of bonds in lieu of cash as means of enforcement.
