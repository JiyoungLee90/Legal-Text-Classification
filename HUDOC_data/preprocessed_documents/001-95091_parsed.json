Given that the applicant had been convicted of a serious crime and was serving a sentence in a penitentiary establishment with strict conditions of detention, his request for participation in the civil proceedings was merely an attempt to be detained, even if briefly, in less strict conditions than those imposed on him. The domestic judicial authorities had observed all the fair-trial guarantees set out in Article\u00a06 of the Convention. The applicant had been duly informed of the dates and time of the hearings. He had been provided with copies of the records of hearings and other documents from the case file. The court had advised him of his rights and had facilitated the collection of the evidence needed to substantiate his claims. As a result, the applicant's claims had been granted in part.",

He had been unable to produce and examine evidence, to file motions and to argue his case. The applicant did not have the financial means to retain a lawyer to represent him. His relatives did not have the requisite legal knowledge to provide effective representation. He could have been transferred to a local detention facility so that transporting him to the courthouse was feasible. The applicant further opined that the courts' refusals to grant him leave to appear had been unlawful. In this connection he relied on Article\u00a077.1 of the Penitentiary Code.

The Court has previously found a violation of the right to a \u201cpublic and fair hearing\u201d in a case where a Russian court, after having refused leave to appear to the imprisoned applicants, who had wished to make oral submissions on their defamation claim, failed to consider other legal possibilities for securing their effective participation in the proceedings (see Khuzhin and Others v. , no. 13470/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a053 et seq., 23 October 2008). It also found a violation of Article 6 in a case where an imprisoned applicant was similarly unable to be present and testify in court with regard to his claim that he had been ill-treated by the police. Despite the fact that the applicant in that case was represented by his wife, the Court considered it relevant that his claim had been largely based on his personal experience and that his submissions would therefore have been \u201can important part of the plaintiff's presentation of the case and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings\u201d (see Kovalev v. Russia, no.\u00a078145/01, \u00a7\u00a037, 10\u00a0May 2007).",

However, neither the Code of Civil Procedure nor the Penitentiary Code make special provision for the exercise of that right by individuals who are in custody, whether they are in pre-trial detention or are serving a sentence. In the present case the applicant's requests for leave to appear were denied precisely on the ground that the domestic law did not make provision for convicted persons to be brought from correctional colonies to the place where their civil claim was being heard. The Court reiterates that Article 6 of the Convention does not guarantee the right to personal presence before a civil court but rather a more general right to present one's case effectively before the court and to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side. Article 6 \u00a7 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a068416/01, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, ECHR 2005-II).",
