The instruction was issued under, inter alia, regulation 171 of the 1997 Act\u2019s implementing regulations, which provided that the mental and physical fitness of the Ministry\u2019s staff was to be assessed periodically in a manner laid down by the Minister (this regulation was repealed in April 2003). Section 6 of the Instruction provided that those assessments were to be carried out by the Ministry\u2019s Psychology Institute (see paragraph 33 below). By virtue of section 16, the purpose of the psychological assessment of the Ministry\u2019s staff was to determine (a) their current mental condition, (b) diminished motivation, behavioural or emotional inadequacy, or general deadaption leading to low professional effectiveness, or (c) abuse of position for financial gain. In carrying out the assessment of staff suspected of abusing their posts, the Institute\u2019s experts could resort to a polygraph test (section 17(3)(a)). Such persons could be subjected to sporadic assessments with a view to protecting the Ministry from \u201cstaff members who ha[d] lost their mental or emotional stability or other professional qualities and [could] cause damage to themselves, the [Ministry] or society through actions or omissions\u201d (section 19(1)).

The conclusion that a person was \u201cmentally unfit for work at the Ministry of Internal Affairs\u201d was final and not subject to review (section 27(3)).",

In a judgment of 8 February 2005, which came into force on 18 February 2005 following its publication in the State Gazette (\u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 1219 \u043e\u0442 8 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 2005 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116\u00a04773/2004 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441\u0432, \u043e\u0431\u043d., \u0414\u0412, \u0431\u0440. 16 \u043e\u0442 18 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 2005\u00a0\u0433.), a fivemember panel of the  partly upheld the challenge and decided to strike out the wording \u201cestablished by the [Ministry\u2019s] Psychology Institute\u201d. It noted, inter alia, that the Institute was directly subordinate to the Minister, and that its assessments of a person\u2019s mental fitness for work at the Ministry were not subject to any form of review. There was therefore no guarantee that in carrying out those assessments the Institute\u2019s experts would not commit errors, abuse their powers or deprive those concerned of their rights. That was important because if the Institute\u2019s experts assessed a member of staff to be mentally unfit for work at the Ministry, the Minister had no discretion and was bound to dismiss him or her. Although the member of staff concerned could seek judicial review of the Minister\u2019s order, such a challenge would be futile because the assessment, which formed the basis of the Minister\u2019s order, was not amenable to judicial scrutiny. The court acknowledged that the employment of the Ministry\u2019s staff touched upon national security. Nonetheless, it went on to hold that considerations relating to national security had to yield to a person\u2019s right under Article 120 of the Constitution (see paragraph 28 above) to judicial review of all administrative decisions affecting his or her rights. The court said that the assessment of a person\u2019s mental fitness for work at the Ministry of Internal Affairs should be amenable to \u201cthe same control for lawfulness, [namely] by several independent experts and by the court, as in the case of assessing health conditions [for the purpose of granting disability benefits]\u201d. Therefore, in as much as it provided that the Ministry\u2019s Psychology Institute was the only body authorised to assess mental fitness for work at the Ministry, regulation 251(1)(6) ran counter to section 2 of the 1997 Act (see paragraph 29 above) and the Health Act 2004. It was in addition contrary to the purpose of the law.",

The psychological assessment underpinning the order had not been the subject matter of the judicial review proceedings. It had not been an administrative decision and could not have itself been challenged by way of judicial review. The body which had made the assessment, the Psychology Institute of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, was a specialised body whose tasks included assessing, on the basis of a range of criteria laid down in Instruction no. I37 of 5 March 2001, the mental fitness of the Ministry\u2019s staff. Because of that, its assessments could not be subjected to judicial scrutiny. Once the Institute had assessed a member of staff to be mentally unfit for work, the Minister had no discretion and was bound to dismiss that person. The Supreme Administrative Court had found that in the applicant\u2019s case the procedure governing the manner in which the assessment was to be carried out had been followed, that the Institute had assessed the applicant to be mentally unfit for work, and that as a result the Minister had, by means of a reasoned decision, dismissed the applicant from his post.

There was nothing inherently wrong with that assessment being carried out by an expert employed by the Ministry\u2019s Psychology Institute (see, mutatis mutandis, Stefan, cited above). Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention does not bar the national courts from relying on expert opinions drawn up by specialised bodies to resolve the disputes before them when this is required by the nature of the contentious issues under consideration (see Cs\u0151sz, cited above, \u00a7 34). However, the reasoning of the threemember and fivemember panels of the Supreme Administrative Court shows that they did not simply take into account the assessment carried out by the Institute, but considered themselves bound by it and refused to scrutinise it in any way (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above, and contrast Stefan, cited above). Those rulings were fully in line with the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s caselaw predating its judgment of\u00a08\u00a0February 2005 in which it partly struck down regulation 251(1)(6) of the implementing regulations of the 1997 Act. In that caselaw, that court consistently held that the Institute\u2019s assessments were not amenable to judicial scrutiny and could not be contested through any means (see paragraph 34 above). This Court, for its part, finds that in its exclusive reliance on that assessment in the applicant\u2019s case the Supreme Administrative Court refused independently to scrutinise a point which was crucial for the determination of the case, and thus deprived itself of jurisdiction to examine the dispute before it (see, mutatis mutandis, I.D.\u00a0v.\u00a0Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7 50).",

In the Court\u2019s judgment, the proceedings before the Institute cannot be regarded as complying with the requirements of that provision.

It is also true that this Court has, albeit in different contexts, held that legitimate national security considerations may justify limitations on the rights enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention (see Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others v. the , 10 July 1998, \u00a7 76, Reports 1998IV; Rowe and Davis v. the  [GC], no. 28901/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR\u00a02000II; P.G. and J.H. v. the , no. 44787/98, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2001IX; Devenney v. the , no. 24265/94, \u00a7 26, 19\u00a0March 2002; and Da\u011ftekin and Others v. , no. 70516/01, \u00a7 34, 13\u00a0December 2007). However, neither the  in its reasoning nor the Government in their observations sought to justify this denial of access to a court with adequate jurisdiction in terms of either the legitimacy of the aim pursued or its proportionality. It is noteworthy in this connection that in other cases the Supreme Administrative Court held that an assessment of mental fitness for work which prompts the dismissal of an officer employed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs should be amenable to judicial scrutiny even if it touches upon national security, and that in May 2006 the law was changed to provide for direct judicial review of the mental fitness assessments of all members of the Ministry\u2019s staff (see paragraphs\u00a035, 36 and 4043 above and, mutatis mutandis, Mihailov v.\u00a0, no. 52367/99, \u00a7 38, 21 July 2005).",
