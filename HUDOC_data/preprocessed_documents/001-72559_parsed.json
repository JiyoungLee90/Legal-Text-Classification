Since in accordance with the relevant Bulgarian law at the pertinent time land commissions' decisions determined entitlement to restitution and property rights vis-\u00e0-vis the State, and since those decisions were subject to appeal to all levels of court, it would be contrary to the principle of legal certainty if it were accepted that the resulting final judgments did not even bind the State.

The State was declared the owner of the disputed land, the forest authority entered into possession thereof and the applicants were accordingly deprived of their title, including the rights to possess, use or dispose of the property (see paragraphs 24-26 above). In these circumstances, the Court finds that the effect of the judgment of 10 October 2000 the Supreme Court of Cassation was to deprive the applicants of their possessions (see Brumarescu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 76 and 77).",

The rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Pincov\u00e1 and Pinc v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a036548/97, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2002VIII, with further references). The principle of lawfulness also presupposes that the applicable provisions of domestic law are sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application (see Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a031443/96, \u00a7 147, ECHR 2004V). Furthermore, a deprivation of property can only be justified if it is shown to be \u201cin the public interest\u201d and if it satisfies the requirement of proportionality by striking a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights (see Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden, judgment of 23\u00a0September 1982, Series A no. 52, pp. 26-28, \u00a7\u00a7 69-74).",

It cannot be maintained, therefore that the deprivation of property at issue was lawful, in the sense of the Convention. The present case does not concern reopening of civil proceedings, within timelimits and under conditions regulated by law, but a failure to recognise the res judicata effect of a final judgment delivered in contentious proceedings. It cannot be considered that a public interest overriding the fundamental principle of legal certainty and the applicants' rights justified a re-examination of the dispute and the resulting deprivation of property without compensation.",
