Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For a positive obligation to arise, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7\u00a7 89-90, ECHR 2001III; Gongadze v.

In such a situation it is not only a question of an obligation to afford general protection to society (see Mastromatteo v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2002VIII; Maiorano and Others v.\u00a0Italy, no. 28634/06, \u00a7 111, 15 December 2009; Choreftakis and Choreftaki v.

In that context the Court reiterates that the police had to intervene twice during the night of 25\u00a0November 2013: firstly when they inspected the damaged flat, and secondly when they stopped and fined A.T., who was in a state of intoxication. Having regard also to the fact that the police had been in a position to check, in real time, A.T.\u2019s police record, the Court considers that they should have known that the applicant\u2019s husband constituted a real risk to her, the imminent materialisation of which could not be excluded. It therefore concludes that the authorities failed to use their powers to take measures which could reasonably have prevented, or at least mitigated, the materialisation of a real risk to the lives of the applicant and her son.",

It also notes that A.T. was convicted on 1 October 2015 of causing grievous bodily harm following the incident in August 2012, while in the meantime he had killed his son and attempted to murder the applicant and had also been sentenced on 8 January 2015, by the Udine preliminary hearings judge to life imprisonment for the murder of his son and the attempted murder of his wife, and for the offences of ill-treatment of the applicant and her daughter.

The Court considers that the applicant provided prima facie evidence, backed up by undisputed statistical data, that domestic violence primarily affects women and that, despite the reforms implemented, a large number of women are murdered by their partners or former partners (femicide) and, secondly, that the socio-cultural attitudes of tolerance of domestic violence persist (see paragraph 57 and 59 above).",

In light of the particular circumstances of this case and my conclusions in relation to Article 2 (above) any such short-term (and effectively preventative) intervention may well have been capable of justification under Article 5 \u00a7 1; whether on the basis of securing fulfilment of \u201chis obligation to keep the peace by not committing a specific and concrete offence\u201d (see Ostendorf v.

When contrasted with the close nexus in time and regularity of the violent acts in Opuz v. Turkey, which gave rise to the Court\u2019s finding of constructive knowledge, namely that the authorities ought to have known of a real and immediate risk under the Osman test, it is plain that the requisite timeframe allowing for a conclusion of immediacy is lacking in the present case. Bljakaj and Others v. Croatia presents a similar stark contrast and demonstrates the required extent of immediacy, with the perpetrator in that case making threats on the day before, morning of, and hour prior to, the fatal incident. It is worth noting that the Court\u2019s case-law in this regard falls in line with the requirements of the Istanbul Convention, the Explanatory Report to which establishes that the term \u201cimmediate danger\u201d refers to any situations of domestic violence in which harm is imminent or has already materialised and is likely to happen again.

It goes without saying that the attacks of June and August 2012 and their impact on the applicant should in no way be underestimated, the Italian courts eventually convicting A.T. of the violence carried out on those occasions. Nonetheless, when contrasted with the gravity of the eight prior attacks identified in Opuz, involving repeated death threats and resulting in life-threatening injuries on several occasions, the constructive knowledge inevitably arising from such a course of events cannot be imputed to the authorities in the present case, who did not possess information on attacks and death threats on this scale.

On what basis, then, could he have been detained, arrested or held at a hospital against his will, bearing in mind that having a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that he may have committed an offence and that there can clearly not be a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d if the acts or facts held against him, such as being drunk at home, did not constitute a crime at the time when they occurred?",

In fact, with the exception of the drunken state of the applicant\u2019s husband, which alone does not suffice for these purposes, there were no comments, threats or other behavioural signs that could have justified the deployment by the police of operational measures of arrest or detention at that point.",

Although it may be tempting to dilute legal concepts such as the Osman test when faced with heart-rending facts and give solace to individuals in situations such as that of the applicant, there are reasons why the threshold under the Convention is set high, and, in my view, why it must continue to remain so.

It has further stated that this conclusion will be reached where the actions of the authorities are not a simple failure or delay in dealing with violence, but amount to repeatedly condoning such violence and reflect a discriminatory attitude towards an applicant as a woman (see Eremia v.\u00a0the Republic of Moldova, \u00a7 89). Having regard to this high threshold and the previous findings made under this provision with respect to Italy in the case of Rumor v. Italy, I cannot subscribe to the majority\u2019s findings that the inaction of the authorities, as manifested in the present case, reflects systemic gender-based discrimination, since there is insufficient evidence to show general and discriminatory passivity of the kind previously established in the Court\u2019s case-law.",

It made reference to the overall unresponsiveness of the judicial system and the impunity enjoyed by aggressors. In particular, it noted the manner in which female victims were treated at police stations, with reports indicating that when they reported domestic violence, police officers tried to persuade them to return home and drop their complaint, seeing the problem as a family matter with which they could not interfere. The perpetrators of domestic violence did not seem to receive dissuasive punishments, with the courts mitigating sentences on the grounds of custom, tradition or \u201chonour\u201d. These findings were confirmed in Halime K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. Turkey, the Court highlighting the wilful refusal of the authorities to accept the seriousness of the incidents of domestic violence. In regularly turning a blind eye to the repeated acts of violence and death threats, the authorities had created a climate that was conducive to domestic violence. In both cases, the Court found that the inactivity, delays and, in particular, attempts to dissuade women from lodging complaints that characterised the treatment of domestic violence claims in Turkey stemmed directly from the discriminatory attitudes of the authorities.",

Croatia, no. 55164/08, \u00a7 97, 14 October 2010, the Court concluded that there was insufficient statistical or other information disclosing an appearance of discriminatory treatment of female victims of domestic violence on the part of authorities such as the police, law enforcement or healthcare personnel, social services, prosecutors or judges. The applicant did not allege that any officials had tried to dissuade her from pursuing the prosecution of the aggressor or giving evidence against him, or that they had tried in any other manner to hamper her efforts to seek protection against his violence. The Court thus declared the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 14 inadmissible, since she had failed to provide sufficient evidence that the practices adopted in Croatia as regards domestic violence were discriminatory.",

Croatia, \u00a7 101). Thus societal discrimination and high levels of domestic violence, as referenced by the judgment at paragraph 146, are not, in and of themselves, enough to ground a finding of an Article 14 violation; it is the legislative framework and its application by the national authorities that falls to be considered. In this regard, both in its substantive consideration of Articles\u00a02 and 3 as well as in the Article 14 context, the judgment fails to take proper account of the Court\u2019s finding in Rumor v. Italy, in the context of Article\u00a03, that \u201cthe authorities had put in place a legislative framework allowing them to take measures against persons accused of domestic violence and that that framework was effective in punishing the perpetrator of the crime of which the applicant was victim and preventing the recurrence of violent attacks against her physical integrity\u201d (see Rumor v. Italy, \u00a7 76). Although, as the judgment notes, that case may have concerned a different set of facts, the system at issue is the same. Since the impugned failings were not rooted in the discriminatory intent of the authorities but rather in pure passivity, they do not provide grounds for departure from the Article 14 conclusions previously drawn in respect of Italy.",

Where the Court has previously relied on international reports in this sphere, the criticisms therein have undoubtedly been more unequivocal. For instance, in Mudric v.\u00a0the\u00a0Republic of Moldova, the Court was of the view that the findings of the Special Rapporteur supported \u201cthe impression that the authorities do not fully appreciate the seriousness and extent of the problem of domestic violence and its discriminatory effect on women\u201d (see Mudric, \u00a7 63).",
