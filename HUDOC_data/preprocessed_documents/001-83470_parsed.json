The police arrested a reserve police constable William McCaughey, who, in the course of questioning, revealed his part in the abduction of the priest and in a variety of other loyalist paramilitary incidents. A number of other arrests followed, including that of a police officer John Weir who was named as having been involved in the murder of a shopkeeper called Strathearn in Ahoghill in April 1977: he was convicted for that murder in June 1980. The Government stated that both McCaughey and Weir refused to name the two loyalist paramilitaries also involved with them in the murder unless they received immunity from prosecution. The police and prosecuting authority took the decision prior to the trial not to enter into any process of bargaining with Weir and McCaughey. While both were approached by the police after their convictions to see if at that stage they would give evidence against the loyalist paramilitaries, each again refused to do so unless there was something in it for themselves. The Government stated that during the period in which Weir was detained he was interviewed on a large number of occasions.

While admitting to knowing that the three persons must have been engaged in illegal activity they claimed that they did not know the details and only after the event were able to relate the picking up of these persons to the incident at Donnelly\u2019s Bar. McClure and Shields were charged with offences under section 5 of the Criminal Law Act () 1967 \u2013 failure to disclose information relating to an offence. McConnell had by this date been murdered by the IRA and it was not possible to identify the other two persons in the car. In April 1981 the DPP made a decision not to pursue the charges against McClure and Shields. This decision was based on the receipt of an opinion of senior prosecuting counsel and was based on a series of factors: the delay in bringing the case to trial, the disposal of charges against others accused of offences arising from the investigation into McCaughey\u2019s revelations, the absence of a prospect of a custodial sentence and the impact of a judgment of Jones LJ cited in another case (R v Donnelly [1986] NI 54) which was viewed as eliminating any reasonable prospect of conviction as a legal defence was available to the accused on a charge of withholding information.",

They obtained from the journalist an edited transcript of the interview with Weir. While his whereabouts were unknown to the RUC, Weir met with senior Irish police officers at the Irish Embassy on 15 April 1999. A copy of his statement was provided by the Garda to the RUC, along with a further statement made by Weir to another journalist dated 3 February 1999. The police analysed the available materials and sought to identify the personalities to be interviewed. It became apparent that some had died and that others, living abroad, could not be traced. A series of seven interviews were conducted, under cautions, between July and December 2001, of those individuals central to Weir\u2019s account who could be traced. No charges were preferred. The interviews followed the format of Weir\u2019s allegations being put to the interviewee for his or her response.

It profiled Weir and dealt inter alia with a description of the 1978 investigation into McCaughey, Weir and others.

This also could not be disclosed due to the ongoing investigation but the Government have stated that this focussed directly on the attack on Donnelly\u2019s Bar, noting that Weir had mentioned the names of six persons, three of whom were known to have played a role in the attack. It noted that it was difficult to advance inquiries without interviewing Weir and recommended that there should be an overall review of the file on the attack and that the case be examined by the Serious Crime Review Team (\u201cSCRT\u201d) so that it could be determined whether the investigation should be reopened. This recommendation was accepted. The SCRT was established in March 2004, with responsibilities including the review of all historical murders by way of case assessment for evidential and investigative opportunities. It carried out a preliminary case review culminating in a report dated 14 June 2005 by Detective Inspector Ramsay of the Police Service Northern Ireland (\u201cPSNI\u201d). His view was that the investigation if looked at alone could not be progressed but that in the context of linked cases might be worth further exploration. He suggested a referral of the case for further assessment. The Historical Enquiry Team (\u201cHET\u201d) director of Investigations, Detective Chief Superintendent James of the London Metropolitan Police Force, took over personal supervision of the investigation which progressed through the first three of five stages of the HET process (collection of all relevant material; assessment of the investigations to date; review of evidence, with intelligence and open and non-police sources, together with a meeting with the families of the victims of the attack). As a number of investigative opportunities were identified and to be followed up, the case was to continue to be processed by HET, which had been put in touch with Weir by the Centre. The Government submitted that if any evidence of police involvement in the murders was found, the Office of the Police Ombudsman for  would then become involved.

The Independent Commission did not find the RUC\u2019s reasons sufficient to dismiss Weir\u2019s claims and it also noted a number of errors and discrepancies: for example, the RUC claimed that Lily Shields was dead whereas Garda enquiries revealed that she was still alive and the information given did not take into account Special Branch extracts, which indicated that James Mitchell knew ten named loyalists who came to the farm, of whom six appeared in Weir\u2019s allegations. Nor had the RUC paid sufficient attention to the evidence which supported Weir\u2019s allegations. The Garda officers, in contrast to the view formed by the RUC, found Weir \u201ccame across as an intelligent and discerning man who is a very convincing witness\u201d and that he was \u201chighly credible and had very comprehensive details about the crimes he purports to have knowledge of.\u201d The Report concluded that :",

He found that correspondence with the Attorney General in April 2003 established that the Attorney General had not issued a nolle prosequi. It appeared that a decision was taken by the DPP not to offer evidence against the accused at trial, which practice at the time was called, misleadingly, a nolle prosequi. Noting that the offence occurred in 1975 and the charges dropped in 1981 and that it had been clear throughout 2002 when the family and the Centre had been in contact with the police that no further action on this matter would be taken, he commented that the passage of time until bringing the judicial review application in May 2003 was very considerable. However, if he was wrong on the question of delay, the application still failed on the merits. The application for disclosure of files failed on the procedural ground that it was brought against the DPP, not the Chief Constable who had control of the said files. The decision of the DPP not to use his statutory power to direct a police investigation was a matter of discretion and the decision could not be said to be irrational or unlawful in the circumstances. As regarded reasons, the DPP had departed from his practice and reasons had been given by his officer in affidavit. In any event, the extent of the reasoning was a matter for the DPP and the court could not make an order to require the decision maker to give sufficient reasons to justify the decision not to prosecute. In relation to the discontinuance of the prosecution, the judge noted that the reasons included delay in bringing the case to trial, the perceived unlikelihood of a custodial sentence and \"crucially the impact of a judgment in another case which was judged to eliminate any reasonable prospect of a conviction\" which was a reference to the decision of Jones LJ discussed in R v Donnelly [1986] NI 54. He considered that it was evident that the decision was taken at the highest level and not lightly. At this long remove, with the death and retirement of the principal actors, it was not possible to establish that the decision, which had a rational basis was Wednesbury irrational or unlawful. He emphasised that a legal challenge of this kind directly affected third parties, namely the two defendants against whom the prosecution was dropped, and that it would be intrinsically unfair to reach a decision adverse to their position without giving them an opportunity to be heard - neither had been given notice of the application \u2013 and such a decision might also, potentially, be in breach of their rights or of the presumption of innocence. He noted that the purported entry of a nolle prosequi by the prosecution was admitted to be wrong in principle and law, as only the Attorney General could do such. The court record and documentation tended to suggest that the court was told that there was a nolle prosequi. While it would have been open to the prosecution merely to tender no evidence, this could have led to the direction of an acquittal; it was less clear whether an acquittal should have followed as a matter of law. He declined to give declaratory relief as to the invalid nature of the purported nolle prosequi due to the universal acceptance that this had been inappropriate, the fact that this practice had ceased, the applicant\u2019s delay and the absence of the accused as parties to the application.",

She also disputed that McClure and Shields had only been implicated to the degree of realising after the event that they had picked up the persons involved in the attack: to the extent that she had been able to see the statements, reproduced in the Dundalk report, the state of knowledge of both McClure and Shields was such as properly to give rise to a charge of murder, as McClure admitted knowing that a shooting was involved and Shields realised that it had something to do with \u201cThe Troubles\u201d. She also considered that doubts arose as to the circumstances in which a nolle prosequi had been entered against McClure, there being no adequate explanation for dropping these charges, the delay in proceeding with them or their separation from other charges faced by him.

The latter noted that the Irish police who had interviewed Weir and had access to all the information at the RUC\u2019s disposal found him a convincing witness. This underlined, in her view, the lack of RUC independence, both hierarchical and practical and the lack of an effective and thorough investigation by the RUC. She pointed out that the PSNI did not come into existence until November 2001 and in any event was largely a continuation of the former organisation without hierarchical or practical independence. In particular, she noted that the RUC officer conducting the investigation in 1999 was denied access to the information held by RUC Special Branch (e.g. the abstracts of information from interview notes, themselves since lost, known as Daily Record Sheets); the significant number of factual errors and inaccuracies in the RUC report (e.g. it stated that Shields was dead when she was in fact still living at Mitchell\u2019s farm); the failure of the RUC report to draw sufficient attention to evidence which supported Weir\u2019s stories; and the fact that discrepancies in the accounts given by Mitchell in 1978 and 2000 were not explored, while denials made by David Payne which were contradicted by his previous convictions were not followed up, thus showing that the interview process by the RUC in 1999 was inadequate. Indeed, she asserted that the interviews conducted by the RUC were only carried out at the behest of the Irish police and that they were conducted in a manner which did not press the interviewees in relation to their involvement in terrorist activities and contributed to the conclusion that Weir lacked credibility. Insofar as the Government claimed that it had not been possible for the authorities to interview Weir themselves, she noted that he had been easily accessible to journalists, the Irish Police and the Independent Commission and that it had been possible for the HET, some seven years later, to trace him using the Centre as a conduit.

The Court\u2019s case-law established that such an obligation could arise where circumstances, in particular the emergence of new evidence, arose casting doubt on the original investigation or which raised new or wider issues. The test for determining whether an investigation was required was whether the nature of the evidence was such as to make it reasonable to impose a duty on the authorities to investigate that information or material or whether it was in the interests of justice to impose a duty on the authorities to investigate the new evidence. Further, where the state\u2019s own authorities determined that an investigation was necessary, such investigation must necessarily be Article 2 - compliant. The requirements of independence, accountability and transparency, effectiveness, promptness and expedition remained undiminished, even after the passage of time, although the steps that could reasonably be taken might be influenced by that factor. Also relevant was the nature and efficacy of any earlier investigation and the nature of the new evidence. However the investigation in this case, lasting over seven years, could not be regarded as prompt. Commenced in July 1999, the RUC investigation concluded in October 2003, then further work was undertaken prior to transmission to the SCRT, the HET took up the case in April 2006 and the investigation was still ongoing. She noted that in any event the HET was not carrying out a full effective investigation but was only seeking to identify if further evidentiary opportunities existed.

To the extent that the case of Hackett appeared to support the contrary approach, the Court had adopted its decision without the benefit of argument on these points.

To do so, any new evidence would have to be very weighty and, prima facie, compelling in nature and hold out a serious or realistic prospect of a successful prosecution, otherwise the State authorities would face a disproportionate burden in investigating historic crimes, possibly to the detriment of the investigation of recent crimes and the prevention of future ones. In this case, the allegations made by Weir about this incident were limited references, made indirectly to third parties rather than to the authorities in , based largely on hearsay and speculation and not pointing to any source of hard evidence.

The investigations were independent, as the RUC personnel involved in the initial investigations had long since left the security forces or died, PSNI had undergone extensive reform and was to be regarded as independent of the RUC, and in any event the HET which was now carrying out the investigation was independent of both the RUC and PSNI, while the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland was also independent and in a position to investigate and monitor the HET investigation. The investigations were reasonably prompt having regard to the circumstances and the other pressures on policing resources in : the police were hampered by the failure of Weir to give a statement to them and their attempts to trace him had proved fruitless. Further, the investigations had been as effective as could reasonably be expected in the circumstances, the applicant not identifying any concrete line of inquiry or step which should have been taken but was not. Efforts had been made to meet with Weir. However, when he did agree to meet with the HET in , he refused to make a written statement or to give evidence in court. There had also been involvement of the family and public scrutiny to the requisite degree, given that there was no obligation to provide relatives with access to the file of an ongoing criminal investigation and that police officers had met with and discussed the case with the family on a number of occasions.

Furthermore, even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see McKerr\u00a0v. the , no.\u00a028883/95, \u00a7\u00a7 111 and 114, ECHR 2001III).",

It cannot be the case that any assertion or allegation can trigger a fresh investigative obligation under Article 2 of the Convention. Nonetheless, given the fundamental importance of this provision, the State authorities must be sensitive to any information or material which has the potential either to undermine the conclusions of an earlier investigation or to allow an earlier inconclusive investigation to be pursued further. Both parties have suggested possible tests. The Court has doubts as to whether it is possible to formulate any detailed test which could usefully apply to the myriad of widely-differing situations that might arise. It is also salutary to remember that the Convention provides for minimum standards, not for the best possible practice, it being open to the Contracting Parties to provide further protection or guarantees. For example, contrary to the applicant\u2019s assertion, if Article 2 does not impose the obligation to pursue an investigation into an incident, the fact that the State chooses to pursue some form of inquiry does not thereby have the effect of imposing Article 2 standards on the proceedings. Lastly, bearing in mind the difficulties involved in policing modern societies and the choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources, positive obligations must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (Osman\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII, \u00a7 116).",

The steps that it will be reasonable to take will vary considerably with the facts of the situation. The lapse of time will, inevitably, be an obstacle as regards, for example, the location of witnesses and the ability of witnesses to recall events reliably. Such an investigation may in some cases, reasonably, be restricted to verifying the credibility of the source, or of the purported new evidence. The Court would further underline that, in light of the primary purpose of any renewed investigative efforts (see paragraph 65 above), the authorities are entitled to take into account the prospects of success of any prosecution. The importance of the right under Article 2 does not justify the lodging, willy-nilly, of proceedings. As it has had occasion to hold previously, the police must discharge their duties in a manner which is compatible with the rights and freedoms of individuals and they cannot be criticised for attaching weight to the presumption of innocence or failing to use powers of arrest, search and seizure having regard to their reasonably held view that they lacked at relevant times the required standard of suspicion to use those powers or that any action taken would not in fact have produced concrete results. (Osman, cited above, \u00a7 121).",

Where the assertion or new evidence tends to indicate police or security force collusion in an unlawful death, the criterion of independence will, generally, remain unchanged (see, for the importance of this criterion from the very earliest stage of the procedure, Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands\u00a0[GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7\u00a7. 325, 333-341, ECHR 2007-...). Promptness will be likely not to come into play in the same way, since, for example, there may be no urgency as regards the securing of a scene of the crime from contamination or in obtaining witness statements while recollections are sharp. Reasonable expedition will remain a requirement, but what is reasonable is likely to be coloured by the investigative prospects and difficulties which exist at such a late stage.",

It was more than seventeen years later that allegations by John Weir were made public concerning collusion between security forces and loyalist terrorists and naming four loyalists as having been responsible for the attack. These allegations were published, or made known from March 1999 and received wide publicity when included in a television programme in June 1999. An investigative response appears to have been commenced by the RUC at around that time. Interviews with seven individuals central to Weir\u2019s allegations and amongst those who could be traced or were still alive, were conducted in 2001, without obtaining any useful new or incriminating evidence. Information was received from counterparts in the Irish police force and also provided to the inquiry in  which was investigating a number of incidents at this time (paragraphs 42-45 above). It would appear that the RUC investigation was acknowledged as failing to progress due to the need to interview Weir directly. While the applicant alleged, in answer to the Government\u2019s assertion that Weir had proved inaccessible to the United Kingdom authorities, that the Dublin police and the Centre had no difficulty in talking to him, the Court would note that Weir refrained from coming within the jurisdiction, where he might well have risked further criminal charges being lodged against him or retaliatory steps from those whom he had been naming in the press. It sees no reason to disbelieve the Government\u2019s statement that they took steps to locate Weir, including approaching his last known address and making inquiries from the Irish police and the Barron inquiry staff.",

It was the RUC which carried out the interviews with those named by Weir and which was entrusted with the initial assessment of the credibility of his allegations. This must be regarded as tainting the early stage of the enquiries. The Court recalls that the PSNI took over from the RUC in November 2001. It is satisfied that the PSNI was institutionally distinct from its predecessor even if, necessarily, it inherited officers and resources. It observes that the applicant has not expressed any doubts about the independence of the teams which took over from 2004 (the SCRT and HET). However this does not in the circumstances detract from the fact that for a considerable period the case lay under the responsibility and control of the RUC.
