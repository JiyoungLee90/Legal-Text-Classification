This was considered to be evidence that she would not be of any adverse interest to the Ugandan authorities.

It found that the Special Adjudicator was not correct in stating that there was no evidence of individuals being at risk of persecution because of the political activities of their relatives, as he should have considered and made a finding on a letter from the Democratic Party before him which contained evidence to the contrary. The Special Adjudicator had also erred in stating that the applicant had claimed to have been followed but never accosted or apprehended after she returned from Kenya in 1997 and it would have been better if he had referred to the applicant\u2019s claim to have gone into hiding when concluding that the authorities had shown no further interest in her after her release. Though the applicant was a credible witness and events in  had given rise to a genuine fear of persecution on her part, she had not been seriously ill-treated when detained for a short time in 1986 and questioned about her father\u2019s political activities. Her representative had conceded at the hearing that she had not been subjected to past persecution. There was no evidence that the authorities were looking for the applicant in the period between her being questioned and her father\u2019s release in 1987. However, it was noted that this may have been because she was in hiding. After the applicant\u2019s father disappeared in October 1997 there was a period before she went to  during which the authorities could have found her at her home and arrested her if they had wanted to do so. They could have arrested her at any time between her return to Uganda in January 1997 and September 1998, except for a brief period from July\u00a01998 during which she returned to . During this period, the applicant believed that she was being watched and followed. If this was the case and the authorities had as serious an interest in her as she claimed, it was difficult to understand why they had not arrested her. Whilst in late\u00a01997 she was accosted by two men who asked her if she knew where her father was and confiscated her original passport, they did not arrest her or subject her to the persecution she claimed to fear. If she was correct and the authorities were looking for her father they were as likely to obtain information from her during that period as they would be during the period after he was detained.",

There was no claim that the applicant or any other member of the family present at that time had been arrested. The evidence showed that the only real interest the authorities had in the applicant was in discovering her father\u2019s whereabouts. They no longer needed this information since he was in custody. Though the applicant sought to argue that the Ugandan authorities might still wish to obtain information from her, which would assist the conviction of her father or his associates, it was likely that they were looking for incriminating evidence when they searched the home in September 1998. However they did not arrest the applicant. Having regard to the country information reports, the tribunal also found that there was no evidence that family members of political opponents were negatively associated or as a result persecuted in any way.",

He was of the opinion that as the applicant\u2019s claim had been considered and dismissed by both a Special Adjudicator and the IAT, albeit on a majority decision, he needed to consider whether there were any circumstances that had arisen since the date of the IAT\u2019s decision that would provide exceptional circumstances sufficient to engage Article 3. Though the current conditions in  were certainly no better than they were at the time the applicant had left the country, there was nothing to suggest that they had seriously deteriorated or that the position of her father had worsened. The Adjudicator noted that the applicant\u2019s cousin had informed her that the remainder of her family were well in Uganda and that her legal representative had conceded that there was no emphatic ground to contend that Article 3 would be breached should the applicant be returned to . He further observed that, with commendable honesty, the applicant\u2019s legal representative had accepted that the Article 3 claim would be hard to uphold and had rather sought to concentrate on the Article 8 claim. As regards the applicant\u2019s submissions under Article 8, the Adjudicator found that the applicant had established a private and not family life in the  as the relationship she enjoyed with a male friend did not constitute family life.

The applicant\u2019s fears that she might be detained, tortured or subjected to degrading treatment given the manner of her escape were considered speculative as she had provided no evidence to support this claim. The applicant had failed to provide any evidence that the Ugandan authorities were of the opinion that she could assist them with any inquiries regarding her father. No new or compelling evidence had been provided. Article 8 had already been considered during her appeal against the refusal of her human rights application and all the issues she had raised in her current representations had also been raised before and considered thoroughly by the Adjudicator. Furthermore, the applicant had the opportunity to apply for permission to appeal against the Adjudicator\u2019s determination of 11\u00a0January 2005 but had failed to do so.",

Secondly, the applicant had failed to apply for permission to appeal from the Adjudicator to the IAT in her human rights appeal (see paragraph 28 above). As the decision under appeal in the present case had been taken on 4 June 2001, when the Secretary of State had initially refused her appeal on human rights grounds, the 1999 Act was still applicable following the provisions of the Commencement Order 2003 (see\u00a0paragraphs 31 and 32 above). Thirdly, the applicant had failed to apply for permission to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of State\u2019s decision of 27 March 2006. Finally, the applicant could have made further representations to the Secretary of State if there had been a relevant change of circumstances which she had not previously raised before the domestic authorities. If any such further submissions had been accepted as a fresh claim, she would have a right of appeal under section 82 of the 2002 Act (see paragraph 29 above). If her further submissions were rejected and not accepted as amounting to a fresh claim she could bring judicial review proceedings. The High Court could grant an injunction to prevent her removal from taking place before her judicial review application had been considered. However, this was very unlikely given the lack of evidence of a relevant change of circumstances and the comments made by the High Court judge in relation to her last application for leave to apply for judicial review.",

As for the Government\u2019s final submission that she could have made further representations to the Secretary of State, the applicant contended that the Government themselves had recognised that there was no material that had not been previously considered and that therefore a fresh claim was not a realistic remedy.

The burden of proof is on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that an effective remedy was available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, namely, that the remedy was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, 16\u00a0December 1999, \u00a7 55). Further, where there is a choice of remedies open to an applicant, Article 35 must be applied to reflect the practical realities of the applicant\u2019s position in order to ensure the effective protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (Hilal v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 45276/99, 8 February 2000).",

In so finding, the Court observes that it was not entirely clear which provisions were applicable to the applicant\u2019s case due to the change to the applicable legislation introduced by the 2002 Act and its concomitant Commencement Orders. The Court further notes the Adjudicator\u2019s observation during the January 2005 hearing that the applicant\u2019s representative herself had conceded that the Article 3 point was difficult to uphold and considers this to be strong evidence that any further appeal, if available, would offer little if any prospects of success. In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s application to the Secretary of State on human rights grounds and her subsequent appeal against that decision to an Adjudicator under section 65 of the 1999 Act, all following the failure of her initial asylum claim, were sufficient to dispense her from the obligation to exhaust all domestic remedies under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

In light of the applicant\u2019s unsuccessful application for leave to apply for judicial review in April 2005 and the lack of any new evidence, the Court similarly finds that this remedy offered little if any prospects of success. Finally, the Court does not consider the Government\u2019s final submission that the applicant could have made further representations to the Secretary of State tenable, as by the Government\u2019s own admission there was no material which had not been considered previously. It follows that this was not an adequate or effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Similarly the Court takes into consideration the Home Office\u2019s recent Operational Guidance Note on Uganda of 15 January 2007 (see paragraph 35 above), which states that in cases of low-level activists detained for a few days and then released without charge the harassment suffered would not reach a level of persecution in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.

The Court notes that this event occurred a significant time ago, approximately nine years, and that it is unsupported by any other corroborating country evidence as to the existence of a general risk to the families of political opponents. Furthermore, this reported incident can be distinguished from the facts of the present case in that it involved questioning as to a son\u2019s whereabouts on numerous occasions on which the mother had presumably initially failed to cooperate. In the instant case, however, the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s location is known as he has been in detention and in the custody of the authorities for almost ten years. Furthermore, the applicant has not been detained or questioned during several periods when it was clearly open to the authorities to do so.",

In this regard, the Court notes that, unlike the applicant in the case of \u00dcner (cited above), the present applicant is not a settled migrant and has never been granted a right to remain in the respondent State. Her stay in the United Kingdom, pending the determination of her several asylum and human rights claims, has at all times been precarious and her removal, on rejection of those claims, is not rendered disproportionate by any alleged delay on the part of the authorities in assessing them.",
