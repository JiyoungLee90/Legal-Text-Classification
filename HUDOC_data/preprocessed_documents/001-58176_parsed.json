The Group confirmed that childhood leukaemia was more common in this area than normal, but was not able to determine the reason for this. One of the members of the Group, Dr Martin Gardner, went on to conduct three studies into the phenomenon. The third, published on 17\u00a0February 1990 (\u201cthe Gardner Report\u201d), found a statistical association \nbetween the incidence of leukaemia in children from the town of Seascale, near Sellafield, and relatively high recorded doses of external whole-body radiation received by their fathers employed at the nuclear power plant prior to conception.",

The two cases were heard concurrently in the High Court of Justice, London, on ninety days between October 1992 and June 1993.

One of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, Sir Richard Doll, had referred to research emphasising the role of infection in causing childhood leukaemia, particularly in areas where unusual population mixing had occurred, as was the case in Seascale, which had a very mobile population of high socio-economic class situated in a remote rural area.

There had certainly been no intent to expose the servicemen to radiation: an experiment of the kind alleged would have been not only scandalous, but also pointless, since by the 1950s a considerable amount of information about the effects of radiation on the human body had already been derived from the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.

Perhaps more importantly for the issues under Article 2, these records provide a basis to believe that the State authorities, during the period between the United Kingdom\u2019s recognition of the competence of the Commission to receive applications on 14 January 1966 and the applicant\u2019s diagnosis with leukaemia in October 1970, could reasonably have been confident that her father had not been dangerously irradiated.",

British Nuclear Fuels PLC, having examined a considerable amount of expert evidence, found that \u201cthe scales tilt[ed] decisively\u201d in favour of a finding that there was no such causal link (see paragraph 19 above).

It is perhaps arguable that, had there been reason to believe that she was in danger of contracting a life-threatening disease owing to her father\u2019s presence on Christmas Island, the State authorities would have been under a duty to have made this known to her parents whether or not they considered that the information would assist the applicant.
