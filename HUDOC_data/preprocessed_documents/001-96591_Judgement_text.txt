The case originated in an application (no. 2915/02) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Romanian nationals, Ms Ana Maria Oana Seceleanu, Mr Andrei Nicolae Seceleanu and Ms Maria Alina Biji (“the applicants”), on 7 August 2001.
The first applicant died on 2 February 2006. The second and 
third applicants are her children and only heirs. For practical reasons, Ms Ana Maria Oana Seceleanu will continue to be referred to as 
“the applicant” in this judgment, although her heirs are now to be regarded as such (see Dalban v.  [GC], no. 28114/95, § 1, ECHR 1999VI).
The applicants were represented by Mr Daniel Tintoiu, a lawyer practising in . The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Răzvan-Horaţiu Radu.

On 8 February 1995 the Bucharest Court of First Instance allowed the action by S.D. and ordered restitutio in integrum of the two apartments. However, on the basis of an inheritance certificate, it held that B.R. had no standing in the proceedings.
An appeal by the authorities was dismissed on 20 November 1995 by the Bucharest County Court, which considered the seizure as being unlawful. That judgment became final.
On 12 May 1997, at the request of S.D., the Bucharest Town Council, having regard to the fact that the judgment of 8 February 1995 had become enforceable, ordered the restitution of  and 215.
Although S.D. had secured judicial recognition of his property right, he was not able to recover possession of those apartments because the State had sold them on 23 December 1996 and 13 January 1997 respectively to the then tenants, under Law no. 112/1995.
In 1998 S.D. lodged two requests to have the sales by the State declared null and void. S.D. died in 2000 and the applicants continued the proceedings.
On 7 February 2001 the Bucharest Court of Appeal, by a final decision, dismissed the action regarding , considering that the sale had complied with the provisions of Law no. 112/1995 and that the former tenants had made the purchase in good faith.
On 13 August 2001 the applicants applied to the administrative authorities for restitution of  under Law no. 10/2001 governing immovable property wrongfully seized by the State. By a letter of 12 April 2006 the Town Council informed the Agent of the Government that the file was incomplete as it lacked some of the necessary documents.
On 12 December 2002 the Court of Appeal, by a final decision, upheld the other action lodged by S.D. in 1998 and declared the sale of  null and void.
On 22 February 2008 the Bucharest Court of First Instance allowed a request by the second and third applicants to have the former tenants of  evicted from that apartment.

The former tenants also intervened in the proceedings.
The Bucharest Court of Appeal dismissed that request as being out of time, by a final decision of 20 September 2001.
On 12 June 2002 the Town Council again sought to have that judgment revised, following a request by the same former tenants of , alleging that there were new documents proving that S.D. was not the only heir of B.M. The former tenants intervened in the proceedings.
On 20 November 2002 the Bucharest Court of First Instance dismissed the action as being out of time. There is nothing in the file to say that an appeal was lodged against that judgment.
On 22 November 2002, at the request of the former tenants, the Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Bucharest Court of First Instance brought proceedings to have that judgment revised, on the basis of an inheritance certificate from 1958, considered to be a new document attesting that S.D. was not the only heir.
On 31 January 2003 the Bucharest Court of First Instance found that request inadmissible, since that certificate could have been obtained by the authorities, which were defendants in those proceedings, with minimum diligence.

On 27 April 2005 the  Town Council made a fresh attempt, at the request of the same former tenants who had intervened in the proceedings, to have the judgment of 8 February 1995 revised. The former tenants informed the Town Council that the prosecutor had found that the signatures on the 1994 application form (see paragraph 6 above) were forged, since they belonged to the plaintiffs’ lawyer, although it had been alleged that they belonged to the plaintiffs themselves. However, the prosecutor acknowledged that the lawyer’s criminal responsibility had become time-barred.
