While there was no truly public exposure of his handcuffing (since all those who saw the applicant were presumably either detained or worked in the prison), the Court cannot exclude that, especially for a detainee sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment, his appearance and relationship with other inmates and even prison staff may be important to his own self-esteem. Therefore, any measure which diminishes such self-esteem or self-image in the eyes of others, especially when lasting for extended periods of time, must be considered as potentially \u201cdegrading\u201d. The final determination of whether the measure did in fact have such an effect will depend on the overall circumstances \u2013 notably the reason for such treatment, its compliance with domestic law and its proportionality to the detainee\u2019s misconduct.",

Rather, it appears that the measure was intended to last until the prison board, at one of its subsequent sessions, decided to discontinue it. The Court considers that such a rigid system does not allow the prison authorities to react quickly to changes in prison security. It thus does not allow for an adequate mechanism to limit the application of the restraint measure to the time that is strictly necessary (see Rule 68.3 of the European Prison Rules, quoted in paragraph 18 above), that is to the extent necessary for the safe and orderly confinement of the detainee in question (see 25th General Report of the CPT, \u00a7 74, quoted in paragraph 19 above).",
