She understood some Danish but found it difficult to speak Danish. She stated that she had been granted residence based on an application for asylum. She had entered Denmark in 2000. She was still married to [the applicant], although they had only married in a Muslim ceremony. They had never married under the Danish rules. They had three children together: a 9-year-old boy, an 8-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy. All of them were healthy and attended school here in Denmark. Y and [the applicant] had joint custody of the three children, who were all Iraqi nationals. Before [the applicant\u2019s] arrest in the drug case, which resulted in him being sent to prison, Y and [the applicant], had lived together at Y\u2019s current home. After his arrest and during his imprisonment, Y had visited [the applicant] in prison once a week on average. Their three children had also accompanied her on the visits. If [the applicant] were released, the plan was for him to move in with Y again and live with her and their three children. Y indicated that she could not go to Jordan with him if he were deported to Jordan. She stated in that respect that she had lived in Jordan for five years with her parents. When leaving Jordan in 2000, she had been told at the airport in Jordan that she must pay some money for having lived in Jordan, and if she failed to pay she could not return to Jordan. Y could not pay the money; she did not recall the amount. When asked whether she was in possession of Jordanian documents in that respect, she replied that she was not. This was the reason why she could not return to Jordan. Furthermore, she did not want her children to grow up in Jordan. Accordingly she and her three children would not accompany [the applicant] if he were returned to Jordan. ... Her father was dead ... She subsisted on welfare benefits. [The applicant\u2019s] only contribution to Y\u2019s living costs was child support ...\u201d",

When asked how and to whom her family had had to pay money, she replied that she had been very young at the time and had never learned the details about that. She had lived in Jordan for about three years and had not left the country during those three years. She had left Jordan in 2000 with her mother and her three siblings as they had been granted family reunion in Denmark. Y and her family had therefore travelled to Denmark. She had not been to Jordan since. When Y and her family had left the airport in Amman, the airport authorities/police had demanded that the family pay money for the time that they had lived in Jordan. The applicant did not know how much money her family had been asked to pay. She stated that she had heard that the amount was ten Jordanian dinars, probably for each day\u2019s stay on each passport, but there may also have been a monthly payment. Their family had had three passports altogether. Her family had been unable to pay the amount demanded at the airport of Amman, and they had then been told that it would subsequently be impossible for them to enter Jordan in future. She did not know whether her family could enter if the amount due was paid in connection with a future journey to Jordan. When asked about her three children, Y replied that they were all in good health and attended school here in Denmark. In connection with parent consultations at the school, Y had been informed that her children were doing well at school. However, her eldest son isolated himself a little when in after-school care. None of the children suffered from diseases of any kind, whether physical or mental. When asked, Y replied that none of her children saw a doctor or a psychologist. However, her eldest son was often sad because he thought about his father.\u201d",

The reason was that he isolated himself. The reason why he isolated himself was that he missed being part of a whole family. It would help if he could be with [the applicant]. No support had been granted to the two younger children. They were doing well. Her siblings also lived in Aarhus. However, she did have one sister living in the Netherlands. A few years before, this sister had tried to return to Jordan after she was expelled from the Netherlands. However, Jordan had refused to accept her sister because there was an unpaid bill or fine linked to the family\u2019s stay in Jordan. If [the applicant] were deported to Jordan, she would have to remain in Denmark with the children, primarily for the sake of the children. She did not want them to grow up elsewhere.

The access to review under section 50 was restricted by Act No. 473 of 1 July 1998 so that it is only possible to review an expulsion order of a judgment once. According to Report No. 1326/1997, the rationale of this restriction was to link the review time-wise with the date of the alien\u2019s release for the purpose of expulsion so as to reduce the likelihood of material relevant changes in the alien\u2019s circumstances occurring during the period between the review and the enforcement of the expulsion. It is incumbent on the court, on its own initiative, to see to it that the conditions for review of an expulsion order of a judgment are satisfied, see Danish Weekly Law Reports 2000.2406, Supreme Court. The request may be dismissed by the court if it is manifest that no material change has occurred in the alien\u2019s circumstances.\u201d",
