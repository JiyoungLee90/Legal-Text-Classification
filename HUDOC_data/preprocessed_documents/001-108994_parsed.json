However, the same term has been used to describe local Muslims who joined the foreign mujahedin, endorsed their ideology and adjusted to their way of dressing.

As stated by Ali Hamad, an ICTY witness of Bahraini origin who came to BH in 1992, some of the mujahedin were members of al-Qaeda who had the aim of \u201ccreating a base that would allow them to increase their area of operations\u201d.

They were also given religious instruction. A number of groups comprising foreign and/or local mujahedin were active. Notwithstanding instances of participation in combat alongside each other, it appears that these groups were anxious to maintain their distinct identities.

Although the original idea had been to replenish the unit with foreign mujahedin only, locals soon outnumbered its foreign members. The factors that motivated locals to join it included: its stricter regimental discipline; a better degree of organisation; superior equipment and combat morale; its religious dedication; and material benefits. The unit received funds and assistance from many organisations and individuals from the Islamic world, including the Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation and the Benevolence International Foundation.

It was led by foreign mujahedin who were not appointed by the ARBH. At the top of the hierarchy was an emir, who has been described as the highest-ranking person within the unit. Abu Haris, a Libyan, was its first emir. In December 1993, he was succeeded by an Algerian, Abu Maali, who remained in that position until the end of the war. A different person from the emir, the military commander, headed the military council and was responsible for the conduct of combat operations. In 1993, this post was held by an Egyptian named Vahidin or Wahiuddin. After his death in October 1993, another Egyptian, Muatez, succeeded him. Muatez was killed in September 1995. The unit had a religious council, the shura, which was its supreme decision-making body. It consisted of approximately twenty prominent members of the unit, mostly of Arab origin. The emir was elected by and answerable to the shura. At the end of 1994, Sheikh Shaban joined the leadership of the unit. He was the head of the Islamic Cultural Institute in  and known to be an extremist who was well-connected with Islamic fundamentalists all over the world (the ICTY relied in that regard on a judgment of the Milan Criminal Court of 1 January 2006). He facilitated the recruitment of volunteers from Arab countries for the struggle in BH. Although Sheikh Shaban did not hold an official function within the unit, its members considered him to be the political authority and even the real emir within the unit. He could issue binding rulings (fatwa) and his authority was never challenged by the shura. Sheikh Shaban was killed, together with Abu\u00a0Haris, at an HVO (Croatian Defence Council) military checkpoint on 14 December 1995.",

Article III of Annex 1A to that Agreement called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, including individual advisors, freedom fighters, trainers, volunteers, and personnel from neighbouring and other States, irrespective of whether they were legally and militarily subordinated to any of the local forces. In view of that, on 14 December 1995 the ARBH disbanded El\u00a0Mujahedin and ordered its foreign members to leave the country by 10\u00a0January 1996. Despite initial resistance, the shura accepted that the unit be disbanded. It would appear that awards, such as the \u201cGolden Lily\u201d, were given to its members as an incentive for foreigners to leave. Members of the unit were also provided with ARBH certificates of service, which assisted its foreign members to acquire BH citizenship.

Armed groups remain lethal, and suicide attacks and car bombs directed against the MNF-I/ISF [Multinational Forces in Iraq/Iraqi Security Forces], Awakening Movements and civilians, in addition to targeted assassinations and kidnappings, continue to occur on a regular basis, claiming the lives of civilians and causing new displacement. These methods of violence are usually targeted at chosen areas where civilians of specific religious or ethnic groups gather, including places of worship, market places, bus stations, and neighbourhoods. Violence appears often to be politically motivated and linked to ongoing struggles over territory and power among various actors. As clarified above, even where an individual may not have personally experienced threats or risks of harm, events surrounding his or her areas of residence or relating to others, may nonetheless give rise to a well-founded fear. There is also more specific targeting of individuals by extremist elements of one religious or political group against specific individuals of another, through kidnappings and execution-style killings.\u201d",

Nonetheless, politically motivated violence still occurred on a daily basis. There were otherwise no new patterns of acts of violence. It was still the situation that such acts were primarily targeting authorities, the army and the political milieu. However, the casualties among the civilian population were considerably higher than those of the target groups. The level of political violence appeared relatively low in view of the continuous political tensions related to the unclear political status of the city. At the same time, the political violence was directly linked to unresolved political questions. Both Kurdish regional authorities and the national central authorities claimed a right to governance in the city. There was little information available which systematically presented the situation in the province for each of the three ethnic groups \u2013 Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens. According to the newspaper Today\u2019s Zaman of 10 February 2010, the local police was composed of 36% Kurds, 39%\u00a0Arabs and 26% Turkmens. In the Kurdish areas of the city there were both Kurdish and Turkmen officers. In the Hawija district west of , the officers were Arabs. Even though the different groupings were reasonably well represented within public administration and education, distrust between them had frequently been reported since 2003.",

On the other hand, not only did he not provide any evidence in support of these statements, they also seem to be in contradiction to what he previously said about his visits (see paragraph 23 above). From his previous statements it would appear that he moved freely in and out of public buildings and on the streets during his visits (taking his sick father to hospital and, afterwards, holding a commemoration for him). Moreover, on both visits the applicant stayed in  for more than one month. It should be noted that the security situation in Iraq was much more dangerous at the time of the applicant\u2019s visits than it is now (according to Iraq Body Count there were 12,087 civilian deaths reported in 2003, 11, 072 in 2004 and 4,045 in 2010;  as downloaded on 16 November 2011).

In that case, the Court held that while the general situation in Iraq was insecure and problematic, it was not so serious as to cause, by itself, a violation of Article\u00a03 if that applicant, a Christian and a member of the Ba\u2019ath party, were to be returned there (see also M\u00fcslim v.

Although the Court is aware that the UNHCR, the UN and the IOM recommend that countries refrain from forcibly returning refugees to , they have stated that they are committed to providing assistance to those who return. Moreover, the Court observes that their recommendations are partly based on the security situation and partly due to practical problems for returnees such as shelter, health care and property restitution. In this connection, the Court stresses that it attaches importance to information contained in recent reports from independent international human rights organisations or governmental sources (see, among others, Saadi v. Italy, cited above, \u00a7 131). However, its own assessment of the general situation in the country of destination is carried out only to determine whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant would be at a real risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited by Article 3 if he were to be returned to that country. Consequently, where reports are focused on general socio-economic and humanitarian conditions, the Court has been inclined to accord less weight to them, since such conditions do not necessarily have a bearing on the question of a real risk to an individual applicant of illtreatment within the meaning of Article 3 (see NA, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0122).",

It does no more than afford the Contracting States a means of preventing offences which are concrete and specific as regards, in particular, the place and time of their commission and their victims (see Guzzardi v.

In other words, the domestic authorities must still act in strict compliance with domestic law (ibid., \u00a7 75).

His detention was accordingly authorised and was indeed mandatory pursuant to section 99(2)(b) of the Aliens Act 2008 (see paragraph 30 above).

That is to say, the applicant must have paid them, or be bound to pay them, pursuant to a legal or contractual obligation, and they must have been unavoidable in order to prevent the breaches found or to obtain redress. The Court requires itemised bills and invoices that are sufficiently detailed to enable it to determine to what extent the above requirements have been met. In the present case, regard being had to the fact that one of the applicant\u2019s representatives is a non-profit organisation providing free legal aid and that no bills and invoices have been submitted in relation to the other applicant\u2019s representative, the Court rejects the claim for costs and expenses.",
