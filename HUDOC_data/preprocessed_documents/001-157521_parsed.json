He referred to the description of the applicant\u2019s injuries on his arrival in the IVS (see paragraph 13 above) and the SIZO (see paragraph 16 above) and his examination by the forensic medical expert (see paragraph 19 above). He stated that the expert\u2019s suggestions as to how the injuries had been sustained made it doubtful that the applicant could have received his injuries as a result of a one-off impact by his face against a wall. The prosecutor further noted that the applicant had explained that he would most likely be able to identify the police officer who had beaten him at the police station. However, it was not possible to carry out an identification parade and a confrontation in a preinvestigation inquiry. The prosecutor considered that it could not be ruled out that, after his arrest, the applicant had been subjected to acts of violence in order to make him confess to the crime. The applicant\u2019s version of his illtreatment by the police officers could only be verified by way of a full investigation. In order to do so it was necessary to open a criminal case, given that there was sufficient information disclosing elements of a crime under Article 286 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(a) of the Criminal Code (official misconduct with the use of violence). The prosecutor ordered that a criminal case be opened.",

It considered his statement of surrender and confession, the fact that he had two minor children and that he had voluntarily surrendered the stolen gold jewellery, as well as his health condition, as mitigating circumstances. B. and Zh. were convicted of robbery with the use of violence and sentenced to nine years\u2019 and eight and a half years\u2019 imprisonment respectively.

It held, in particular, that the statement had been obtained in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure. Under Article 142\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of that Code, a statement of surrender and confession was a voluntary statement by a person about a crime committed by him. It had not therefore been necessary to have an instruction from an investigator in order to obtain it. The law did not provide for any additional requirements to such a statement, save that the individual concerned was to be warned of his or her criminal responsibility for deliberately giving false information. Therefore, the absence of a lawyer had not rendered the statement unlawful and had not violated the applicant\u2019s right to defend himself. He had been informed of his right under Article 51 of the Constitution, as confirmed by his signature on the record of his surrender and confession.",

Ensuring the exercise of this constitutional right necessitates consideration of both the status in proceedings and the actual situation of the person facing public criminal prosecution. Moreover, the very fact of criminal prosecution and, accordingly, accusatory activity undertaken against a particular person may be proven by a decision to institute criminal proceedings against the person, investigative actions in his or her regard (search, identification, interrogation, etc.), and other measures aiming at his exposure or indicating the existence of suspicions against him or her (inter alia, by informing the individual, under Article 51 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, of the right not to incriminate himself or herself). In so far as these actions are intended to establish facts and circumstances proving the guilt of the prosecuted person, he or she should be given an immediate opportunity to seek assistance of (defence) counsel. This creates the conditions enabling him or her to properly understand his or her rights and responsibilities, any charges brought against him or her, and, consequently, to defend himself or herself effectively.

The constitutional right to legal assistance arose from the moment when the relevant person\u2019s rights were actually restricted, for example when measures which effectively restricted his or her rights to liberty and security, including his or her freedom of movement, were undertaken by competent authorities (decisions on inadmissibility no.\u00a01280O of 17 July 2012, no.\u00a0638-O of 20\u00a0March 2014, no.\u00a01338-O of 24\u00a0June 2014, no.\u00a02380O of 23\u00a0October 2014 and no.\u00a02787O of 23\u00a0December 2014 with a reference to earlier decision no.\u00a01522-O-O of 17\u00a0November 2009).

For this reason Article\u00a0142 of the CCrP did not provide for the presence of a lawyer. However, it did not exclude the right of a person to make such statement in the presence of a lawyer, either (see decisions on inadmissibility no. 326-O of 14 October 2004, no. 1280-O of 17\u00a0July 2012, no. 638-O of 20 March 2014, no. 1338O of 24 June 2014, no.\u00a02380-O of 23 October 2014 and no. 2787-O of 23\u00a0December 2014).

Furthermore, the finding of selfharm does not accord with the forensic medical expert\u2019s conclusion as to the origin of the injuries, which excluded the possibility that the injuries could have been caused as a result of a fall, that is by a single impact from a flat surface, as was also noted by the supervising authority (see paragraph\u00a022 above), and suggested that they could have been caused by blows from blunt hard objects with a limited contact surface.

According to the prosecutor, the preinvestigation inquiry had not reliably established the circumstances in which the applicant had sustained his injuries.

Confronted with numerous cases of this kind against Russia, the Court has held that it was bound to draw stronger inferences from the mere fact of the investigative authority\u2019s refusal to open a criminal investigation into credible allegations of serious illtreatment in police custody. This was indicative of the State\u2019s failure to comply with its obligation under Article 3 to carry out an effective investigation (see Lyapin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 46956/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0129 and 13236, 24\u00a0July 2014).",

The applicant was taken to the police station and interviewed by police officers about the circumstances of the crime. He was subjected to illtreatment (see paragraph 66 above) and confessed to having participated in the crime. His confession was documented by police officer G. in the statement recording his surrender and confession. That record states that the applicant had been informed of Article 51 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation (see paragraph 10 above). Once given access to a lawyer on the following day during his first questioning as a suspect by the investigator, the applicant retracted his confession statement, asserting that it had been given as a result of his illtreatment by the police officers. He consistently repudiated his confession throughout the ensuing proceedings, in which he was represented by a lawyer. He was able to challenge the admissibility of the statement as evidence at his trial on two grounds, which he has now raised before this Court. Firstly, he asserted that the confession statement had been extracted from him as a result of his illtreatment by the police officers, and, secondly, that it had been obtained without him having access to a lawyer. The trial court regarded his confession as admissible evidence, considering that the allegations of his illtreatment were unsubstantiated, that access to a lawyer had not been required by domestic law and that the applicant had been informed of the right not to incriminate himself. In convicting the applicant the trial court relied to a significant extent on his confession (see paragraphs 38-39 above). In the appeal and the supervisory review proceedings the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic and the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation endorsed the trial court\u2019s findings in full.",

In relying on the police officers\u2019 statements denying any wrongdoing on their part and on the internal police inquiry dismissing the applicant\u2019s allegations, the court attached no significance to the police officers\u2019 obvious interest in the applicant\u2019s allegations of illtreatment being rejected. Overall, the trial court\u2019s reasoning for its dismissal of the applicant\u2019s objection displays a failure to conduct its own independent assessment of all the relevant factors with a view to ascertaining whether there were reasons to exclude from evidence the applicant\u2019s confession statement, allegedly \u201ctainted\u201d by a violation of Article\u00a03 of the Convention, so as to ensure the fairness of the trial, and instead indicates its reliance on the decision of the investigative authority (see paragraphs 3738 above), which the Court has found to have been based on an investigation which did not meet the Article\u00a03 requirements (see paragraph 74 above). This lack of a careful assessment of the quality of the impugned evidence (the applicant\u2019s confession statement) and the circumstances in which it was obtained, which cast doubts on its reliability and accuracy, was not remedied by the higher courts. In consequence, the applicant\u2019s confession obtained as a result of his inhuman and degrading treatment (see paragraph 65 above) was used by the domestic courts as evidence of the applicant\u2019s guilt. In so doing, the domestic courts legalised the police officers\u2019 efforts to use a \u201cstatement of surrender and confession\u201d to document the applicant\u2019s confession, obtained under duress, after his apprehension on suspicion of having committed a crime, contrary to the meaning envisaged for such a statement in Article 142 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (voluntary statement by a person about a crime he or she has committed, see paragraph 50 above).",

Early access to a lawyer at the investigation stage of the proceedings serves as a procedural guarantee of the privilege against selfincrimination and a fundamental safeguard against ill-treatment, given the particular vulnerability of the accused at that stage of the proceedings (see Salduz v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2008; Nechiporuk and Yonkalo v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 42310/04, \u00a7 263, 21 April 2011; and Martin v.\u00a0Estonia, no.\u00a035985/09, \u00a7 79, 30 May 2013). In order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently \u201cpractical and effective\u201d, Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction \u2013 whatever its justification \u2013 must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 55). A systematic restriction of the right of access to legal assistance, on the basis of statutory provisions, is sufficient in itself for a violation of Article 6 to be found (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 56; and Dayanan v.

This would also correspond to the domestic criminal procedural-law requirement that the right of access to a lawyer arises from the moment of actual arrest (see paragraph 46 above), which accords with the Constitutional Court\u2019s interpretation of the right to legal assistance as arising from the moment of actual restriction of one\u2019s constitutional rights, in particular the right to liberty and security, and not from the moment of the formal recognition of one\u2019s status as a suspect or one\u2019s detention (see paragraphs 48-49 and 54-55 above).",

This has irretrievably prejudiced the rights of the defence. Neither the assistance provided subsequently by a lawyer nor the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings and the possibility of challenging the admissibility of the evidence at issue at the trial and on appeal could remedy the defects which had occurred during police custody.",

In any event, no reliance can be placed on the mere fact that the applicant had been reminded of his right to remain silent and signed the relevant record (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 59; and P\u0142onka v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a020310/02, \u00a7 37, 31\u00a0March 2009), especially because the record cited Article 51 of the Constitution without explaining its meaning. Furthermore, since the lack of access to a lawyer in the present case resulted from the systemic application of legal provisions, as interpreted by the domestic courts, and the applicant was not informed of the right to legal assistance before signing the statement of his surrender and confession, the question of the waiver of the right to legal assistance is not pertinent.",
