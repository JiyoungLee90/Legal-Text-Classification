There remained therefore a possibility that the applicants would be acquitted and eligible for compensation at the domestic level. The examination of their complaints in the Strasbourg proceedings could result in the Court\u2019s acting in parallel with the national judicial authorities, interfering with the pending proceedings and substituting itself for the domestic jurisdiction, thereby impairing the principle of subsidiarity. Should the applicants be acquitted, this could result in double compensation being awarded to them, first by the Court and later by the national court. The Government claimed that such situation had already occurred in the cases of Rychkov v. Russia (dec., no. 2210/04, 4\u00a0December 2008) and Matskus v. Russia (no. 18123/04, 21 February 2008). Mr Rychkov and Mr Matskus were defendants in the same case who lodged separate applications with the Court, alleging violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 and Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. By judgment of 21 February 2008, the Court found the alleged violations of the Convention and made an award to Mr\u00a0Matskus. On 31 March 2008 both Mr Rychkov and Mr Matskus were cleared of all charges and could claim compensation for unlawful prosecution. On 4 December 2008 the Court struck Mr Rychkov\u2019s application out of its list of cases, noting that he had been acquitted and lost interest in the proceedings before the Court. In the Government\u2019s view, Mr\u00a0Matskus obtained a double compensation for the same violation. In sum, the Government considered that the complaint was premature.",

Even though the person who is acquitted is eligible to claim compensation for \u201cunlawful prosecution\u201d in the framework of the \u201crehabilitation\u201d proceedings, the Russian courts in these proceedings need not examine, and still less acknowledge, that the pre-trial detention was formally defective or that it was based on insufficient reasons or exceeded a reasonable time. The only ground for awarding compensation in these proceedings is the discontinuation of the prosecution rather than any alleged procedural irregularity in the pre-trial detention. This ground for compensation does not correspond to the basis of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 and the alleged violation cannot therefore be redressed in these proceedings (see Shalya v. Russia, no.\u00a027335/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a019 et seq., 13\u00a0November 2014, with further references). Therefore, an acquittal as such is incapable of depriving the applicant of his status as a \u201cvictim\u201d of the alleged violation and the Court will have to continue the examination of the case (see Shalya, cited above, \u00a7 22).",

On the other hand, as the case-law of the Russian courts demonstrates (see paragraphs 19-22 above), if the applicant receives compensation pursuant to the Court\u2019s judgment in which a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 was found, nothing prevents Russian courts in subsequent proceedings from taking this award into account when determining the final amount of compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage incurred on account of an excessively long detention.",

As it clearly follows from the text of the Court\u2019s decision to strike the case out of the list, it was based on the applicant\u2019s wish to withdraw his case. His acquittal and eligibility for compensation were only mentioned as an argument supporting the Court\u2019s finding that respect for human rights did not require it to continue the examination of the application. By contrast, Mr Matskus did not withdraw his case (cited above). In so far as he complained about an excessive length of criminal proceedings and an excessive length of his detention pending those proceedings, the Court could, and did, examine both of those complaints before the final termination of the proceedings in question (see, e.g.,\u00a0Rokhlina v. Russia (dec.), no. 54071/00, \u00a7 5, 9 September 2004); were it otherwise, a Government would be able to evade jurisdiction of the Court by protracting domestic proceedings even longer. As noted above, the award Mr Matskus received from the Court under Article 41 of the Convention was distinct from any amount he might eventually have recovered in the framework of the \u201crehabilitation\u201d proceedings. It follows that there was no \u201cdouble compensation for the same violation\u201d in that case.",

Russia, no.\u00a057541/09, 24\u00a0January 2012; Romanova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 23215/02, 11\u00a0October 2011; Sutyagin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a030024/02, 3\u00a0May 2011; Logvinenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a044511/04, 17 June 2010; Gultyayeva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 67413/01, 1\u00a0April 2010; Makarenko v.

Similar considerations apply in the circumstances of the present case in which the Government did not submit any arguments that could have allowed the Court to reach a different conclusion. As regards in particular the case of Mr\u00a0Lysenko, the Court accepts that the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of his alleged criminal activities constituted a relevant ground for extending his detention for the time necessary to complete the investigation and hear evidence from the accused and witnesses in court (see, for similar reasoning, Celejewski v. Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, 4 May 2006, and \u0141aszkiewicz v. Poland, no. 28481/03, \n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a059-60, 15 January 2008). Nevertheless, to the extent that the Saratov Regional Court routinely extended the authorised period of detention in respect of Mr\u00a0Lysenko and his co-defendants in a collective fashion, the Court reiterates that the practice of issuing collective detention orders without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention in respect of each detainee is incompatible, in itself, with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention \n(see, among many others, Kolunov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 26436/05, \u00a7 53, 9\u00a0October 2012, and Shcheglyuk v.
