In fact, in order to establish whether the subjective conditions for suspending a sentence are satisfied, the trial judge must determine whether there are prospects for the defendant\u2019s lasting improvement, having regard to his past history and his character (Arr\u00eats du Tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, [ATF, official reports of the judgments of the Swiss Federal Court] 101 IV 258, ground 1; Federal Court: Meyer, 29.11.1983, ad Cass. : 7.10.1983). In this instance the trial court noted the appellant\u2019s past history and found that he took and trafficked in drugs. As regards his character, it described his curriculum vitae, his family situation, his reputation and his financial position. The trial court therefore gathered together all the necessary information to make a prognosis.

Not even his precarious financial position excuses engaging in such traffic. The information obtained regarding the appellant is not wholly positive. The first-instance court was therefore correct in taking the view that his past history and his character and the circumstances of the case were not such as to warrant a favourable prognosis and therefore in refusing to suspend the sentence. The refusal to suspend the sentence is therefore justified and the application to have the decision varied must therefore also fail.\"",

Clearly the risk of the activation of the previous suspended sentence (which was here for a term of ten months\u2019 imprisonment) has to be taken into account (see the Coindet judgment, cited above, ground 2 b). But the appellant does not maintain that, in view of this possibility, he in fact risked a custodial sentence of more than eighteen months. On the contrary, he relied on the total of sixteen months\u2019 imprisonment imposed on him in order to argue that free legal assistance might have made it possible for him to obtain a more lenient sentence. It must therefore be recognised that the overall sentence which he actually risked did not exceed eighteen months and therefore did not entail the obligation to grant him free legal assistance.",

In addition, his case did not give rise to any difficulty as to the facts, since the investigation concerning him consisted merely of a single interview by the investigating judge. Moreover, he immediately admitted the facts in respect of which he was accused, and which are not in any case contested in the appeal (ATF 111 Ia 85/86, 101 Ia 92).",

They argued that the right to free legal assistance was not absolute, but depended on the assessment of all the circumstances of the case and was subject to a number of conditions which were substantially the same in federal law and in the law of the various cantons. The Vaud legislation provided for the right to free legal assistance in criminal proceedings and made the grant of such assistance subject to certain conditions; Article 104, 2nd paragraph, of the Vaud Code of Criminal Procedure recognised such a right, inter alia, \"when the needs of the defence so require\" (see paragraph 18 above). The Government stressed that sub-paragraph (c) of Article 6 para. 3 (art. 6-3-c) of the Convention was drafted in similar terms. They considered nevertheless that the Court had had few opportunities to define the notion of \"interests of justice\" and that its case-law in this field lacked clarity.

The Criminal Court therefore had both to rule on the possibility of activating the suspended sentence and to decide on a new sentence. The participation of a lawyer at the trial would have created the best conditions for the accused\u2019s defence, in particular in view of the fact that a wide range of measures was available to the Court.",
