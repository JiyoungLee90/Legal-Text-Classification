The problems mainly stem from the interpretation of Article 5 of the law. This Article provides for a \u201cnotification\u201d procedure before convening an assembly. In 2006, the Venice Commission welcomed the confirmation by representatives of the Government that the requirement in the law was for notification and not for a prior permission to hold the assembly, noting that \u201cother provisions of the Law could, as they currently stand, encourage the competent authorities to issue a blanket prohibition as soon as the notification process proves incomplete.\u201d In 2007, the Venice Commission added that a system of notification is in itself admissible so long as it is only meant to help the authorities cope more easily with the practical problems involved with the holding of an assembly; it also stressed that it is indeed important that assemblies can be held with a presumption of legality so as to avoid any chilling effect on organisers and participants.",

For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see B\u0105czkowski and Others v. Poland, no.\u00a01543/06, \u00a7\u00a7 66-68, 3\u00a0May 2007). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to interference as well (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, \u00a7\u00a7 5962, ECHR 2003III). So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 30, ECHR 2006XIII, and Hyde Park and Others v.

Nevertheless, an unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior notification or authorisation, does not justify per se an infringement of freedom of assembly (see Oya Ataman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37-39). While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 25691/04, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2007III; F\u00e1ber v.

It has not been argued or demonstrated that it would have been difficult for the police to contain or redirect protestors, or control the situation otherwise, protect public safety and prevent any possible disorder or crime.

Nor did they specify who had given such an order and when, or indicate its exact wording. Furthermore, the fact that the protesters, including the applicants, began to run away and leave the place as soon as they noticed the police approaching showed their willingness to end the demonstration in order to avoid confronting the police. In such circumstances, reference by the authorities to Article 310.1 of the CAO as a ground for the applicants\u2019 arrest and conviction appears to be unsubstantiated. Despite being formally charged with failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, the applicants in fact were arrested and convicted for their participation in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration. The Court notes that at the material time, no penalty in the form of deprivation of liberty was provided for under the CAO for participating in an unauthorised public assembly or generally for violation of rules on holding public assemblies. Nevertheless, the first and third applicants each were sentenced to seven days\u2019 and the second applicant to eight days\u2019 \u201cadministrative\u201d detention on charges that they had failed to stop participating in the unauthorised demonstration.

Nothing in the materials before the Court suggests that before proposing for them State-funded legal assistance the judges gave the applicants an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of their own choice, as required under Article 376.2 of the CAO (see Dvorski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 77-80). Secondly, even if the applicants refused State-funded legal assistance, it must be ascertained that such refusal amounted to an unequivocal waiver of the right to a lawyer. However, having already established that the applicants were not afforded legal assistance at the pre-trial stage, the Court finds it unnecessary to rule on the issue whether their refusal of State-funded legal assistance at the trial constituted an unequivocal waiver of the right to a lawyer.",

Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see Bozano v. France, 18\u00a0December 1986, \u00a7 54, Series A no. 111, and Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a021906/04, \u00a7 116, ECHR 2008).",

While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute \u201carbitrariness\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis (see Mooren v.

While they were formally charged with failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, the applicants were in fact detained for their participation in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration (see paragraphs 76 and 81 above). Furthermore, there are sufficient elements to conclude that the domestic courts that imposed the administrative detention also acted arbitrarily in reviewing both the factual and the legal grounds for the applicants\u2019 detention (see paragraph\u00a0105 above). In such circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the applicants\u2019 deprivation of liberty as a whole was arbitrary and therefore contrary to the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
