In this respect the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, although the final decision as to observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court. It must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, \u00a7 59, ECHR 1999I). The right of access to a court is impaired when the rules cease to serve the aims of legal certainty and the proper administration of justice and form a sort of barrier preventing the litigant from having his or her case determined on the merits by the competent court (see Tsalkitzis v. Greece, no. 11801/04, \u00a7 44, 16 November 2006).",

The Court notes further that by its judgment of 28 February 2006 the Orhei District Court quashed the hospital\u2019s order whereby the applicant was transferred to the position of head of female patient services. As a result of this judgment the applicant lost his administrative position in the hospital and took up that of a less well paid ordinary doctor. In such circumstances, the Court finds it surprising that the Supreme Court of Justice considered that the applicant\u2019s rights had not been affected by the judgment of the first-instance court (see paragraph 12 above). By contrast, the Court is of the opinion that the applicant\u2019s civil rights were affected in a most direct manner by the judgment of 28 February 2008 and that, therefore, Article 6 is applicable in the present case.",
