N.A. had described the importation channel in detail to the second applicant, arguing that the latter was safe and very valuable as his influential contact person, K., could bypass all controls in the port.

Despite the constant influence the informant had exerted on N.A., N.A. had neither been threatened by the informant nor had the informant exploited a situation of distress in N.A. The fact that N.A. had taken an independent decision to commit the offence was illustrated by the fact that the actual offence developed from a random meeting between N.A. and an acquaintance of the second applicant in the Netherlands. When N.A. realised the opportunity to carry out the drug offence which derived from this meeting, he pursued his decision to commit the offence with considerable criminal energy.

It noted that the impugned measure, incitement, did not concern only the acquisition of evidence, but resulted in the offence as a whole. Recognising a bar to the criminal proceedings drew a direct consequence from the fact that an offence was incited and thus from the unlawful conduct of the investigation authorities. It led to discontinuing the proceedings in respect of that offence (see, in particular, Article 260 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, at paragraph 45 above).",

For instance they could be affected by a duty of the applicant and heir to pay debts or costs as a result of a domestic court\u2019s judgment rendered against him or her (such as, for instance, in Micallef, cited above at paragraph 74) or if the applicant\u2019s own right to claim compensation is directly affected (Gr\u0103dinar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a095-103). To the contrary, a potential compensation claim under Article\u00a041 of the Convention, which requires the finding of a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights in the first place, is insufficient to render the applicant a potential victim of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention; it only arises once there has been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.

The Regional Court confirmed that the police informant had partly described the events leading to the drug importation in a substantially different manner from the defendants in their confessions at the trial. This held true, in particular, as regards the influence the informant had exerted on N.A., which was decisive for the finding that there had been incitement.

The Court notes that both these courts handed down their decisions before the judgment in Furcht, cited above. That was not the case of the Federal Constitutional Court, whose judgment proceeded the latter judgment of the Court by several months. The Court notes that the Federal Constitutional Court engaged extensively with the Court\u2019s case-law, including Furcht, and that it sought to draw lessons for lower courts from the latter decision for the future. However, while recognising that the evidence against the second applicant which resulted from the incitement had not been totally excluded, the Federal Constitutional Court, in the case of N.A. and the second applicant , sought to distinguish the latter case.

The Court notes, however, that in its case-law (see, in particular, paragraph 117 above), criminal proceedings following undercover operations were only found to raise an issue under Article 6 in so far as there was a direct or indirect incitement of the person subsequently charged in such proceedings. It cannot be deduced from that case-law that where an undercover operation entails incitement of one of the perpetrators, the proceedings automatically raise an issue under Article 6 in respect of other perpetrators who have neither directly nor indirectly been induced specifically by the police\u2019s conduct to participate in the offence.",

However, the Court notes that the third applicant had been convicted for having agreed to pick up the drugs at a flat in Bremerhaven \u2013 after they had been imported via the port, taken out of the port with the help of the dock worker and taken to the flat \u2013 and transport the drugs to Berlin. Unlike the importation via the port, the police did not influence or was in any other way involved in these subsequent transport activities. Although it may have played a certain role for the third applicant that the previous drug importation was seemingly safe as it generally reduced the risk of discovery when picking up the drugs in Bremerhaven in the flat, the third applicant only seized the opportunity without the police exerting such an influence on him as to incite the transport of the drugs from the flat in Bremerhaven to Berlin. While the third applicant was found guilty of illicit possession of the drugs entrusted to him by N.A. and of having aided and abetted N.A.\u2019s drug trafficking, his participation and activities cannot, therefore, be considered as having been determined by the conduct of the police who did not exert pressure on him either.",

It observes in this context that the work of the police informant, M., was supervised by the police following authorisation by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and covered by the general provisions of Articles\u00a0161\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 and 163 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, read in conjunction with the applicable Guidelines on criminal and summary proceedings (see paragraphs 42-43 above). The work of the undercover agent, K., was authorised by the Berlin District Court in accordance with domestic law under Article 110b \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see\u00a0paragraphs 15 and 41 above). This authorisation and \u2013 albeit perfectible \u2013 supervision of the undercover operation permitted the authorities to discharge the burden of proof of showing that there had been no incitement in the third applicant\u2019s case.
