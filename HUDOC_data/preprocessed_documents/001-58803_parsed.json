Referring to the judgment by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Informationsverein Lentia and Others v. Austria (of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 276), the applicant argued that the Ministry's decision was in breach of its right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention. In particular, it submitted that the Constitutional Broadcasting Law, if interpreted in a way compatible with Article 10, allowed everyone to broadcast freely unless restrictions were laid down by law. As no law regulating private television broadcasting had been enacted, the refusal of an authorisation to set up and operate a television transmitter lacked a legal basis. Alternatively, if one followed the approach of  the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 16 December 1983, namely that any broadcasting had to be explicitly authorised by federal legislation, the current legal situation was unconstitutional as the legislator had failed to enact legislation except for the ORF and private regional radio broadcasting.

So far federal legislation had been enacted for radio and television broadcasting by the ORF and for terrestrial broadcasting of regional radio programs. The Broadcasting Ordinance (Rundfunkverordnung) contained the legal basis for passive and, following the Constitutional Court's judgment of 27\u00a0September 1995, also active cable broadcasting of radio and television programs as of 1\u00a0August 1996. However, no legislation had been enacted for terrestrial broadcasting of television programs, apart from the legislation referring to the ORF.

The Government confirmed these figures. Further, the Government, referring to information obtained from the Organisation of Telecommunications and Broadcasting Enterprises, submitted that there was an estimated number of 798,000 households in Vienna having access to the cable net as cable installations are available in the building where they are located. The applicant, relying on information obtained from the leading Vienna cable net company, provided somewhat similar figures. Out of an estimated 850,000 households receiving television, about 435,000 were already connected while 415,000 which were not yet connected, had access to the cable net as cable installations were available in the building in which they are located or at least in the neighbouring building.

I concur that in the present case the negative impact on freedom of expression of ORF\u2019s monopoly on terrestrial television was almost counteracted by the existence, in that period, of a viable alternative in the form of cable television.  The file contains little evidence that the establishment and operation of a cable network lays a disproportionate onus on the broadcaster, or that a link-up with, and subscription to, cable broadcasting constituted a significant financial burden to the subscriber.",

Of the constitutive elements of free circulation of ideas and information I hold the following to be among those paramount: (a)  that, generally, no one shall be put to a disadvantage (financial or otherwise) to others imparting or receiving similar ideas or information; and (b) that the pernicious effects of a media monopoly can only be properly neutralised  by the existence of easily accessible alternatives which weight the viewer with no heavier millstone than that imposed by the monopoly.",
