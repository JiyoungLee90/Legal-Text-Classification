The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Dula\u015f, cited above, \u00a7 65).",

It does not appear that any attempt was made to carry out a proper on-site inspection at the scene of the incident, to establish the true version of the facts through the questioning of other villagers who might have witnessed the events, or to interview the members of the security forces who were allegedly involved in the incident.

The nature and extent of the military operation which resulted in the situation complained of by the applicant and amounted to breaches of Articles\u00a03, 8 and 13 of the Convention and Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 were intrinsically connected with the policy of the respondent Government in respect of the activities of the PKK, a Kurdish organisation. The Government submitted copies of military reports showing that an armed attack was carried out on Konakl\u0131 gendarme station at 1 a.m. on 2 April 1992 by members of the PKK. The Court found it established that, subsequent to the armed attack at the Konakl\u0131 gendarme station, gendarmes went to the applicant's hamlet on or about 21\u00a0April 1992, and burned down the applicant's family home and its contents and subsequently the fruit orchards and oak trees.",

However the Government's allegation that this revelation made it difficult for the family to stay in the hamlet probably through fear of reprisals from the PKK for having surrendered the weapons was not accepted by the Court and in any case could not by any imagination explain why the applicant's property was destroyed by the security forces, as the Court found had been established.",

In this respect I must stress that I consider it highly relevant that this is not the first case against Turkey in which the Court has found similar violations against persons of Kurdish origin as a result of military operations by members of the security forces using the same modus operandi with objectives, reasons, methods and results that are strikingly similar to those in the present case ",

I believe that it is important to bear in mind that the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d has its origin in the context of common law criminal procedure. There the objective is to punish an individual for a criminal offence, by using an adversarial procedure in which the liberty of the accused must be protected by applying rigid standards of proof. Taking into account their object and procedure as well as the position of the parties, i.e. the \u201caccused\u201d being always the State, proceedings to determine human rights violations differ substantially from criminal proceedings. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has pointed out that: ",

In the common law that formula of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d is also intertwined with the principle that the burden of proof is upon the prosecution and that the accused does not have to prove anything in support of his innocence: he may even remain silent and such silence cannot be interpreted as an acknowledgment of the allegations against him. In contrast, in proceeding to determine human rights violations, especially under the Convention, facts can be established on the basis of the evidence presented by both parties or obtained as a result of a proprio motu request by the competent judicial organs. These organs do not have the power to compel witnesses to appear before them, nor to compel the state against which the relevant allegations are directed to produce any evidence. Their task is to investigate the allegations and to establish the facts, admitting any evidence they consider helpful in order to ascertain the truth, free from any rules of evidence or procedure.",

There could be no more effective a tool for ensuring that the protection against discrimination on grounds of racial or national origin will become illusory and inoperative than to expect victims to submit themselves to such a high standard of proof. In reality, the application of such a high standard is tantamount to rendering it impossible for applicants to prove that there was a violation of Article 14.
