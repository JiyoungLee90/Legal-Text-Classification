It appears from the judgment that in the course of its proceedings the appellate court heard K.M., and three of the six persons (A.,\u00a0C. and D.) who had signed the report of 12 February 2013. The judgment does not provide any reason for the appellate court\u2019s failure to hear the other three persons who signed the report. It appears from the judgment that K.M. stated before the appellate court that he and the applicant had entered the judge\u2019s office with the judge\u2019s permission, and that the applicant had not insulted or threatened the judge. He further noted that when the applicant had wanted to leave the judge\u2019s office the judge had not allowed him to do so and had summoned the court employees, asking them to draw up a report. For his part, A. stated that when he went into the judge\u2019s office the applicant and the judge were arguing. However, the police officer did not state that the applicant had insulted or threatened the judge. In their statements, C. and D. stated that they had heard the expression of \u201cI\u00a0[shall] get you fired\u201d. The appellate court held that when assessing K.M.\u2019s statement it had to take into consideration the fact that he worked with the applicant. The appellate court also held that the very fact that the applicant entered the judge\u2019s office and discussed a case with him was contrary to the requirements of the law, and thus the applicant\u2019s argument that he could not enter the judge\u2019s office without that latter\u2019s permission, which could be proved by security cameras, was irrelevant.",
