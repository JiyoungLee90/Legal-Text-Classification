However, the only remedies to be exhausted are those which are effective. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time (see, inter alia, Vernillo v.

Where the judicial system is deficient with regard to the reasonable-time requirement of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation, since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori. Some States have fully understood the situation by choosing to combine these two types of remedy (see Scordino, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 183 and 186, Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a064886/01, \u00a7\u00a7 74 and 77 ECHR 2006, and S\u00fcrmeli v. Germany [GC], cited above, \u00a7100).",
