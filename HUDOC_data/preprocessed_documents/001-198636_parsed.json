This report, dated 26\u00a0January 2015, was elaborated on the basis of the existing file, interviews with the applicant and her mother and a psychological examination of the applicant. According to its conclusions, it was highly probable that the applicant had not invented the events she had described and that she had experienced sexual abuse. The authors of the report concluded that the applicant was already able to discern reality from fantasy and did not display any personality features likely to negatively influence her statements. They reported that she had referred to her past experience verbally, non-verbally and inadvertently through gestures, which had increased the specific credibility of her statements. The experts considered that the revelation by the applicant of the details of her sexual abuse was a\u00a0process, which included stages in which she was reluctant to make any statement, when she denied any abuse and then revealed certain details, withdrew her statements and reconfirmed them again. Her drawings had also shown that there was a likelihood of her having experienced the alleged sexual abuse. Furthermore, the applicant was experiencing internal anxiety and general fear; she was also very sexually receptive and her inner stability was distorted by past inadequate sexual stimulation.",

After having summarised the statements of the applicant and her parents and the contents of the expert reports, the investigator noted that according to the second expert report, it could not be excluded that the applicant distorted reality and confused real memories with fantasy, and thus her statements did not appear objective; no signs indicating sexual abuse experience could be found in her personality which was still subject to developments. Referring to the third and fourth expert reports, the investigator observed that no tendencies to lie, no pathological symptoms or signs of sexual deviation or aggression had been identified in respect of the applicant\u2019s father, while the fifth expert report pointed to the subjectivity of the assertions of the applicant\u2019s mother who had a slightly heightened tendency to lie and was characterised by suspiciousness, naivety and confusion over reality. There was thus no evidence proving that the act in question had occurred. Despite the sixth and seventh expert reports having concluded that the applicant had displayed symptoms of a sexually abused child, those conclusions were not sufficient to prove that the act had really been committed, particularly in view of the expert reports assessing the personality of the applicant.",

She also found that the applicant had no tendency to lie consciously or to distort reality and that she could not have invented certain stories without having experienced them in the past. In any event, the expert did not find any symptoms of sexual abuse, apart from some emotional trauma which could have been connected either to sexual abuse or to her parents\u2019 separation. However, four years had passed since the alleged sexual abuse and the applicant\u2019s memory had naturally faded, or might have been intentionally erased as a response to a possible traumatic event. The applicant had a rather ambivalent attitude towards her father.

While it is true that the possibility of making requests to the public prosecutor was abolished on 1 January 2016, the applicant (her legal guardian), or anyone else (such as her mother) could still have used it and challenged the decision, rendered prior to that legislative amendment, to discontinue the criminal prosecution.

Also, in the Government\u2019s view, the applicant had formulated her constitutional complaint in a way that had prevented the Constitutional Court from effectively reviewing the course of the investigation, since she had not pointed out to any procedural requirements following from Articles 3 and 8 but only complained about the assessment of evidence by the investigator and the conclusions of the investigation.",

The investigator limited himself rather to extensively summarising the relevant procedural steps taken in the course of the investigation, without having comprehensively explained why he had decided not to rely on the opinion of experts from a research institute which had addressed all the relevant issues including the possible origin of the differences with and between other expert opinions previously submitted. Thus, instead of trying to eliminate gaps and contradicting opinions of the experts, the investigator discontinued the criminal proceedings on the basis of what now appears as a selective and somewhat inconsistent approach to the assessment of evidence. It is also to be noted that, although in the letter to his superior, the district prosecutor considered that the investigation had not led to an unequivocal result (see paragraph 31 above), the discontinuation decision relied on Section 215 of the Code of Criminal Procedure providing that there was no doubt that the impugned act had not been committed, which thus prevented the criminal proceedings from having continued, if appropriate, before the criminal courts.",
