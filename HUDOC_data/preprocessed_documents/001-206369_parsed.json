II. \u00daS 53/2016). It observed that a guarantee of non-refoulement was not unconditional, since the relevant exclusion provisions allowed for persons who did not deserve refugee protection to be excluded from such protection, and as such did not constitute an obstacle to the requested State undertaking certain actions in the course of extradition proceedings (including proceedings in respect of detention pending extradition) involving such persons. Consequently, Article 14 \u00a7 3 (a) of Directive 2011/95/EU obliged member States to revoke the refugee status of a person if they had established that he or she should have been excluded from being accorded the status of refugee under Article\u00a012. The imposition of detention pending extradition was thus a procedural tool allowing the interests at stake to be weighed proportionally. In the instant case there was no reason not to accept at that stage the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusions; the general courts were nevertheless called on, in the subsequent proceedings, to examine and take into account all the relevant circumstances (including the Court\u2019s case-law in respect of Article\u00a03 of the Convention) before deciding whether to \u201crevoke\u201d the applicant\u2019s refugee status and whether to extradite him to Russia.",

It gave as the main reason for that decision the fact that, having been granted asylum in Sweden, the applicant enjoyed refugee protection on the territory of all EU States, despite the fact that Swedish authorities had not been aware of the criminal charge facing him in Russia. It also concluded that neither the exclusion clause contained in the 1951 Geneva Convention nor the one contained in Directive 2011/95/EU were applicable in the instant case. It furthermore observed, after reviewing all the relevant circumstances (including the general human rights situation in Russia and the reliability of the assurances offered by Russia), that the applicant\u2019s extradition would also not be admissible (i) on humanitarian grounds, (ii) owing to a lack of reliable evidence to support the slightest plausibility of the suspicion against him, and (iii) in the light of numerous inaccuracies and contradictions contained in the extradition documents. Lastly, the Supreme Court noted that the action serving as the initial impetus for the applicant\u2019s criminal prosecution had to be regarded as \u201cpolitical\u201d and that his political views (together with his brother\u2019s political activities) could give rise to bias on the part of the requesting State\u2019s authorities, within the meaning of Article\u00a03 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 2 of the European Convention on Extradition.",

He also pointed out that in view of the fact that Directives 2011/95/EU and 2013/32/EU had unified EU asylum policy, it was immaterial whether asylum had been granted to him in Slovakia or in another member State of the EU. Consequently, the Slovak authorities had been bound by the decision of Sweden to grant him asylum, and nothing had prevented them from conferring refugee protection on him, contrary to what the Supreme Court had stated in its decision of 16 March 2015.

It can be seen from their decisions that the matter of the applicant\u2019s status in Sweden had been subject to a preliminary investigation by the prosecutor (starting on 16 January 2015) into the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s refugee status. That investigation had been all the more important in the light of the exclusion provisions specified by the relevant international law, since its findings had been likely to impact on the outcome of the extradition proceedings. After the prosecutor had, in the course of that investigation, secured the necessary extradition documents (as well as assurances concerning the applicant\u2019s treatment and proceedings in the event of his extradition), he had asked the Regional Court to allow the applicant\u2019s extradition to Russia.

Within that context, the Government expressed their conviction, based on the relevant international instruments, that refugee status granted in one EU State did not automatically exclude its holder from the possibility of being extradited.

Such a decision is extraterritorially binding in that an award of refugee status by Sweden, as one of the State Parties to the 1951 Geneva Convention, could be called into question by Slovakia only in exceptional circumstances giving rise to the appearance that the beneficiary of the decision in question manifestly falls within the terms of the exclusion provision of Article 1F of the 1951 Geneva Convention and therefore does not meet the requirements of the definition of a refugee contained therein (paragraph 40 above).

Instead, alerted to the applicant\u2019s special status and bound by their obligation to respect the principle of non-refoulement, the Slovak authorities decided, in the course of standard extradition proceedings, to conduct their own inquiry into the danger of the applicant being persecuted in Russia and to contact the Swedish authorities in order to obtain the full facts of his case. In this context, the Court reiterates that when an extradition request concerns a person facing criminal charges in the requesting State, the requested State is required to act with greater diligence than when an extradition is sought for the purposes of enforcing a sentence, in order to secure the protection of the rights of the person concerned (see Gallardo Sanchez v.
