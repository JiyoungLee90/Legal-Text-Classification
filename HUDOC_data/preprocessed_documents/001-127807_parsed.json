He further argued that prior to 17 July 2003 he had not had an opportunity to complain of his ill-treatment, as his complaints had been blocked by the administration of the ITT. He had not been able to collect medical evidence in support of his allegations, as the ill-treatment to which he had been subjected prior to his medical examination on 30 December 2002 had not left marks on his body or face, while he had not been medically examined at the ITT. According to the applicant, the injuries which had been discovered during his medical examination on 28 July 2003 (see paragraph 39 above) had resulted from the alleged ill-treatment.",

However, the Court considers that this complaint is in any event manifestly ill-founded, as the applicant did not demonstrate in a persuasive way that he was ill-treated by the police. In particular, the Court notes that there is no medical evidence in support of the applicant\u2019s allegations. No injuries which could have been inflicted on the applicant during his detention were discovered during the applicant\u2019s medical examinations in December 2002 and July 2003. The health problems noted during the applicant\u2019s examination on 28 July 2003 appear to be related to the injuries to his arms that he suffered long before the events in question. This was established by the prosecutors who dealt with the applicant\u2019s complaints and matched the applicant\u2019s submissions made during the trial (see paragraphs 34 and 39 above).

The applicant also argued that the Supreme Court had failed to address those issues, although they had been raised in his cassation appeal. According to the applicant, the Supreme Court had also failed to provide him with free legal aid, which, given his lack of funds, the seriousness of the matters at stake and the nature of the cassation appeal proceedings, had been necessary in his case.

In particular, the Court notes that the witnesses whom the applicant asked the trial court to summon had been questioned at the investigation stage. Their statements were examined in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer, who had been given sufficient opportunity to challenge them. Given the applicant\u2019s submissions during the trial, the statements were considered to be generally accurate. Although the applicant argued that the witnesses could have confirmed his argument that the blood-stained jacket should not have been accepted as evidence, he did not demonstrate that, had they done so, their statements would have had any decisive effect on the outcome of the trial. The Court notes that the jacket was only part of a substantial amount of evidence on which the applicant\u2019s conviction was based. The Court also notes that certain efforts were made by the trial court and the police in order to have those witnesses questioned at a hearing (see paragraphs 36-37 above). While there may be a question as to the sufficiency of the authorities\u2019 efforts, it appears that the witnesses were not immediately available when the police looked for them. Thus, in the circumstances, the Court discerns no arbitrariness in the trial court\u2019s decision to proceed with the case without hearing those witnesses in person, against which the applicant did not object (see paragraph 42 above). The fact that the Supreme Court did not specifically address the applicant\u2019s submissions in this regard does not demonstrate that the examination of the case on cassation was not thorough or comprehensive. It was the conclusion of that court that the applicant\u2019s trial had been conducted in accordance with applicable procedure. Having regard to the nature of the applicant\u2019s submissions in his cassation appeal, the Court is not persuaded that the Supreme Court was required to provide more details in that respect.",
