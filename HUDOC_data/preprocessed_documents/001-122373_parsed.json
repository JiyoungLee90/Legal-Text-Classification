This conclusion was further strengthened by the fact that under paragraph 2 of section 44 of the Act publishers did not bear any legal responsibility for the content of paid advertisements.",

Those difficulties had arisen essentially because prior to the cases brought before the courts by the applicant there had been no judicial practice concerning the interpretation to be given to section 36 of the Press Act. The applicant\u2019s cases were the first occasion for the domestic courts to examine what balance should be struck between, on the one hand, the economic freedom of newspaper publishers and, on the other, private parties\u2019 freedom of expression in the context of information of a commercial nature. This absence of relevant judgments had resulted in doubts as to whether publishers were obliged to accede to each and every request to publish a paid advertisement in a newspaper or had a right to refuse to do so. The Supreme Court had developed its jurisprudence in this matter solely on the basis of the cases brought by the applicant.

The instant case differs from the above mentioned in that the general rules examined so far by the Court in its case-law affected directly not only the potential advertisers but also the broadcasters.

In the Court\u2019s view these principles apply also to the publication of advertisements. An effective exercise of the freedom of the press presupposes the right of the newspapers to establish and apply their own policies in respect of the content of advertisements.

The Court is therefore satisfied that under the provisions of the Polish civil procedure there was a mechanism available to the courts for the purposes of clarifying major interpretation difficulties and harmonising the judicial approach to those difficulties by way of a decision of the highest judicial authority, and that that mechanism was resorted to in the present case. Hence, the criteria relied on by the Court when dealing with inconsistencies in judicial practice were thereby complied with (see Iordan\u00a0Iordanov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 23530/02, \u00a7 49-50). It is true that ultimately the Supreme Court refused to answer that question.

That court accepted the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal for an examination on the merits, a decision given only in respect of cases raising important legal issues. It is also significant that the Supreme Court in the present case relied on its own analysis of the issues involved in the interpretation of Article\u00a036 made in the applicant\u2019s previous cases (III\u00a067/05, I CSK 351/06, I CSK 376/06, referred to above).
