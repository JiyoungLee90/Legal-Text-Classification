Only after that date were they to be considered stateless persons (see paragraph 24 above). The applicant claimed that she belonged to that category and the Government did not produce any evidence to the contrary. It follows that at the material time, in early December 2000, the requirement to have a residence permit, established in the 1981 USSR Law governing the status of foreign citizens and stateless persons, did not apply to her because she was neither a foreign citizen nor a stateless person (see paragraph 25 above). In any event, both the 1993 Law on the liberty of movement and freedom to choose residence and the Government Resolution of 12 March 1997 established that the procedure for registration of residence of \u201cformer  citizens\u201d should be the same as that for Russian citizens (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above).",

The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision (see Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 303-A). Even though a domestic court has a certain margin of appreciation when choosing arguments in a particular case and admitting evidence in support of the parties\u2019 submissions, an authority is obliged to justify its activities by giving reasons for its decisions (see Suominen v. , no. 37801/97, \u00a7 36, 1 July 2003). A further function of a reasoned decision is to demonstrate to the parties that they have been heard. Moreover, a reasoned decision affords a party the possibility to appeal against it, as well as the possibility of having the decision reviewed by an appellate body. It is only by giving a reasoned decision that there can be public scrutiny of the administration of justice (see, mutatis mutandis, Hirvisaari v.

In fact, the visa requirement for Georgian citizens had not been introduced by a treaty as the District Court maintained, but had resulted from the denunciation by Russia of the Bishkek Agreement in the absence of a separate treaty on visa-free movement between Russia and  (see paragraph 28 above). The Court is not convinced that this discrepancy could have been the result of a mere difference in terms because the text of the \u201ctreaty on visa-based exchanges\u201d was never produced in the domestic proceedings. The domestic courts appear to have taken the reference to it from the passport department\u2019s submissions. Furthermore, the Court finds it anomalous that the District Court relied on a treaty governing the conditions of entry and stay for Georgian citizens without giving any reasons for the assumption that the applicant was a Georgian citizen.

While such a technique of reasoning by an appellate court is, in principle, acceptable, in the circumstances of the present case it failed to satisfy the requirements of a fair trial. As the applicant\u2019s statement of appeal indicated that the District Court\u2019s findings had been devoid of a factual and/or legal basis, it was all the more important that the City Court give proper reasons of its own (see Hirvisaari, cited above, \u00a7 32). Nevertheless, the City Court endorsed the District Court\u2019s findings in a summary fashion, without reviewing the arguments in the applicant\u2019s statement of appeal.",
