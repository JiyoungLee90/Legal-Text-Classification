At about 9.45 p.m. several soldiers broke into the house and immediately started to hit and kick the first applicant. He could not see them well because the house, like the rest of the town, was without electricity. When he fell to the ground, they dragged him into the kitchen where V.M., the first applicant\u2019s wife and the second applicant\u2019s mother, and G.M., the first applicant\u2019s daughter and the second applicant\u2019s sister, and B., one of their neighbours, were sheltering. In the candlelight, the first applicant saw five men in military uniforms of the Croatian Army with balaclavas on their heads. They continued to hit and kick the first applicant and one of the men cut through the first applicant\u2019s palm with a knife. The other man cut one of B.\u2019s fingers off with the knife. One of the soldiers shot G.M. in the head, the other then cut B.\u2019s throat with a knife and subsequently shot at her with a firearm. The soldiers then ordered V.M. to make coffee for them. One of the soldiers introduced himself as Grgi\u0107 from a nearby village, Bro\u010dice. He asked the first applicant if he knew him and then hit him on the head with the shotgun. One soldier then cut a muscle in the first applicant\u2019s right hand. Next, the soldiers shot V.M. dead. After that, a soldier shot the first applicant through his right cheek. The soldiers then left the kitchen. The first applicant escaped through the window and ran away, reaching a nearby medical centre. From there he was transferred to a hospital in Kutina, then to Zagreb where he lay in a coma for three days. When he came round, one of the doctors told him that three men had been looking for him and wanted him killed. His sister sent an ambulance from Germany and he was transferred from Zagreb to Germany, where he was treated from 6 January to 15 May 1992.",
