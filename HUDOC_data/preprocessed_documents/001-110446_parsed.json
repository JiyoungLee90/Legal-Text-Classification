In particular, the case does not appear to have been particularly complex, although it involved several expert reports. Furthermore, although the applicant was responsible for several adjournments (see paragraph 6 above), the Court considers that the bulk of the delay occurred as a result of the manner in which the  handled the case. In particular, that court held no fewer than nineteen hearings, acceding to numerous belated evidentiary requests of the parties. Thus, it appointed several experts and adjourned the hearings on a number of occasions in order to enable those experts to answer last minute additional questions or in order to give the parties an opportunity to submit further evidence, which, in turn, caused additional delays due to absence of experts or their failure to submit their reports on time, or irregular summoning. As a result, the proceedings before that court lasted almost seven years (see paragraphs 5-7 above). It is true that the proceedings were stayed for more than a year pending the outcome of another set of proceedings. However, the Court notes that much of the delays could have been avoided if the Regional Court had, from the outset, tried to identify the controversial points and gather evidence in relation to them in a more efficient manner (see Finger, cited above, \u00a7 102, with further references). Therefore, although no extraordinary delays occurred in the subsequent proceedings before the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Cassation, the Court considers that the overall length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.",

Furthermore, it has already held that a complaint about delays is not an effective remedy in cases where the major source of delay is not the courts\u2019 failure to schedule hearings at reasonable intervals, but rather the fact that they did not organise the examination of the case properly, dealt with it over a considerable number of hearings, and failed to gather evidence in a more efficient manner (see Finger, cited above, \u00a7 88). The Court considers that in the instant case the reasons for unjustified delays disclose no material difference from those examined in Finger (see paragraph 24 above). Therefore the Court is not persuaded that a \u201ccomplaint about delays\u201d would have been an effective remedy. It is not disputed furthermore that Bulgarian law does not provide any other remedies, whether acceleratory or compensatory, in respect of the excessive length of civil proceedings (Finger, cited above, \u00a7 89). The Government\u2019s objection that the applicant failed to exhaust domestic remedies should therefore be dismissed. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicant did not have effective remedies under domestic law in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings.",
