On that account the applicant could legitimately fear that the  might allow itself to be unduly influenced by partial considerations.

In addition, the context in which the opinions were expressed can be distinguished, as regards their potential impact, from that of the Arrowsmith case, in which the applicant, a pacifist activist, had distributed a leaflet inciting servicemen to desert at a military camp occupied by troops who were shortly to be posted to Northern Ireland (see Arrowsmith v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a07050/75, Commission's report of 12 October 1978, Decisions and Reports (DR) 19, p. 5).
