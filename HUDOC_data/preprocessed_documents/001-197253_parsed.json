Therefore, for a person held in such conditions, a remedy capable of rapidly bringing the ongoing violation to an end is of the greatest value and, indeed, indispensable in view of the special importance attached to the right under Article 3. However, once the impugned situation has come to an end because this person has been released or placed in conditions that meet the requirements of Article 3, he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for any breach that has already taken place. In other words, in this domain preventive and compensatory remedies have to be complementary to be considered effective (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 96-98 and 214).",

Accordingly, the Court has held that where an applicant had already been released when he or she lodged his application with it, a remedy of a purely compensatory nature could in principle have been effective and could have provided him or her with fair redress for the alleged breach of Article 3 (see, for instance, Bizjak v. Slovenia (dec.), no. 25516/12, \u00a7 28, 8 July 2014; Chatzivasiliadis v. Greece (dec.), no. 51618/12, \u00a7 30, 26 November 2013; Singh and Others v.

Indeed, evidence shows that the remedy of a complaint before the sentenceexecution judge, followed by a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court, was able to provide adequate relief for complaints alleging inadequate conditions of detention (see, for instance, \u0160titi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia (dec.), no. 9660/03, 9\u00a0November 2006; Novak, cited above, \u00a7 34; and Bu\u010dkal, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27; and, by contrast, Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 110).

Indeed, the Court would reiterate, as it did in many other contexts, that before bringing complaints against Croatia to it, in order to comply with the principle of subsidiarity applicants are in principle required to afford the Croatian Constitutional Court, as the highest Court in Croatia, the opportunity to remedy their situation (see Pavlovi\u0107 and Others v.

Thus, irrespective of the Constitutional Court\u2019s approach to such cases in terms of its focus on the substantive or procedural aspects of complaints (see paragraphs 53-54 and 98 above), the fact remains that the Constitutional Court exercises a further review of the case in relation to the findings of the civil courts, taking as a basis for its assessment the Court\u2019s case-law in Mur\u0161i\u0107 (see paragraph 52 above).",

In addition, the sanitary facility in the cell was not fully separated from the living area where he had been accommodated so smell had been pervasive and, due to the absence of a dining area, he had been served food in such conditions. Moreover, there had not been sufficient space to move around the cell and he had been confined to the cell for twenty-two hours a day. During rainy days even that possibility had been restricted.

Throughout his stay in Glina State Prison the applicant had had more than 3 sq. m of personal space. The only period in which he had had less than 3 sq. m was in the last eight days of his confinement in that prison. However, he had spent that period in a special cell for prisoners preparing for release. That call was never closed so prisoners remained free to walk out of the cell at any time during the night and day. Moreover, it had been properly equipped and furbished. The Government also stressed that throughout the applicant\u2019s stay in Glina State Prison he had had sufficient freedom of movement and had been provided with adequate out-of-cell activities. As regards the period of the applicant\u2019s separation from other prisoners, the Government stressed that it had been the result of his own request due to his fear from the alleged violence by two other prisoners. Lastly, the Government pointed out that the applicant had been given adequate medical treatment. In particular, he had first seen the dentist four months after his arrival to Glina State Prison and had in total seen the dentist on nine occasions in a period of little more than a year.",

Furthermore, the sanitary facilities in the detention cells were not fully separated from the living area where the detainees were accommodated. It is not disputed between the parties that Zagreb Prison did not have dining facilities and that the food for all prisoners was served in cells.
