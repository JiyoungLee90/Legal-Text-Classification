The case originated in an application (no. 33082/96) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Krzysztof Wojnowicz (“the applicant”), on 12 October 1995.
The Government of Poland (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki.
The applicant alleged that, contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the civil proceedings to which he was a party were not conducted within a reasonable time.
On 2 July 1997 the Commission (Second Chamber) decided to give notice of the application to the respondent Government and invited them to submit their observations on the merits.
The Government submitted their observations on 22 September 1997, to which the applicant replied on 5 December 1997.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 § 2 thereof.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber called upon to examine the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted according to the provision of Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 18 November 1999 the Chamber declared the application admissible.
The applicant is a Polish national, born in 1948 and residing in Warsaw.
Jointly with M.K. and B.W., the applicant owned a company running a car repair shop.
On 21 September 1987 the applicant lodged an action with the Warsaw District Court against M.K. and B.W., requesting that the court dissolve the company and distribute its property to its shareholders. At an unspecified later date the court appointed an expert in order to have the value of the company estimated.
The first hearing, to be held on 20 February 1987, was adjourned as one of the parties - not the applicant - failed to appear. Subsequently, the judge rapporteur was changed. Likewise, the hearing set for 25 October 1988 was adjourned. On 24 January 1989 the applicant complained to the Ministry of Justice about the conduct of the proceedings. In a letter to the court of 26 January 1989, the applicant requested the court to accelerate the proceedings.
In a letter of 4 April 1989, the Ministry of Justice acknowledged that the proceedings had exceeded a reasonable time and that in view thereof the conduct of the proceedings would be henceforth supervised by the Ministry.
On 4 October 1989 the Warsaw District Court appointed an administrator for the company.
The hearing fixed for 26 November 1989 was adjourned, one of the parties - other than the applicant - not being present.
On 13 December 1989 the Warsaw Regional Court quashed the decision to appoint an administrator for the company. The case was subsequently assigned to a new judge rapporteur.
In a letter of 25 January 1990, the applicant complained to the president of the Parliamentary Commission on the Administration of Justice about the length of the proceedings. In his reply of 23 February 1990, the president of that Commission stated that the complaint was partly well-founded, particularly in that the court had failed sufficiently to supervise the expert appointed by it. In a communication of 2 April 1990, the applicant stated that supervision by the Ministry had not brought about any tangible results. He further pointed out that the expert could not be held responsible for the delay as he had several times requested the court to give him access to the case-file and, for reasons unknown, this request had not been granted.
In a letter of 28 May 1990, the Minister of Justice informed the president of the Parliamentary Commission on the Administration of Justice that according to a progress report on the case, submitted to the Ministry by the President of the Warsaw District Court on 20 April 1990, the expert had obtained the case-file on 2 April 1990 and would present his opinion to the court before 30 May 1990.
On 10 June 1990 the applicant complained to the Ombudsman about the length of the proceedings. The Ombudsman transmitted the complaint to the President of the Warsaw District Court who, on 21 August 1990, informed the applicant that he had issued appropriate orders to accelerate the proceedings.
On 19 September 1990 the hearing was adjourned, one of the parties other than the applicant being absent. A new judge rapporteur was subsequently appointed.
On 18 March 1991 the court heard the expert. On 6 May 1991 the proceedings were suspended, as the parties attempted to reach an out-of-court settlement.
The hearings scheduled for 2 August and 14 October 1991 were adjourned because one of the parties other than the applicant did not comply with the summonses. A new judge rapporteur took over.
On 18 November 1991 the applicant requested the court to set a date for a new hearing and to take measures in order to discipline the party who sabotaged the proceedings by his consistent refusal to participate.
Two further hearings, scheduled for 23 March and 25 May 1992, were adjourned as one of the parties - not the applicant - was absent and the judge rapporteur changed again.
On 28 September 1990 the applicant complained to the President of the Warsaw Regional Court about the excessive length of the proceedings.
At the hearing on 19 October 1992, the court, presided over by yet another judge rapporteur, heard a witness and an expert.
On 28 January 1993 the court heard another witness and an expert.
On 5 March 1993 the court appointed an expert in accountancy, who submitted her findings to the court on 31 July 1993, having been twice urged by the court to speed up the preparation of her report.
On 16 August 1993 the lawyer of one of the parties requested the court to be served with copies of certain documents submitted by the applicant in a single copy. The applicant submitted copies of the required documents on 20 October 1993.
At a hearing held on 25 November 1993, the court heard the expert accountant and, having regard to objections made by one of the parties, requested her to supplement her report. The expert did so on 6 January 1994.
On 1 March and 15 March 1994 the hearings were adjourned as on the first date one of the parties - not the applicant - and on the second date his representative were absent.
On 10 May 1994 the court, at the request of B.W., one of the parties to the proceedings, admitted in evidence the expert opinion of a construction specialist. This opinion was submitted to the court on 2 August 1994. On 25 October 1994 the court questioned this expert.
On 17 November 1994 the Warsaw District Court pronounced a judgment dissolving the company and assigning its property to the applicant. M.K., one of the parties, filed an appeal. On 28 November 1995 the case-file was transmitted to the Warsaw Regional Court.
On 18 September 1995 the Warsaw Regional Court considered the appeal, set the first-instance judgment aside, finding that serious errors as to the substantive law had been committed, divided the case into two separate cases. The first concerned the settlement of claims between the company’s shareholders and the liquidation of the company, and the second related to the division of the company’s property. It ordered both cases to be reconsidered by the Warsaw District Court.
The first case was subsequently assigned to another judge rapporteur. On 24 January 1996 a hearing before the District Court was adjourned due to the judge's ill health.
On 28 February 1996 another hearing was held, during which the court examined the applicant's request for legal aid. Subsequently the judge rapporteur was changed.
On 10 June 1996 a hearing was again cancelled as the judge was ill. On 26 August 1996 the case was re-assigned to another judge rapporteur.
On 26 September 1996 a hearing took place and a new expert was appointed in order to evaluate the property. He submitted his report to the court before 17 June 1997.
The hearing fixed for 17 June 1997 was adjourned as that expert failed to attend it. On 9 October 1997 the court rejected the applicant’s request to have a new expert appointed to the case. At a hearing on 29 October 1997, the expert was questioned and the court requested him to supplement his opinion. Subsequently, a hearing set for 4 March 1998 was adjourned as one of the parties - not the applicant - and his lawyer failed to comply with the summonses.
At the hearing on 13 May 1998 the court questioned the expert witness and requested the parties to submit their claims and evidence to the court.
At the hearing on 8 July 1998 witnesses called by one of the parties other than the applicant failed to attend. On 14 October 1998 the court heard evidence from witnesses called by the applicant. The hearing listed for 13 January 1999 was adjourned as both the applicant and the presiding judge were ill. On 3 March 1999 a hearing was likewise adjourned because the lawyer of another party was ill. A hearing set for 14 April 1999 was again adjourned as one of the other parties was ill. On 14 June 1999 the court heard evidence from the witnesses called by the applicant. The next hearing was listed for 20 October 1999 but was adjourned due to the judge’s ill-health. Subsequently, the judge rapporteur was changed. The next hearing was scheduled for 28 January 2000.
As regards the case concerning the division of the company’s assets, the first hearing in these proceedings was to be held on 16 January 1998. The hearing was adjourned since one of the parties - not the applicant - and his lawyer failed to attend. A hearing fixed for 22 April 1998 was adjourned for the same reason. At a hearing held on 26 June 1998, an expert was appointed to prepare an expert opinion. A hearing which was to take place on 17 June 1999 was adjourned because the expert failed to comply with the summons, and the date of the next hearing was set for 16 September 1999. This hearing was postponed as the court expert had not been properly summoned. The court heard evidence from this expert at the next hearing on 9 November 1999.
Both sets of proceedings are still pending before the court of first instance.
