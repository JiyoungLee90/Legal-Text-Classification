The draft new Schools Act would bring changes to the special education system (transforming \u201cspecial schools\u201d into \u201cspecial primary schools\u201d), providing the children targeted assistance in overcoming their sociocultural handicap. These included preparatory classes, individual study programmes for children in special schools, measures concerning preschool education, an expanded role for assistants from the Roma community and specialised teacher-training programmes. As one of the main problems encountered by Roma pupils was their poor command of the Czech language, the Ministry of Education considered that the best solution (and the only realistic one) would be to provide preparatory classes at the preschool stage for children from a disadvantaged sociocultural background.",

The applicants denied that the disproportionately large number of Roma children placed in special schools could be explained by the results of the intellectual capacity tests carried out in the educational psychology and child guidance centres. Such tests were adapted to the Czech language and cultural environment and so disadvantaged Roma children and caused errors that distorted the findings, since the majority of the children concerned were not suffering from any learning disability. Furthermore, there were no uniform rules governing the manner in which the tests were administered and the results interpreted so that much was left to the discretion of the psychologists and there was considerable scope for racial prejudice and cultural insensitivity.

The Court had occasion to note that the Roma/gypsy community is subjected, for instance, to violence and discrimination in Slovakia (see \u00e7onka v. , application no. 51564/99, admissibility decision of 13 March 2001). More recently, in the case of Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria, the Court found that there were grounds for suspecting that racist attitudes were at the origin of violence that had resulted in the deaths of the two victims, of Roma origin. For this reason, it found a violation of Article 14, taken together with Article 2 (in so far as it lays down procedural obligations), as the authorities had not taken all possible measures to establish whether discriminatory conduct may have played a role in the events (see the Grand Chamber judgment of 5 July 2005, to be published in the Reports of Decisions and Judgments).
