A civil court is unable to pursue any independent investigation and is incapable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings regarding the identity of the perpetrators of fatal assaults or disappearances, still less of establishing their responsibility (see Khashiyev and Akayeva v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a057942/00 and 57945/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0119-21, 24 February 2005, and Estamirov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a060272/00, \u00a7\u00a077, 12 October 2006).

The situations where deprivation of life may be justified are exhaustive and must be narrowly interpreted. The use of force which may result in the deprivation of life must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in Article 2 \u00a7 2 (a), (b) and (c).

Greece [GC], no.\u00a050385/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a057-59, ECHR 2004-XI, and Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos.\u00a043577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a096, ECHR\u00a02005-VII).

In the Court\u2019s view the very fact that the FSB servicemen went to the applicants\u2019 house in order to search for insurgents and concealed lethal weapons (see paragraph 29 above) suggests that they were on a security operation and thus were bound to have had a clear plan of actions allowing for various likely scenarios.",

Assuming that the servicemen intended to effect his lawful arrest, this legitimate aim could only justify putting human life at risk in circumstances of absolute necessity. The Court considers that in principle there can be no such necessity where it is known that the person to be arrested poses no threat to life or limb and is not suspected of having committed a violent offence, even if refraining from using lethal force may result in the opportunity to arrest the fugitive being lost (see Makaratzis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a064-66).",

However, in the present case the Court cannot see any reasonable explanation as to why the FSB servicemen took the handcuffs off a potentially dangerous person while searching for concealed weapons. It is clear that they were able to open the doors in the household themselves once they had taken the keys from Beslan Arapkhanov. Uncuffing the latter appears to be tangible proof that the servicemen in charge of the operation failed to foresee a number of highly probable occurrences, such as an attempt to flee or violent resistance, and thus did not comply with their duty to plan the security operation.",
