In their petitions for release, however, the applicant and her counsel had advanced specific arguments capable of casting doubt on the lawfulness of, and justification for, her detention. They submitted that she had had no criminal record and that there was no danger of absconding because she had a permanent place of residence in , studied at university, had positive work references and suffered from frail health. Although the existence of these facts was acknowledged in the domestic decisions and their accuracy had not been disputed by anyone, the domestic courts treated them as irrelevant, consistently holding that the gravity of the charges carried a greater weight than the concrete facts mitigating for the applicant\u2019s release (see paragraphs 17, 20 and 24 above). Thus, the District Court\u2019s decision of 11 April 2005 expressly indicated that the applicant had failed to show that there had been no possibility of her absconding (see paragraph 20 above).",

In particular, on 10 August 2005 the trial court refused the applicant\u2019s petition for release, although she had produced a personal surety given not just by a private individual, but by a member of the Russian Parliament. Moreover, at no point in the proceedings did the domestic courts explain in their decisions why alternatives to the deprivation of liberty would not have ensured that the trial would follow its proper course. This failure is made all the more inexplicable by the fact that the new Code of Criminal Procedure expressly requires the domestic courts to consider less restrictive \u201cpreventive measures\u201d as an alternative to custody (see paragraph 29 above).",
