In such cases the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether national law has been observed (see, among other authorities, Douiyeb v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 31464/96, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45, 4\u00a0August 1999).",

In this regard, the Court cannot accept the Government's argument that the applicant had been placed in a witness room in which there was a telephone line. This version of the events contradicts the fact that he was provided with a Stateappointed lawyer and the latter lawyer's submissions concerning the applicant's situation (see paragraph 33 above). Moreover, the Government did not submit any evidence in support of their argument. The Court also finds unrealistic the Government's submission that the applicant was free to leave the MNS building before the issuance of the record of the applicant's forty-eight-hour detention as a suspect. In particular, the Government did not provide a reasonable explanation as to why the applicant stayed in the MNS building without any reason from 2.30 p.m. to 5.10 p.m. (the period of time between the end of the questioning and the beginning of the confrontation, according to the Government's version of the events) if he was really free to leave the MNS building.",

The law stated that within forty-eight hours of his or her arrest a person so detained must be brought before a judge, who should either remand the person in custody or order their immediate release (see\u00a0paragraphs 27-29 above). Furthermore, Article 153.3.4 of the CCrP unequivocally required the arrested person's release, if no court order on his or her remand in custody was issued within forty-eight hours of arrest. Accordingly, beyond the initial forty-eight-hour period, an arrested person could be detained only on the basis of a judicial order remanding him or her in custody. It does not appear that this period could be extended under any circumstances, or that it was simply a non-mandatory indicative deadline and the Government did not demonstrate or argue the opposite (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Kaiser v. , no. 17073/04, \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 33, 15\u00a0March 2007).",
