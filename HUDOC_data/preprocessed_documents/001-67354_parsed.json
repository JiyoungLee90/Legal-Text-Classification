It agrees with the Government that the period during which the applicant companies\u2019 requests for remission of sentence were dealt with falls outside the period to be taken into account, since during that time there was no determination of a criminal charge. However, even though, following the rejection of their requests for remission of sentence, the applicant companies did not ultimately succeed in having their appeals reinstated, the Court observes that the Court of Appeal, in its judgments of 1\u00a0December 1997, did allow the appeals to proceed and \u201cdetermined\u201d the charges against the applicant companies by declaring prosecution of the offences to be time-barred. Although the Supreme Court overturned that decision, it would have had jurisdiction to allow the appeals to proceed and to rule on the criminal charges against the applicant companies. For these reasons, the Court considers that the period from 29 January 1997, when Mr\u00a0Wouterse lodged the appeals of the applicant companies afresh, until 22\u00a0September 1998 when the Supreme Court declared the appeals inadmissible (an additional one year, seven months and twenty-four days), should be taken into account in the assessment of the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings.",
