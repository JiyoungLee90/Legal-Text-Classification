Whilst this information must be conveyed \u201cpromptly\u201d, it need not be related in its entirety by the arresting officer at the very moment of the arrest.

At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right of judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 is primarily intended to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Where detention is authorised by a court, subsequent proceedings are not so much concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention. Therefore, the Court would be less concerned with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal, if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees (ibid.).",

In this case, the higher court quashed the trial judgment stating that \u201cthe judge who convicted the applicant had not examined the circumstances of the case and had not established whether she was guilty of any administrative offence\u201d. For its part, the Court considered, under Article 6 of the Convention, that the above corroborated the applicant\u2019s allegations that there had been no adversarial proceedings as such and that even the appearances of a trial had been neglected to the extent that she did not get a chance to find out the purpose of her brief appearance before the trial judge. Having regard to the above findings, the Court also held, under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, that while the ensuing period of detention had been carried out on the order of a judge who was in principle competent to take the decision in issue, the judge had exercised his authority in manifest opposition to the procedural guarantees provided for by the Convention.

The accused\u2019s right to a public hearing is not only an additional guarantee that an endeavour will be made to establish the truth but also helps to ensure that he is satisfied that his case is being determined by a tribunal whose independence and impartiality he may verify. The public character of proceedings before judicial bodies protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret without public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts, superior and inferior, can be maintained.

The Court also notes at this juncture that, whilst the adjective \u201cnecessary\u201d, within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 or 11 \u00a7 2 is not synonymous with \u201cindispensable\u201d, it remains for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of the reality of the pressing social need implied by the notion of \u201cnecessity\u201d in this context (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, \u00a7 48, Series A no.\u00a024). When the Court carries out its scrutiny, its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 or 11 the decisions that they delivered. This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine, after having established that it pursued a \u201clegitimate aim\u201d, whether it was proportionate to that aim and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, \u00a7 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I).",

As stated above in the context of Article 6 of the Convention, for its part, the appeal court found it pertinent to amend the description of the circumstances, stating that the applicant had held an unlawful demonstration and held a banner containing a very negative assessment of the professional activity of high-ranking public officials.

In any event, the Court reiterates that there may be circumstances in which the formal unlawfulness of a peaceful public assembly is not sufficient to justify its dispersal (see Bukta and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, and Oya Ataman v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 74552/01, \u00a7\u00a7 38-42, ECHR 2006XIII).

Turkey, no. 38676/08, \u00a7 29, 27 November 2012). Nevertheless, although a demonstration in a public place may cause some disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of its substance (ibid.).",
