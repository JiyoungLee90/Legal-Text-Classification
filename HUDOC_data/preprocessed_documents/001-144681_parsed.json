He further explained that before concluding the contract with company L. in 2002, the hospital had buried bodies of stillborn babies in a communal grave. Company L. had then suggested cremating the bodies rather than burying them, because the communal grave had been full. The applicant\u2019s child\u2019s remains had therefore been packed together with other clinical waste and taken to the Zagreb cemetery for cremation.

She had seen the applicant on another occasion, and he had told her that he did not want to assume responsibility for the funeral. When the applicant had again approached her to ask where the burial had taken place, she had told him that his child had been buried in the communal grave, although she had not been sure, but in any event she had considered cremation in the communal grave to be a form of burial. The witness also expressed her regret that the applicant might have been under the impression that the child would be buried in an individual grave. The applicant disputed M.K.\u2019s version of events, asserting that he had asked for all the documents and invoices concerning the burial to be forwarded to him.

Sweden, no. 61564/00, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2006I).
