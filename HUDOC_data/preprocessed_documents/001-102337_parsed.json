As follows from that certificate, in May 2001 a positive dynamic in the treatment of the illness was registered. However, on 5\u00a0August 2001 the applicant's state of health seriously deteriorated.

It was not before 25 November 2002, that is long after his transfer to another detention facility, that the metal blinds were removed in compliance with the recommendations of the Russian Ministry of Justice. It was impossible to take a shower as inmates were given only fifteen minutes and two to three men had to use one shower head at the same time. That situation was further aggravated by the fact that inmates could only take a shower once every two weeks. Inmates had to wash and dry their laundry indoors, creating excessive humidity in the cells. They were also allowed to smoke in the cells. The toilet was a filthy hole in the floor, separated from the living area by a small partition, and spread an unpleasant odour in the cell. At no time did inmates have complete privacy.

Primarily restating the European Prison Rules and CPT standards, the Recommendation went beyond reiteration of the principles in some aspects to include more specific discussion of the management of certain common problems including transmissible diseases. In particular, in respect of cases of tuberculosis, the Committee of Ministers stressed that all necessary measures should be applied to prevent the propagation of this infection, in accordance with relevant legislation in this area. Therapeutic intervention should be of a standard equal to that outside prison. The medical services of the local chest physician should be requested in order to obtain the long-term advice that is required for this condition, as is practised in the community, in accordance with relevant legislation (Section 41).",

This was due to a combination of factors, including: (i)\u00a0increased poverty, (ii) under-funding of TB services and health services in general, (iii) diagnostic and therapeutic approaches that were designed for a centralized command-and-control TB system, but were unable to cope with the social mobility and relative freedom of the post-Soviet era, and (iv) technical inadequacies and outdated equipment. Migration of populations from ex-Soviet republics with high TB burdens also increased the problem. Prevalence rates were many times higher in the prison system than in the general population. Treatment included lengthy hospitalizations, variations among clinicians and patients in the therapeutic regimen, and frequent recourse to surgery. A shrinking health budget resulted in an erratic supply of anti-TB drugs and laboratory supplies, reduced quality control in TB dispensaries and laboratories, and inadequate treatment. The social conditions favouring the spread of TB, combined with inadequate systems for diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance, as well as increased drug resistance, produced a serious public health problem.",

Russia (dec.), no. 31697/03, 29\u00a0January 2009). The Court also reiterates its finding made in the context of a complaint under Article\u00a013 of the Convention that in Russia there have been no domestic remedies whereby an applicant could effectively complain about the conditions of his or her detention (see Benediktov v. Russia, no. 106/02, \u00a7\u00a030, 10 May 2007). In addition, noting that the applicant in the present case lodged an action for damages against the administration of detention facility no. IZ-39/1 complaining about the conditions of his detention in that facility, the Court considers it necessary to stress that on numerous occasions it has previously found that an application to a court with a view of obtaining redress for allegedly inhuman and degrading conditions of detention cannot be regarded as an effective domestic remedy.

However, in the instant case, having established, among other things, that the applicant had been detained in overcrowded cells, the domestic courts dismissed his action and refused compensation on the sole ground that the domestic authorities, in particular, the facility administration, had not been liable for damage arising out of the conditions of his detention ... The courts' finding was apparently based on the underlying proposition that the authorities were only accountable for damage caused by culpable conduct or omission. In the particular case, they considered that the lack of financial resources excluded the liability of the domestic authorities for unsatisfactory conditions of the applicant's detention, which were amply proven. They did not consider that it was not open to the State authorities to cite lack of funds or limited capacity of the detention facility as an excuse for not honouring their obligation to ensure satisfactory conditions of detention.",

It allows a large number of cases, such as the applicant's, where the unsatisfactory conditions of detention result from lack of funds or limited capacity of detention facilities, to be dismissed. Thus, as a result of that stance of the courts, the remedy under the Russian Civil Code offers no prospect of success and could be considered theoretical and illusory rather than adequate and effective in the sense of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

It marks out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the Court and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a016064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, \u00a7 156, ECHR 2009...).

Finally, the rule should ensure that it is possible to ascertain the facts of the case before that possibility fades away, making a fair examination of the question at issue next to impossible (see Kelly v. the United Kingdom, no. 10626/83, Commission decision of 7\u00a0May 1985, Decisions and Reports (DR) 42, p.\u00a0205, and Baybora and Others v.

The applicant made use of that judicial avenue in July 2001 when he lodged his action with the Tsentralniy District Court seeking compensation for damage arising out of the conditions of his detention. While it is true that it was not until the domestic tort proceedings came to an end on 19 June 2002 and the applicant received a copy of the final judgment on 16 August 2002 that he complained to the Court for the first time, the Court, however, cannot overlook its finding that, were it not for the domestic courts' arbitrary and unlawful interpretation of Article 1069 of the Russian Civil Code (see paragraph 55 above), a tort action might have provided a remedy in respect of the applicant's allegations of appalling conditions of his detention. The Court discerns nothing in the parties' submissions to suggest that while the tort proceedings were still pending the applicant was aware or should have become aware of the futility of his action for damages arising from the conditions of his detention.

Given the size of the cells, the number of inmates detained in them at the same time and the parties' submission that the cells had been equipped with bunks, a table, wooden benches and a cubicle in which a lavatory pan was situated, the Court entertains doubt that there was sufficient floor space even to pace out the cell. In this respect, the Court notes that irrespective of the reasons for the overcrowding, it is incumbent on the respondent Government to organise its penitentiary system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees, regardless of financial or logistical difficulties (see Mamedova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7 63, 1 June 2006).",

The Court further observes, and it was not disputed by the parties, that the windows in the cells in which the applicant was held were small and covered with metal shutters. This arrangement significantly reduced the amount of daylight that could penetrate into the cell, and cut off fresh air. In addition, as was confirmed by the Government (see paragraph 15 above), the cells lacked artificial ventilation. It therefore appears that for more than two years the applicant had to spend a considerable part of each day in a cramped cell with poor ventilation and no window in the proper sense of the word (compare Peers v.

However, for the Government to effectively argue that the applicant was infected with Koch's bacillus even before his arrest, it would have been necessary for the authorities to perform the Mantoux test on the applicant upon his admission to the detention facility and in addition to a fluorography examination, or a special tuberculosis blood test which would have indicated the presence of the latent infection. However, as follows from the parties' submissions, apart from fluorography examinations, the Russian penitentiary institutions did not employ any other methods to check for TB at the moment of detainees' admission to detention facilities. It is therefore impossible to exclude that the applicant was never exposed to the infection prior to his arrest and that he only contracted tuberculosis in detention, particularly taking into account that the severe overcrowding, unsatisfactory ventilation and poor sanitary conditions in which the applicant found himself in facility no. IZ-39/1 (see paragraphs 68-73 above) are a recognised setting for the transmission of tuberculosis (see Ghavtadze v. Georgia, no. 23204/07, \u00a7 86, 3 March 2009). The Court also does not lose sight of the statistical estimations that place Russia among one of the twenty-two highest-burden countries for tuberculosis in the world, recording a drastic increase in the incidence of tuberculosis in 1990s, with some reports indicating that TB is twenty times more prevalent in Russian prisons than in civilian life (see paragraph 49 above). With all these considerations in mind and also adding to them the fact that the first two fluorography tests performed in December 1999 and June 2000 showed no pathology in the applicant's lungs, the Court considers it most probable that the applicant contracted tuberculosis in detention facility no.

Estonia, no. 64812/01, \u00a7 54, 8 November 2005, and Pitalev v. Russia, no. 34393/03, \u00a7 53, 30 July 2009, with further references). However, the State does have a responsibility to ensure treatment for prisoners in its charge and a lack of adequate medical assistance for serious health problems not suffered from prior to detention may amount to a violation of Article 3 (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7 108 et seq.). Absent or inadequate treatment for tuberculosis, particularly when the disease has been contracted in detention, is most certainly a subject of the Court's concern. It is therefore bound to assess the quality of medical services rendered to the applicant in the present case and to determine whether he was deprived of adequate medical assistance as he claims and, if so, whether this amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see Sarban v. , no. 3456/05, \u00a7 78, 4\u00a0October 2005).",

The Court accepts the Government's argument, as it was not disputed by the applicant, that certain medical treatment was provided to him in the ward. However, the mere fact that a detainee is seen by a doctor and prescribed a certain form of treatment cannot automatically lead to the conclusion that the medical assistance was adequate (see Pokhlebin v. , no. 35581/06, \u00a7\u00a062, 20 May 2010, with further references).",

Russia, no.\u00a059696/00, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2006XII (extracts)) or a result of the Government's omission to enclose, in their submissions to the Court, that part of the applicant's medical record which may be considered vital evidence necessary for the examination of the complaint in so far as it contains information capable of corroborating or refuting the violation alleged by the applicant.

IZ-39/1 following the detection of tuberculosis. According to the Government the applicant was subjected to an intensive chemotherapy regimen comprising two medicines. Apart from the fact that the medicines in question were not identified by the Government, the Court notes that neither standardised treatment regimen recommended by the WHO for new TB patients consists of only two drugs (see paragraph 50 above). In fact, the initial two-month phase of the tuberculosis treatment recommended by the WHO should include at least three drugs aimed at rapidly killing tubercle bacilli. At the same time, as follows from the certificate issued by the head of the medical department of the Kaliningrad Regional Department of Execution of Sentences, it was not before September 2001, that is almost nine months after the infection had been discovered, that the applicant was prescribed a course of three anti-tuberculosis drugs recommended by the WHO. Furthermore, the Government have not argued that the initial phase of the treatment was followed up by the four-month or six-month continuation phase during which the chemotherapy regimen should have been amended for the purpose of eliminating the remaining bacilli and preventing subsequent relapse.",

However, it was more than ten days later that a tuberculosis specialist examined him for the first time and prescribed \u201csymptomatic treatment\u201d for acute viral respiratory infection. The Court finds it particularly striking that despite the applicant's history of tuberculosis the first chest fluorography examination was given to him almost a month after the deterioration of his condition. At the same time, there is no indication that the medical authorities performed any other tests, such as sputum culture testing and sputum smear bacterioscopy, drug susceptibility testing, blood analysis, liver examinations, and so on, which form part of the comprehensive therapeutic strategy required in the course of the treatment of TB patients and aimed at curing the disease. In fact, there is no evidence that the applicant was subjected even to systematic radiological assessment or that his condition was regularly checked by the facility medical personnel. In the Court's view, this cannot be deemed to be adequate and reasonable medical attention, given the disease from which the applicant was suffering.",

For instance, the Government did not argue that the intake of medicines by the applicant had been supervised and directly observed by the facility medical personnel throughout the whole treatment regime as required by the DOTS strategy (see paragraph 50 above). In addition, as follows from an extract from the applicant's medial record drawn up on 26\u00a0June 2006, the deterioration of his health in August 2001 was attributed to \u201cirregular medication\u201d (see paragraph 10 above). In the absence of the Government's argument that the applicant refused to cooperate with the domestic authorities and resisted the treatment and having regard to the observations of the attending doctor in the tuberculosis hospital recording the strong determination on the applicant's part to go through with anti-tuberculosis treatment (see paragraph 11 above), the Court cannot but accept the applicant's argument concerning the authorities' failure to administer him with anti-tuberculosis drugs in the requisite dosage and at the right intervals. This conclusion is also supported by the report of the Kaliningrad Regional Ombudsman who, having visited detention facility no. IZ-39/1 in 2001, found that inmates did not have access to sufficient medical assistance in view of the facility's lack of financial resources to purchase medical equipment or medicines (see paragraph 37 above). In this respect the Court observes that the authorities' inability to assure a regular, uninterrupted supply of essential anti-tuberculosis drugs to patients is a key factor in tuberculosis treatment failure (see, for similar reasoning, Yakovenko v. Ukraine, no. 15825/06, \u00a7\u00a7 98-102, 25 October 2007). It also notes that special attention, obviously lacking in the applicant's case, should always be given to patients whose treatment was interrupted, including specific clinical and radiological assessment and adjustment of treatment regimen in the light of the results of the assessment.",

IZ-39/1 the applicant was forced to undergo long-term treatment for his tuberculosis, becoming a chronic patient and being assigned second-degree disability. In addition, he was subjected to surgery in relation to his tuberculosis and is in need of another operation. The Court believes that, for lack of adequate medical treatment, the applicant was exposed to prolonged mental and physical suffering diminishing his human dignity.

In fact, he effectively exercised that right before the Tsentralniy District Court, which held every hearing in his presence (see, by contrast, Shilbergs v. Russia, no. 20075/03, \u00a7\u00a7 108-110, 17 December 2009). However, the Court does not find it surprising that the applicant opted for legal representation on appeal, as his personal attendance was no longer crucial at that stage of the proceedings. The Court is convinced that the applicant made informed decisions in appointing representatives and asking the  to examine the action in their absence if they failed to appear. It was open to him to make an additional provision for his personal attendance when he instructed the  regarding the consequences of his representatives' failure to attend. Furthermore, having been apprised of the date of the appeal hearing in May 2002, the applicant could have responded by lodging a separate application for leave to attend. However, he did not make use of either of those avenues. The Court does not doubt that the applicant fully understood that, in the absence of an explicit request to attend on his part, his choice of legal representation, and his consent to the examination of the action should his representatives fail to appear, implied the waiver of his right to attend the appeal hearing.",

The applicant's presence was sufficient to ensure that the proceedings before the District Court were adversarial and the principle of equality of arms was respected. There is no evidence that the applicant's position had changed since the hearings before the District Court or that he intended to present to the  any new arguments in support of his claims for compensation. The Court further takes into account that the applicant did not request the  to call any witnesses on his behalf. The task of the appeal court was therefore limited to verifying whether the relevant provisions of the domestic law conferred on the applicant the right to compensation for damage caused by his having contracted tuberculosis as a result of inadequate conditions of detention. The Court recognises that the 's task was rather technical and accordingly perhaps best dealt with in writing rather than in oral argument. Furthermore, it cannot overlook the demands of efficiency and economy that are to be met by the national authorities in the administration of justice (see, for similar reasons, Belan v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 56786/00, 2 September 2004).",

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or the omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Mente\u015f and Others v.

In this respect the Court observes that Russian law undoubtedly afforded the applicant the possibility of bringing judicial proceedings to claim compensation for the damage flowing from actions/inactions of State officials (see paragraph 38 above). The Court reiterates that the applicant availed himself of that possibility by bringing an action against the State agencies seeking compensation for the damage he had sustained on account of his contracting tuberculosis. The domestic courts examined the applicant's claims, having found them to be manifestly ill-founded in view of the absence of any evidence of the authorities' fault in infecting the applicant with tuberculosis. The applicant's dissatisfaction with the outcome of the proceedings does not in itself demonstrate that a tort action was an ineffective remedy for airing such complaints (see Buzychkin, cited above, \u00a7 74). In this connection the Court notes that the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant (see \u010conka v.
