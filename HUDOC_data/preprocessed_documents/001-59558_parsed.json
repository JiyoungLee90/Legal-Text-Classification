He denied owning any part in the newsagents business. When he was released from prison in April 1994 he began trading in telephones; this was the source of the GBP 17,000 in his building society account. He denied owning any of the cars registered in his name, claiming variously that each had been purchased and sold on behalf of a friend or stolen without insurance.

By asking the court to make a confiscation order, the prosecutor is asking it to assess the value of the proceeds of the petitioner\u2019s drug trafficking. It is therefore asking the court to reach the stage of saying that he has trafficked in drugs. If that is criminal, that seems to me to be closely analogous to an actual charge of an actual crime, in Scottish terms. There is of course no indictment or complaint, and no conviction. And the advocate depute pointed out a further difference, that a Scottish complaint or indictment would have to be specific, and would require evidence, whereas this particular allegation was unspecific and based on no evidence. But the suggestion that there is less need for a presumption of innocence in the latter situation appears to me to be somewhat Kafkaesque, and to portray vice as a virtue. With no notice of what he is supposed to have done, or of any basis which there might be for treating him as having done it, the accused\u2019s need for the presumption of innocence is in my opinion all the greater ...

In contrast to the usual obligation on the prosecution to prove the elements of the allegations against the accused, the burden was on the applicant to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that he acquired the property in question other than through drug trafficking. Following the judge\u2019s inquiry, a substantial confiscation order \u2013 in the amount of GBP\u00a091,400 \u2013 was imposed.

The court was empowered to make a confiscation order of a smaller amount if satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that only a lesser sum could be realised. The principal safeguard, however, was that the assumption made by the 1994 Act could have been rebutted if the applicant had shown, again on the balance of probabilities, that he had acquired the property other than through drug trafficking. Furthermore, the judge had a discretion not to apply the assumption if he considered that applying it would give rise to a serious risk of injustice. ",

In reality, however, and looking in detail at the steps taken by the judge to reach the final figure of GBP 91,400, the Court notes that in respect of every item taken into account the judge was satisfied, on the basis either of the applicant\u2019s admissions or of evidence adduced by the prosecution, that the applicant owned the property or had spent the money, and that the obvious inference was that it had come from an illegitimate source. Thus, the judge found \u201creal indications on the civil basis of proof\u201d that the sale of the house to X had not been genuine and was instead a cover for the transfer of drug money (see paragraph 14 above). As for the additional GBP\u00a028,000 which the applicant admitted receiving in cash from X, the judge said: \u201cNo sensible explanation for the involvement of [X] \u2026 was given to me at all, and it is impossible, in my judgment, to see any sensible reason other than that ... it was a simple payment.\u201d Similarly, when assessing the amount of the applicant\u2019s expenditure on cars, the judge based himself on the lowest of the applicant\u2019s estimates as to how much he had spent (see paragraph 16 above). Since the applicant was not able to provide any record explaining the source of this money, the judge assumed that it was a benefit of drug trafficking. On the basis of the judge\u2019s findings, there could have been no objection to including the matters in a schedule of the applicant\u2019s assets for the purpose of sentencing, even if the statutory assumption had not applied.",

This was established by the Court in Eckle v. Germany (judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51) in relation to the requirement that proceedings should be determined within a reasonable time. This principle was applied in Findlay v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I) in the context of a complaint about the independence and impartiality of a tribunal before which the applicant pleaded guilty and where the only issue was one of sentence. More recently, it was applied in T. v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 24724/94, 16\u00a0December 1999, unreported) and V. v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no.\u00a024888/94, ECHR 1999-IX), where the fixing of the tariff was held to be part of the determination of a criminal charge, which therefore had to be carried out by a judicial body satisfying the requirements of independence and impartiality.

                        "content": "The other development has been the readiness of the Court to see the requirements in other paragraphs of Article 6 as but specific aspects of the requirements of fairness in paragraph 1. This is particularly so as regards the provisions of paragraph 3, where the Court has invariably considered complaints of violations of the requirements of individual sub-paragraphs in conjunction with the overall requirement of fairness in paragraph 1. Admittedly, one does not find case-law which so clearly spells out the link between paragraph 2 and paragraph 1. But such a link plainly exists, the presumption of innocence being a fundamental element of a fair trial. Moreover, there are clear indications to this effect in the Court\u2019s case-law. In Lutz v. Germany (judgment of 25 August 1987, Series A no. 123, p. 22, \n\u00a7 52), the Court noted that it had \u201cconsistently held paragraph 1 to embody the basic rule of which paragraphs 2 and 3 represented specific applications\u201d. In John Murray v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 8\u00a0February 1996, Reports 1996-I), the drawing of adverse inferences from an accused\u2019s silence was considered by the Court in terms of both paragraphs 1 and 2, the right to silence, the right not to incriminate oneself and the principle that the prosecution should bear the burden of proof being seen as aspects of a fair trial in paragraph 1, as well as specific requirements of the presumption of innocence in paragraph 2. Closer to the present case, in Salabiaku v. France (judgment of 7 October 1988, Series A no. 141-A) and Pham Hoang v. France (judgment of 25 September 1992, Series A no.\u00a0243), the Court examined the applicants\u2019 complaints about the application of presumptions against them under both paragraphs, noting in the former case that it started its examination under paragraph 2 because \u201cthe presumption of innocence, which is one aspect of the right to a fair trial secured under paragraph 1 of Article 6 ... is the essential issue in the case\u201d (paragraph 25; see also paragraph 31).

However, as the Court of Appeal pointed out in R. v. Benjafield and Others, the European Court in Minelli emphasised that Article 6 \u00a7 2, like Article 6 \u00a7 1, \u201cgoverns criminal proceedings in their entirety irrespective of the outcome of the prosecution and not solely the examination of the merits of the charge\u201d. More specifically, I see a close relationship between cases where presumptions are applied at the trial stage for the purpose of determining a defendant\u2019s guilt of the offence charged and cases such as the present where presumptions are applied after conviction and as part of the sentencing process for the purposes of determining what assets of the defendant are to be regarded as derived from the proceeds of drug trafficking and thus liable to confiscation. In my view, the Court of Appeal in Benjafield and Others was correct in holding that the confiscation procedure had to be considered on the basis that it was subject to the requirements of both paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of Article 6 read together and in seeing the requirement of \u201cfairness\u201d in this context as substantially importing the requirements laid down by the Court in Salabiaku and Pham Hoang.
