Secondly, their purpose was not primarily deterrent or punitive, as demonstrated by the fact that they did not reach a substantial level and their amount was low, 50 per cent of the overdue tax.

In that case it was found that an oral hearing had been unnecessary since the applicant had been given ample opportunity to put forward his case in writing, comment on the submissions of the tax authorities, and any issues of fact and law could have been adequately addressed in writing (see Jussila, \u00a7 47, cited above).",

In these circumstances, the Court cannot attach decisive importance to the applicant\u2019s not requesting a hearing, but has to proceed to an independent evaluation of the question of overall fairness of the proceedings, having the requirements of Article 6 as the point of reference. As it has been pointed out above, the Court has to examine whether a departure from the principle that there should be such a hearing could, in the circumstances of the case, be justified at the appeal stage by the special features of the domestic proceedings viewed as a whole. In order to decide on this question, regard must be had to the nature of the national appeal and revision system, to the scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s powers and to the manner in which the applicants\u2019 interests were actually presented and protected before the Supreme Court particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by them (see, mutatis mutandis, Ekbatani v.

It is true that the Supreme Court\u2019s main reason to reject that evidence was the absence of any other, documentary evidence, customary in similar transactions. However, the Court considers that \u2013 since it appears from the information available to it that there are no formal rules of evidence at play in this case and the courts were at liberty to accept any form of evidence \u2013 the hearing in person of the applicant and, potentially, her father would have been desirable, as a matter of fair trial, so as to enable the defence to exercise its rights to the fullest.",

The Court further observes that the proceedings before the Supreme Court were at the final instance for determining the merits of the \u201ccriminal charges\u201d brought against the applicant and no further remedy lay against its decision. Without questioning the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence had been erroneously assessed by the lower-instance court and correctly by the tax authorities, the Court considers that Article 6 \u00a7 1 required an oral hearing before a tribunal, taking into account what was at stake for the applicant.",

In the interests of procedural efficiency and economy, the highest courts in several Member States of the Council of Europe may decide cases without holding oral hearings, at least absent particular reasons to the contrary. For example, the Icelandic Supreme Court can decide to hear cases in writing if appropriate, while the Albanian Constitutional Court decides whether to hear cases orally or in writing \u201caccording to the nature of the case\u201d. Comparable approaches also apply under, for example, Swiss, Finnish, and Austrian law. While there seems to be no common standard among Member States in this regard, the above shows that, far from being aberrant, the respondent State\u2019s approach to the holding of oral hearings on appeal is certainly a tenable alternative.",
