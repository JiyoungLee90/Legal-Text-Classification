In particular, he noted that jurisdiction to deal with alleged delays in administrative proceedings was vested with administrative tribunals under Article 250t of the CCP. This excluded jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court in relation to the length of administrative proceedings as such. However, if an administrative tribunal\u2019s decision concerning the\u00a0length of administrative proceedings was considered to be arbitrary, the Constitutional Court could still review it under Article 127 of the Constitution for compliance with the requirement of fairness. The result of that review in the present case had been the finding of a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to a fair hearing and an award of damages. Moreover, as an action under Article 250t of the CCP had no compensatory effect, it could have been complemented by compensation claims under the State Liability Act.",

Moreover, that judgment had led to a reexamination of the applicant\u2019s first complaint under Article 250t \u00a7 1 of the CCP, which had eventually ended with the decision of 11 April 2013 recognising that there had been unjustified delays in the administrative proceedings and ordering their acceleration (see paragraphs 16 and 22 above). The Government argued that, in the light of those compensatory and preventive measures, the applicant had lost his status as a victim of a violation of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time in relation to the part of the administrative proceedings preceding the decision of 11\u00a0April 2013.",

In their view, therefore, the applicant should have resorted to that remedy anew. Relying on the judgment of the Bratislava Regional Court in an unrelated case (see paragraphs 34 et seq. above), the Government further argued that the applicant could have sought compensation for the length of the administrative proceedings by way of an action under the State Liability Act. Lastly, they pointed out that, subject to the subsidiarity principle, the protection of the applicant\u2019s fundamental rights remained within the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court under Article 127 of the Constitution. They concluded that, as regards that period, by not having made use of those avenues, the applicant had failed to satisfy the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convection.",

In support of their argument, they pointed out that in Csepyov\u00e1 v. Slovakia ((dec.), no. 67199/01, 8 April 2003), the Court had already accepted an action for acceleration of administrative proceedings under Part 5 of the CCP to be an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

He submitted, in particular, that despite two judicial orders under Article 250t of the CCP, there had been no actual acceleration of the administrative proceedings in question. Resorting to that remedy for the third time would have had no better chances of genuine success. In response to his second action under Article 250t of the CCP, the Regional Court had imposed a fine on the Land Office, but in the absence of any accelerating effect this had had no benefit for him since the fine had not been payable to him but to the State. The constitutional judgment in his favour had not been concerned with the alleged violation of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time by the Land Office, as complained of in the present case, but with the violation of his right to a fair hearing by the Regional Court. On a careful reading, the precedent relied on by the Government (see paragraphs 34 et\u00a0seq. and 40 above) actually disproved the effectiveness of the remedy under the State Liability Act. It was true that the domestic law had enabled him repeatedly to use various remedies, but the reality was that the domestic courts dealing with those remedies were not capable of actually resolving his problem. Lastly, in so far as the Government could be understood as attaching some responsibility for the length of the proceedings to his procedural behaviour, the applicant strongly denied any such responsibility.",

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint; however, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law. The \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the \u201cauthority\u201d referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 157).",
