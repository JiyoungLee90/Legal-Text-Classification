Accordingly, the Court finds that the whole period of time from the applicant\u2019s arrest on 17\u00a0January 2000 to his transfer to solitary confinement on 21\u00a0November 2003 should be regarded as a \"continuing situation\" for the purposes of calculation of the six-month time-limit (see Igor Ivanov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 34000/02, \u00a7 30, 7 June 2007; Benediktov v.

The presumption of innocence enshrined in paragraph 2 of Article 6 is one of the elements of the fair criminal trial that is required by paragraph 1 of that Convention (see Allenet\u00a0de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 308). It prohibits the premature expression by the tribunal itself of the opinion that the person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d is guilty before he has been so proved according to law (see Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 62) but it also covers statements made by other public officials, including police officers or prosecutors, about pending criminal investigations which could encourage the public to believe the suspect to be guilty and to prejudge the assessment of the facts by the relevant judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7 41; Daktaras v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 42095/98, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43, ECHR 2000-X; Butkevi\u010dius v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 48297/99, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2002-II; Y.B. and Others v. , nos. 48173/99 and 48319/99, \u00a7\u00a7 46-51, 28 October 2004 and Samoil\u0103 and Cionca v. , no. 33065/03, \u00a7\u00a7 91-101, 4 March 2008).",

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of committing a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court would underline that Article 6 \u00a7 2 cannot prevent the authorities from informing the public about criminal investigations in progress, but it requires that they do so with all the discretion and circumspection necessary if the presumption of innocence is to be respected (Karaka\u015f and Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak v. Turkey, no. 43925/98, \u00a7 50, 28\u00a0June 2005 and Huseyn and Others v. , nos. 35485/05, 45553/05, 35680/05 and 36085/05, \u00a7 225, 26 July 2011). The Court has thus consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see B\u00f6hmer v. Germany, no. 37568/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054 and 56, 3 October 2002; Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v.

D., the policemen of the Frunzenskiy District Department of the Interior, and their superior A.K., the head of the department in charge of homicide investigations in that police department, commenting on the merits of the charges made against the applicant during the trial. In this connection, the Court notes the Government\u2019s argument to the effect that the State could not be held responsible for material published in private media. However, it was not in dispute between the parties that the statements referred to by the applicant had indeed been made and that they had been authored by the officials in question, who apparently never objected to the publication of these statements before the delivery of the first-instance judgment in the case. In view of the above, the Court considers that the contents of the interviews are attributable to the respondent State.",

Their statements were not limited to describing the status of the pending proceedings or a \u201cstate of suspicion\u201d against the applicant but represented, as an established fact, without any qualification or reservation, that he had committed the offences.",

Russia, no. 13470/02, \u00a7 96, 23 October 2008).
