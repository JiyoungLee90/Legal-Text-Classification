The government offered diplomatic assurances to sending states to secure the returns, pledging free access to detention centres for independent monitors and diplomats. In practice, they did not honour these guarantees. Those forcibly returned to Uzbekistan faced incommunicado detention, torture and other ill-treatment and, after unfair trials, long prison sentences in cruel, inhuman and degrading conditions.

The Court notes that they refer in this regard to the case of Zokhidov (cited above), in which the extradition order in respect of the applicant was set aside. In the Government\u2019s view, that happened because Mr\u00a0Zokhidov \u2013 unlike the applicant in the present case \u2013 had submitted persuasive and consistent arguments in respect of the risk of ill-treatment, which had received due assessment by the domestic courts. The Court observes that the same example has been quoted by the Government in other similar cases (see, for instance, Ermakov v. Russia, no. 43165/10, \u00a7\u00a0185, 7\u00a0November 2013). Nonetheless, even leaving aside the subsequent developments in Zokhidov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a062 et seq.), the Court observes that the main reason for the domestic authorities\u2019 refusal to extradite the applicant in that case was of a more \u201ctechnical\u201d nature, namely the fact that his prosecution had become timebarred under Russian law (see Zokhidov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0129). Therefore, the Court is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument as regards the existence of the \u201cestablished practice\u201d in dealing with the risk of illtreatment complaints, in so far as it is based on the Zokhidov case.",

The Court further notes from the interview record of 14\u00a0September 2012 and the application for refugee status of 2\u00a0October 2012 that the applicant had learned about the nature of the charges against him when arrested (see paragraphs\u00a034-35 above). The Court observes that, in any event, the main thrust of the applicant\u2019s grievance was that he risked persecution by the Uzbek authorities in connection with charges of serious criminal offences punishable by long prison terms, and also illtreatment in custody. The Court reiterates its constant approach that, whilst a person\u2019s failure to seek asylum immediately after arrival in another country may be relevant for the assessment of the credibility of his or her allegations, it is not possible to weigh the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons put forward for expulsion (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia v.

Any such allegation always concerns an eventuality, something which may or may not occur in the future. Consequently, such allegations cannot be proven in the same way as past events. The applicant must only be required to show, with reference to specific facts relevant to him and to the class of people he belongs to, that there was a high likelihood that he would be ill-treated (see Azimov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a067474/11, \u00a7\u00a0128, 18\u00a0April 2013).

The Uzbek authorities were of the opinion that the applicant was plotting to destroy the constitutional order of Uzbekistan. The above considerations constituted the basis for both the extradition request and the arrest warrant issued in respect of the applicant. Various international reports, and the Court itself in a number of judgments, have pointed to the risk of illtreatment which could arise in similar circumstances (see Umirov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0119, and Abdulkhakov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0145).",

The Court further reiterates that the ratification of international treaties guaranteeing respect for fundamental rights, referred to by the FMS\u00a0Nizhniy Novgorod (see paragraph\u00a036 above), is not in itself sufficient to ensure adequate protection against a risk of illtreatment where, as in the present case, reliable sources report practices resorted to or tolerated by the authorities which are manifestly contrary to the principles of the Convention (see Hirsi Jamaa and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0128).",

A remedy must be made available during a person\u2019s detention to allow that person to obtain a speedy judicial review of the legality of the detention, capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release. The existence of the remedy required by Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see Ismoilov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0145, with further references). The forms of judicial review satisfying the requirements of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 may vary from one domain to another, and will depend on the type of deprivation of liberty in issue. It is not excluded that a system of automatic periodic review of the lawfulness of detention by a court may ensure compliance with the requirements of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 (see Megyeri v.\u00a0Germany, 12\u00a0May 1992, \u00a7\u00a022, Series A no. 237A).

The applicant\u2019s complaint under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 was mainly directed not against the initial decision on his placement in custody, but rather against his inability to obtain judicial review of his detention after a certain lapse of time. The Court notes that detention under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f) lasts, as a rule, for a significant period and depends on circumstances which are subject to change over time (compare Waite v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a053236/99, \u00a7\u00a056, 10\u00a0December 2002, with further references). Given that the applicant has spent about one year in custody since the relevant appeal decision of 26\u00a0March 2013 was given, new issues affecting the lawfulness of the detention might have arisen during that period. Under such circumstances the Court considers that the requirement of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 was neither incorporated in the initial detention order of 13\u00a0March 2013 nor fulfilled by the appeal court (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0151).",

Be that as it may, the Court does not consider it necessary to assess the effectiveness of the proposed remedy, because, in any event, those provisions, in so far as relevant, only provide for an opportunity to challenge the initial detention order. Admittedly, in the present case the applicant could have requested the supervisory court to assess whether in the initial proceedings there had been an error in determining the outcome of the case or which significantly adversely affected his rights or interests (see, in so far as relevant, the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 3\u00a0April 2012, cited in paragraph\u00a058 above).

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see A. and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a03455/05, \u00a7\u00a0164, ECHR 2009, with further references). It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01, and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary, and thus contrary to the Convention. To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention should be appropriate; and the length of the detention should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Rustamov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0150, with further references).",

The Court reiterates that \u201cthe absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time may be incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u201d (see Khudoyorov v.

Indeed, it is not disputed that the authorities were aware of the applicant\u2019s irregular immigration status from the time of his arrest on 13\u00a0September 2012 (see paragraph\u00a034 above). Nevertheless, they did not cite that ground for detaining him until the time-limit for his detention pending extradition had expired. However, \u2013 even if the official account of the events surrounding the applicant\u2019s release is accepted (see paragraphs\u00a022-23 above) \u2013 once the said time-limit had expired the applicant was again arrested, right outside the Arzamas police station during an extraordinary check conducted late at night within ten minutes of the applicant\u2019s purported release from detention pending extradition (ibid.). After that time the applicant remained in detention \u201cwith a view to expulsion\u201d, while the extradition proceedings were in progress, until 9\u00a0April 2013 (see paragraph\u00a015 above).

In Azimov the Court found, in somewhat similar circumstances, that those two conditions had not been met, at least during the short period when the applicant\u2019s extradition proceedings were still pending, and probably even after they were over (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0165).",
