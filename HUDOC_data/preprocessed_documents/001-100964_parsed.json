His counsel M. objected, stating that the applicant had a permanent place of residence, had no intention of absconding \u2013 on the contrary, he had actively cooperated with the investigation \u2013 and that his state of health had worsened. The court held that the investigator's request should be granted and that there was no reason to vary the preventive measure in respect of the applicant since the circumstances that had constituted the grounds for its application had not changed. The applicant was charged with a serious offence and had no permanent job and no assets. Furthermore, he was suspected of having committed a further offence similar to the one he had been charged with. Therefore, if released, he might abscond, hinder the criminal prosecution and engage in further criminal activity. Moreover, certain investigative measures had to be conducted before the case was sent for trial. The court also found that the arguments put forward by the applicant's counsel concerning the applicant's personality and his state of health were not sufficient grounds for refusing the investigator's request. In particular, no medical documents had been provided to prove that placement in a remand prison was damaging to the applicant's health.",

However, she had neither appeared nor provided any documents justifying her failure to do so. The hearing had then been postponed to 5 May 2005 and counsel B. had been notified accordingly.

The assessment of this minimum level is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the state of health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 162, Series\u00a0A no. 25, and G\u00e4fgen v.  [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 88, ECHR 2010...). Although the purpose of such treatment is a factor to be taken into account, in particular the question of whether it was intended to humiliate or debase the victim, the absence of any such purpose does not inevitably lead to a finding that there has been no violation of Article 3 (see Peers v.\u00a0Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2001-III).",

The State must ensure that given the practical demands of imprisonment, the health and well-being of a detainee are adequately secured by, among other things, providing him with the requisite medical assistance (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94).",
