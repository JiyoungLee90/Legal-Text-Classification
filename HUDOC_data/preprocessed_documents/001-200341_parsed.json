In one of their luggage three packets containing a total of 2,988.2 grams of cocaine of around 70% purity were found, and two packets containing a total of 7,151 pills containing MDMA (ecstasy) were also found. G.R.E. made two statements to the police. In his first statement he said that he was afraid to mention the person who had instructed him to carry the drugs to Malta, saying that he was Russian. In his second statement he said that it was Mark Stephens who, it has been established, was the applicant. He confirmed his second statement on oath before the duty magistrate\u201d and concluded that in terms of Section\u00a030A of Chapter 101 of the Laws of Malta such statement was admissible provided that it was given voluntarily (see relevant domestic law).",

The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the unlawfulness in question and, where the violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see Khan v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a035394/97, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR 2000-V; Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a095; Bykov v.\u00a0Russia [GC], no.\u00a04378/02, \u00a7 89, 10 March 2009; and L\u00f3pez Ribalda and Others v.\u00a0Spain, nos.\u00a01874/13 and 8567/13, \u00a7 83, 9 January 2018).",

In any event, the Court notes that, while the applicant alleges that G.R.E. had been questioned while suffering from withdrawal symptoms and that a certain pressure was allegedly exerted on G.R.E., those claims were dismissed by the domestic court (see paragraphs 4445 above). It follows, that it has not been established that the statements, which were also reiterated before the duty magistrate, were made in circumstances which amounted to treatment contrary to Article\u00a03.

The fairness of a criminal trial must be guaranteed in all circumstances. However, what constitutes a fair trial cannot be the subject of a single unvarying rule but must depend on the circumstances of the particular case. The Court\u2019s primary concern, in examining a complaint under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1, is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see, among many other authorities, Beuze v.\u00a0Belgium, [GC], no.\u00a071409/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0120, 9\u00a0November 2018 and the caselaw cited therein).",

They can be viewed, therefore, as specific aspects of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings in Article 6 \u00a7 1. Those minimum rights guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 3 \u2013 such as for example, the right of everyone \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d to be effectively defended by a lawyer, which is one of the fundamental features of a fair trial \u2013 are, nevertheless, not ends in themselves: their intrinsic aim is always to contribute to ensuring the fairness of the criminal proceedings as a whole (ibid. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0122123).",

Indeed the domestic court found that it did not, and the Court is not called upon to reexamine the domestic court\u2019s findings in that case. Further, the Court notes that those statements were not taken in breach of domestic law, since at the time such circumstances were lawful. Therefore, the situation pertaining to the present case is one concerning solely the domestic courts\u2019 use, in the applicant\u2019s case, of statements made by a third party without the assistance of a lawyer. Thus, the Court is called on to assess whether the use in criminal proceedings of evidence obtained from third parties, in such circumstances, rendered the proceedings of another individual (in the present case the applicant) unfair.",

On the contrary, the Court notes that the statement given by G.R.E. to the police on 12\u00a0August 2003 corresponded to the statement given before the magistrate the day after, on 13\u00a0August 2003. Such circumstances lend some credence to their reliability or accuracy, despite the fact that such statements were later retracted. It is true that the notion of a fair and adversarial trial presupposes that, in principle, a tribunal should attach more weight to a witness\u2019s testimony given at the trial hearing than to a record of his or her pretrial questioning produced by the prosecution, unless there are good reasons to find otherwise (ibid. \u00a7 211). When dealing with complaints concerning this issue, although it is not the Court\u2019s task to verify whether the domestic courts made any substantive errors in that assessment, it is nevertheless required to review whether the courts gave reasons for their decisions in respect of any objections concerning the evidence produced (ibid.). However, the Convention does not require jurors to give reasons for their decisions (see Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a019867/12, \u00a7 84, 11 July 2017) and, in so far as relevant in the present case, as noted in the preceding paragraph the applicant\u2019s objections, if any, were limited.",

In particular, in its judgment the Court of Criminal Appeal also relied on the testimony of V.S. given during the proceedings and that of the applicant himself. It also explained in detail how the testimony of each witness corroborated that of the other (see paragraphs 2627 above). The Court reiterates that a higher degree of scrutiny should be applied to assessment of statements by co-defendants, because the position in which co-defendants find themselves when testifying is different from that of ordinary witnesses (see Pichugin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 38623/03, \u00a7\u00a0199, 23\u00a0October 2012). The same can be said to apply to accomplices tried in different proceedings. Thus, while it is true that the testimony of G.R.E. and V.S. as accomplices had to be approached with caution, the Constitutional Court considered that the trial judge had explained the law to the jurors and he had stated in clear terms that the prosecution\u2019s request to find guilt on the basis of G.R.E.\u2019s sworn statement was legally correct whilst factually it depended on whether the jurors accepted that statement as the truth. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view the judge had been careful not to influence the jurors, and, the Court of Criminal Appeal had already rejected the applicant\u2019s grievance (see paragraph 46 above). As to V.S., the Court notes that the applicant had not taken issue with that testimony neither during the criminal proceedings nor during the constitutional redress proceedings, and there is nothing in the case-file which could lead the Court to consider that the testimony given by V.S. \u2013 the crux of which referred to the identification of the applicant as Mark Stephens \u2013 had not been considered with caution.",
