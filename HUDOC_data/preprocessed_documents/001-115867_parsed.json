That information was sent to the remaining applicants in the application no. 4707/08 on 16 February 2011, who are her close relatives. They did not dispute that fact nor did they submit a request to pursue that applicant\u2019s case. In these circumstances, the Court concludes that it is no longer justified to continue the examination of the application no. 4707/08 in so far as it was brought by Ms Slavojka Kandi\u0107 within the meaning of Article\u00a037 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c) of the Convention. Furthermore, the Court finds no reasons of a general nature, as defined in Article 37 \u00a7 1 in fine, which would require the examination of this part of the application no. 4707/08 by virtue of that Article (contrast Karner v.\u00a0Austria, no. 40016/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-28, ECHR 2003-IX). It therefore decides to strike the application out of its list of cases in so far as it was brought by Ms\u00a0Slavojka Kandi\u0107 (see Erol Direk\u00e7i and Erg\u00fcl Direk\u00e7i v.  (dec.), no. 47826/99, 31\u00a0March 2005).",

The respondent State enforced the judgments under consideration in that case in cash and undertook to so enforce a number of other similar judgments (see Momi\u0107 and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 28730/06, 17\u00a0May\u00a02011). However, it should be emphasised that none of the applicants in those cases, unlike the present applicants, had accepted government bonds. The present case must therefore be distinguished from the \u010coli\u0107 and Others jurisprudence. Given further that some of the present applicants have already sold their bonds on the Stock Exchange (see paragraph 10 above) and that the legal costs awarded to them have already been paid in cash, the Court considers the impugned domestic judgments to have been enforced.",

One of the features of such redress is the amount awarded by the national authorities (see Kudi\u0107 v. , no. 28971/05, \u00a7 17, 9 December 2008). While it is true that the national authorities expressly acknowledged the breach alleged in the present case, the applicants were not able to obtain any compensation in respect of the delayed enforcement of the judgments (see paragraph 8 above). Therefore, they may still claim to be victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention in relation to the period during which the judgments remained unenforced (see Dubenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a074221/01, \u00a7 36, 11 January 2005). The Court thus rejects the Government\u2019s objection.",
