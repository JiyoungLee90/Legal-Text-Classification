The case originated in an application (no. 35000/07) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr István Kocsis (“the applicant”), on 6 August 2007.
The applicant was represented by Mr B. Szentkláray, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 7 March 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Miskolc.
In 1986 the applicant, together with some other co-accused, was charged with aggravated fraud and other related criminal offences and placed in pre-trial detention. By its decision of 4 July 1990 the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court party discontinued the criminal proceedings by reason of a general amnesty. As to the remainder of the charges, the applicant was acquitted by the judgment of the Regional Court on 25 October 1990. The Office of the General Attorney appealed but withdrew its appeal on 25 April 1991. The Supreme Court established by its decision of 16 May 1991 that the Regional Court’s judgment had entered into force on 2 May 1991. This decision was served on the applicant and the other defendants on 31 March 1992.
On 21 May 1993 the applicant lodged an action in damages against the Hungarian State for the late service of the final judicial decision. Subsequently he extended his action to include further respondents, the Office of the General Attorney, the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Chief Police Department and the Supreme Court.
By its decision of 26 March 1997, the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s action. On appeal, the Supreme Court, acting as a second instance court, partly upheld the first-instance decision, and as to the complaint against the Supreme Court, remitted the case to the first-instance court. The applicant lodged a petition for review. On 14 May 2001 the Supreme Court upheld the second-instance decision concerning the complaint against the Hungarian State, and remitted the case to the Regional Court as regards the remainder of the respondents.
On 27 September 2003 the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court partly found for the applicant in the proceedings against the Supreme Court and ordered this latter to pay him 1,900,000 Hungarian forints (HUF) (approximately 6,400 euros (EUR)) plus accrued interests in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.
The Budapest Court of Appeal, acting as a second-instance court, increased the amount for the non-pecuniary damage and remitted the case to the first-instance as regards the amount of the pecuniary damage.
In the second set of first-instance proceedings the Regional Court issued its decision on 11 July 2006 ordering the respondent to pay the applicant HUF 3,138,336 (approximately EUR 10,500).
On appeal, the Debrecen Court of Appeal decreased the amount payable to the applicant to HUF 112,349 (approximately EUR 380).
The applicant lodged a petition for review with the Supreme Court. By its decision of 29 November 2007 the Supreme Court increased the amount to HUF 200,000 (approximately EUR 670).
As regards the remainder of the action against the Office of the General Attorney and the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Chief Police Department, the Regional Court issued its decision in the resumed first-instance proceedings on 14 March 2007, dismissing the applicant’s action. This decision was upheld on appeal by the Debrecen Court of Appeal on 26 June 2007.
