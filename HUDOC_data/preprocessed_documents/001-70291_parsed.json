In fact, in the instant case, the debtor is a State body and, as it appears from the case file, the enforcement of the judicial decision against it depends on the allocation of provisions for the relevant expenditures in the State Budget (see paragraph 26 above). Consequently, the enforcement of the judgment of 14 May 2001 was contingent upon the appropriate budgetary measures rather than on the conduct of the Enforcement Authorities (Romashov, cited above, \u00a7 31).

Consequently, the Court considers that the applicant company should be compensated for these financial repercussions by way of an award of non-pecuniary damage (cf. Sovtransavto Holding v.  (just satisfaction), no. 48553/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a078-80, 2 October 2003; Comingersoll v. Portugal [GC], no. 35382/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a032-36, ECHR 2000IV).
