The case originated in eight applications (nos. 22080/09, 56465/13, 73656/14, 75791/14, 626/15, 629/15, 634/15 and 1906/15) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”). The applicants were all Serbian nationals and their further personal and other relevant details and are set out in the appendix to this judgment.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Vanja Rodić.
On 9 March 2015 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants complained of the excessive length of different criminal and civil proceedings under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
All applicants obtained decisions of the Constitutional Court of Serbia, which found a violation of their right to a hearing within reasonable time and awarded them certain sums in respect of the non-pecuniary damage suffered (see appendix to this judgment).
