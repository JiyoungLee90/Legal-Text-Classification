In particular, the applicant had acquired the disputed land in good faith and had farmed it for some nine years (since 1997) when the decision to annul his title had been taken.

In this regard the Court reiterates that the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally fail to respect the requisite fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights and will constitute a disproportionate burden on the applicant (see The Holy Monasteries v.\u00a0Greece, 9\u00a0December 1994, \u00a7\u00a071, Series A no. 301-A, and Former King of Greece and Others v.

He paid land tax on it and farmed it since 1997 as a holder of a share in the land plot owned by a collective farm and duly registered his individual title in 2003. In these circumstances, in the Court\u2019s view, the fact that in 2006 the land was taken from the applicant without any compensation or another type of appropriate reparation is sufficient to find that the applicant was subjected to a disproportionate burden as a result of having been deprived of this plot of land.",

In order to determine just satisfaction, it must have regard to the particular features of each case (see ibid., \u00a7\u00a0247). On a number of occasions, where one or more heads of damage could not be calculated precisely, the Court made a global assessment ruling on an equitable basis (see, as recent references, Agrokompleks v.
