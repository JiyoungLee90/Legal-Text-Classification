In its judgment of 29\u00a0November 2001 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) observed that the grant of that credit was not linked to maternity leave or to the disadvantages which a female civil servant incurred in her career as a result of being absent from work during the period following the birth of a child. This credit was linked to a separate period, namely that devoted to bringing up the children. In this connection, the ECJ found that the situations of a male civil servant and a female civil servant were comparable as regard the bringing-up of children. In particular, the fact that female civil servants were more affected by the occupational disadvantages entailed in bringing up children, because this was a task generally carried out by women, did not prevent their situation from being comparable to that of a male civil servant who had assumed the task of bringing up his children and had thereby been exposed to the same career-related disadvantages.",

That measure was not justified because it was not of a nature such as to offset the disadvantages to which the careers of female civil servants were exposed by helping those women conduct their professional life on an equal footing with men. On the contrary, that measure was limited to granting female civil servants who were mothers a service credit at the date of their retirement, without providing a remedy for the problems which they might encounter in the course of their professional career. The French legislation therefore infringed the principle of equal pay inasmuch as it excluded male civil servants who were able to prove that they had assumed the task of bringing up their children from entitlement to the credit.",

The ECJ found that the positions of a male and a female worker, father and mother of a young child, were comparable with regard to their possible need to reduce their daily working time in order to look after their child. The Spanish legislation established a difference on grounds of sex, as between mothers whose status was that of an employed person and fathers with the same status.",

It could be therefore considered as time purely devoted to the child and as a measure which reconciled family life and work following maternity leave. Feeding and devoting time to the child could be carried out just as well by the father as by the mother. Therefore that leave seemed to be accorded to workers in their capacity as parents of the child. It could not therefore be regarded as ensuring the protection of the biological condition of the woman following pregnancy or the protection of the special relationship between a mother and her child.",

To refuse entitlement to the leave at issue to fathers whose status was that of an employed person, on the sole ground that the child\u2019s mother did not have that status, could have as its effect that the mother would have to limit her self-employed activity and bear the burden resulting from the birth of her child alone, without the child\u2019s father being able to ease that burden. Consequently, a measure at issue could not be considered to be a measure eliminating or reducing existing inequalities in society, nor as a measure seeking to achieve substantive as opposed to formal equality by reducing the real inequalities that could arise in society and thus to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in the professional careers of the relevant persons.",

The Court reiterates in this respect that its judgments serve not only to decide those cases brought before it but, more generally, to elucidate, safeguard and develop the rules instituted by the Convention, thereby contributing to the observance by the States of the engagements undertaken by them as Contracting Parties (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18\u00a0January 1978, \u00a7\u00a0154, Series A no. 25; Guzzardi v.

The denial of parental leave to the applicant had accordingly been based on a combination of two grounds: military status plus sex.

The Chamber further noted that since the adoption of the judgment in the Petrovic case the legal situation as regards parental leave entitlements in the Contracting States had evolved. In an absolute majority of European countries the legislation now provided that parental leave might be taken by both mothers and fathers. In the Chamber\u2019s opinion, this showed that society had moved towards a more equal sharing between men and women of responsibility for the upbringing of their children and that men\u2019s caring role had gained recognition. It was therefore time to overrule the Petrovic case and to hold that there was no objective or reasonable justification for the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to parental leave. The Chamber further condemned gender stereotypes in the sphere of child-raising.",

Thus, a wide margin of appreciation was afforded to States wishing to impose restrictions on the rights of military personnel under Articles 5, 9, 10 and 11 of the Convention. The States, however, had a narrower margin of appreciation in the sphere of family and private life. Indeed, although States were allowed to impose certain restrictions on the Article 8 rights of military personnel where there was a real threat to the armed forces\u2019 operational effectiveness, assertions as to the existence of such a threat had to be \u201csubstantiated by specific examples\u201d.",

Indeed, there was no expert study or statistical research on the number of servicemen who would be in a position to take three years\u2019 parental leave at any given time and who would be willing to do so. Further, the fact that in the armed forces women were less numerous than men could not, in the Chamber\u2019s opinion, justify the disadvantaged treatment of the latter as regards entitlement to parental leave. Finally, the argument that a serviceman was free to resign from the army if he wished to take personal care of his children was particularly questionable, given the difficulty in directly transferring essentially military qualifications and experience to civilian life. The Chamber noted with concern that servicemen were forced to make a difficult choice between caring for their new-born children and pursuing their military career, while no such choice was faced by servicewomen.

The Court had held on many occasions that parental leave, as well as parental and child benefits, came within the scope of Article 8 and that Article 14, taken together with Article\u00a08, was applicable (see Weller v. , no. 44399/05, \u00a7 29, 31\u00a0March 2009; Okpisz v. , no. 59140/00, \u00a7 32, 25 October 2005; Niedzwiecki v.

Servicewomen, as well as civilian men and women, all had an unconditional entitlement to three years\u2019 parental leave, while a serviceman could at most claim three months\u2019 leave if his wife was dead or otherwise incapable of taking care of the child. Although the applicant had been ultimately granted parental leave, it could not alter the fact that he had been treated differently from other parents. In fact, his parental leave had been of a shorter duration and, according to the domestic courts, had been granted unlawfully. The applicant had therefore felt anxiety during the entire duration of the parental leave, as he had known that the leave could be cancelled and he could be recalled to duty at any time. Finally, the applicant had also been treated differently from servicewomen in that he had had to make a difficult choice between his military career and family life, while servicewomen were not faced with such a choice.",

As to the \u201cpositive discrimination\u201d doctrine, it could not be used to justify a difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to parental leave. Positive discrimination measures had to be proportionately tailored to the aim of correcting, compensating for, or mitigating the continuing effects of a hardship suffered by a historically disadvantaged group, such as women (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 40-43, 10 May 2007, and Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 66, ECHR 2006VI). Far from mitigating any historic disadvantage suffered by women, a policy whereby only women were entitled to take parental leave perpetuated gender stereotypes, inequality and hardship arising out of women\u2019s traditional role of caring for the family in the home rather than earning money in the workplace. As a result, that policy discriminated both against men (in family life) and against women (in the workplace).

In his opinion, the Government had not provided evidence showing that an extension of the parental leave entitlement to servicemen would create a threat to the fighting capacity of the army. In particular, the statistics provided by the Government were not conclusive and were not moreover supported by any document. The number of children under the age of three indicated by the Government apparently also included the children of servicewomen and those of administrative army personnel. It was therefore impossible to establish the number of servicemen who would be in a position to take parental leave at any given time. Most importantly, the Government\u2019s admission that there was no relevant statistical information in their possession showed that the legal provisions limiting the parental leave entitlement to servicewomen had no factual foundation at the time of their adoption and had never been subjected to any factually-based review or update. According to the applicant\u2019s estimation the number of servicemen who would be in a position to take parental leave at any given time would not exceed 3.47% of servicemen under contract; moreover, not all of them would be willing to take parental leave. The applicant submitted that under Russian law up to 30% of the personnel of a military unit were allowed to take leave at the same time and such military unit was considered to be fully operational.",

In his opinion, instead of a purely quantitative approach, the Government should have adopted a qualitative one taking account of the nature of each person\u2019s duties.

He further argued that although it was possible to waive Convention rights, such a waiver, to be valid, had to satisfy certain conditions. Firstly, a waiver \u201cmust not run counter to any important public interest\u201d (he referred to Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2006XII). Secondly, it \u201cmust be established in an unequivocal manner, and be given in full knowledge of the facts, that is to say on the basis of informed consent\u201d (he referred to D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, \u00a7\u00a0202, ECHR 2007...). In the applicant\u2019s opinion, the waiver alleged by the Government in the present case did not satisfy the above requirements. The Court had already held, in the context of discrimination based on race, that \u201cin view of the fundamental importance of the prohibition of racial discrimination ... no waiver of the right not to be subjected to racial discrimination [could] be accepted, as it would be counter to an important public interest\u201d (he referred to D.H. and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0204). He argued that as the prohibition of sex discrimination was of the same fundamental importance (he referred to Andrle v. the Czech Republic, no. 6268/08, \u00a7 49, 17 February 2011; Van Raalte v. the Netherlands, 21\u00a0February 1997, \u00a7 39, Reports 1997I; and Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, \u00a7\u00a078, Series A no. 94), the right not to be discriminated against on account of sex could not be waived either. Further, the alleged waiver could not be considered unequivocal. The contract signed by the applicant was a standard one-page form which did not expressly inform the signatory that he undertook to renounce his right to parental leave.",

The applicant argued that an acceptable individualised approach would be to grant parental leave depending on the person\u2019s position in the army rather than on sex. In particular, account should be taken of whether his or her unit was involved in active military actions or was being prepared for such actions and of his or her position in the unit. In the applicant\u2019s view, it was illogical that a servicewoman who held an important military position in the unit had an automatic entitlement to parental leave, while a serviceman in a relatively insignificant military position had no such entitlement.",

The mother\u2019s presence and care during the first year of the child\u2019s life was particularly important. It was therefore in the child\u2019s interest that the mother took parental leave. Secondly, given that there were few women in the army, their absence from service would have no impact on fighting capacity. Indeed, on 1 January 2011 there had been only 1,948 servicewomen in the Russian army. Accordingly, in 2011 women represented only 0.8\u00a0% of military personnel (10% in 2008).

In particular, in accordance with Article 32 \u00a7 7 of the Regulations on military service (see paragraph 48 above), a serviceman under contract was entitled to such leave in one of the following cases: (a) his wife had died in childbirth, or (b) he was bringing up a child or children under 14 years old (handicapped children under 16\u00a0years old) left without maternal care (in the event of the mother\u2019s death, withdrawal of parental authority, lengthy illness or other situations where his children had no maternal care). The list of exceptions was not an exhaustive one. The Government also referred to section 10(9) of the Military Service Act (see paragraph 47 above) according to which military personnel bringing up children left without maternal/paternal care were entitled to social benefits in accordance with federal laws and other legal instruments concerning the protection of family, motherhood and childhood. They produced documents showing the statistics for parental leave granted to servicemen and to policemen. It can be seen from the statistical information that there had been only one case, in 2007, where a serviceman had been granted parental leave of one year and a half in connection with his wife\u2019s serious illness. In 2010 another serviceman had been granted three months\u2019 special leave because his son had been left without maternal care. The Government also referred to twenty-one cases in which three years\u2019 parental leave had been granted to male police officers. The main criterion for granting leave was therefore the fact that a serviceman\u2019s children were left without maternal care. This fact, however, had to be proven. As the applicant had failed to prove that his children lacked maternal care, his application for leave had been refused. At the same time, he had ultimately been granted parental leave in view of his difficult family situation.",

The existence of such a system, which those States have retained since then, does not in itself run counter to their obligations under the Convention (see Engel and Others, cited above, \u00a7 57). It follows that each State is competent to organise its own system of military discipline and enjoys a margin of appreciation in this respect. The proper functioning of an army is hardly imaginable without legal rules designed to prevent service personnel from undermining it. However, the national authorities cannot rely on such rules to frustrate the exercise by individual members of the armed forces of their right to respect for their private lives, which right applies to service personnel as it does to others within the jurisdiction of the State (see Smith and Grady, cited above, \u00a7 89, and Lustig-Prean and Beckett, cited above, \u00a7 82).",

Accordingly, if a State does decide to create a parental leave scheme, it must do so in a manner which is compatible with Article 14 of the Convention (see Petrovic, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 26-29).",

Thus, as far as Article 14 taken together with Article 5 is concerned, the Court has found that the use of deprivation of liberty as a disciplinary sanction that might be imposed on military personnel, but not on civilians, did not result in any discrimination incompatible with the Convention, because the conditions and demands of military life were by nature different from those of civil life (see Engel and Others, cited above, \u00a7 73). Further, with respect to Article 9, the Court has remarked that certain restrictions on conduct and attitudes motivated by religion, although they could not be imposed on civilians, were acceptable in the army. In choosing to pursue a military career, members of the armed forces have accepted of their own accord a system of military discipline and the limitations of rights and freedoms implied by it (see Kala\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7 28, and also Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 50-51, Reports 1998I, concerning proselytising in the army). Similarly, when examining cases under Article\u00a010, the Court has held that it is necessary to take into account the special conditions attaching to military life and the specific \u201cduties\u201d and \u201cresponsibilities\u201d incumbent on military personnel, as members of the armed forces are bound by an obligation of discretion in relation to anything concerning the performance of their duties (see Hadjianastassiou v.

The Court has also found that distinctions between military personnel and civilians in the field of freedom of expression are justified under Article\u00a014 by the differences between the conditions of military and civil life and, more specifically, by the \u201cduties\u201d and \u201cresponsibilities\u201d peculiar to members of the armed forces (see Engel and Others, cited above, \u00a7 103). Finally, it must be noted that Article\u00a011 \u00a7 2 states explicitly that it is permissible to impose lawful restrictions on the exercise by members of the armed forces of the right to freedom of assembly and association (see Demir and Baykara v.  [GC], no. 34503/97, \u00a7 119, 12 November 2008).",

Austria case (cited above) it noted the gradual evolution of society towards a more equal sharing between men and women of responsibilities for the upbringing of their children. In that case the Court did not consider it possible to find that a distinction on the basis of sex with respect to parental leave allowances, which had existed in  in the 1980s, was in violation of Article\u00a014 taken in conjunction with Article 8. It took into account, in particular, the great disparity at the material time between the legal systems of the Contracting States in the sphere of parental benefits. At the same time it noted with satisfaction that the Austrian legislation had been changed in 1990 so that eligibility for parental leave allowances had been extended to fathers. The Austrian authorities could not therefore be criticised for having introduced in a gradual manner, reflecting the evolution of society in that sphere, legislation which was at the material time very progressive in Europe (see Petrovic, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 39-43). In the more recent case of Weller v. Hungary the Court found that the exclusion of natural fathers from the entitlement to receive parental allowances, when mothers, adoptive parents and guardians were entitled to them, amounted to discrimination on grounds of parental status (see Weller, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30-35).",

It shows that in a majority of European countries, including in Russia itself, the legislation now provides that parental leave may be taken by civilian men and women, while the countries limiting the parental leave entitlement to women are in a small minority (see paragraph 72 above). Even more important for the present case is the fact that in a significant number of the member States both servicemen and servicewomen are also entitled to parental leave (see paragraph 74 above). It follows from the above that contemporary European societies have moved towards a more equal sharing between men and women of responsibility for the upbringing of their children and that men\u2019s caring role has gained recognition. The Court cannot overlook the widespread and consistently developing views and associated legal changes to the domestic laws of Contracting States concerning this issue (see, mutatis mutandis, Smith and Grady, cited above, \u00a7 104).",

There is no indication that any expert study or statistical research was ever made by the Russian authorities to evaluate the number of servicemen who would be in a position to take three years\u2019 parental leave at any given time and would be willing to do so, and to assess how this would affect the operational effectiveness of the army. In the Court\u2019s view the mere fact that all servicemen are of a \u201cchildbearing\u201d age, as asserted by the Government (see paragraph 113 above), is insufficient to justify the difference in treatment between servicemen and servicewomen. The statistical information submitted by the Government at the request of the Court is inconclusive (see paragraphs 113 and 114 above). It does not indicate either the total number of military personnel (both military personnel under contract and conscripts) or the number of servicemen having children under the age of three.

Nor is it possible, in the absence of any survey of servicemen\u2019s willingness to take parental leave or any statistical information on the take-up rates among the civilian population, to make an assessment of how many servicemen would actually make use of the entitlement to parental leave. The Government\u2019s claim that such servicemen would be numerous contradicts their argument that this is an isolated case not disclosing any systemic problem under the Convention (see paragraph 118 above). In such circumstances the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s assertion as to the risk to operational effectiveness of the army because it has not been \u201csubstantiated by specific examples\u201d (see the case-law in paragraph 137 above).",

It is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that Russian law provides for exceptions to the rule that servicemen are not entitled to parental leave. Article 32 \u00a7\u00a07 of the Regulations on military service (see paragraph 48 above), to which the Government referred, provides for three months\u2019 special leave, which is clearly different from three years\u2019 parental leave. It can be seen from the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment that it is not a substitute for normal parental leave because its purpose is to give the serviceman a reasonable opportunity to arrange for the care of his child and, depending on the outcome, to decide whether he wishes to continue the military service (see paragraph 34 above). As regards the Government\u2019s reference to section\u00a010(9) of the Military Service Act (see paragraph 47 above), the applicant relied on that legal provision in the domestic proceedings, but the national courts found that it could not serve as a basis for granting three years\u2019 parental leave to a serviceman (see paragraphs 17 and 26 above). Further, it is clear from the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment and from the judgments of the domestic courts in the applicant\u2019s case that Russian law does not give a serviceman the right to three years\u2019 parental leave. In this connection the Court takes particular note of the first-instance and appeal judgments, which state that \u201cmale military personnel have no entitlement to three years\u2019 parental leave even in those cases where their children are left without maternal care\u201d and that \u201cmale military personnel are not in any circumstances entitled to parental leave\u201d (see paragraphs 26 and 29 above).

Indeed, female military personnel are entitled to parental leave and the exclusion concerns only servicemen. At the same time it considers that, having regard to the specific demands imposed by military service, it may be justifiable to exclude from the entitlement to parental leave any personnel, male or female, who may not easily be replaced in their duties owing to such factors as, for example, their hierarchical position, rare technical qualifications or involvement in active military actions. In , by contrast, the entitlement to parental leave depends exclusively on the sex of the military personnel. By excluding servicemen from the entitlement to parental leave, the provision imposes a blanket restriction. It applies automatically to all servicemen, irrespective of their position in the army, the availability of a replacement or their individual situation.

Secondly, the information which was required by the enquiring official could have been obtained elsewhere and in another manner.

Parental leave is protected by Article 8 of the Convention in as much as it is an essential guarantee of the bond between a parent and his or her child at a time of particular vulnerability and special need for the child. The family ties which are thus protected may be based on a biological relationship of motherhood or fatherhood, or a legal relationship of adoption, or any other legally equivalent relationship.

Some major practical consequences flow from this reasoning. Firstly, States have a positive obligation to create a legal system of parental leave.

This argument is flawed for two reasons. Firstly, it ignores the purpose of the Convention as a treaty which envisages the \u201cdevelopment\u201d of human rights in the light of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, where economic and social rights are foreseen. This clear intention is expressed in the Preamble to the Convention and is confirmed by the Convention provisions on the right to join a trade union and the prohibition of forced labour, and the subsequent adoption of Protocols on the right to property and the right to education. In addition, there is no unequivocal dividing line between civil rights and social rights, and most of the civil rights have social and economic derivations.",

The petrification of the Convention would not only depart from the common rules of treaty interpretation, which leave a supplementary role to the preparatory work and give preference to the letter, purpose and object of the provision (see Article 31 \u00a7 1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties): it would also ultimately disregard the true intention of the founding fathers, namely to create an instrument for the guarantee of rights that are practical and effective, not theoretical and illusory.",

Social rights are said to be mere aspirational policy goals or action programmes directed at the political and administrative branches of the State and do not lend themselves to any judicial review. This argument overlooks the notion of a minimum core of fundamental rights. Social rights, as any other fundamental rights, have a minimum core which can and should be determined and enforced by courts, according this task the greatest relevance especially in times of financial hardship, when social rights are the first to be neglected. If wide latitude is given to the State to take the appropriate social-policy measures, the Court\u2019s role is to determine whether they fall within the bounds of \u201creasonableness\u201d. The reasonableness of State social policy is assessed in terms of its proportionality in the sense that it must not only cater even-handedly for all social groups, but must also counterbalance factual inequalities and pay special attention to the most vulnerable social groups. For instance, a social-policy measure will be \u201cunreasonable\u201d, that is disproportionate, if it makes no provision for those most in need. A point of confluence is then found between the implementation of a \u201creasonable\u201d social policy and the obligatory guarantee of the minimum core of the social right.

In other words, there is a trade-off between parental leave and the child\u2019s health and academic performance. Were such a right to parental leave not protected and effected, the general well-being of the child would be significantly prejudiced and the bond between parent and child would be considerably weakened.

Out of thirty-three member States of the Council of Europe, only one does not provide for parental leave at all, two States provide for parental leave only in the case of women and all the remaining States grant parental leave to both men and women. Servicemen and servicewomen benefit from a legal regime that is the same as, or similar to, that of civilians, except in five countries where only servicewomen are entitled to such leave. The political institutions of the Council of Europe have enshrined this consensus in a number of resolutions and recommendations. Within the European Union, the Directive on parental leave (Council Directive 96/34/EC of 3 June 1996, revised by Council Directive 2010/18/EU of 8 March 2010) represents the binding standard for member States of the Union, according to which parental leave is, in principle, available to both parents as a non-transferable, individual entitlement. This consensus in European human rights law is reflected in international labour law, which has repeatedly acknowledged the right to parental leave since the 1980s, as evidenced by a number of recommendations of the International Labour Organisation (ILO): the Workers with Family Responsibilities Recommendation (R165), 1981, \u00a7 22 (1) to (3), the Part-Time Work Recommendation (R182), 1994, \u00a7 13, and the Maternity Protection Recommendation (R191), 2000, \u00a7 10 (3) to (5). Lastly, universal human rights law has joined the above-mentioned consensus. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has noted that the implementation of Article 3 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in relation to Article 9, requires, inter alia, guaranteeing adequate maternity leave for women, paternity leave for men, and parental leave for both men and women.",

The basic argument presented at that time, according to which the majority of member States of the Council of Europe did not provide for parental leave for fathers, does not correspond anymore to reality today. But coherence demands that conclusions must be drawn from this new consensus. If it is correct to conclude that no reason remains for a distinction on the basis of sex with respect to parental leave, it is all the more to be concluded that the right to parental leave itself is now understood by almost all member States of the Council of Europe and the international community in general to be an integral part and a constitutive element of the legal protection of the family and the parent-child relationship. Therefore, it can be inferred that the cost of parental leave is not likely to place an unnecessary and impractical burden on the State\u2019s resources. In other words, the argument can no longer be made that the cost of human rights protection in this particular area does not derive from the choices of the legitimate representatives of the people. The common ground between laws of member States of the Council of Europe and international legal standards reveals a new facet of the right to respect for family life \u2013 a facet which has gained broad democratic legitimacy.",

Although the rules set by the Directive on parental leave are binding for countries in the European Union, the Convention does not impose the same legal standard in view of the lack of a European consensus as to the exact form, duration and conditions of parental leave among all member States of the Council of Europe. Yet the regime governing the right to parental leave, as those that govern any other social rights, is not entirely subject to the discretion of political majorities. Some fundamental features of this right can be ascertained in the light of the Convention and such a regime is therefore subject to the supervision of the Court. The classic Achilles heel of social rights being their effectiveness and judicial enforceability, a clear definition of the scope of competences of the legislature and the judiciary in the implementation of social rights is of the utmost importance.",

At the end of a period of parental leave, workers have the right to return to the same job or, if that is not possible, to an equivalent job consistent with their employment contract or relationship. Rights acquired or in the process of being acquired by the worker on the date on which parental leave starts must be maintained as they stand until the end of parental leave. Workers must be protected against less favorable treatment or dismissal on the grounds of an application for, or the taking of, parental leave. States are free to decide whether parental leave is granted on a full-time or part-time basis, in a piecemeal manner or in the form of a time-credit system, as well as to make entitlement to parental leave subject to a period of work qualification and/or a length of service qualification, but States may not, for instance, require an excessive qualifying period.

This is true in the present case. I find that the denial of parental leave to the applicant was based on a combination of two different discriminatory grounds: military status and sex. The impugned discrimination has a twofold legal nature: there is not only sex discrimination between servicemen and servicewomen, since servicewomen are treated better than servicemen, but also discrimination based on professional status, since civilian men are treated better than servicemen. I will deal separately with these two kinds of discriminatory treatment, with the purpose of showing that the less favourable treatment of servicemen lacks justification in any event. In addition to the theoretical importance of separating the different grounds of discrimination, a major practical consequence will be relevant for the purposes of Article 46.",

The blanket and general nature of the legal provision in question, which does not allow for balanced solutions according to the functions of different service personnel, shows that a category of citizens (servicemen) was singled out by the legislature only on account of their gender. Neither the preponderance of servicemen in the armed forces nor the \u201cspecial role of mothers in the upbringing of children\u201d can be invoked to justify such a radical difference in treatment. In fact, only a minimal percentage of civilian men take parental leave in , according to the statistics. If such a percentage is replicated in the armed forces, no major changes are to be expected in the normal life of the military services. Furthermore, tradition alone does not suffice to justify any discrimination. The discriminatory character of this regime stands out when one takes into account the fact that civilians, both men and women, are all entitled to the same legal benefits. If the Russian legislature is prepared to accept equality between civilian men and women who benefit from the same period of parental leave, it is difficult to understand why such equality is not guaranteed between servicemen and servicewomen.",

Firstly, no factual evidence was presented of any concrete danger to the operational effectiveness of the armed forces due to the possible parental leave taken by servicemen.

In such circumstances the authorities should be required to provide a plausible explanation for the purpose of any contacts with applicants with regard to pending Convention proceedings and to demonstrate that their conduct was lawful and necessary in the pursuit of a legitimate aim in the public interest. I am not persuaded by the respondent Government\u2019s explanations in this regard.

In these circumstances, the late visit and questioning \u201crelated to the Convention proceedings\u201d remain unwarranted. Regardless of whether there was an intention to dissuade Mr Markin from pursuing his complaints before the Court, he was informed that the visit was related to them and it was carried out in a manner which clearly could have been perceived as threatening, thus causing feelings of intimidation and fear to him and his family. This suffices to render the authorities accountable for a failure to respect their undertaking \u201cnot to hinder in any way the effective exercise\u201d of the right of individual petition as guaranteed by Article 34 of the Convention.",
