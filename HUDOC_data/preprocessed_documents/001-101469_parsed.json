Secondly, the Government maintained that the final domestic decision, i.e. the decision of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Latvia, was posted to the applicant on 5 March 2007 and, in reliance on section 56\u00b9 \u00a7 3 of the Law on Civil Procedure, it should be assumed that the letter had reached the applicant within seven days after the day on which it was posted, i.e. on 12\u00a0March 2007.

Pursuant to domestic law, the status of a low-income person is granted after a thorough assessment of the person's financial situation, and entitlement to this status is periodically reviewed. Besides, entitlement to this status also presupposes that the individuals have no property from which they could generate income (see \u00a7 28 above).

In the applicant's place of residence in 2007 the GMI was LVL 45, thus, even without additional evidence received from the applicant, the domestic courts could conclude that the applicant's income, after taking into account the monthly minimum income level, did not exceed LVL 37 (EUR 53).

Thus, when examining a request for the reduction of a court fee owing to an applicant's poor financial situation, a value of the claim does not appear to automatically prevent domestic courts from reducing the court fee, although it could serve as one of the elements in the assessment of its proportionality.",

For the first time the domestic court referred to the above provision in the decision of 1 March 2006 (see \u00a7 14 above), but the applicant's request to postpone the paying of the State fee was dismissed by a decision of 12\u00a0April\u00a02006 in which the court explained that that particular part of the provision did not apply to a court fee payable at the time of lodging a claim. Nevertheless, during the applicant's second attempt to lodge a civil claim, the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court, in a decision of 5 March 2007, repeatedly referred to the aforementioned part of section 43 \u00a7 4 (see \u00a7\u00a020 above), thereby suggesting that the postponement of the payment of a court fee could still be possible.",

What the Court notes is that, in spite of the various formal procedural decisions adopted by the domestic courts over a two-year period, the national courts failed to provide a sufficiently clear and unambiguous interpretation of the procedural provision concerning exemptions from a court fee. In the above circumstances it would be unreasonable to request the applicant to appear before the domestic courts for the third time and request to apply a provision which had not been clearly interpreted within the previous two years.",
