European institutions, including the Commissioner for Human Rights, have expressed concern for violence and limitations on the right to freedom of assembly of LGBT persons. Violent clashes seriously hamper the possibility for LGBT persons to peacefully demonstrate for their human rights and contribute to fostering hostility and prejudices. The OSCE has developed a set of guidelines to provide guidance to states on how to respect the freedom of assembly.

In order to satisfy the requirements of the Convention in this area, the States must ensure genuine protection through effective investigation and prosecution. The obligation to investigate effectively was of particular relevance where treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention was a hate crime motivated by prejudice, including prejudice based on sexual orientation or gender identity. A failure to ensure that a prohibition was effective in practice would send out the message that the discrimination in question was not taken seriously and could even suggest tacit approval of the actions of the perpetrators because of a prejudice shared by the investigating authorities.",

For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation as to the results to be achieved but as to the means to be employed. The authorities must have taken the steps reasonably available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. In cases under Article 3 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation has been at issue, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time. Consideration has been given to the opening of investigations, delays in taking statements and the length of time taken for the preliminary investigation (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0119123; Mocanu and Others, cited above, \u00a7 322; Identoba and Others, cited above, \u00a7 66; Begheluri and Others, cited above, \u00a7 99; Denis Vasilyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0100 with further references; and Stoica v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a042722/02, \u00a7 67, 4\u00a0March 2008). A prompt response by the authorities in investigating allegations of illtreatment may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. Tolerance by the authorities towards such acts cannot but undermine public confidence in the principle of lawfulness and the State\u2019s maintenance of the rule of law (see Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Others v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 71156/01, \u00a7 97, 3 May 2007).",

The respondent State\u2019s obligation to investigate possible discriminatory motives for a violent act is an obligation to use its best endeavours to do so, and is not absolute. The authorities must do whatever is reasonable in the circumstances to collect and secure the evidence, to explore all practical means of discovering the truth, and to deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of violence induced by, for instance, racial or religious intolerance, or violence motivated by gender-based discrimination (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 160, ECHR 2005VII; Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 138-42, cited above; and Mudric v. the Republic of Moldova, no.\u00a074839/10, \u00a7\u00a7 60-64, 16 July 2013, recently reiterated in Identoba and Others, cited above, \u00a7 67). Treating violence and brutality arising from discriminatory attitudes on an equal footing with violence occurring in cases that have no such overtones would be turning a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention (see, for instance, Begheluri and Others, cited above, \u00a7 173).",

However, no significant steps were taken in the investigation for a period of almost a year, from June 2006 \u2012 the date on which the criminal complaint was lodged \u2012 to April 2007, the date on which the file was finally allocated to the Metro Police Station. Even at the time when the investigation was officially closed by the prosecutor, more than five years after the initial criminal complaint, the police had not established the identity of the culprits (see paragraph 30 above). Furthermore, the Court cannot ignore that during the investigation there were significant periods of inactivity on the part of the authorities. The whole process lasted until 9 August 2012, that is to say a total period of more than six years, a passage of time which is liable not only to undermine an investigation, but also to compromise definitively its chances of being ever completed (see paragraph 111 above).",

Organisational changes and restructuring, however, do not suspend the State\u2019s obligations under the Convention. Moreover, the Court observes several shortcomings in the investigation, some of them acknowledged by the national authorities themselves (see, notably, paragraphs 28 and 33 above). In particular it is to be noted that throughout the investigation the police did no more than hear evidence from one witness, R.A.S., as well as attending 29 football matches and making random checks at the metro stations on five occasions (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above). It does not appear that they made use in any significant way of the evidence adduced by the applicants, specifically statements, photographs and the identification of some individuals in the group of attackers (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above). The Court in particular notes that, even though the applicants had identified some of the attackers, the domestic authorities (see paragraph 28 above) and the Government in their pleadings before the Court (see paragraph 90 above) have continued to assert the impossibility of conducting an investigation in the present case due to the failure to identify the perpetrators of the violence (see Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0118). Moreover, the Court cannot accept that the investigative actions undertaken by the domestic authorities could be deemed appropriate steps towards identifying and punishing those responsible for the incident, in particular as these measures took place such a long time after the initial events.",

They refused to examine the facts under any other Articles of the Criminal Code despite the applicants\u2019 express request to that effect, which remained unanswered (see paragraph 31 above).

The necessity of conducting a meaningful inquiry into the possibility of discrimination motivating the attack was indispensable given the hostility against the LGBTI community in the respondent State (see paragraph 46 above) and in the light of the applicants\u2019 submissions that hate speech, that was clearly homophobic, had been uttered by the assailants during the incident. The authorities should have done so \u2012 despite the fact that incitement to hate speech was not punishable at the time when the incidents occurred (see paragraph 40 above) \u2012 as the crimes could have been assigned a legal classification that would have allowed the proper administration of justice. The Court considers that without such a rigorous approach from the lawenforcement authorities, prejudice-motivated crimes would inevitably be treated on an equal footing with cases involving no such overtones, and the resultant indifference would be tantamount to official acquiescence to, or even connivance with, hate crimes (see Identoba and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077; and, mutatis mutandis, Ciorcan and others, cited above, \u00a7 167). Moreover, without a meaningful investigation, it would be difficult for the respondent State to implement measures aimed at improving the policing of similar peaceful demonstrations in the future, thus undermining public confidence in the State\u2019s anti-discrimination policy (see Identoba and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a080 in fine).",

This should have been investigated by the domestic authorities. All the Court can state is that the applicants have an arguable claim under Article 3, which triggers the obligation to carry out an effective investigation.

I disagree with the majority that the allegations other than those under Articles 3 and 14 (in so far as the complaint concerned the investigation into the allegations of ill-treatment) did not need to be examined. The issues raised by the applicant under Articles 8, 11 and 13, taken separately or in conjunction with Article 14, should not have been summarily dismissed. At least some of them merited thorough scrutiny. Only one aspect of the alleged violation of Articles 3 and 14 was examined in the present case, while the alleged violation of Article 11 was not examined at all. By way of comparison, in Identoba v. Georgia (no. 73235/12, \u00a7 106, 12 May 2015), the Court found that \u201cthe ... applicants\u2019 complaints under Article 8, made either separately or in conjunction with Articles 13 and 14 of the Convention, as well as the specific repetition of their grievance about the ineffectiveness of the criminal investigation under Article 13\u201d \u201cmerely [reiterate] the issues already thoroughly examined under the lex specialis \u2013 Articles 3 and 11, both read in conjunction with Article 14\u201d. Based on this consideration, the Court declared that part of the application \u201cmanifestly illfounded\u201d and rejected it pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention. One could say that the \u201creiteration\u201d of certain complaints already examined under other heads does not at all, by itself, permit the conclusion that they are \u201cill-founded\u201d, let alone \u201cmanifestly\u201d so. But this issue pertains to that case and not to the present one. However, in the present case the majority limited itself to a mere statement that \u201cthe Court need not examine the remainder of [the] complaint\u201d, but did not declare that part of the application \u201cmanifestly ill-founded\u201d.",

I regret to observe that overly laconic reasons for the rejection of \u201cremainders of complaints\u201d have become a longstanding practice of the Court, not only in cases where the need for such rejection is self-evident but also in cases where it would merit more explicit consideration.
