The request should be examined by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level (Article 108 \u00a7 4).

The period of detention pending investigation of a crime cannot exceed two months (Article 109 \u00a7\u00a01) but may be extended up to six months by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level (Article 109 \u00a7 2).

Allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. To assess this evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Jalloh v.

The establishment of such responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of conditions in the requesting country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention. Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the receiving country, whether under general international law, under the Convention or otherwise (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 91, Series A no.\u00a0161).",

France, 29\u00a0April 1997, \u00a7\u00a037, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III). Since the nature of the Contracting States' responsibility under Article 3 in cases of this kind lies in the act of exposing an individual to the risk of ill-treatment, the existence of the risk must be assessed primarily with reference to those facts which were known or ought to have been known to the Contracting State at the time of the extradition (see Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden, 20 March 1991, \u00a7\u00a7 75-76, Series\u00a0A no. 201, and Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, 30 October 1991, \u00a7 107, Series A no. 215).

It is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see N. v.

For instance, the Committee Against Torture pointed out that the Tajik law regarding prohibition of torture was not fully in conformity with the text of the Convention Against Torture, which in itself might raise suspicions as to the degree of protection accorded to those alleging ill-treatment. The Committee also emphasised that detainees were often kept in unrecorded detention without access to a lawyer or medical assistance and that interrogation methods prohibited by the Convention Against Torture were frequently used (see paragraph 72 above). Amnesty International reported that religious freedom in  was subject to restrictions imposed by State authorities (see paragraph 73 above). Human Rights Watch observed that granting impunity to State officials for acts of rampant torture was a common practice (see paragraph 74 above). The US Department of State also reported frequent use of torture by security officials and pointed out that the State bodies denied unhindered access to independent observers, including employees of the International Committee for the Red Cross, to detention facilities (see paragraph 75 above).",

In those circumstances, the Court will not then insist that the applicant show the existence of further special distinguishing features if to do so would render illusory the protection offered by Article 3 (see Muminov v.

The period that elapsed between the date of the applicant's arrest and the date of issue of the Tajik request for extradition amounts to twenty-four days.
