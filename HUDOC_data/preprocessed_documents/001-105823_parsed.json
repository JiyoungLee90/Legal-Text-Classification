In the questionnaires completed by the defence lawyers, many complaints were made in relation to the refusal by the court to provide copies of documents and video tape recordings to the defendants and lawyers.

In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 161, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7\u00a034, Series A no. 336, and Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000VII). In particular, where an individual, when taken into police custody, is in good health, but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Tomasi v. France, 27 August 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 108-11, Series A no. 241A, and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR\u00a01999V).",

Similarly, the Court notes that, even at the applicants\u2019 own trial, not only the first applicant but also a number of witnesses had complained that they had been ill-treated in detention. Moreover, the Court refers to its earlier judgment concerning a similar complaint made in a separate application by the fourth applicant in the present case (see Mammadov, cited above), in which it found that the applicant had been tortured in the OCD\u2019s detention facility in circumstances similar to those alleged in the present case. All of the above information supports, albeit indirectly, the first applicant\u2019s allegations made in the present case.",

In order for the Court to reach such a finding, the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by appropriate evidence or such evidence should flow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of unrebutted presumptions of fact. However, the Court notes that, unlike, for example, the Mammadov case, where similar allegations of illtreatment were raised (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 18 et seq.), the first applicant had not made a formal complaint of ill-treatment, had not requested a forensic examination as soon as possible after the alleged ill-treatment, and had not provided any explanation as to his failure to do so. It is true that his access to a lawyer was delayed for several days after his arrest, and that this could have prevented him from taking the above steps during that time; however, nothing was done in this connection after the applicant had been able to meet the lawyer. While he lodged a relevant complaint about four months after the alleged ill-treatment, he expressly refused to undergo the forensic examination offered to him. Nor has he submitted to the Court any other evidence confirming the presence of any injuries on his person. No plausible explanation has been offered for his failure to do so. Moreover, despite the first applicant\u2019s arguments to the contrary, it does not appear from the documents in the case file that he ever gave the domestic authorities a detailed and consistent description concerning the method, duration or perpetrators of the alleged ill-treatment or the chronology of the events. On the contrary, it appears that, whenever specifically asked about these matters, each time he refused to provide an answer, confining himself to making general or incomplete statements. Nor has he provided a detailed account of these matters in his submissions to the Court. In the absence of such an account and of any evidence concerning any injuries that the applicant might have sustained, the Court considers that there is insufficient evidence either to prove the first applicant\u2019s allegations beyond reasonable doubt or at least to establish a prima facie case of ill-treatment, in which event the burden of proof would be shifted to the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation.",

In order to comply with this rule, normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged. The Court notes that the application of this rule must make due allowance for the context of the individual case including, among other things, the personal circumstances of the applicant. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66 and 69, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV).",

The applications were properly substantiated with relevant reasoning. Moreover, these applications were joined by all the other applicants, including the second and fourth applicants, in respect of whom the Government did not raise a similar objection, thus implicitly accepting that they had properly raised this issue before the relevant domestic authority.

The Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument concerning the applicant\u2019s alleged failure to lodge a repeated objection in respect of those judges at a later stage of the proceedings. Once the first applicant had raised this objection at the preliminary hearings in accordance with the formal requirements of the domestic law and obtained an unsuccessful outcome, neither the Convention nor the domestic law required him to keep raising the same objection repeatedly before the same court.",

The applicants had the status of accused persons in criminal case no. 80308 from the very beginning of the proceedings. As appears from the Prosecutor General\u2019s decision of 1 March 2004, the only discernible reason offered by the prosecution for severing case no. 80365 from case no. 80308 was to ensure the conclusion of the investigation in respect of those accused whose individual cases were ready for trial and their speedy committal for trial, as it was considered too difficult in practice to hold a single trial for more than one hundred defendants. It was specifically stated in that decision that, by the time case no. 80365 was severed, the prosecution had essentially gathered, in the context of the investigation in criminal case no. 80308, all the evidence necessary to bring the applicants to trial. Accordingly, the Court considers that both Judge Aleskerov and his brother were de facto involved in the same criminal case concerning the same defendants and the same criminal charges, notwithstanding any regrouping of defendants into separate sets of proceedings and formal reassignments of case numbers that had taken place in the meantime.",

While it could be argued that, given that at some point the investigation team consisted of as many as forty-three investigators, the involvement of the judge\u2019s brother in the case had not been substantial, the Court nevertheless notes that he had contributed a share of the work in collecting evidence that his brother, Judge Aleskerov, would subsequently be called upon to examine at the trial. Moreover, at the trial, the judge would be called upon not only to assess the prosecution\u2019s submissions on their merits, but also to examine the defence\u2019s numerous objections and arguments concerning the conduct of the investigation team and the allegedly faulty manner in which the evidence had been collected at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings. In such circumstances, the Court is of the view that the close family ties between a member of a prosecution team and Judge Aleskerov sufficed to objectively justify the applicants\u2019 fears that the judge lacked an appearance of objective impartiality (compare, mutatis mutandis, Micallef v.

Given that Judge Ibayev\u2019s son had never been assigned to work on the applicants\u2019 case, the Court considers that this part of the complaint, if viewed separately, concerns a situation where Judge Ibayev\u2019s link with one of the parties to the proceedings might be seen as too remote to objectively justify any fears of lack of impartiality on his part. However, taking into account the fact that both Judges Aleskerov and Ibayev were members of the same three-judge panel of the  that heard the applicants\u2019 case, the Court considers it inappropriate to view the applicants\u2019 objections in respect of each of these judges independently of each other. The Court considers that, however insignificant and remote the link of Judge Ibayev with the prosecution might have been considered if viewed separately, in the specific context of the present case his situation at least compounded the justified fears mentioned above as to the Assize Court\u2019s lack of impartiality arising from the situation of Judge Aleskerov.",

In this regard, Article 6 may also be relevant before a case is sent for trial and in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with it (see Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 275, and \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2005-IV). The manner in which Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) are applied during the investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings and the facts of the case. Article 6 will normally require that the accused be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer from the initial stages of police interrogation (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, \u00a7 63, Reports 1996I, and \u00d6calan, cited above, \u00a7 131). As the Court has further clarified, in order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently \u201cpractical and effective\u201d, Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction \u2013 whatever its justification \u2013 must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2008-...). Even in cases where an accused person remained silent and was not questioned in detention, a restriction of his or her right to legal assistance from the time of the arrest may fall short of the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention (see Dayanan v. , no. 7377/03, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, ECHR\u00a02009...).",

Having regard to the information available on this matter, the Court cannot speculate on the exact impact which the applicants\u2019 access to a lawyer during that period would have had on the ensuing proceedings and whether the absence of a lawyer during that period irretrievably affected their defence rights. Nevertheless, the Court notes that such a restriction on initial access to legal assistance affected the applicants\u2019 defence rights.",

The Court reiterates that the right to an adversarial trial under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Various ways are conceivable in which national law may meet this requirement. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment on them (see Brandstetter v. , 28 August 1991, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67, Series A no. 211). Article 6 \u00a7 3 (b) guarantees the accused \u201cadequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence\u201d and therefore implies that the substantive defence activity on his behalf may comprise everything which is \u201cnecessary\u201d to prepare the main trial. The accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the possibility of putting all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus of influencing the outcome of the proceedings (see Can v. Austria, no. 9300/81, Commission report of 12\u00a0July 1984, \u00a7 53, Series A no. 96; Connolly v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a027245/95, Commission decision of 26 June 1996; and Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, \u00a7 78, 20\u00a0January 2005). The facilities which everyone charged with a criminal offence should enjoy include the opportunity to acquaint himself for the purposes of preparing his defence with the results of investigations carried out throughout the proceedings (see C.G.P. v. the Netherlands, no. 29835/96, Commission decision of 15 January 1997, and Foucher v. France, 18\u00a0March 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 31-38, Reports 1997-II). The issue of the adequacy of the time and facilities afforded to an accused must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of each particular case.",

Examination of such a large volume of evidence by the defence inevitably required a substantial amount of time (compare \u00d6calan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0142-47). The Government maintained that the defence had been given sufficient time to examine the case file, relying merely on the fact that each of the defence lawyers and applicants had signed a record on familiarisation with the material in the case file without making any remarks as to the inadequacy of the time and facilities afforded to them for doing so. The Court cannot accept this argument. It notes that signing a record on familiarisation with the material in the case file appears to be a procedural formality of minor legal significance, aimed at documenting the fact that the persons concerned have indeed been given access to the case file, but it does not necessarily follow from this that the signing of such a record may somehow attest in any way whether the time and facilities for such access were sufficient or may serve as an unequivocal waiver of any substantive or procedural grievances the defence may have had in connection with the process of consulting the investigation file. Moreover, the Court observes that the lawyers repeatedly complained during the criminal trial that they had not been given adequate time to examine the investigation file to a sufficient extent; some of them even complained that they had been pressured into signing records on familiarisation with material in the case file without having ever been given access to the material at all. Although the Court is not obliged to accept these allegations at face value, it nevertheless considers that the allegations should be given a considerable amount of credit because they were serious, repeatedly made and mutually concordant, and because of the apparent fact that the domestic courts avoided addressing them in any reasonable detail.",

As a notable exception, the Government submitted information as to the schedule of access to the prosecution evidence by one of the second applicant\u2019s lawyers, Mr Karim; however, as the case stands, this information is irrelevant, as Mr Karim was dismissed as the second applicant\u2019s lawyer and did not represent him during the trial.

This Convention provision speaks of \u201cassistance\u201d and not of \u201cnomination\u201d: mere nomination does not ensure effective assistance since a lawyer may be prevented from providing such assistance owing to various practical reasons, or shirk his or her duties. A State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes. However, if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or is sufficiently brought to the authorities\u2019 attention in some other way, the authorities must take steps to ensure that the accused effectively enjoys the right to legal assistance (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7\u00a7 33-37, Series\u00a0A no. 37, and Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, \u00a7 65, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0168). Moreover, where it is clear that the lawyer representing the accused before the domestic court has not had the time and facilities to organise a proper defence, the court should take measures of a positive nature to ensure that the lawyer is given an opportunity to fulfil his obligations in the best possible conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, Goddi v.\u00a0Italy, 9 April 1984, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 76).",

The applicants\u2019 inability to receive effective representation was thus manifest and was brought to the Assize Court\u2019s attention in a clear manner, namely by way of repeated complaints and applications in this regard made by both the applicants and their lawyers and by the very fact of the lawyers\u2019 refusal to take part in the oral submissions.",

The Court considers that such a perfunctory approach to the matter reveals an apparent lack of concern by the domestic court about the effectiveness of legal representation available to the applicants.

As to the defence witnesses, it is true that the Assize Court allowed the examination of only some of the witnesses requested by the defence, but refused to call all of the persons whom the defence sought to examine. While Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention is aimed at ensuring equality in criminal proceedings between the defence and the prosecution as regards the calling and examination of witnesses, it does not give an accused person an unlimited right to obtain the attendance of witnesses in court. The domestic law may thus lay down conditions for the admission and examination of witnesses provided that such conditions are identical for witnesses on both sides. Similarly, the domestic court is free, subject to compliance with the terms of the Convention, to refuse to call witnesses proposed by the defence, for instance on the ground that the court considers their evidence unlikely to assist in ascertaining the truth (see X v.\u00a0Austria, no. 4428/70, Commission decision of 1 June 1972). Having regard to the available material, the Court finds that it has not been clearly shown how any of the witnesses whom the  refused to examine would have been able to assist the applicants\u2019 defence against the specific accusations put forward against them.",

Secondly, having regard to the available material, including the relevant and very detailed reports of highly reputable international organisations and NGOs such as, among others, the OSCE and Human Rights Watch, the Court notes the existence of numerous, consistent and credible allegations of systematic ill-treatment by the law-enforcement authorities of detainees and witnesses questioned in connection with the events of 15 and 16 October 2003. In particular, those reports contain quotations of first-hand accounts by a large number of detained persons concerning their own alleged ill-treatment and ill-treatment that they had witnessed being used against other detainees.

While the Court is not in a position to accept the information contained in those reports as established proof of ill-treatment of the relevant witnesses in the present case or other persons mentioned in those reports, it nevertheless considers that the credibility of their authors and their consistent and detailed nature give rise to a considerable degree of distrust towards the manner in which the domestic authorities dealt with those allegations of ill-treatment in various proceedings, including the Assize Court proceedings in the present case.",

Among other reasons, this is because pre-trial questioning is primarily a process by which the prosecution gather information in preparation for the trial in order to support their case in court, whereas the tribunal conducting the trial is called upon to determine a defendant\u2019s guilt following a fair assessment of all evidence actually produced at the trial, based on the direct examination of evidence in court. Although it is not the Court\u2019s task to verify whether the domestic courts made any substantive errors in that assessment, it is nevertheless required to review whether the courts gave reasons for their decisions in respect of any objections concerning the evidence produced.",

Although the relevant judgments relied on by the Assize Court had acquired legal effect, the Court considers that the decisions reached by other courts in respect of the same or similar submissions by the witnesses could not be said to have a \u201cres judicata effect\u201d in respect of the applicants, or to prevent them from raising the same objections again at their own trial. The Court notes that, in the light of the principle of presumption of innocence and a defendant\u2019s right to challenge any evidence against him or her, a criminal court must conduct a full, independent and comprehensive examination and assessment of the admissibility and reliability of evidence pertaining to the determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt, irrespective of how the same evidence may have been assessed in any other proceedings concerning other defendants. In this connection, it is of particular importance that the applicants in the present case had not been parties to the earlier proceedings referred to by the  and, thus, had been unable to challenge any decisions reached in them concerning any claim or particular issue. Moreover, the witnesses\u2019 submissions in those proceedings were assessed in a context different from that of the applicants\u2019 case. Thus, in those proceedings, where the witnesses themselves were defendants, their allegations of having testified under duress appeared to have been examined for the purposes of establishing the existence of ill-treatment and assessing whether the defendants had made self-incriminating statements under duress. On the other hand, in the applicants\u2019 case the same or similar submissions by the witnesses were relevant for the purpose of assessing the admissibility and probative value of evidence incriminating a third party (the applicants).",

The presumption of innocence enshrined in paragraph 2 of Article 6 is one of the elements of the fair criminal trial that is required by paragraph\u00a01 (see Allenet de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 308). It not only prohibits the premature expression by the tribunal itself of the opinion that the person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d is guilty before he has been so proved according to law (see Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 62), but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041, and Daktaras v. Lithuania, no.\u00a042095/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-43, ECHR 2000-X). The Court stresses that Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 cannot prevent the authorities from informing the public about criminal investigations in progress, but it requires that they do so with all the discretion and circumspection necessary if the presumption of innocence is to be respected (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038).",

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Khuzhin and Others v. Russia, no. 13470/02, \u00a7 94, 23 October 2008, with further references). Whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Butkevi\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2002-II).",

It acknowledges that the gravity of the events of 15 and 16\u00a0October 2003 may have required the authorities to keep the public informed of any criminal proceedings instituted in connection with those events. However, this circumstance cannot justify a lack of caution in the choice of words used in their statements in reference to the accused persons in those proceedings. The statements at issue were made at a time when the criminal investigation in respect of the applicants had just been started. It was particularly important at this initial stage not to make any public allegations which could have been interpreted as confirming the guilt of the applicants in the opinion of a State law-enforcement authority. The Court notes, in particular, that these statements specifically mentioned, among other things, the fourth applicant\u2019s name and also referred to \u201cother\u201d persons unidentified by name, and declared, without any qualification or reservation, that the persons concerned had instigated, and ordered the demonstrators to commit, unlawful actions resulting in mass disorder.",

From the content and rhetoric of those statements, it is evident that their primary purpose was to express political criticism and condemnation of the political opposition and the violent actions attributed to it. Seeing that the authors of the statements were high-ranking functionaries of the law-enforcement authorities and not politicians, their statements, which were made in their official capacity, could not be considered part of a legitimate political debate, which might arguably allow a certain degree of exaggeration and liberal use of value judgments with reference to political rivals.",

Thus, at their core, the events would concern the exercise of the freedom of assembly, one of the fundamental freedoms serving as the foundation of a democratic society. The Court reiterates that the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that a person ought not to be subjected to a sanction for participation in a demonstration which has not been prohibited, so long as this person does not himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, \u00a7 53, Series A no. 202). Furthermore, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no.\u00a074552/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a038-42, ECHR 2006XIII).

The Court has already found that the criminal proceedings in the present case did not comply with the required guarantees of fairness. Furthermore, the applicants\u2019 submissions in respect of the complaint under Article 11, as declared admissible, are essentially the same as under Article 6.",
