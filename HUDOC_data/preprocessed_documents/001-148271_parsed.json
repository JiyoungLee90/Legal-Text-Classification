In the Court\u2019s view, the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d extends to aspects relating to personal identity and a person\u2019s sex is an inherent part of his or her identity. Thus, a measure as drastic as a dismissal from a post on the sole ground of sex has adverse effects on a person\u2019s identity, self-perception and self-respect and, as a result, his or her private life. The Court therefore considers that the applicant\u2019s dismissal on the sole ground of her sex constituted an interference with her right to respect for her private life (see, mutatis mutandis, Smith and Grady v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7 71, ECHR 1999VI). Besides, the applicant\u2019s dismissal had an impact on her \u201cinner circle\u201d as the loss of her job must have had tangible consequences for the material well-being of her and her family (see Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, \u00a7 166). The applicant must also have suffered distress and anxiety on account of the loss of her post. What is more, the applicant\u2019s dismissal affected a wide range of her relationships with other people, including those of a professional nature and her ability to practise a profession which corresponded to her qualifications (see\u00a0Sidabras and D\u017eiautas, cited above, \u00a7 48; Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, \u00a7 166; and \u0130hsan Ay, cited above, \u00a7 31).

The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background to the case (see \u00dcnal Tekeli, cited above, \u00a7 52), but the final decision as to observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court (see Kafkaris v.

Where a difference of treatment is based on sex, the margin of appreciation afforded to the State is narrow and in such situations the principle of proportionality does not merely require that the measure chosen should in general be suited to the fulfilment of the aim pursued, but it must also be shown that it was necessary in the circumstances. The Court further reiterates that the advancement of gender equality is today a major goal in the member States of the Council of Europe and very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before such a difference of treatment could be regarded as compatible with the Convention (see Konstantin Markin v.

These explanations were also submitted by the human resources department of the same branch to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (see paragraph 7 above). The Court observes in this connection that the main consideration in these explanations is that the activities of security officers carried certain risks and responsibilities as the security officers had to work at nights in rural areas and since they had to use firearms and physical force in case of an attack on the premises they were guarding. It appears that the administrative authorities considered that women were unable to face those risks and assume such responsibilities. There is, however, no explanation in the submissions of the administrative authorities or the Government as to this purported inability. What is more, the decisions of the Twelfth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court did not contain any assessment of those considerations on the part of the administration.

In this connection, the Court observes that it is not disputed that the applicant had a right, according to the domestic law, to apply for the post of security officer and that there was a genuine and serious \u201cdispute\u201d (\u201ccontestation\u201d in the French text) within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. The Court further observes that the applicant clearly had access to a court in order to challenge the lawfulness of her dismissal from the post of security officer. As a result, the applicant had the right to challenge before the domestic courts the administrative decisions. The domestic courts examined the merits of the applicant\u2019s appeals and in so doing they determined the dispute over her rights.

The Court further notes that, although it is not directly accessible to plaintiffs, according to Article 39 of the Supreme Administrative Court Act (Law\u00a0no.\u00a02575), in cases where there is inconsistency between a decision of a division of the Supreme Administrative Court and the General Assembly of Administrative Proceedings Divisions, the Assembly for the Unification of Conflicting Case-Law renders a legally binding decision settling the conflict of case-law. Taking these aspects into consideration, the Court finds no reason to further examine whether the aforementioned provision for overcoming the judicial inconsistencies could have been applied in the instant case and to what effect (see, mutatis mutandis, Ari\u015fanu v. Romania (dec.), no.\u00a017436/09, 28 January 2014). In these circumstances and bearing in mind that it is not the Court\u2019s function to compare different decisions of national courts, even if given in similar proceedings, the Court considers that the difference of interpretation between the Twelfth Division and the General Assembly of Administrative Proceedings Divisions does not, in itself, constitute a violation of Article 6 of the Convention.",

Although Article 6 \u00a7 1 obliges courts to give reasons for their decisions, it cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument. Thus, in dismissing an appeal, an appellate court may, in principle, simply endorse the reasons for the lower court\u2019s decision (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.

(see paragraph\u00a021 above). Moreover, in its decision dated 12 February 2008, the Twelfth Division cited the text of the decision rendered by the General Assembly of Administrative Proceedings Divisions on 6 December 2007 with regard to R.B. (see paragraph 23 above). The Twelfth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court, however, did not consider the applicant\u2019s submissions or the decision of 6 December 2007 and simply endorsed the Ankara Administrative Court\u2019s judgment. Although such a technique of reasoning by an appellate court is, in principle, acceptable, in the circumstances of the present case, it failed to satisfy the requirements of a fair hearing. Following the administrative court\u2019s judgment and prior to the examination of the applicant\u2019s appeal, the General Assembly of Administrative Proceedings Divisions had rendered a decision which was in conflict with the administrative court\u2019s judgment. In the Court\u2019s opinion, under those circumstances, the applicant\u2019s submissions regarding the case of R.B. required an adequate response by the Twelfth Division. In addition, the applicant\u2019s request for rectification of the decision containing an explicit reference to the decision of 6\u00a0December 2007 was also dismissed by the Twelfth Division without any reasoning (see paragraph 25 above). The Court therefore considers that the Twelfth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court failed to fulfil its duty to provide adequate reasoning for its decisions.",

It found that it would thus be too restrictive to limit this notion to an \u201cinner circle\u201d in which the individual could live his own personal life as he chose and to entirely exclude therefrom the outside world not encompassed within that circle (ibid., \u00a7 109). The Grand Chamber thus stated that there was no reason of principle why the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d should be taken to exclude professional activities. On this basis, the Court held that Article 8 might be applicable where a civil servant had been dismissed if a concrete examination of the applicant\u2019s situation established that (1) the dismissal had \u201crepercussions on the manner in which he or she construct[ed] his or her social identity by developing relationships with others\u201d, or that (2) \u201cfactors relating to private life, in the strict sense of the term, [were] regarded as qualifying criteria for a given profession\u201d (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0110).",

In paragraph 44 of the judgment, the majority thus conclude, firstly, that a measure \u201cas drastic as a dismissal from a post on the sole ground of sex has adverse effects on a person\u2019s identity, self-perception and self-respect, and, as a result, his or her private life\u201d, and that \u201cthe applicant\u2019s dismissal on the sole ground of her sex [therefore] constituted an interference with her right to respect for her private life\u201d.",

If dismissal on the sole ground of sex is sufficient, in and of itself, for the measure to constitute an interference with the civil servant\u2019s private life, does that interpretation not, in substance, make Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 redundant in this context? I fail to see the difference.",

Lastly, they state in the same paragraph, in their findings on the applicability of Article 8, that the applicant \u201cmust have suffered distress and anxiety on account of the loss of her post. What is more, the applicant\u2019s dismissal affected a wide range of her relationships with other people, including those of a professional nature and her ability to practise a profession which corresponded to her qualifications\u201d.",
