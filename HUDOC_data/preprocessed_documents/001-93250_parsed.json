For the fulfilment of potential obligations arising from the warranty, the Agency was obliged to maintain in the State\u2019s bank account the sum of EEK 50,000,000 (EUR\u00a03,195,000) until the grounds for claims regarding the warranty had ceased to exist, but in any case not for longer than seven years. The maximum potential State liability under this warranty was EEK\u00a0100,000,000 (EUR\u00a06,390,000). The parties considered the possible direct damage covered by this warranty to be debts relating to the privatised property outside the scope of privatisation, as described in section 10(5) of the Privatisation Act. The State was entitled at its sole discretion and upon notice to BRS but at the latest by 29 June 2001 to withdraw this warranty, to withdraw from the privatisation agreement and to terminate it.",

It was stated in the memorandum that broad and vague definitions of the necessary elements of offences were in conflict with the general principle of legal certainty and the nulla poena sine lege principle laid down in the Constitution (Articles 13 \u00a7 2 and 23, respectively). It was reiterated that it had to be sufficiently clear to a person what kind of (lawful) conduct was expected from him or her and which circumstances determined his or her liability. Reference was also made to the interpretation of Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the Convention by the European Court of Human Rights, according to which the necessary elements of a criminal offence had to be clearly defined in law (see Veeber v. Estonia (no.\u00a02), no.\u00a045771/99, \u00a7\u00a031, ECHR 2003I).",

Hence, at the time of committing the act it might not be possible to predict with sufficient certainty whether the particular misuse of official position resulting in non-pecuniary damage was punishable as a criminal offence or not. Thus, according to the memorandum, it could be concluded that in the case of a vague definition of an offence, there was a risk that damage might be deemed to be caused merely on the ground that a breach of regulations had been committed, and this, in principle, made it possible to bring charges against an official for any kind of misuse of office.

The criminal case concerned charges against a person who held an official position in a public limited company. The Criminal Law Chamber noted that in its earlier case-law it had explicitly accepted that non-pecuniary damage could be caused to legal persons in public law, first and foremost to the State (including a specific government agency) and to local government bodies. However, according to the case-law of the Civil Law Chamber of the Supreme Court, a legal person could not claim compensation for non-pecuniary damage.

It referred to a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in which the Court had found that an offence had to be clearly defined in law and that this requirement was satisfied where the individual could know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation of it, what acts and omissions would make him criminally liable (see Veeber (no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7\u00a031). The Criminal Law Chamber noted that criminal liability for misuse of an official position under Article 161 of the Criminal Code was dependent on whether the damage caused was \u201csignificant\u201d. While there existed criteria to assess whether the pecuniary damage was \u201csignificant\u201d, there were no objective criteria to determine the extent of non-pecuniary damage. The latter was expressed in the opinion of the court, for the purposes of which the court would consider the general principles of law, the level of society\u2019s general welfare and case-law.",

There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, mutatis mutandis, Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, \u00a7\u00a049, Series A no. 30, and Kokkinakis, cited above, \u00a7 40). The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain (see, mutatis mutandis, Cantoni v. , 15 November 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V).

The Court is aware of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 6\u00a0June 2000 (see paragraph 82 above) in which the Supreme Court attached importance to the creation of danger as damage. However, it notes that no criteria had been developed for assessing such a risk. Moreover, in the present case the applicant actually acted under an obligation to conduct the privatisation of ER, having to balance risks relating to proceeding with the privatisation against those relating to withdrawal from the agreement.

Indeed, the applicant\u2019s attempt to adduce evidence showing that the reputation of the State had not been damaged was turned down by the courts. It appears that the fact of an alleged violation of law by the applicant in itself served as an irrebuttable presumption that he had caused moral damage to the interests of the State. So broad an interpretation could, in principle, render any breach of law a criminal offence within the meaning of Article 161. Moreover, any such moral damage would have to be qualified as \u201csignificant\u201d. The Court takes note in this context of the attempts in the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law to lay down criteria for an assessment whether there existed in a given case any non-pecuniary damage and whether this damage was \u201cordinary, significant or large-scale\u201d (see paragraph 80 and the following, above). However, in the Court\u2019s view, the criteria used by the domestic courts in the present case to establish that the applicant had caused \u201csignificant\u201d non-pecuniary damage \u2013 that he had been a high-ranking state official who had been working in a field attracting great public interest and that his acts had been incompatible with \u201cthe general sense of justice\u201d \u2013 were too vague.
