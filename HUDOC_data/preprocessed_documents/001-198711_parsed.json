The prison governor had also not been informed of the incident and the applicant had not been examined by a doctor. The Ombudsman listed numerous injuries all over the applicant\u2019s body, including his head, face, chest, back, shoulders and his limbs, and concluded that the extent of those injuries, as well as the manner in which they had been inflicted, including by means of a rubber truncheon, meant that the applicant had indeed been ill-treated by the prison guards on 24 December 2011, as alleged. The prison doctor, for his part, agreed that the applicant\u2019s injuries established during the visit of the Ombudsman\u2019s team were more extensive than the ones which he had noted on 22 December 2011. In view of the above, the Ombudsman recommended, inter alia, that the prison investigate the events of 24\u00a0December 2011 in order to identify and hold responsible the individuals who had abused the applicant.",

It further found that the applicant had been subjected to inhuman treatment in respect of all four incidents and that as regards the incidents of 11 June 2007, 18 December 2009 and 22 December 2011, in particular, the force used against him had been justified but excessive. While this treatment, according to the Constitutional Court, had caused the applicant serious suffering, there was no proof that the prison guards had intended to inflict it upon him in order to achieve a certain goal within the meaning of the caselaw of the European Court of Human Rights (see, for example, Aksoy v.\u00a0Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 63 and 64, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, as one of the judgments specifically cited by the Constitutional Court in the general principles part of its decision). The Constitutional Court furthermore held that the relevant authorities had also failed to carry out an effective investigation in respect of the said four incidents. Regarding the incident of 24 December 2011 only, the Constitutional Court ordered that the official investigation be expedited. It further explained that in awarding compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant it had taken into account its own practice in other similar cases, the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, the \u201csocial circumstances\u201d in Serbia itself, and the \u201cvery essence\u201d (sama su\u0161tina) of \u201ccompensation for non-pecuniary harm\u201d as such.

These are clearly high risk situations insofar as the possible ill-treatment of prisoners is concerned, and as such they call for specific safeguards. In particular, a record should be kept of every instance of resort to \u201ccoercive means\u201d against prisoners. Moreover, physical force and means of restraint should never be applied as a punishment. A prisoner against whom any means of force have been used should have the right to be immediately examined and, if necessary, treated by a medical doctor. The results of the examination (including any relevant statements by the prisoner and the doctor\u2019s conclusions) should be formally recorded and made available to the prisoner, who in addition should be entitled, if he so wishes, to undergo a forensic medical examination. The CPT recommends that the Serbian authorities take steps to bring the practice in line with the above considerations. In this context, it is also important to ensure that prosecutors and the Ministry of Justice\u2019s Inspectorate are systematically notified of any use of physical force and \u201ccoercive means\u201d by prison staff, and that they be particularly vigilant when examining such cases.",

Consequently, a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him or her of his or her status as a \u201cvictim\u201d. In respect of complaints under Article 3, such as the ones here at issue, the national authorities have to: (i)\u00a0acknowledge the breach of the Convention, either expressly or in substance (see, among other authorities, Murray v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 10511/10, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2016, with further references); (ii) afford redress, or at least provide a person with the possibility of applying for and obtaining compensation for the damage sustained as a result of the ill-treatment in question (see Shestopalov v. Russia, no. 46248/07, \u00a7 56, 28\u00a0March 2017, and Gjini v. Serbia, no. 1128/16, \u00a7 54, 15\u00a0January 2019); and (iii) conduct a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible.\u00a0A breach of Article 3 cannot therefore, in the Court\u2019s view, be remedied only by an award of compensation to the victim because, if the authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of wilful ill-treatment by State agents to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough to prosecute and punish those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity. The general legal prohibition on torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, despite its fundamental importance, would thus be ineffective in practice (see Vladimir Romanov v. Russia, no. 41461/02, \u00a7 78, 24 July 2008, and G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7\u00a7 116 and 119, ECHR 2010). That is why awarding compensation to the applicant for the damage which he or she sustained as a result of the illtreatment is only part of the overall action required (see Cestaro v.\u00a0Italy, no. 6884/11, \u00a7\u00a0231, 7 April 2015). The fact that domestic authorities may not have carried out an effective investigation would, however, be decisive for the purposes of the assessment of an applicant\u2019s victim status (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0229, see also Shestopalov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056).",

It did not, however, find that the applicant had been subjected to torture as alleged. Furthermore, the award in the amount of EUR 1,000, in view of the principles set out in the case of Shestopalov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 58-63), and more recently in Artur\u00a0Ivanov v. Russia (no. 62798/09, \u00a7 19, 5 June 2018), appears to be substantially less than the award the Court itself would have made, given a finding of a violation of the magnitude claimed (see, mutatis mutandis, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0202-216, ECHR 2006V).

France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 95, ECHR\u00a01999-V). The Court has confirmed that even in the most difficult circumstances, such as the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the conduct of the person concerned (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, \u00a7 79, Reports 1996-V, and Labita v.

The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a088; Price v. the United Kingdom, no..33394/96, \u00a7\u00a024, ECHR 2001-VII; and Jalloh v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a054810/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 11\u00a0July 2006). Treatment has been held to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering (see\u00a0Labita, cited above, \u00a7 120).

Any recourse to physical force in respect of a person deprived of his or her liberty which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is an infringement of the rights set forth in Article 3 of the Convention (see Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no.\u00a023380/09, \u00a7\u00a7 100 and 101, ECHR 2015). The Court is, of course, mindful of the potential for violence that exists in penal institutions (see G\u00f6mi and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a035962/97, \u00a7 77, 21 December 2006). It accepts therefore that the use of force may be necessary on occasion to ensure prison security, to maintain order or prevent crime. Nevertheless, such force may be used only if indispensable and must not be excessive (see Vladimir Romanov v.

However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events at issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of individuals within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000-VII). Whilst it is not, in principle, the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts, the Court is nevertheless not bound by the domestic courts\u2019 findings in this regard (see, for example, Habimi, cited above, \u00a7 87).",

In these circumstances and in view of the extensively documented facts of the present case the Court finds that it has been established that the applicant had suffered ill-treatment at the hands of State agents, specifically \u201cinhuman treatment\u201d as characterised by the Constitutional Court. Apart from the applicant\u2019s own accounts in this regard, however, the Court is of the opinion that there is insufficient evidence for it to conclude that the applicant had indeed been \u201cdeliberately\u201d abused in order to cause him \u201cvery serious and cruel suffering\u201d, which would have amounted to \u201ctorture\u201d within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. Indeed, the Constitutional Court itself had opined that the use of force against the applicant on 11 June 2007, 18\u00a0December 2009 and 22 December 2011 had been justified but excessive. As regards the incident of 24\u00a0December 2011, while it is true that the Ombudsman\u2019s report of 31 January 2012 had described it as amounting to \u201ctorture\u201d, the Court cannot but note that this conclusion was again essentially based on the applicant\u2019s own accounts of what had happened and the severity of the injuries sustained by him on that occasion. The Ombudsman\u2019s team did not, therefore, manage to uncover other evidence regarding the context, the reasons and/or the intent which may have warranted the initial use of force by the prison guards, however excessive this ultimately turned out to be.",

Furthermore, the investigation must be prompt and independent. Lastly, it must afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny to secure accountability. While the degree of public scrutiny required may vary, the complainant must be afforded effective access to the investigatory procedure in all cases (see, for example, Krsmanovi\u0107 v. Serbia, no. 19796/14, \u00a7 74, 19 December 2017, and Gjini, cited above, \u00a7 95, as well as the authorities cited therein).",

In respect of the procedural aspect, it further found that the relevant authorities had failed to carry out an effective investigation in respect of the said four incidents and ordered \u2013 albeit regarding the incident of 24 December 2011 only \u2013 that the ongoing official investigation be expedited (see paragraph 36 above). There was hence, the Court would agree, never a criminal or another proper official investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of the applicant\u2019s abusers regarding the incidents of 11 June 2007, 18\u00a0December 2009 and 22 December 2011, despite his credible allegations to the effect that he had been ill-treated by State agents. With respect to the incident of 24\u00a0December 2011, the Court also sees no reason, in view of the known facts of the case, to disagree with the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding of a procedural breach of Article 3, particularly in view of: (i) the notable and unjustifiable lapse of time between some of the investigative steps taken (see, for example, paragraphs 38 and 39 above); (ii) the overall duration of the investigation in question, which started on 14 March 2012 at the latest (see paragraph 25 above) and was still pending as of 4 July 2016 (see paragraph 44 above), having thus lasted, by that time, for a period of some four years and three months in all; (iii) the unnecessarily repetitive nature of some of the those steps (see paragraphs 23-34 and 38-44 above); (iv) the failure by the relevant authorities to attempt to carry out an exercise to allow the applicant to identify the prison guards despite the applicant\u2019s repeated and ostensibly reasonable proposals in that connection (see paragraphs 30, 38, 41 and 43 above); and (v) the lack of transparency in terms of where, when and why video footage may or may not have been available (see and compare the availability of video footage referred to in paragraphs 23 and 28 above). It is lastly the case that the domestic authorities had thus also failed to conduct an effective and meaningful investigation even after the adoption of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 10 July 2013 (see paragraphs 38-44 above).",
