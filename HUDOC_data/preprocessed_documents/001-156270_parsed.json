They further submitted that the right of access to a lawyer was an essential safeguard which enabled the exercise of other rights, including the right to remain silent, the exercise of which depended on the adequate provision of information about the right. Many suspects faced serious challenges in exercising that right across the European Union and as a result the EU had adopted directives enshrining the right to information and the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings, placing safeguards around waivers and imposing a broad remedial duty on courts (see section \u201cRelevant European texts\u201d above). The Court should adopt a scrupulous approach to the questions of whether any waiver of the right of access to a lawyer and the right to remain silent had been effective and whether there had been any failure on the part of the national courts to take due account of any prejudice arising from any possible restriction of those rights, taking into account recent EU legislation.",

In that regard, the Court notes that in both of the classifications in question, the applicants\u2019 offence essentially consisted of the same elements, save for the fact that in its particularly serious form it had to have been perpetrated against at least three persons. That relatively small distinction, however, had grave consequences in terms of the applicable penalty, the ordinary offence being punishable by imprisonment for a term of four to ten years, while the serious offence attracted a prison sentence of ten to fifteen years (see paragraphs 7 and 32 above).",
