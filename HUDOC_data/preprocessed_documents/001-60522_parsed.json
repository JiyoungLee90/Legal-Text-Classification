Mrs Saleh left Bulgaria with the children in June 2000, a year after the deportation of her husband, and settled in Jordan, where she has close relatives. Mr AlNashif himself has close relatives in Syria, has a Syrian stateless person's identity document and, when entering Bulgaria in 1992, declared Syria as his country of residence.
