Those principles indicate, in particular, that the investigation into serious allegations of ill-treatment must be both prompt and thorough, and authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard.",

The only viable means for the Central Investigation Office to obtain certainty on this point would have been to hear the testimony of the police officers present during his questioning (A and B), of the escort officers accompanying the applicant during his transfer in an outside the prison facilities (C, D, E, G, H and I), and of the medical staff who examined the applicant before his readmission (F, the three members of the medical staff mentioned in paragraph 21 above and the prison doctor).",

At this point most of the witnesses no longer had any recollection whatsoever of the events and could not even recognise the applicant from a photo. Even those officers on duty who had been with the applicant for an extended time could not recall the exact details of his transfer. This was mainly so, according to the witnesses\u2019 own assessment, because they had been responsible for the admission, transfer and examination of a large number of detainees on a daily basis, making it impossible to distinguish cases after a certain lapse of time. The witnesses could therefore only reply to the investigation authorities\u2019 questions in a general manner or theoretically, without an actual link to the present case. For the Court, the delay in questioning the witnesses significantly tainted the official investigation being pursued by the State authorities, which was not redressed by the fact that they were ultimately heard in the course of the investigations.",
