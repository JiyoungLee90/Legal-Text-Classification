In particular, the court acknowledged that the parties had agreed, on 19 November 1998, that the value of the dispute should be 50,000 new dinars, but observed that there was no separate Municipal Court\u2019s decision to this effect in the case file. Therefore, the relevant amount was the 4,000,000 old dinars, as stated in the plaintiff\u2019s original claim, which was clearly less than the 15,000 new dinars threshold under the relevant civil procedure rules (see paragraphs 20 and 21 below). Lastly, implicitly relying on its Opinion of 22 May 2001, the Supreme Court noted that the Government\u2019s Decree of 24 January 1994 had provided that until 22\u00a0July 1994 both old and new dinars would be valid legal tender based on the ratio that one new dinar was worth twelve thousand old dinars. The \u201cplaintiff\u201d himself, however, had \u201cnot amended the value of the dispute in new dinars\u201d by 22 July 1994 (see paragraph 19 below).",

It was, rather, a legitimate and reasonable procedural requirement having regard to the very essence of the Supreme Court\u2019s role, i.e. to deal only with matters of the requisite significance. Further, as provided in Article 392 of the Civil Procedure Act 1977, the Supreme Court was fully entitled to reject any appeal on points of law which it deemed inadmissible (see paragraph 17 above). Indeed, as correctly noted by the Government, the Supreme Court was thus not bound by the lower courts\u2019 mere reference to the amount of 50,000 new dinars as the value of the dispute in question. Finally, the Supreme Court implicitly based the impugned decision on its prior binding opinion concerning the redenomination of the Serbian currency, including the deadline not complied with by the applicants (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above). In such circumstances, the Court does not find any reason to believe that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the present case was arbitrary.",

In several other cases the Court concluded that whenever the domestic courts applied a certain admissibility requirement in too formalistic a way, this would amount to a disproportionate restriction of the right of access to a court (see Stone Court Shipping Company, S.A. v. , no. 55524/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a036-43, 28 October 2003; Bulena v. the , no. 57567/00, \u00a7\u00a035, 20 April 2004; Kadlec and Others v. the , no.\u00a049478/99, \u00a7\u00a7 26-30, 25 May 2004; and Boulougouras v. , no.\u00a066294/01, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27, 27 May 2004). On another occasion the Commission also stated that the rejection of a petition for review (cassation) violated the right of access if that rejection was the result of an omission on the part of the domestic courts (see Dimova v. Bulgaria, no. 31806/96, Commission\u2019s report of 21 October 1998). The formalistic requirement of a separate ruling on the value of the claim, which had already been provided by the lower courts\u2019 judgments, deprived the applicants in the present case of the right to lodge a second appeal with the Supreme Court. That is what in our opinion constitutes a violation of Article 6 in this case.",
