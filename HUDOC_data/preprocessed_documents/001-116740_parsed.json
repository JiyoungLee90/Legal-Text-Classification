The excerpt from the medical record submitted by the applicant was silent on whether her eye condition required any urgent medical intervention, as well as on the doctors\u2019 recommendations or prescriptions in respect of her ailments, and also said nothing about whether her health had deteriorated, and if so whether this was connected to any defects in her previous treatment.",

The Government also noted that in their cooperation with the Kazakhstani authorities in extradition matters they had never been faced with a failure on the authorities\u2019 part to comply with their assurances. The Government particularly stressed that, whilst the President of Kazakhstan had made several statements concerning Mr\u00a0Ablyazov, in none of them did he mention the applicant.",

The establishment of that responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of the situation in the requesting country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention. Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the requesting country, whether under general international law, the Convention or otherwise. In so far as any responsibility under the Convention is or may be incurred, it is responsibility incurred by the extraditing Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which has as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed illtreatment (see Mamatkulov and Askarov v.

Italy [GC], no.\u00a037201/06, \u00a7 128, ECHR 2008). Since the nature of the Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under Article 3 in cases of this kind lies in the act of exposing an individual to the risk of ill-treatment, the existence of the risk must be assessed primarily with reference to those facts which were known or ought to have been known to the Contracting State at the time of the extradition (see Cruz Varas and Others v.

In the last round of proceedings, after examining those materials, as well as the information and documents collected during the extradition check conducted by the Russian GPO, the domestic courts dismissed the applicant\u2019s arguments concerning the risk of ill-treatment because of the alleged political motivation for her criminal prosecution and because of the alleged threats against her by Kazakhstani officials in Kazakhstan and while she was in detention in Russia as unfounded, and those concerning statements by State officials as unconvincing. They further pointed out that her state of health was not such as to bar her extradition, and in dismissing her claims they also referred to the assurances given by the Kazakhstani authorities, which they considered to be wide-ranging and to have been issued by bodies with the authority to do so (see paragraphs\u00a052-55 above).",

Bearing in mind this assessment of the situation, and whilst not underestimating the seriousness of the concerns expressed by such authoritative sources as, for instance, the UN Committee Against Torture and the UN Human Rights Committee, the Court nonetheless reiterates that it has consistently emphasised that reference to a general problem concerning human rights observance in a particular country is normally insufficient to bar extradition (see Kamyshev v. Ukraine, no. 3990/06, \u00a7 44, 20 May 2010, and Shakurov v. Russia, no.\u00a055822/10, \u00a7 135, 5 June 2012).",

In this respect the Court reiterates that diplomatic assurances are not in themselves sufficient to ensure adequate protection against the risk of ill-treatment, and there is an obligation to examine whether they provide, in their practical application, that the applicant has protection against any such risk (see Othman (Abu\u00a0Qatada) v. the , no. 8139/09, \u00a7\u00a0187, 17 January 2012).",

In the present case the Court is inclined to consider that the assurances given by the Kazakhstani authorities were more of a general nature (compare, for example, Klein v. , no.\u00a024268/08, \u00a7 55, 1 April 2010). Moreover, whilst they contained a statement to the effect that competent Russian authorities would be allowed access to the applicant during the criminal proceedings against her, the Government failed to elaborate on that point and did not indicate if there existed any specific mechanisms \u2013 either diplomatic or monitoring \u2013 by which compliance with those undertakings could be objectively checked (see, by contrast, Othman (Abu Qatada), cited\u00a0above, \u00a7\u00a7 199, 203-204). Their vague reference to the fact that they had not encountered any problems in their previous cooperation with Kazakhstan in similar matters (see paragraph 179 above) is not sufficient for the Court to dispel doubts about those assurances. In sum, it is not ready to give any particular weight to these statements in the present case (see Kozhayev v. , no. 60045/10, \u00a7 84, 5 June 2012).",

The Court also does not consider, contrary to the applicant\u2019s submission, that the fact that she had replaced Mr Ablyazov as the head of a private company previously founded by him can be regarded as indicating that they were together in terms of any political involvement. The Court is therefore not persuaded that the impugned statement by Mr Nazarbayev can be regarded as indicative of a personal risk for the applicant of being subjected to treatment in breach of Article 3 (see, by contrast, Klein, cited above, \u00a7 54, where the Court accepted that the statement by the Vice-President of Colombia, addressed specifically to the applicant and saying that the latter should \u201crot in jail\u201d could be regarded as an indication that the applicant ran a serious risk of being subjected to ill-treatment while in detention). The Court is likewise not convinced that the statement by the representatives of the Kazakhstani GPO during the media briefing concerning the criminal proceedings for misappropriation of BTA Bank property can be regarded as a factor substantiating the alleged risk of ill-treatment for the applicant (see paragraph 22 above).",

It notes at the same time that neither that report nor any other resources made available to the Court contain any references to allegations of ill-treatment or torture or the risk of such treatment against former BTA employees either suspected of fraud or standing trial or having already been convicted on those fraud charges, nor do they suggest that people who have enjoyed \u201ca relationship of trust\u201d with Mr Ablyazov are at particular risk of torture or ill-treatment. Against this background, and bearing in mind the principles enunciated in paragraph 196 above, the Court is not convinced that the labelling by Freedom House of the criminal proceedings against the former BTA management as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d is in itself indicative of a risk specifically for the applicant of being subjected to torture, as alleged by her (see, by contrast, Muminov v. , no.\u00a042502/06, \u00a7 95, 11 December 2008, and compare with Y.P. and L.P. v.\u00a0France, no. 32476/06, \u00a7\u00a7 71-72, 2\u00a0September 2010).

The decision to remove an alien who is suffering from a serious mental or physical illness to a country where the facilities for treatment of that illness are inferior to those available in the Contracting State may raise an issue under Article 3, but only in a very exceptional case, where there are compelling humanitarian grounds against the removal (see N. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a026565/05, \u00a7\u00a042, 27 May 2008).",

In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the \u201cquality of the law\u201d, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. \u201cQuality of law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Nasrulloyev, cited above, \u00a7 71, 11 October 2007, with further references).",

It refers back to domestic law, providing that the requested party should apply its national legislation when executing a request for legal assistance, including a special request for arrest pending the receipt of an extradition request mentioned in its Article\u00a061 (see paragraphs 150 and 151 above). Accordingly, Article 61 of the Minsk Convention can serve as a legal basis for detention only in conjunction with corresponding domestic legal provisions establishing the grounds and the procedure for ordering detention, as well as applicable time-limits (see the Constitutional Court decision cited in paragraph 160 above). However, neither the prosecutor in his decision nor the Government referred to any provision in the domestic law which would have authorised the former authority to place the applicant in custody pending the receipt of an extradition request. Accordingly, from 3 to 8 July 2009 the applicant was in a legal vacuum that was not covered by any domestic legal provision clearly establishing the grounds of her detention and the procedure and time-limits applicable to that detention pending the extradition request.",

Nor does it set any time-limits on detention pending extradition.

Although it is not always necessary for an Article 5 \u00a7 4 procedure to be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the type of deprivation of liberty in question (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7\u00a0203, ECHR 2009). The proceedings must be adversarial in nature and ensure equality of arms (see Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999 II). It is essential that the person concerned should have access to court and the opportunity to be heard either in person or, where necessary, through some form of representation (see, among others, Niedba\u0142a v.

The Court observes that in the present case both the applicant\u2019s privately appointed counsel chose to leave before the judge had started examining the applicant\u2019s case. Whilst the Court is mindful of the fact that the hearing began late, which in itself may be open to criticism, it is nonetheless not convinced that the delay was extraordinary long and that the respondent Government should be held responsible for the applicant\u2019s lawyers\u2019 conduct, particularly having regard to their reasons for leaving, as cited in their statements to the District Court, namely that they \u201ccould not waste their time waiting\u201d (see paragraph 126 above). It furthermore does not find any specific circumstances in the present case which could have adversely affected the applicant\u2019s ability to present her case at the hearing of 16\u00a0September 2009 (see, by contrast, Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 88-91).

Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention. However, where domestic law provides for an appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, for instance as concerns the speediness of the review in appeal proceedings. Accordingly, in order to determine whether the requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d has been complied with, it is necessary to effect an overall assessment where the proceedings have been conducted at more than one level of jurisdiction (see Mooren v.\u00a0 [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7 106, 9\u00a0July 2009).

In order to constitute such a \u201ccourt\u201d an authority must provide the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty (see ibid.), and the review should be wide enough to bear on those conditions which are essential for the \u201clawful\u201d detention of a person according to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see E. v. Norway, 29 August 1990, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 181A). The Court has specifically and consistently emphasised that the reviewing \u201ccourt\u201d must not have merely advisory functions, but must have the competence to \u201cdecide\u201d the \u201clawfulness\u201d of the detention and to order release if the detention is unlawful (see, among many other authorities, A. and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0202; Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 200, Series A no.\u00a025; Chahal, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0130; and more recently, Soliyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a052, and Rustamov, cited above, \u00a7 175).",
