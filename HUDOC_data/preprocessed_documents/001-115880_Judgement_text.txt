The case originated in an application (no. 13620/10) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Albanian national, Mr Lek Tushaj (“the applicant”), on 6 March 2010.
The applicant was represented by Ms E. Kokona and Ms E. Meli, lawyers practising in Tirana. The Albanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms L. Mandia of the State Advocate’s Office.
On 11 July 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in .
Further to the applicant’s dismissal, on 19 January 2007 the Civil Service Commission (“CSC”) ordered his employer, the Prime Minister’s Office, to reinstate him. No award of salary arrears was made.
On 14 December 2007 the Supreme Court rejected the employer’s appeal and the CSC decision became final.
On 27 February 2008 an enforcement writ was issued.
On 28 March 2008 an appointment order was issued by the Department of Public Administration. However, the applicant was prevented by his employer from taking up his functions.
On 12 April, 28 May and 15 July 2008 the applicant unsuccessfully requested his employer to comply with the appointment order.
On 15 May and 25 June 2006 the People’s Advocate Office (“Ombudsperson”) unsuccessfully requested information from the applicant’s employer about compliance with the appointment order.
On 12 February 2010 the Ombudsperson recommended the applicant’s employer to comply with the appointment order.
On 20 April 2010 the applicant tendered his resignation.
On an unspecified date in 2009, having regard to the fact that the applicant had not been able to resume his work, he sought the payment of salary arrears before the domestic court.
By final decision of 2 July 2009 the Supreme Court upheld the lower court’s decision declaring the case outside its jurisdiction, on the grounds that the action should have been lodged with the CSC.
On 10 March 2010, following the applicant’s request, the CSC accepted his claim. It ordered his employer to pay the applicant’s salary arrears starting from 28 March 2008.
It would appear that in March 2010 the applicant was paid the salary arrears in respect of the period between 28 March 2008 and 20 April 2010, the date on which he resigned.
