Greece, 24\u00a0September\u00a01997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions\u00a01997-V, p.\u00a01830, \u00a7\u00a032).",

Germany judgment of 21\u00a0February\u00a01984, Series\u00a0A\u00a0no.\u00a073, p.\u00a019, \u00a7\u00a052). It is therefore necessary to examine the minor offence in the light of the second and third criteria mentioned above (see paragraph\u00a022). In this respect, the Court recalls that these criteria are alternative and not cumulative: for Article\u00a06 to apply by virtue of the words \u201ccriminal charge\u201d, it suffices that the offence in question should by its nature be \u201ccriminal\u201d from the point of view of the Convention, or should have made the person concerned liable to a sanction which, by its nature and degree of severity, belongs in general to the \u201ccriminal\u201d sphere (see, inter alia, Lutz v. Germany, judgment of 25\u00a0August\u00a01987, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0123, p.\u00a023, \u00a7\u00a055). This does not exclude that a cumulative approach may be adopted where the separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d (see, among other authorities, Garyfallou\u00a0AEBE, cited above, p.\u00a01830, \u00a7\u00a033; and Bendenoun v.
