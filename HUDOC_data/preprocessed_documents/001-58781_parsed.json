Those fees do not constitute necessary expenses incurred in seeking redress for the violations which the Court has found under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3 and 4 of the Convention. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant LTL 40,000 for legal costs, together with any value-added tax that may be chargeable.",
