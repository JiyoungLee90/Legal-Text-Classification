Fourthly, he submitted that he was not told of the reasons for his detention in close arrest until 14 January 2000, when his solicitor intervened and, as a result, he had no opportunity to correct errors (such as the assertion that he was a habitual absconder). Fifthly, he claimed that there was no basis in fact or law for his detention (in particular, the claim that he was a habitual absconder was unfounded). No document had been produced providing the factual basis for these reasons. Moreover, it was unlikely that the commanding officer at 12th Regiment of the Royal Artillery or at the MCTC knew why the applicant was being held in close arrest. Lastly, he alleged that no officer concerned carried out his obligations under the Army's rules until the applicant's final release into open arrest (although the applicant was unaware of this because there was no provision that he be provided with the paperwork).",

The Court will therefore confine its examination of the applicant's complaint to the independence and impartiality of this first CO only, covering the period from 6 November to 16 November 1999.",

Although the CO did not draw up the charges himself, he had the power to amend or substitute any charge presented to him (see sections 76(1) and (2) of the 1955 Act as amended, paragraph 24 above, and Schiesser, cited above, \u00a7 34). He then had the power to decide whether to dismiss the charge, try it summarily or refer it to a higher authority. Even when the CO referred the charge to a higher authority (as occurred in the present case), the possibility still remained that the CO might play a prosecuting role: he retained the power to take subsequent action to deal with the charge if the prosecuting authority decided not to institute proceedings or to discontinue such proceedings (see Regulation 26 of the 1997 Regulations and Hood, cited above, \u00a7 57). Secondly, the conflict remained between the CO's pre-trial detention decision-making and his responsibility for unit discipline (see Hood, cited above, \u00a7 58).",

While it is not clear whether the applicant was provided with copies of the reports on which these reasons were recorded, the Court notes that the Government maintain that he was orally informed of the reasons each time he appeared before the CO. It further notes that the applicant made no comment on the Government's submissions on this point. The Court would also add that copies of the written records were sent to the applicant's solicitors on request on 11 February 2000 and were therefore available to them when they applied to the High Court for a writ of habeas corpus on 18 February 2000. In the Court's view, it is always desirable that when a detainee is informed orally of the reasons for his detention he then be provided with a follow-up, written copy of these reasons. However, in the present case, any failure to do so is mitigated by the fact that written records were kept and later provided to the applicant's representatives thus allowing them to take proceedings to have the lawfulness of the detention reviewed (see, a contrario, X v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, \u00a7 66).",

While noting that the applicant disputes the factual basis for these reasons, the Court finds these reasons to be relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3.
