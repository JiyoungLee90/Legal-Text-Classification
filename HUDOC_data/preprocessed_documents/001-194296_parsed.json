In doing so, it agreed with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the origin of money was legally irrelevant to the question of the degree of the applicant\u2019s liability. It further noted that the applicant had been obliged to acquaint himself with the relevant custom rules before crossing the Ukrainian border and that he had not been prevented in any way from doing so. The Court of Appeal went on to note that the District Court\u2019s judgment suggested that it had examined and taken into account information about the character of the applicant. As regards the lawyer\u2019s arguments that the applicant had admitted to a negligent failure to declare the relevant amount of money, had never been held administratively liable and had a large family, these factors, according to the Court of Appeal, were not a sine qua non condition for quashing the District Court\u2019s judgment and changing the sanction imposed on the applicant. It noted that confiscation as a sanction was laid down in Articles 339 and 340 of the Customs Code and had been correctly imposed on the applicant with due regard being given to the nature of the offence, the way it had been committed and the available information on the character of the offender. Lastly, the Court of Appeal noted that the applicant had committed a gross violation of customs rules by failing to declare a substantial amount of money, which severely affected the external economic interests and security of Ukraine and encroached on the key elements of the customs regulations. It therefore ruled that there were no grounds to allow the appeal lodged by the applicant\u2019s lawyer.",

The obligation to declare cash exceeding EUR\u00a010,000 to customs was set out in the Regulation issued by the National Bank (see paragraph 15 above).\u00a0Competence of the National Bank on the matter was referred to in Article 97 of the Customs Code. The Court considers that the rules in question were formulated with sufficient precision and thus met the qualitative requirement of foreseeability. It further notes, that, according to Ukrainian law data base available on the web-site of the Ukrainian parliament, the Regulation was published in the Official Gazette of Ukraine (\u041e\u0444\u0456\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0456\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438), no. 43 of 23 June 2008 and thus had been accessible to public. The fact that the National Bank\u2019s Decree which approved the Regulation was not a law in a formal sense does not alter the above assessment as the notion of a law under the Convention also has an autonomous meaning which can include subordinate legislation (see, for instance, Bitt\u00f3 and Others v.

The general declaration requirement applicable to any individual crossing the State border prevents cash from entering or leaving the country undetected and the confiscation measure in which the failure to declare cash to the customs authorities results is part of the general regulatory scheme designed to combat those offences.

Not only was it permissible to export foreign currency, but the sum which could be legally transferred or, as in the present case, physically carried across the customs border, was not, in principle, restricted at the time of the events, if declared (see paragraph\u00a015 above). Those elements distinguish this case from certain others, in which the confiscation measure applied either to goods whose import was prohibited or to vehicles used for transporting prohibited substances or trafficking human beings (for examples of such cases, see Ismayilov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035).",

The Court observes that there is no evidence before it to suggest that the applicant produced the loan agreement, which is a handwritten document, signed between the applicant and a physical person on the date of his departure from Ukraine, to the customs authorities. As it follows from the available documents, the first reference to the agreement was made at the court proceedings. However, given that no assessment of the lawfulness of the origin of the money was made by the domestic court and given the fact that in their observations before this Court, the Government have not raised any doubts as regards the validity of the loan agreement, the Court is not in a position to call into question the lawful origin of the confiscated cash. On that ground it distinguishes the present case from cases in which the confiscation measure covered assets which were the proceeds of a criminal offence, were deemed to have been unlawfully acquired or were intended for use in illegal activities (for examples of such cases, see Ismayilov, cited above, \u00a7 36, and Grifhorst v.\u00a0France, no. 28336/02, \u00a7 99, 26 February 2009).",

The fact that the Ukrainian authorities did not institute criminal proceedings against the applicant also evidences that they conceded a lack of intent to deceive them on the part of the applicant and that by imposing the confiscation measure on him the authorities were not seeking to prevent any other illegal activities, such as money laundering, drug trafficking, financing terrorism or tax evasion. The money the applicant was carrying had been lawfully obtained and he was allowed to take it out of Ukraine so long as he declared it to the customs authorities. It follows that the only illegal (but not criminal) conduct which could be attributed to him was his failure to make a written declaration to the customs authorities to the effect that he was carrying such cash across the border.",

It should therefore be reserved to enable the parties to provide their written observations on this question and inform the Court of any agreement reached between them in this respect (Rule 75\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Rules of Court).",
