The Court emphasises that, in order for Article 8 of the Convention to come into play, an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and its manner must cause prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see A. v. Norway, no.\u00a028070/06, \u00a7 64, 9\u00a0April 2009, and Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, \u00a7 83, 7 February 2012). It is not convinced, however, in the circumstances of the present case, that the impugned statements could be considered as an attack reaching the requisite threshold of seriousness and capable of causing prejudice to Mr\u00a0Klimov\u2019s personal enjoyment of private life.",
