This represented compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant as a result of the unlawful acts and actions of the public prosecutor\u2019s office during the period from 16\u00a0September 1995 to 16 December 1996 in charging him with aiding and abetting another individual to commit murder, holding him in pre-trial detention and then replacing it with a restriction not to leave his place of residence without the authorisation of the public prosecutor\u2019s office. In reaching its decision, the Regional Court took into account the fact that the criminal proceedings and the associated restrictions imposed on the liberty and movement of the applicant had lasted for more than a year, which it found had caused him suffering and had brought about the break-up of his relationship with his fianc\u00e9e. The court further found that he had been detained in \u201cextremely harsh conditions\u201d at the Sliven Regional Investigation Service detention facility, which it considered to have caused him physical and mental pain and suffering and to have had a negative effect on his dignity as he had been held in an overcrowded cell with another six individuals, without access to a toilet, bathing or any other facilities in order to maintain even basic hygiene, had been given food only once a day, had not been allowed visits by friends or relatives and had had no access to newspapers or any other media. The  also took note of a report by the paramedic at the said detention facility that the applicant had been healthy at the time of his arrival there, but had then developed an inflammation of the sciatic nerve accompanied by pain in the pelvis area and down the left leg. Lastly, the court found that the applicant\u2019s reputation had been damaged as a result of having been unlawfully held in pre-trial detention and having had criminal proceedings initiated against him. The Regional Court dismissed as unsubstantiated the remainder of the claims in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage and, by applying section 10 (2) of the SMRDA, ordered the applicant to pay court fees of four percent on the dismissed part of his claim, which amounted to BGN\u00a01,800 (EUR 923).",

Further, cells had had no direct sunlight so only artificial light was available. Detainees also had had the opportunity to purchase books, newspapers and magazines. A paramedic had been available to deal with any medical complaints by detainees and specialised medical personnel could have been called or a transfer to an outside medical facility could have been be made if a detainee\u2019s medical condition required it.

In addition, the domestic courts, by applying section 10 (2) of the SMRDA, ordered the applicant to pay court fees of BGN 1,880 (EUR\u00a0964). Thus, the primary issue to be assessed is whether the said compensation, taken together with the requirement to pay over half of the awarded amount in court fees, adequately redressed the violation of the applicant\u2019s right under Article 3 of the Convention.",

In particular, in the aforementioned cases the Court found a violation of Article 6 as it considered that although the imposition of court fees was an aim which was compatible as such with the good administration of justice, the practical difficulties in assessing the likely award under the SMRDA, taken together with the relatively high and wholly inflexible rate of court fees, amounted to a restriction on the applicant\u2019s right to a court which was disproportionate to the otherwise legitimate aim (see Stankov, cited above, \u00a7 67). In the present case, the applicant was ordered to pay court fees of BGN 1,880 (EUR 964) which represents approximately sixty three percent of the compensation of BGN\u00a03,000 (EUR 1,538) awarded by the domestic courts for all the established violations (see paragraphs 12-15 above).",

The Court considers this assessment to be just as valid for claims for damage under the SMRDA regarding conditions of detention as it has not been shown that at the relevant time there existed developed or accessible case-law which might have assisted a claimant in determining the likely amount for an award. Neither was the amount of compensation fixed by law. The applicant cannot therefore be criticised for having made the claim which he did (ibid.).",

Facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to bring a charge (see O\u2019Hara v. the United Kingdom, no. 37555/97, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2001-X).
