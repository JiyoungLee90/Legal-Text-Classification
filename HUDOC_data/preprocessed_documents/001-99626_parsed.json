In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Labita v.

There is no detailed medical opinion as to the manner in which the injuries displayed by the applicant after the release could have been inflicted. The Court is further hindered from making affirmative conclusions as to the applicant's allegations of tortures given that those statements turned out to be inconsistent at the domestic level (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above). In sum, there is insufficient material to give preference to the applicant's description of ill-treatment as opposed to the other possible versions, including the one of the trial court suggesting that the applicant had been ill-treated by being punched and kicked (see paragraph 35 above).",
