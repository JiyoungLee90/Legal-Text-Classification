Thus, as the Court held in its judgment in Varnava and Others, cited above, in disappearance cases where there is a state of ignorance and uncertainty and, by definition, a failure to account for what has happened, if not an appearance of deliberate concealment and obstruction on the part of some authorities, the situation is less clear-cut compared with cases concerning killings. It is more difficult for the relatives of the missing to assess what is happening or what can be expected to happen. Allowances must be made for the uncertainty and confusion which frequently mark the aftermath of a disappearance (ibid.).",

The serious nature of disappearances is such that the standard of expedition expected of the relatives cannot be rendered too rigorous in the context of Convention protection (see Varnava and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 162-164). In this connection, the Court also observes that the file was forwarded to a military prosecutor who began a new investigation in 2004. In the course of that investigation the military prosecutor requested further information from local military units and questioned one of the applicants and the two eyewitnesses. Secondly, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, it is best for the facts of cases to be investigated and issues to be resolved in so far as possible at the domestic level. It is in the interests of the applicant, and the efficacy of the Convention system, that the domestic authorities, who are best placed to do so, act to put right any alleged breaches of the Convention.",

If there is an investigation of sorts, even if sporadic and plagued by problems, the relatives may reasonably wait some years longer until hope of progress being made has effectively evaporated.

They subsequently cooperated with the prosecutor and provided the latter with eyewitness evidence. The investigation opened by that prosecutor continued in an active manner until 16\u00a0February 1996. Further steps were taken in the investigation after the civilian prosecutor decided on 10 December 2003 that the military prosecutors had jurisdiction to continue the investigation.

The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5 of the Convention. Bearing in mind the responsibility of the authorities to account for individuals under their control, Article 5 of the Convention requires them to take effective measures to safeguard against the risk of disappearance and to conduct a prompt and effective investigation into an arguable claim that a person has been taken into custody and has not been seen since (see Akdeniz, cited above, \u00a7 129, and the authorities cited therein).",

His detention there was not logged in the relevant custody records and there exists no official record of his alleged release. In the view of the Court, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of holding data recording such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention, the name of the person effecting it and the time and date of release must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (ibid.,\u00a0\u00a7 130).",

There is no specific rule applicable to situations where no final decision is taken, for example in cases of disappearance. In such circumstances the rule applicable to such situations has to be developed and interpreted in conformity with the purpose of the Convention, namely securing the effective recognition and observance of the rights protected by the Convention. Nevertheless, it is sometimes argued that the six-month rule must be interpreted strictly to satisfy the exigencies of legal certainty. However, in the context of the Convention such legal certainty attributed to the six-month rule would serve a very specific expectation, namely that, whatever had happened (even the most outrageous mass violation of human rights), the authorities and the State would not be held accountable. The logic applied in \u0160ilih v.  ([GC], no. 71463/01, 9 April 2009) indicates that this is unacceptable to the Court. The State Party interest in the six-month rule is very different from the reliance interest generally protected in a domestic system with regard to the finality of a judgment. Lord Bingham has voiced the opinion that when it comes to procedure a non-formalistic approach is appropriate: \u201cProcedural idiosyncrasy is not (like national costume or regional cuisine) to be nurtured for its own sake, and in answering the question before us we must have regard to the realities of litigation in this country and the purpose of the Convention, not to tradition, nomenclature or rules developed for other purposes\u201d (Dresser\u00a0U.K. Ltd v.

Given the domestic difficulties in the present case, that extension is eminently reasonable. What I find difficult to follow is the logic that where more than ten years has elapsed the applicants would generally have to show convincingly that there was some ongoing, and concrete, advance being achieved to justify further delay in coming to Strasbourg. I\u00a0understand that a clear rule like this offers guidance as to expectations and may push potential applicants to take action more swiftly, but on the other hand it may not serve the purposes of the Convention. There is nothing magical about the ten-year mark that would change an ongoing situation. As long as there is a reasonable expectation that domestic remedies will be provided and the potential applicants behave reasonably in pursuing available remedies, the general principles of Varnava should apply. This is the interpretation that best satisfies the dictates of subsidiarity. Subsidiarity is based on the undertaking, entered into by the member States of the Council of Europe, to pursue the \u201cfurther realisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms\u201d. Most importantly, this is the interpretation that best serves the interests of human rights protection in cases where the most serious breaches of human rights are alleged.",
