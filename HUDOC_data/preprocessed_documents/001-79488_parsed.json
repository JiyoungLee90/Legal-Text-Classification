In reply to a question whether he and his family had been affected by the terrorism in the region, the applicant stated that his son F.S. had been an active member of the PKK, that he had served a twelve years' prison sentence following his arrest and conviction and that therefore the PKK had not intimidated his family. Given that his wife's father had worked at the same time as a village guard, the State security forces had not intimidated his family either.

This twofold violence resulting from the acts of the two parties to the conflict forced many people to flee their homes.

In this context, statements were taken from a number of persons. A.K., who carried out the removal of the applicant's household property from Nurettin to Malazgirt, stated that the applicant's house was intact on the day of the removal (see paragraph 17 above). Furthermore, in their oral evidence to the , six village guards, who were allegedly involved in the events in question, denied the applicant's allegations. The applicant's fellow villagers R.G., C.\u00c7. and \u0130.\u00d6. also claimed that the applicant's allegations were untrue and that nobody had forced the applicant to leave the village (see paragraph 28 above). Nor had anybody set the applicant's house on fire (Ibid.) Moreover, the on-site investigation carried out on the ruins of the applicant's house showed that there was no trace indicating that the house had been exposed to fire, but that the house seemed to have been demolished as a result of natural forces and lack of care (see paragraph 24 above).",

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Dula\u015f and Y\u00f6yler, both cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65 and 87 respectively).",

That said, the Court reiterates that, notwithstanding the terms of Article 13 read literally, the existence of an actual breach of another provision is not a prerequisite for the application of the Article (Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, \u00a7 52). However, having regard to its above findings on the applicant's substantive complaints under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention and Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1, the Court cannot conclude that the applicant has laid the basis of a prima facie case of misconduct on the part of the security forces. It refers in this connection to the applicant's failure to rebut the testimonies of the villagers or the conclusions reached in the investigation conducted by the domestic authorities into his complaints (see in this respect Matyar and \u00c7a\u00e7an, both cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 154 and 80 respectively).",
