At the same time, it is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999-V, and Mifsud v.

In addition, the Court notes that the information concerning the absence of the medical licence at the medical unit was obtained by the applicants in April 2006 that is more than five years after the applicants were released from the detention centre (see paragraph 32) and that this fact was never brought by the applicants to the attention of competent domestic authorities. The Court further observes that the applicants raised the issue of the alleged lack of medical assistance only in the context of their requests for release pending trial and only as one of the grounds for their release, but not as a separate complaint to this effect (see paragraphs 15, 19-21 and 23 above). According to the Government, if the applicants had complained about the lack of medical assistance to the administration of the detention centre, the latter would have either provided such care or arranged it for the applicants in other hospitals in . In support of their position the Government furnished the Court with a number of information statements and witness statements by the medical personnel of IZ-25/1 and the applicants\u2019 medical records certifying that they had not applied for medical assistance while in detention in IZ-25/1.",

The Court has already established that applicants complaining of a lack of medical assistance should raise their complaints with the competent domestic authorities, including the administration of the detention facility (see Solovyev v.

In connection with this, the Court notes that the domestic legislation at the material time provided that an inmate had the right to request that his or her medical examination be conducted by medical officers of other medical institutions and, if the administration of the detention facility refused to arrange such an examination, to appeal against that decision to the prosecutor or the court (see paragraph 53). However, in the present case, the applicants failed to resort to this remedy and to raise the issue of the alleged lack of medical assistance or its inadequate quality with the administration of the detention centre, the prosecutor\u2019s office or the court. There is no indication that such a remedy would have been ineffective in the circumstances of the applicants\u2019 case.

The Court has repeatedly held that, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of an accused absconding or reoffending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the seriousness of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v.\u00a0France, judgment of 26 June 1991, \u00a7\u00a051, Series A no.\u00a0207; see also Panchenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a045100/98, \u00a7\u00a0102, 8\u00a0February 2005; Goral v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a038654/97, \u00a7 68, 30 October 2003; and Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081).",

Although such factors could justify a relatively longer period of detention, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure (see Osuch v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a031246/02, \u00a7\u00a026, 14 November 2006, and Celejewski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 4 May 2006). The fact that a person is charged with criminal conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of detention; the accused\u2019s personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account. There is no indication in the present case that the applicants had made any attempts to intimidate witnesses or to obstruct the course of the proceedings in any other way. In such circumstances the Court has difficulty accepting that there was a risk of interference with the administration of justice at the later stages of the proceedings. The Court is not therefore persuaded that, throughout the entire period of the applicants\u2019 detention, there were compelling reasons to fear that they might interfere with witnesses or otherwise hamper the investigation of the case, certainly not to such an extent as to outweigh the applicants\u2019 right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

Only one of these complaints, lodged by the second applicant on 3 January 2000, received a response from the District Court (see paragraph 22 above). This response did not provide any information as to whether any judicial examination of the request had been conducted; it simply acknowledged receipt of the complaint and stated, without providing any reasons or addressing the specific arguments advanced by the applicant, that there were no grounds for changing the preventive measure in respect of him. The rest of the applicants\u2019 complaints lodged between 29 October 2000 and 20 February 2001 remained unanswered by the District Court, which failed to carry out a judicial review of the applicants\u2019 detention.",
