In the instant case, the applicant\u2019s detention on remand began when she was arrested on 22\u00a0September 1996. She was detained within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention until her conviction by the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court on 2\u00a0June 1999. As from that date, until 20 December 1999, when the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the first-instance court, she was detained \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d, within the meaning of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 (a) and, therefore, this part of her detention falls outside the scope of Article 5 \u00a7 3. From 20 December 1999 until her release pending trial on 10 August 2001, the applicant was again in pre-trial detention falling under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. As a result, given the applicant\u2019s continued detention throughout these different phases, the six-month period should only start running from the end of the last period of pre-trial custody, which is 10 August 2001 (see Akyol v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a023438/02, \u00a7 25, 20 September 2007).",
