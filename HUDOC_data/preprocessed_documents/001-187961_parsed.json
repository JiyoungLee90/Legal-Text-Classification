The applicant repeated the comments he had made to the public prosecutor and stated that he would not answer any questions. In the reasons for its decision, the Diyarbak\u0131r 2nd Magistrate\u2019s Court noted firstly that the constitutional amendment had lifted the applicant\u2019s parliamentary immunity in relation to the offences concerned. It then observed that, during the escalation of clashes between Daesh and the PYD in Syria in October 2014, the PKK had issued several calls for people to take to the streets. Almost simultaneously, three tweets had been published on behalf of the HDP central executive board, of which the applicant was a member and co-chair, likewise urging people to go out into the streets. The magistrate noted that during the events of 6 to 8\u00a0October 2014, PKK supporters had committed a number of offences, and in particular had caused the death of fifty people, injuries to 678 others and damage to 1,113 buildings. In his view, the tweets sent by the HDP gave rise to a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence of incitement to commit an offence, in view of his position within the HDP. Next, he observed that the applicant had given several speeches in which he had described certain acts by PKK members, such as digging trenches and putting up barricades in towns, as \u201cresistance\u201d, and had participated in activities of the Democratic Society Congress, an organisation which, according to the magistrate, operated in accordance with the KCK Agreement. He added that the applicant was the subject of several ongoing criminal investigations by the public prosecutor\u2019s office concerning terrorism-related offences such as:",

It noted that, at a time when the internal conflict in Syria had posed a threat to national security in Turkey, following armed clashes in Kobani and alongside appeals from the PKK, the HDP had called on the people to take to the streets. Following those calls, serious violent incidents had started to take place on 6\u00a0October 2014. Tens of thousands of people had taken part in the incidents, and many people had lost their lives, while many others had suffered injuries. The Constitutional Court noted that the applicant had not argued that the calls in question had been issued against his will; on the contrary, he had stated that he stood behind them. Having regard to the number of deaths and injuries, it found that a causal link could be established between the calls issued by the HDP central executive board, which was co-chaired by the applicant, and the acts of violence in question. Furthermore, with regard to the \u201ctrench events\u201d, it held that, bearing in mind the statements made by the applicant, the places where he had made them and his position as co-chair of the HDP, his pre-trial detention in connection with a terrorism-related offence was not unfounded. Thus, referring to the content of the speeches given by the applicant on 13 November 2012 and 21\u00a0April 2013 (see paragraph 57 (ii) and (iii) above), it observed that a finding that the speeches amounted to evidence of the commission of an offence could not be viewed as manifestly ill-founded. Lastly, having regard to the contents of the conversations between senior officials of the PKK and the applicant, it found that it had been legitimate to consider that the applicant might have acted in accordance with the instructions of the leaders of a terrorist organisation. It therefore held that these factors were sufficient grounds for a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed an offence.",

It noted in that connection that, having established that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the alleged offences, the Diyarbak\u0131r 2nd Magistrate\u2019s Court had ordered his pre-trial detention on the grounds that the offences in question were among those listed in Article 100 \u00a7 3 of the CCP and were punishable by heavy sentences. The Constitutional Court noted that the severity of the potential sentence was a factor to consider when assessing the risk of absconding. It added that the applicant had refused to appear before the investigating authorities and had stated that no member of parliament from his party would give evidence voluntarily. Those aspects were sufficient in the court\u2019s view to conclude that there was a flight risk.",

In that context, the applicant had alleged that his detention had prevented him from carrying out his political activities. Referring to several Constitutional Court judgments concerning the pre-trial detention of members of parliament, he had argued that his detention was disproportionate to the aim pursued, in view of his status as a member of parliament. In relation to that point, the Constitutional Court noted firstly that, contrary to what the applicant had maintained, it had never given a judgment in which it had found that the pre-trial detention of a member of parliament whose immunity had been lifted amounted in itself to a breach of the Constitution. It noted that in the cases of Kemal Akta\u015f and Selma Irmak (no. 2014/85), Faysal Sar\u0131y\u0131ld\u0131z (no. 2014/9), \u0130brahim Ayhan (no.\u00a02013/9895) and G\u00fclser Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m (no. 2013/9894), no review of the lawfulness of the applicants\u2019 pre-trial detention had been carried out since they had not raised a complaint on that account. In the cases of Mehmet Haberal (no.\u00a02012/849) and Mustafa Ali Balbay (no. 2012/1272) it had declared the complaints as to the lawfulness of the applicants\u2019 detention inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. In those judgments it had examined the complaints concerning the right to be elected and to carry out political activities in conjunction with the complaints about the length of the applicants\u2019 pre-trial detention. In finding a violation of the right to liberty and security of the members of parliament concerned, it had weighed the public interest inherent in the exercise of the right to be elected and to carry out political activities against the length of the applicants\u2019 detention (four years, three months and twenty-two days in the Mehmet Haberal judgment (no.\u00a02012/849); four years and five months in Mustafa Ali Balbay (no.\u00a02012/1272); four years, eight months and sixteen days in Kemal Akta\u015f and Selma Irmak (no. 2014/85); four years, six months and fifteen days in Faysal Sar\u0131y\u0131ld\u0131z (no. 2014/9); three years, two months and twenty-six days in \u0130brahim Ayhan (no. 2013/9895); and three years, ten months and five days in G\u00fclser Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m (no.\u00a02013/9894)). The Constitutional Court further noted that as the applicant had been placed in pre-trial detention a long time after the alleged offences had been committed, it had to examine whether or not his initial and continued pre-trial detention could have been regarded as necessary in the circumstances. In that context, it pointed out that, in accordance with Article 83 of the Constitution, the applicant could not have been placed in pre-trial detention while he enjoyed parliamentary immunity. It observed that the investigation reports concerning him had been sent to the competent public prosecutors after the entry into force of the constitutional amendment introducing an exception to parliamentary immunity in his case, and that he had been placed in pre-trial detention some five months afterwards. It was therefore clear from the evidence in the case file that the investigating authorities had not remained inactive during that period. The Constitutional Court further held that it was unable to conclude that the applicant\u2019s initial and continued pre-trial detention had been disproportionate and arbitrary, notably in view of the severity of the sentences prescribed for the offences in question. For those reasons, it declared this part of the application inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded.",

It observed that the applicant and his representatives had had unrestricted access to those reports. Next, it examined the public prosecutor\u2019s application of 4 November 2016 for the applicant to be placed in pre-trial detention for membership of an armed terrorist organisation and incitement to commit an offence, and the order of the same day for his pre-trial detention. It found that although the applicant had not had an unlimited right of access to the evidence in the file between 9 September 2016 and 2\u00a0February 2017, he had had sufficient knowledge of the substance of the evidence forming the basis for his pre-trial detention and had thus had the opportunity to properly contest the reasons given to justify the detention.

However, referring to the principles established in the Court\u2019s case-law, particularly in Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova ([GC], no. 23755/07, 5\u00a0July 2016), he expressed the view that the applicant\u2019s detention was not proportionate in so far as it had not been shown that there were relevant and sufficient reasons to justify it. In his opinion, the judicial authorities had not explained why the application of an alternative measure to detention would have been insufficient. Turning to the risk of absconding, he observed firstly that the orders for the applicant\u2019s initial and continued pre-trial detention had given two main reasons to substantiate that risk, namely the severity of the sentences prescribed by law for the offences in question and the fact that the applicant had refused to appear before the investigating authorities. In the dissenting judge\u2019s view, however, the severity of a sentence could not per se justify a person\u2019s pre-trial detention. Similarly, he considered that it could not be concluded that the applicant\u2019s refusal to appear was an indication of a flight risk, since he had continued to carry out his political activities without demonstrating any intention of absconding. Furthermore, the dissenting judge noted that between the entry into force of the amendment to the Constitution lifting the applicant\u2019s parliamentary immunity and the date of his initial pre-trial detention, the applicant had travelled abroad more than ten times and had never attempted to flee. For these reasons, he was of the view that there had been a violation of Article\u00a019 of the Constitution in the applicant\u2019s case. Noting in addition that the applicant was a member of parliament and co-chair of a political party that had obtained more than five million votes, the dissenting judge considered that his pre-trial detention without relevant and sufficient reasons also amounted to a breach of the right to be elected and to carry out political activities as safeguarded by Article 67 of the Constitution.",

The case concerned the pre-trial detention of Mr Balbay, who had been elected as a member of the National Assembly following the parliamentary elections held on 12 June 2011. While his application was still pending before the Constitutional Court, Mr Balbay had been sentenced to sixteen years\u2019 imprisonment on 5 August 2013.

In a move that the Venice Commission described as an ad hoc, \u2018one shot\u2019 and \u2018ad homines\u2019 measure, as well as a misuse of the constitutional amendment procedure, the majority in the Turkish Parliament lifted the immunities of 139 of its members who were subject to pending prosecution requests submitted to the Parliament. One of the most worrying aspects of this measure was the fact that the majority of impugned acts concerned statements made by these MPs, for example for insulting the President or other public officials, terrorist propaganda or incitement to hatred. The preamble of the constitutional amendment itself stated that its purpose was to address public indignation about, inter alia, \u2018statements of certain deputies constituting emotional and moral support to terrorism\u2019. As the Venice Commission highlighted, nearly all MPs of a particular opposition party, the HDP, were concerned by the measure. As a result of this measure, prosecutions are on-going against a large number of opposition MPs. Several members of HDP, including its co-Chairs, were arrested in November 2016. The Turkish authorities have stated that the reason of the arrests was the refusal of the MPs to comply with the order to personally appear before the prosecutor. However, even after having forcibly been made to give evidence, 11 MPs are still in prison and cannot carry out their parliamentary mandate at a crucial juncture.",

If a political group was considered to be supporting terrorism, merely by advocating those principles, that would reduce the possibility of dealing with related issues in the context of a democratic debate and would allow armed movements to monopolise support for the principles in question. In the current climate, the Commissioner considers that the lifting of the immunities of MPs and their subsequent arrest and detention not only disenfranchised millions of voters, but sent an extremely dangerous and chilling message to the entire Turkish population, and significantly reduced the scope of democratic debate, including on human rights.\u201d",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. The Court must further ascertain in this connection whether domestic law itself is in conformity with the Convention, including the general principles expressed or implied therein, notably the principle of legal certainty (see Mooren v.

The standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention thus requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Baranowski v.

Following the constitutional amendment, the criminal investigations in respect of the applicant were all joined together into a single investigation file, handled by the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor. After the applicant had refused to give evidence to the investigating authorities, he was arrested and taken into police custody. On 4 November 2016 he was placed in pre-trial detention on suspicion of membership of an armed terrorist organisation and incitement to commit an offence (see paragraph 53 above). The Diyarbak\u0131r 2nd Magistrate\u2019s Court found that the tweets published on behalf of the HDP central executive board \u2013 of which the applicant was a member and co-chair \u2013 urging people to take to the streets were consistent with the policy espoused by the PKK and the calls it had issued. Reviewing the events of 6 to 8 October 2014, and in particular the number of deaths and injuries, the magistrate concluded that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence of incitement to commit an offence. He further noted that the applicant had described certain acts by members of the PKK, such as digging trenches and putting up barricades in towns, as \u201cresistance\u201d. The applicant had also participated in activities of the Democratic Society Congress. Taking into account the fact that the applicant was the subject of several ongoing criminal investigations, the magistrate found that there was a sufficient basis for a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence of membership of a terrorist organisation.",

It observes that the Constitutional Court first of all analysed the tweets published from the HDP\u2019s account and noted that, at the time of the events, national security in Turkey was threatened by the internal conflict in Syria. The Constitutional Court observed that the tweets had been published following armed clashes in Kobani and alongside calls issued by the PKK, and also that serious violent incidents had taken place after the publication of the tweets and that the applicant had stated that he stood behind the calls. Having regard to the number of deaths and injuries, the Constitutional Court found that a causal link could be established between the calls issued by the HDP central executive board, which was co-chaired by the applicant, and the acts of violence in question. Next, taking into account the applicant\u2019s statements concerning the armed clashes in the context of the \u201ctrench events\u201d, the Constitutional Court held that his pre-trial detention in connection with a terrorism-related offence was not unfounded. Furthermore, referring to the content of the speeches given by the applicant on 13 November 2012 and 21 April 2013, it found that they amounted to an indication that an offence had been committed. The Court also notes that, having regard to the contents of the conversations between leading members of the PKK and the applicant, the Constitutional Court held that it was legitimate to consider that the applicant might have acted in accordance with the instructions of the leaders of a terrorist organisation, and that as a result, it concluded that those factors were sufficient to give rise to a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed an offence.",

In that context, it notes that the public prosecutor alleged that the applicant had declared, among other things, that he intended to display a sculpture of the leader of a terrorist organisation (see paragraph 57 above). In addition, it observes that, according to the indictment, in a speech given in the BDP offices in Diyarbak\u0131r on 21 April 2013, the applicant stated that the Kurdish people in Turkey owed its existence to the armed struggle led by the PKK. In that regard, it was alleged that the applicant had referred to the first terrorist attacks by the PKK as the \u201ccoup in 1984\u201d and the \u201cresistance in \u015eemdinli [and] Eruh\u201d (ibid.). Moreover, the public prosecutor asserted that the applicant was in charge of the political wing of the KCK, an illegal organisation. In this connection, the Court notes that evidence such as records of conversations among PKK leaders and between those leaders and the applicant had been obtained by the public prosecutor prior to the applicant\u2019s arrest on suspicion of having committed the criminal offence of which he was accused (ibid.). It further notes that, having regard to the content of those conversations, the national authorities, in particular the first-instance courts and the Constitutional Court, found that it was possible to conclude that the applicant had been acting in accordance with the instructions of the leaders of a terrorist organisation.",

That is the task of the national courts.

In relation to that question, having regard to the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as to the level of factual justification needed at the stage of suspicion, the Court finds that there was sufficient information in the criminal case file to satisfy an objective observer that the applicant might have committed at least some of the offences for which he had been prosecuted.",

The Court will therefore ascertain whether there were other relevant and sufficient grounds in the present case to justify the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention.",

As regards these so-called \u201ccatalogue\u201d offences, the Court notes that, in accordance with Article 100 \u00a7\u00a03 of the CCP, Turkish law provides that for certain offences there is a statutory presumption of the existence of grounds for detention (risk of absconding, tampering with evidence or putting pressure on witnesses, victims and other persons). In this connection, the Court reaffirms that any system of mandatory detention on remand is per se incompatible with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7 84, 26 July 2001). Where the law provides for a presumption concerning the grounds for pre-trial detention, it must nevertheless be convincingly demonstrated that there are concrete facts warranting a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty (see Contrada v. Italy, 24 August 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 58-65, Reports 1998-V). Moreover, under Turkish law, even in the case of a \u201ccatalogue\u201d offence, the judicial authorities are under an obligation to consider alternative measures to pre-trial detention first of all (see Agit Demir v. Turkey, no.\u00a036475/10, \u00a7\u00a039, 27\u00a0February 2018). In this connection, the Court observes that it has already found that the existence of a statutory presumption of this kind does not, in the context of the review it must carry out under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, provide any specific evidence demonstrating the need for continued pre-trial detention (see \u015e\u0131k v. Turkey, no. 53413/11, \u00a7 62, 8 July 2014). In the present case, it notes that the domestic courts\u2019 finding that alternative measures to detention appeared insufficient was not based on any analysis of the applicant\u2019s personal situation. In the Court\u2019s view, the judicial authorities made barely any mention in the reasons given for their decisions of the specific circumstances substantiating any of the risks referred to in the provision in question, and nor did they specify how such risks had been established and had persisted over such a lengthy period (see Galip Do\u011fru v. Turkey, no.\u00a036001/06, \u00a7 58, 28 April 2015).",

It further notes that they took into account the severity of the sentences prescribed by law for such offences. The Court takes note in this connection of the Constitutional Court\u2019s findings as to the severity of the sentences the applicant might face in the present case (see paragraph 74 above). Even assuming that the severity of the potential sentences and the nature of the charges might have justified the applicant\u2019s initial pre-trial detention, as the Constitutional Court maintained, the Court considers that they cannot in themselves form the reason for extending his detention, particularly at a late stage of the proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Letellier, cited above, \u00a7 51; Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-81; Ku\u010dera v.\u00a0Slovakia, no.\u00a048666/99, \u00a7\u00a094, 17\u00a0July\u00a02007; and Idalov v. Russia [GC], no.\u00a05826/03, \u00a7 145, 22 May 2012). In other words, throughout the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention the judicial authorities were required to demonstrate convincingly that his continued detention was still justified.",

The Government\u2019s observations appear to interpret this as a sign that there was a risk of his absconding. The Court notes in addition that the Constitutional Court concluded that the applicant\u2019s refusal to appear before the investigating authorities and his statement that no member of parliament from his political party would give evidence voluntarily could serve as an indication of a flight risk. However, the Court observes that the applicant made the statement in question in April 2016, before the constitutional amendment had been adopted. It accepts that the applicant did not appear before the investigating authorities to give evidence and notes in that connection that his arrest and detention were justified for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority. Nevertheless, it considers that the judicial authorities did not explain how the failure of the applicant \u2013 who at the time was also the co-chair of the third largest political party represented in the National Assembly \u2013 to give evidence could have suggested that he posed a flight risk. In that context, the Court attaches considerable weight to the findings of the Constitutional Court judge in the minority, who pointed out in his dissenting opinion that the applicant had travelled abroad several times and had always come back to Turkey without demonstrating any intention to flee. The Court also notes that the applicant had long been aware of the criminal investigations of which he was the subject and of the seriousness of the charges against him, yet despite that, he had not absconded.",

It is especially struck by the lack of a thorough analysis of the arguments in favour of releasing the applicant. In the Court\u2019s view, decisions worded in formulaic terms as in the present case can on no account be regarded as sufficient to justify a person\u2019s initial and continued pre-trial detention (see \u015e\u0131k, cited above, \u00a7 62).",

Although the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 need not always be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 of the Convention for civil or criminal litigation \u2013 as the two provisions pursue different aims (see Reinprecht v. Austria, no. 67175/01, \u00a7\u00a039, ECHR 2005-XII) \u2013 it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see D.N. v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27154/95, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2001-III). In particular, proceedings in which an appeal against a detention order is being examined must be adversarial and must ensure equality of arms between the parties, the prosecutor and the detainee (see Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a031195/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999-II). While national law may satisfy this requirement in various ways, whatever method is chosen should ensure that the other party is informed that observations have been filed and has a real opportunity to comment on them (see Lietzow v. Germany, no.\u00a024479/94, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 2001-I). In order to determine whether proceedings falling under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention provide the necessary guarantees, regard must be had to the particular nature of the circumstances in which they take place (see Megyeri v. Germany, 12 May 1992, \u00a7 22, Series A no. 237-A). In particular, equality of arms is not ensured if counsel is denied access to documents in the investigation file which are essential in order to effectively challenge the lawfulness of his or her client\u2019s detention (see, among other authorities, Lamy v.

Austria (8 July 1986, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 42, Series A no.\u00a0103), free elections and freedom of expression, in particular freedom of political debate, form the bedrock of any democratic system (see T\u0103nase v. Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, \u00a7 154, ECHR 2010). Thus, the Convention establishes a close nexus between an effective political democracy and the effective operation of Parliament. Accordingly, there can be no doubt that the effective functioning of Parliament is a value of key importance for a democratic society (see Kar\u00e1csony and Others, cited above, \u00a7 141).",

To determine whether deprivation of liberty was a proportionate measure for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Court has to take several aspects into account. In this context, it considers firstly that where a member of parliament or a candidate is placed in pre-trial detention, in order to discharge their positive obligation under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 the member States must set up a remedy providing a safeguard against arbitrariness and affording applicants an effective opportunity to challenge their deprivation of liberty and to secure an assessment of their complaint under that Article. In that connection, it is essential for the domestic courts to show that they have weighed up the interests of the person concerned and of society as safeguarded by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 against the interests of the proper administration of justice in ordering the initial pre-trial detention and/or its extension (see, mutatis mutandis, Uspaskich, cited above, \u00a7 94).

It observes, however, the parties did not submit any specific observations on this point, and in view of its findings under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see paragraphs 159 and 171 above), it will proceed on the assumption that the interference in issue pursued a legitimate aim, namely public-policy imperatives, since it occurred as a consequence of the applicant\u2019s detention, the purpose of which was to ensure the proper conduct of the criminal proceedings against him.",

Moreover, they did not demonstrate that there were pressing reasons justifying keeping him in pre-trial detention for such a lengthy period. The Court also observes in this connection that it has found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention on account of the extension of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention by the judicial authorities on grounds that could not be regarded as \u201csufficient\u201d to justify detention for a duration of more than twenty-three months (see paragraph 194 above).",

It has also found that the detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained (see Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, \u00a7 143, ECHR 2012). Those considerations apply a fortiori to the detention of a member of parliament. The Court observes that in a democracy, Parliament and comparable bodies are essential fora for political debate, of which the performance of parliamentary duties forms part (see, mutatis mutandis, Cordova v. Italy (no. 1), no.\u00a040877/98, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2003-I). While serving their term of office, members of parliament represent their voters, drawing attention to their concerns and defending their interests. As the minority Constitutional Court judge rightly pointed out in his dissenting opinion (see paragraph 79 above), the judicial authorities did not explain why the application of an alternative measure to detention would have been insufficient in the applicant\u2019s particular case. It does not appear from the case file that they genuinely considered the application of alternative measures to pre-trial detention, even though such measures are provided for by domestic law. Although they systematically found that measures of that kind were insufficient, they did not provide any specific reasons connected to the applicant\u2019s individual case. Yet throughout his detention, the applicant was deprived of all opportunity to devote himself to his parliamentary responsibilities.",

In those elections, the AKP, which had been governing the country since 2002, had lost its majority in the National Assembly, above all owing to the success of the HDP, which had received 13% of the vote and had for the first time passed the threshold for representation in Parliament. Subsequently, following the failure of negotiations to form a coalition government, early elections had been held on 1\u00a0November 2015, in which the HDP had polled 10% of the vote. Both elections had been crucial as the AKP had been unable to attain a sufficient majority to amend the Constitution in order to be able to introduce a presidential system, as the President of Turkey had wished.

In that connection he observed that between July 2015 and January 2018, 3,282 individuals linked to the HDP, including 135 co-chairs of local branches, fifteen members of parliament and 750 party officials at local level, had been arrested in the course of police operations against persons with links to the HDP. He stated that the judicial harassment had intensified following the end of the \u201csolution process\u201d. In his view, the real reason for his detention had been the severity of his criticism of the policies pursued by the government and the President of Turkey. In that regard, the crackdown against members of his party had become notably more visible after he had stated that he would never support a presidential system with Mr Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan as president.

But it is equally possible that a restriction is applied both for an ulterior purpose and a purpose prescribed by the Convention; in other words, that it pursues a plurality of purposes (see Merabishvili, cited above, \u00a7 292). That being so, a restriction may be compatible with the substantive Convention provision which authorises it because it pursues an aim permissible under that provision, but still infringe Article 18 because it was chiefly meant for another purpose that is not prescribed by the Convention; in other words, if that other purpose was predominant. Conversely, if the prescribed purpose was the main one, the restriction does not run counter to Article 18 even if it also pursues another purpose (ibid., \u00a7 305). Which purpose is predominant in a given case depends on all the circumstances. In assessing that point, the Court will have regard to the nature and degree of reprehensibility of the alleged ulterior purpose, as well as its duration and effects. It will also bear in mind that the Convention was designed to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society governed by the rule of law (ibid., \u00a7 307). In continuing situations, the Court cannot rule out the possibility that the assessment of which purpose was predominant may vary over time (ibid., \u00a7 308).",

In other words, it has already concluded that the applicant was deprived of his liberty for a purpose prescribed by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention. Accordingly, as in Merabishvili (ibid., \u00a7 318), even if it is established that the restriction of the applicant\u2019s right to liberty also pursued a purpose not prescribed by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), there will only be a breach of Article 18 if that other purpose was predominant.

Accordingly, a proper examination of the applicant\u2019s complaint cannot be detached from the general political and social background to the facts of the case and from the sequence of events emerging from the case file. Furthermore, in accordance with the requirement laid down in Merabishvili (ibid., \u00a7 314), the Court must determine whether, on the basis of a contextual analysis of that kind, sufficient proof of a predominant purpose underlying the repeated decisions to extend the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention can follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.",

The Court further observes that the reports and opinions of international observers also emphasise that a number of leading figures from the applicant\u2019s political party, including members of parliament and elected mayors, have been placed in pre-trial detention, notably on account of their political speeches. In this connection, it notes that after the parliamentary immunity of 154 members of parliament, including fifty-five from the HDP, had been lifted, fifteen opposition parliamentarians, including fourteen from the party in question, were placed in pre-trial detention (see paragraph 41 above). The Court takes note of the observations of the intervening third parties, in particular the Commissioner for Human Rights, who stated that national laws were increasingly being used to silence dissenting voices.

In that context, concordant inferences drawn from this background support the argument that the judicial authorities reacted harshly to the applicant\u2019s conduct, bearing in mind his position as one of the leaders of the opposition, and to the conduct of other HDP members of parliament and elected mayors, as well as to dissenting voices more generally.

In this connection, the Court observes that the applicant does not see himself solely as an individual victim of a violation. His contention is that he has been kept in pre-trial detention chiefly on account of his position as one of the leaders of the political opposition. The Court considers that in such an eventuality, it is not only the applicant\u2019s rights and freedoms as an individual that could be said to be under threat but the whole democratic system itself. In the Court\u2019s opinion, an ulterior purpose of that kind would undoubtedly pose a serious problem for democracy.",

In the absence of such a conclusion (see paragraph 271 of the judgment), the majority should in my view have avoided engaging in speculation, as for example when they asserted that the applicant\u2019s continued detention had had a negative effect on the \u201cno\u201d campaign relating to the proposed Bill to amend the Constitution with a view to introducing a presidential system, or that the political climate in recent years had created an environment capable of influencing certain decisions by the national courts.",
