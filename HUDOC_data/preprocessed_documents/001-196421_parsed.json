It sufficed instead to have reasonable evidence (prove logiche) of the criminal origin of the money in question. The criminal origin of the money was an objective prerequisite to be autonomously ascertained by the judge in the money laundering case. It was thus not important to ascertain a specific predicate offence if a plurality of elements showed the illicit origin of the money. In the case at hand, the criminal origin of the assets had been shown by the above-mentioned Italian criminal judgment against B. together with other relevant elements. In particular, the judge quoted a part of the Italian judgment which described the criminal career of B. and his previous convictions for inter alia, fighting, causing personal injury, carrying of weapons and, after 1975, handling and receiving stolen goods, multiple instances of theft, owning unjustified assets and drug dealing.",

In particular it had not been ascertained beyond a reasonable doubt that the applicants had been aware of the criminal origin of the assets in the light, inter alia, of their young age. Nevertheless, the court noted that the sum deposited in the bank account had had a criminal origin in the absence of any explanation as to the origin of the money (which led to the purchase of properties, the sale of which resulted in the sums at issue). Indeed the fact that relevant fiscal controls did not exist at the time did not suffice to prove the licit origin of the funds. Further, the transfer of such money into banks in San Marino showed the attempt to make such money untraceable precisely to hide their initial origin.

He further considered that the confiscation, independently from any investigation concerning the possessor, his/her criminal liability or dangerousness, constituted a mere consequence of the status (condizione giuridica) of the property and therefore was devoid of any punitive nature.

Relying on European Court of Human Rights case-law, the judge for extraordinary remedies held that, contrary to the argument raised by the applicants, judicial interpretation of laws did not go against the principle of legal certainty when it was justified by the need to adapt laws to the existing realities, socio-economic needs or international obligations. Given the context, the measure had been necessary in a democratic society. The criminal pervasiveness of the conduct at issue and the multiplier effect on criminal activities, their adverse impact on the regularity of economic activities, the destabilising effects on the economic market and the negative impact on the image of the country and its international credibility were all convincing and imperative reasons justifying the measure.",

Such interpretation was based on judgment No. 6 of the constitutional jurisdiction (see preceding paragraph), which in his view provided that revision proceedings were the only remedy in cases where there had been a \u201csubstantive injustice relating to a final judgment which was in contrast with fundamental human rights\u201d. He considered that the effective remedy required by the Convention was guaranteed in San Marino by revision proceedings given that the constitutional jurisdictions had entrusted the judge for extraordinary remedies with the competence to evaluate a situation where a final judgment was in conflict with fundamental human rights, and to examine the complaint where this was based on an arguable claim, and, Article 13 attributed to the judge for extraordinary remedies the power to award adequate redress for the violations upheld.",

San Marino ((dec.), no.\u00a035430/97, 28\u00a0May 2002). The situation may be different now in the light of the fact that the judge for extraordinary remedies has established his competence to examine human rights issues as happened in the applicants\u2019 case, and as appears to be the case since 2016 (see paragraph\u00a036 above). Indeed, it would appear to be in the light of such developments that the applicants attempted the remedy. However, the Court has not yet had the opportunity to examine, on the basis of relevant observations by the parties, whether the revision proceedings are still to be considered an extraordinary remedy, or whether such proceedings are a remedy for the purposes of Articles 13 and 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in a given situation, and in such circumstances there is no doubt that the applicants should have informed the Court about the remedy they pursued.",

Moreover, the measure was grounded on Article 147 (2) of the Criminal Code which allowed such measures even in cases of acquittal. However, according to the applicants that provision was intended to provide for the confiscation of possessions destined to committing crimes or which constituted a crime or which where dangerous, and thus the confiscation of sums of money should not have fallen under its remit. In their view by relying on that provision the judge was extending the domestic court\u2019s remit by analogy, which was not possible in the criminal law sphere. In their view he had applied something in between Article\u00a0147\u00a0(1) which was a punitive measure and Article\u00a0147\u00a0(2) which was a preventive measure despite both provisions not being applicable in their case.

France, no. 42875/10, \u00a7 42, 3\u00a0September 2015), without it being regarded as decisive when it comes to establishing the nature of the measure (see Valico S.r.l. v.

In this connection the Court notes that Article\u00a0199bis states that the use or transfer of money which one knows was obtained as a result of crimes constitutes money laundering (see paragraph\u00a030 above). The Court observes that it has been established that the funds have an illicit origin and the applicants are aware of that now. It follows that the applicants could be charged with new acts of money laundering had they to use or transfer such money. Against this legal background, the Court confirms the preventive character of such a confiscation designed to prevent the unlawful use of these proceeds, an aim also sought by various international instruments (see paragraphs 38  40 above) (compare also, Gogitidze and Others v. Georgia, no.\u00a036862/05, \u00a7\u00a0101, 12 May 2015). In such circumstances and particularly in view of the applicant\u2019s acquittal precisely on the basis of the lack of intention, it cannot be said that the measure also included a punitive purpose (see, a contrario, Sofia v.\u00a0San\u00a0Marino (dec.), no. 38977/15, \u00a7\u00a063, 2\u00a0May 2017, and Vannucci v.\u00a0San\u00a0Marino, (dec.), no. 33898/15, 28\u00a0March 2017, concerning a confiscation of laundered assets, or the equivalent, respectively, under Article 147 (3) of the Criminal Code which were applicable after conviction, and Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9\u00a0February 1995, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 307A, where the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking followed a finding of guilt and its amount depended on the degree of culpability of the applicant).",

However, this cannot in itself be decisive (see by implication, Dassa Foundations and Others v.\u00a0Liechtenstein, (dec.), no. 696/05, 10 July 2007). Indeed, it is a common feature of several jurisdictions for criminal courts to take decisions of a nonpunitive nature as, for example, the possibility for criminal courts to order civil reparation measures for the victim of the criminal act. Furthermore, the Court observes that in the present case those courts had to assess the origin of the funds, and during those proceedings, which the applicants have not considered unfair, and during which the applicants have had the right to present their defence, it was established that the origin of the funds had been illicit. This decision was based on the evidence related to their father\u2019s dealings, including a criminal judgment against him, and the applicants\u2019 inability to prove the lawful origin of the money. Thus, the assessment had been objective and based on relevant evidence in the absence of a successful rebuttal, and therefore must be distinguished from mere suspicions or subjective speculation (see, mutatis\u00a0mutandis, M.\u00a0v.\u00a0Italy, cited above).",

Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, \u00a7 82, ECHR 2013). The Court considers that the confiscation of the sums in the present case is not sufficiently severe as to warrant its classification as a criminal penalty. The Court has previously held that confiscation is not a measure confined to the sphere of criminal law, but that it is encountered widely in the sphere of administrative law where items liable to confiscation include illegally imported goods (see AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1986, Series A no. 108), items considered dangerous in themselves (such as weapons, explosive or infected cattle) and property connected, even if only indirectly, with a criminal activity (see M. v. Italy, Yildirim, and Bowler International Unit, all cited above, and more recently Gogitidze and Others, cited above, \u00a7 126). Each confiscation must be seen in its context; money laundering directly threatens the rule of law as is also evident by the action of the Council of Europe and other international bodies in this field. In particular the Council of Europe Conventions on the matter have bound States to criminalise the laundering of the proceeds of crime and provide for other measures aimed at having a strong criminal policy to combat this growing national and international phenomenon the complexities of which are unprecedented (see Podeschi v. San Marino, no. 66357/14, \u00a7 181, 13\u00a0April 2017). In such circumstances the Court considers that the preventive measure was necessary and appropriate given the public interest involved (see, mutatis mutandis, M. v. Italy (cited above) and Gogitidze and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0103).",

Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuance decision in any other proceedings, the fairtrial guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person\u2019s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public.

Moreover, quite apart from being preventive and not punitive (see paragraph 65 above), the confiscation concerned funds in the applicants\u2019 possession which were found to be illicit as a result of crimes not attributed to the applicants, but to third persons (who had committed the predicate offence of the money laundering with which the applicants were charged).

The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, among other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest.

That provision had to be construed in the light of the general principle set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph which requires that there exist a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see, among many examples, Sofia, cited above and Phillips, cited above, \u00a7 51).

Having regard to the wording of that provision, the Court finds nothing arbitrary in the interpretation given to Article 147 (2) which provided for the confiscation, in the absence of conviction, of any items which constituted an offence. The fact that the sums of money fell into the remit of the word \u201citems\u201d is wholly plausible irrespective of whether those items constituted the \u201cproceeds of a crime\u201d, a concept referred to in Article\u00a0147 (1).

Indeed, whenever a confiscation order was the result of civil proceedings in rem which related to the proceeds of crime derived from serious offences, the Court did not require proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d of the illicit origins of the property in such proceedings. Instead, proof on a balance of probabilities or a high probability of illicit origins, combined with the inability of the owner to prove the contrary, was found to suffice for the purposes of the proportionality test under Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (compare also with the case of Silickien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-70, where a confiscation measure was applied to the widow of an alleged corrupt public official). More recently in Gogitidze and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0108, concerning a confiscation applied in civil proceedings), the Court also found that the civil proceedings in rem through which the applicants - one of whom had been directly accused of corruption in a separate set of criminal proceedings, and two other applicants, were presumed, as the accused\u2019s family members, to have benefited unduly from the proceeds of his crime - had suffered confiscations of their property, could not be considered to have been arbitrary or to have upset the proportionality test under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

Secondly, the onus of proving the lawful origin of the property presumed to have been wrongfully acquired may legitimately be shifted onto the respondents in such non-criminal proceedings for confiscation, including civil proceedings in rem.
