Their numerous requests for release were supported with arguments related to their personal and family circumstances. The Court of Appeal, on each occasion, rejected those arguments with a single decision in which it reiterated, in a summary form, the reasons given by the panel. It did not make an individual assessment of the arguments in the light of the personal characteristics of each appellant separately. The Court sees no reason to believe that the Court of Appeal would have decided otherwise if the remaining applicants had appealed. The Court therefore considers that in the particular circumstances of the case the appeal was ineffective and the fact that some applicants did not use it cannot be regarded as a failure to exhaust the domestic remedies.

Nor did they address any of the applicants' arguments that mitigated the risk of their absconding. It remained unclear, therefore, why they did not consider that risk to have been removed in respect of the applicants who had already had their passports withdrawn or had invoked facts showing close ties with the respondent State (see paragraphs 10, 16\u00a0and 19 above). Moreover, at no point in the proceedings did the domestic courts explain in their decisions why alternatives to deprivation of liberty would not have sufficed to ensure that the trial would follow its proper course, which, according to the Government, was the main purpose of the applicants' detention (see paragraph 54 above). Furthermore, the applicants' release was ordered on the basis of the fact that they had permanent places of residence and families in the respondent State. These factors were not unknown to the domestic courts at the earlier stages of the proceedings (see paragraph 26 above).",
