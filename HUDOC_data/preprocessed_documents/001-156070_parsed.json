Firstly, the Court considers that the applicant repeatedly raised a serious argument that the criminal charge against him had become time-barred in 1999. Under the 1960 Criminal Code the limitation period for prosecution in respect of the criminal offence with which the applicant was charged was five years from the time of commission of the alleged offence (see paragraphs 27-28 above). Since the applicant had never absconded the investigation, the running of the limitation period was never stopped under the 1960 Criminal Code. Neither the domestic authorities or courts, nor the Government have alleged that there were any other circumstances stopping the running of the limitation period in the applicant\u2019s case or precluding the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings on that ground. Therefore, it appears that the criminal charge in question became time-barred on 10\u00a0September 1999 and it was up to the relevant prosecuting authorities to discontinue the proceedings on that date. As for the 2000 Criminal Code, it came into force after that date and was not applicable at the material time. In any event, since the 2000 Criminal Code provided for a longer limitation period for the same offence (seven years; see paragraphs 30-31 above), it appears that, although the criminal proceedings remained pending after its entry into force, it could not be applied retroactively to the applicant\u2019s situation (see paragraph 29 above).",

In essence, this meant that in situations where the prosecuting authorities arbitrarily and unlawfully refused to discontinue proceedings in cases where the alleged criminal offence had become time-barred, a person\u2019s right to freedom of movement could remain restricted indefinitely, without an adequate remedy available to him to challenge the restriction.",

Hungary, no. 41463/02, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2006XII). Even in cases where the restriction was initially warranted, maintaining it automatically over a lengthy period of time may result in disproportionality of the measure (see Riener, cited above, \u00a7 121, with further references). In the present case, as noted above, there was no examination of the justification for the restriction when the applicant was initially refused a new passport in 2006 and it appears that the domestic legal system does not provide any possibilities for a regular re-examination. Accordingly, the de facto travel ban imposed on the applicant by way of refusing him a new passport constituted, in reality, an automatic, blanket measure of indefinite duration. This runs counter to the authorities\u2019 duty under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to take appropriate care to ensure that any interference with the right to leave one\u2019s country remains justified and proportionate throughout its duration in the individual circumstances of each case.",
