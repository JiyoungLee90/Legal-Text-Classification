He was found civilly liable for his speech, and therefore the impugned interference must be assessed in the context of professional environment. The Court has previously observed that employees owe to their employer a duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion (see, for instance, Kudeshkina v. Russia, no. 29492/05, \u00a7 85, 26\u00a0February 2009, and Heinisch v. Germany, no. 28274/08, \u00a7 64, ECHR 2011 (extracts)), and that in striking a fair balance the limits of the right to freedom of expression and the reciprocal rights and obligations specific to the professional environment must be taken into account (see Palomo\u00a0S\u00e1nchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos. 28955/06, 28957/06, 28959/06 and 28964/06, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2011). At the same time the Court does not lose sight of the academic context of the debate. The principle of open discussion of issues of professional interest must thus be construed as an element of a broader concept of academic autonomy which encompasses the academics\u2019 freedom to express their opinion about the institution or system in which they work (see Mustafa Erdo\u011fan and Others v. Turkey, nos.\u00a0346/04 and 39779/04, \u00a7 40, 27 May 2014, and Sorgu\u00e7 v. Turkey, no.\u00a017089/03, \u00a7 35, 23 June 2009). Therefore the Court must look at the interference in the light of the case as a whole, including the nature of the remarks held against the applicant and the professional and academic context in which he made them (see Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others, cited above, \u00a7 70, and Lingens v.

The debate was therefore not a purely private one. On the contrary, it took place in public and the issue raised by the applicant concerned a matter of general interest, which the applicant was entitled to bring to the attention of his colleagues (see Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others, cited above, \u00a7 72, Rubins v.

Russia, no.12365/03, \u00a7 38, 22\u00a0February 2007, with further references). In the present case there is no evidence that the domestic courts performed a balancing exercise between the need to protect the University\u2019s reputation and the applicant\u2019s right to impart information on issues of general interest concerning the organization of the academic life. They merely confined their analysis to the discussion of the damage to the plaintiff\u2019s reputation (see paragraph 10 above) without giving any due consideration to the Convention standards described above. Neither did the domestic courts consider that the \u201cdignity\u201d of an institution cannot be equated to that of human beings. The Court considers that the protection of the University\u2019s authority is a mere institutional interest of the University, that is, a consideration not necessarily of the same strength as \u201cthe protection of the reputation or rights of others\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 (see Uj v. Hungary, no. 23954/10, \u00a7 22, 19 July 2011). The Court therefore finds that the domestic courts did not take into account specific features of academic relations and failed to recognise that the present case involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and the protection of reputation (see Dyundin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 37406/03, \u00a7\u00a033, 14 October 2008).",

The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible to proof (see De\u00a0Haes and Gijsels v.

The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2004XI).",

The courts focused their attention on the applicant\u2019s describing the elected senate as \u201cillegitimate\u201d and found, on the strength of the available evidence, that the academic senate elections had been run in full compliance with the applicable regulations (see paragraph 13 above). The Court observes at the outset that the thrust of the applicant\u2019s speech was his severe discontent with the manner in which the academic senate had been elected. Seeking to attract his colleagues\u2019 attention to the shortcomings in the election procedure, the applicant argued that the heads of department had failed to initiate any public discussion, and claimed that the election had been \u201cin breach of the ordinary professors\u2019 rights\u201d because the candidates had been appointed directly by the heads of departments. The applicant has thus voiced his personal comment on a matter of public interest for the University staff while the domestic courts considered the applicant\u2019s subjective appraisal of the election procedure to be a factual accusation (see, for similar reasoning, Pinto Pinheiro Marques v. Portugal, no. 26671/09, \u00a7\u00a043, 22 January 2015). In his defence, the applicant relied on statements of four fellow professors heard by the District Court. They corroborated the applicant\u2019s claim that no meetings had been held in the University departments and that no candidates had been nominated by open majority vote (see paragraph 6 above). The Court considers that by calling these four witnesses to testify before the District Court the applicant succeeded in showing that the impugned value judgment had a sufficient factual grounding, and that the situation described by the witnesses, namely the absence of an open discussion of candidates for the academic senate election, could have prompted him to speak the way he did. Against this background, the Court finds irrelevant the Government\u2019s argument about formal compliance of the election procedure with the University internal regulations. The applicant based his opinion about \u201cillegitimacy\u201d of the academic senate on his own assessment of facts which might be accurate or not (see Brosa v. Germany, no. 5709/09, \u00a7 45, 17 April 2014) and discharged the obligation to back up his statement with evidence.",

The most careful scrutiny on the part of the Court is called for when, as in the present case, the measures taken or sanctions imposed by the national authority are capable of discouraging participation in debates on matters of legitimate public concern (see Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 298). This means that the Convention inherently protects democratic principles through the freedom of expression applicable to any organisation. It is vital that democracy start much earlier than parliamentary elections; it starts at the level of local municipalities, associations and organisations.
