Thus, even if a media organ prepared a balanced and unbiased article on a matter of public interest, it could still be found to be in violation of the law. This would result in an undue burden for publishers, since they could only publish information whose veracity they had established beyond any doubt, making reporting on controversial matters impossible. The applicant company argued that the judicial practice was unconstitutional since it did not examine whether a publisher\u2019s conduct had been in compliance with the ethical and professional rules of journalism, but only whether it had disseminated an untrue statement. In the area of the Internet, where the news value of information was very short-lived, there was simply no time to verify the truthfulness of every statement.",

Specifically, in these situations the aim of a publication was neither to enrich nor to influence public debate with the journalists\u2019 own arguments, but to provide an up-to-date and credible report on the statements of third parties participating in public debates.

Without hyperlinks, most of the information on the Internet would be difficult or impossible to find and accessibility of information on the Internet would be reduced. Article 19 referred to comparative-law material concerning judicial decisions in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States, in particular, showing that hyperlinks alone did not constitute publication but were merely reference tools, similar to footnotes, offering readers the possibility of pursuing further reading of separate publications. Another reason, in the intervener\u2019s opinion, to exclude liability for hyperlinking was that the linked content was liable to change over time without the person who used the hyperlink being made aware of it. Furthermore, in Article 19\u2019s submission, no liability should be imposed unless the person who used the hyperlink was aware that the linked content was unlawful and where the hyperlink was presented in such a way as to expressly endorse the linked content. Lastly the intervener emphasised that holding someone who used a hyperlink liable for third-party content would have the farreaching consequence that a wide range of groups could be penalised for the content of websites over which they had no control, resulting in a chilling effect limiting Internet users\u2019 access to information.",

Hyperlinking also promoted diversity within the media and facilitated an informed public debate by allowing information and opinions to be more freely expressed and accessed. In the interveners\u2019 submission, the imposition of strict liability for hyperlinking had a chilling effect, since journalists were not in a position themselves to verify the legality of the content on any linked pages and as a consequence would rather refrain from this reporting technique in favour of a more traditional approach. They also pointed out that in practice hyperlinked content could itself be changed so that it ceased to be lawful by the entity which controlled the relevant web page, for which it would be unreasonable to hold the journalist responsible. The imposition of strict liability did not meet a pressing social need because anyone whose rights had been adversely affected by the placing of unlawful content online would be able to seek adequate protection by suing the person who had placed the unlawful content online and requesting that the injurious content be removed. The interveners accepted that there could be situations where a journalist\u2019s or journalistic organisation\u2019s liability arose, for example when they proclaimed specific unlawful content to be true or when they refused to remove a hyperlink to a web page which had been found by a court judgment to contain a substantial amount of illegal content.",

Denmark, 23 September 1994, \u00a7 35, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0298; Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, \u00a7 62, ECHR 2001III \u00a7 62; and Novaya Gazeta and Milashina v. Russia, no. 45083/06, \u00a7 71, 3\u00a0October 2017). A general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press\u2019s role of providing information on current events, opinions and ideas (see Thoma, cited above \u00a7 64). With these principles in mind, the Court would not rule out the possibility that, in certain particular constellations of circumstances, even the mere repetition of a statement, for example in addition to a hyperlink, may potentially engage the question of liability. This could include situations where a journalist does not act in good faith in accordance with the ethics of journalism and with the diligence expected in responsible journalism dealing with a matter of public interest (see in this respect, for example, Novaya Gazeta and Milashina, cited above, \u00a7 72). However, this was not the case in the present application, where, as observed above, the article in question repeated none of the defamatory statements, and the publication was indeed limited to posting the hyperlink.",

The Court also considers that this issue must be determined in the light of the situation as it presented itself to the author at the material time, rather than with the benefit of hindsight on the basis of the findings of the domestic courts\u2019 judgments. At this juncture, the Court reiterates that an attack on personal honour and reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and must have been carried out in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see Delfi AS, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0137, and Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7 83). Furthermore, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider as regards a politician \u2013 or a political party\u00a0\u2013 as such than as regards a private individual. Unlike private individuals, politicians and political parties inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance (see Lindon,\u00a0Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos.\u00a021279/02 and\u00a036448/02, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2007IV).",

Although the statements by J.Gy. were ultimately found to be defamatory because they implied, without a factual basis, that persons associated with Jobbik had committed acts of a racist nature, the Court is satisfied that such utterances could not be seen as clearly unlawful from the outset (contrast Delfi AS, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 136 and 140).",

Indeed, the courts held that the hyperlinking amounted to dissemination of information and imposed objective liability \u2013 a course of action that effectively precluded any balancing between the competing rights, that is to say, the right to reputation of the political party and the right to freedom of expression of the applicant company (see, mutatis mutandis, Magyar Tartalomszolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3k Egyes\u00fclete and Index.hu Zrt, cited above, \u00a7\u00a089). In the Court\u2019s view, such objective liability may have foreseeable negative consequences on the flow of information on the Internet, impelling article authors and publishers to refrain altogether from hyperlinking to material over whose changeable content they have no control. This may have, directly or indirectly, a chilling effect on freedom of expression on the Internet.",

As a technique of reporting, hyperlinking facilitates and improves the journalistic process by enabling content to be delivered more swiftly to users and enabling journalists to convey information that is more readily accessible and digestible. It also promotes diversity and pluralism in the media, which is substantively in the public interest, since through hyperlinking large and small media organisations are able to work together in a mutually beneficial manner to provide enriched content to users. Typically, journalists and journalistic organisations are not in a position to reassure themselves as to the legality of the content on any linked pages. Even if it were assumed for the sake of argument that larger media organisations may to a certain extent be able to weather the legal risks attendant on hyperlinking, it is plainly the case that smaller journalistic organisations, with far more limited resources, would have no choice but to abandon hyperlinking.",

Since the hyperlink is normally far removed from the actual content, a user facing a hyperlink is free to decide whether or not to move to the next website. If the user does not make the independent choice to follow the link, the content will never be displayed to him or her. This freedom of choice is crucial for media users. Hyperlinking enables users more readily to access and check for themselves the original sources of the journalistic content and to have a large measure of control over how they consume the content: they can either go no further than the journalistic content proffered to them or they can selectively look behind that content as they see fit.
