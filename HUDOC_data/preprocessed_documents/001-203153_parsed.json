In view of the fact that the majority of tenants living in dwellings belonging to former owners had retired and benefited from the old age pension or received financial aid, the court had made a determination that they would be obliged to use the entire pension or the financial aid towards the payment of the rent, rendering its allocation devoid of purpose and their subsequent accommodation untenable.

The three rules are not, however, distinct in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among other authorities, G.I.E.M.

The Court finds no reason to justify drawing a different conclusion.

The notion of \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cgeneral\u201d interest is necessarily extensive. In particular, spheres such as housing of the population, which modern societies consider a prime social need and which plays a central role in the welfare and economic policies of Contracting States, may often call for some form of regulation by the State. In that sphere decisions as to whether, and if so when, it may fully be left to the play of free market forces or whether it should be subject to State control, as well as the choice of measures for securing the housing needs of the community and of the timing for their implementation, necessarily involve consideration of complex social, economic and political issues. Finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, the Court has on many occasions declared that it will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is in the \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cgeneral\u201d interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see, amongst other authorities, Hutten-Czapska v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no. 35014/97, \u00a7\u00a7 165-66, ECHR 2006VIII, and Amato\u00a0Gauci v.

The requisite balance will not be struck where the person concerned bears an individual and excessive burden (see, amongst other authorities, Brum\u0103rescu v.

In cases concerning the operation of wide-ranging housing legislation, that assessment may involve not only the conditions of the rent received by individual landlords and the extent of the State\u2019s interference with freedom of contract and contractual relations in the lease market, but also the existence of procedural and other safeguards ensuring that the operation of the system and its impact on a landlord\u2019s property rights are neither arbitrary nor unforeseeable.

Slovakia, nos. 44218/07 and 3 others, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 28-33, 10 January 2017; Hutten-Czapska, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7154-225; and Mellacher and Others v.

In addition, and more importantly, the scheme was, from the outset, meant to be of limited time duration, with the State expressly assuming the responsibility for securing alternative housing solutions for the affected tenants during this transitional period (see paragraphs 23, 24 and 42 above). The Court further notes that, as a general rule, a tenancy agreement would normally be entered into voluntarily between the parties at a rent reflecting the market level at the time when the agreement was concluded. However, in the present case, as stated in paragraph 33 above, the tenancy agreements were created ex lege by the transfer of the previously existing tenancy agreements entered into between the tenants and the State. The applicant had no influence on the choice of the tenants or the essential elements of the tenancy agreements. He was subjected to a forced landlord-tenant relationship. Nor can it be argued that the applicant had implicitly waived his right to choose the tenants as he never had the possibility of exercising that right (see R & L, s.r.o., and Others v. the Czech Republic, cited above, \u00a7 106).",
