The investigation in case no. 25042 was instituted on 14\u00a0April 2001, that is twenty-one days after Adam Makharbiyev was taken away from the checkpoint and fourteen days after the authorities had officially been informed about it. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the abduction in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were either delayed or not taken at all. For instance, the investigators questioned the key witnesses to the abduction, Mr L.M. and Mr I.M., more than two years after the commencement of the investigation (see paragraphs 60 and 61 above). The investigation had not taken any steps to identify the servicemen who had been manning the checkpoint on the date of Adam Makharbiyev\u2019s abduction, nor did it question any of the servicemen at the military commander\u2019s office or the VOVD who might have had information about the fate of the disappeared man. In addition, no measures were taken to question the district military commander about the whereabouts of Adam Makharbiyev and his alleged absconding from the district military commander\u2019s office (see paragraphs 31, 40 and 52 above) or to obtain information from the Chernokozovo detention centre about Adam Makharbiyev\u2019s alleged detention there (see paragraph 33, 41 and 58 above). It is obvious that these basic investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, or as soon as the investigation commenced and the relevant information was received. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

The Court observes that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged acts or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this respect that while the suspension or reopening of proceedings is not in itself a sign that the proceedings are ineffective, in the present case the decisions to suspend the investigation were made without the necessary steps being taken, which led to numerous periods of inactivity and thus unnecessary protraction. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be taken. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

Having regard to its above conclusions, it finds that there is a direct causal link between the violation of Article\u00a02 in respect of the applicants\u2019 relative and the loss by the applicants of the financial support which he could have provided. Having regard to the applicants\u2019 submissions and the fact that Adam Makharbiyev was not employed at the time of his abduction, the Court awards EUR\u00a07,000 to the first and second applicants jointly and EUR\u00a010,000 to the third, fourth and fifth applicants jointly in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
