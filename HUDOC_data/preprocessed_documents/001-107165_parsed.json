The Supreme Court acknowledged the existence of these difficulties in its resolution of 26 September 2002. It considered it necessary to adopt a resolution clarifying certain procedural aspects of judicial secondments. It held that the practice by certain presidents of courts of seconding judges \u201cfor the examination of a particular case\u201d, without setting precise temporal limits, was inappropriate. The Supreme Court held that the temporal limitation was of significant importance as it served the purposes of preserving judicial independence.

In a number of cases that court held that the absence of a formal decision on a judge\u2019s assignment rendered the proceedings void. In another decision it was stated that the assignment should indicate either the dates of hearings or the precise dates of other measures, if a judge was seconded for purposes other than a hearing (see paragraph 28 above).
