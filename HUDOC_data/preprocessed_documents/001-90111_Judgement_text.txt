The case originated in an application (no. 14790/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Cypriot national, Mr Costas Mylonas (“the applicant”), on 3 April 2006.
The applicant was represented by Mr Ch. Clerides, a lawyer practising in . The Cypriot Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Clerides, Attorney-General of the .
On 13 September 2007 the President of the First Section decided to communicate the applicant’s complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect. Furthermore, the Court decided to communicate to the Government the applicant’s complaints as to the alleged repercussions of the length of the proceedings on the applicant’s rights under Articles 6 of the Convention (access to court) and 1 of Protocol No. 1. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, the Court decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in .
On 31 August 1995 the applicant filed an action before the District Court of Nicosia (no. 7992/95) under the Property Relations of Spouses and other Related Matters Law of 1991 (hereinafter “Law 232/91”) claiming recovery of part of the increase in his wife’s property by reason of his contribution during their marriage. An interim injunction was granted on that date in his favour.
In his affidavit of 31 August 1995 the applicant stated that the separation had started in June 1992 even though he and his wife were still living in the same house.
On 5 April 1996, following an amendment to Law 232/91 (see paragraph 49 below) the Nicosia Family Court became the competent court to adjudicate on the application. On 9 May 1996 the action was transferred to that court by virtue of (Amending) Law 34(1)/96, as an application (application no. 46/96; hereinafter “main application”).
On 13 June 1996 the main application and the interim injunction were adjourned until 19 September 1996 at the parties’ request. On that date the main application was adjourned until 17 October 1996.
On 17 October 1996 the court made the injunction absolute and fixed the case for mention for 21 November 2006. It ordered that the applicant file his statement of claim by that date.
On 21 January 1997 the applicant filed his statement of claim, on 26 June 1997 his former wife (hereinafter “the respondent”) filed her defence and counter-claim and on 14 October 1997 the applicant filed his reply and his defence to the counter-claim. It appears from the court record of the proceedings that the main application was fixed for mention several times in order to give time to the parties to file their pleadings.
In his statement of claim the applicant alleged that he had separated from his wife on the 22 September 1995. The respondent in her defence and counter-claim stated that the applicant had abandoned the family home on or around 22 September 1995 but that they had been separated since the summer of 1992 despite living under the same roof.
In the meantime, on 21 January 1997 a divorce order was issued by the Nicosia Family Court (divorce jurisdiction) dissolving the marriage.
On 16 October 1997 the court, at the parties’ request, fixed the main application for hearing for 15 January 1998. On the latter date, again at the parties’ request, the main application was fixed for mention for 19 February 1998. On the latter date it was adjourned three consecutive times until 12 November 1998, always at the parties’ request.
In the meantime an interim application was filed by the respondent on 9 November 1998.
On 12 November 1998 the interim application was fixed for mention for 19 November 1998 in order to settle the matter of the composition of the court. It was fixed for mention, for the same reason, twice more until 3 December 1998 and then for 18 March 1999 at the parties’ request. The main application was also fixed for hearing on the latter date.
On 18 March 1999 the hearing of the main application was adjourned until 10 June 1999 and the interim application was fixed for 13 May 1999 and then, on that date, for 10 June 1999.
On the latter date the interim application was fixed for hearing for 10 September 1999. The main application was also adjourned to 12 November 1999 as the applicant’s lawyer had to attend another hearing.
On 10 September 1999 the parties requested that the interim application be fixed for mention the same day as the hearing of the main application. It was therefore adjourned until 12 November 1999.
On the above date the parties requested that the main application be fixed for scheduling for the purposes of reaching a friendly settlement. The court set down the main application for 20 January 2000.
On 18 January 2000 the respondent appointed a new lawyer.
On 20 January 2000 the applicant’s lawyer requested additional time in order to examine the friendly settlement proposals made by the respondent. The main application was set for scheduling for 10 February 2000. On that date the applicant’s lawyer informed the court that the friendly settlement negotiations had failed and requested that the application be set for hearing. At the parties’ request the court fixed the main application for hearing on 21 April 2000.
On 10 March 2000 the applicant appointed a new lawyer.
On 20 April 2000 the court rescheduled the main application for 12 May 2000.
In the meantime, on 7 April 2000 the respondent filed an interim application which she withdrew on 12 May 2000. On the latter date the applicant requested additional time in order to file an application for the amendment of his statement of claim and that the main application be fixed for scheduling on 8 June 2000.
On 24 May 2000 the respondent filed another interim application.
On 8 June 2000 the applicant requested additional time in order to file an opposition to the interim application. The court fixed the main application and the interim application for scheduling on 22 June 2000. On that date the applicant requested an extension for filing the opposition. Both applications were then fixed for 30 June 2000.
On 30 June 2000 the applicant filed an application by summons to amend his statement of claim and requested an extension in order to file an opposition. The respondent also requested time to consider the possible amendment of the interim application. The court fixed the interim applications and the main application for 28 September 2000.
On the above date the court adjourned the main application for scheduling on 6 October 2000 as the presiding judge was absent for health reasons.
On 6 October 2000 the parties were granted leave to file amended pleadings and the main application was fixed for scheduling on 8 November 2000. At the parties’ request the interim application of 24 May 2000 was also adjourned to 8 November 2000 for mention.
The applicant filed his amended statement of claim on 16 October 2000. In this it was stated that the parties had lived under the same roof until 22 September 1995 when the applicant abandoned the family home and that the parties had been separated since that date.
On 8 November 2000 the respondent withdrew her interim application of 24 May 2000. The main application was then adjourned twice until 31 January 2001 at the respondent’s request, to allow her to appoint a new lawyer.
On 29 January 2001 the court rescheduled the main application for 22 February 2001.
The respondent appointed a new lawyer on 30 January 2001.
On 22 February 2001 the respondent’s new lawyer requested time in order to file the defence and counter-claim to the amended statement of claim. The main application was then fixed for 16 March 2001. The respondent asked for additional time to file her defence. With no objection on the part of the applicant, the main application was adjourned to 11 April 2001.
On 5 April 2001 the respondent filed an ex parte application for an order of the court granting her an extension of one month for the purpose of filing her defence to the amended statement of claim. However, the respondent withdrew the application on 11 April 2004 and asked the court for an extension of ten days to file her defence. There was no objection on the applicant’s part. The main application was then fixed for 24 April 2001 and then for hearing on 28 June 2001.
The respondent filed her defence to the amended statement of claim and her counter-claim on 19 April 2001. In this she claimed that the applicant had abandoned the family home on 22 September 1995 and that the separation had occurred on that date.
On 24 April 2001, the applicant filed his reply and defence to the counter-claim.
On 28 June 2001 the applicant’s lawyer requested an adjournment. With the consent of the respondent, the hearing of the main application was set for 8 and 9 November 2001. On that date the hearing was adjourned until 29 November 2001 at the applicant’s lawyer’s request.
The hearing of the main application commenced on 9 November 2001 and was concluded on 29 July 2003. During this period the Court held approximately twenty-nine hearing sessions (on average two sessions per month). The hearing was adjourned seven times: four times at the applicant’s request, twice at the respondent’s request and once because the respondent’s lawyer arrived two hours late for the hearing. Furthermore the hearing was rescheduled once for a week but the reasons for this do not appear in the court record.
During the proceedings a total of fifty-three witnesses were heard and seventy-seven exhibits were put before the court.
Furthermore, at one point during the proceedings the applicant claimed that the date in his statement of claim determining the date of separation had been wrong and that the court should make an amendment to this effect ex officio.
On 23 January 2004 the Nicosia Family Court dismissed the main application as premature since none of the conditions provided for in section 14 (1) of Law 232/91 were satisfied when the applicant filed the action on 31 August 1995: the parties had not been divorced or separated at the time. In this respect it noted, firstly, that the divorce had come through in 1997 and secondly, that the parties had separated on 22 September 1995. The court found that it had been clear from the parties’ pleadings and their oral evidence before it that separation had actually taken place on 22 September 1995. It held that the court could not amend the statement of claim ex officio, as suggested by the applicant, since the date of separation was the crucial time for the calculation of the increase in property and all the evidence provided by the parties’ valuation experts had taken as the time of termination the date when the parties had separated, namely, 22 September 1995. Furthermore, no evidence had been put before the court with regard to any other date of separation. The court also noted that it had pointed out this issue to the parties in good time so if the applicant had so wished he had had the time to file an application to amend his statement of claim. However, he did not file such an application. Finally, the court dismissed the respondent’s counter-claim as being unsubstantiated.
On 2 March 2004 the applicant filed an appeal (no. 193) before the Family Court of Appeal against the first instance judgment. The applicant raised a number of issues in his grounds for appeal, including the following: the first instance court’s finding that his application had been premature was incorrect since it had been clear from the evidence that he had separated from his wife well before September 1995; the first instance court had erred in its evaluation of the evidence in this respect and had not taken all the evidence into account; the undue length of the proceedings had “deprived the appellant of numerous and significant ... procedural rights” in violation of the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time.
On 6 October 2005 the Family Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The court upheld the findings of the first instance court. It rejected the applicant’s argument that the conclusion as to the date of separation was wrong. It noted that this argument, as stated in the grounds of appeal, had been vague and unsubstantiated and that as a result the court had had to verify all the minutes of the evidence taken. In this respect the court observed that it had been clear from the minutes that both parties had stated, when asked during oral evidence, that they had separated in September 1995. The court observed in this connection that the evidence given by the parties themselves as to when separation occurred was a significant element in determining the time of separation, especially when, as in the present application, the parties agreed.
Addressing the applicant’s complaint concerning the length of the proceedings, the court found that the trial at first instance had been long and laborious as the parties, instead of accepting in a civilised manner the breakdown of their marriage and seeking a reasonable and fair solution to their property disputes or other matters which resulted from the break-up of the relationship, had found in the court procedure an arena for the display of an antagonistic and selfish attitude towards each other. Although the proceedings had been long and slow, this had been exclusively due to the parties’ conduct. In this connection, the court noted, inter alia, that the parties had been tardy in the filing of their pleadings, had filed a number of interim applications and that the trial dates had been set on dates to facilitate the lawyers’ attendance. Furthermore, extensive evidence had been put before the court. The Family Court of Appeal therefore found that the applicant’s allegations in this respect had been wrong and unfair. Finally, it observed that the applicant’s claims before it as to the consequences of the length of the proceedings, in particular, that “if the trial had been conducted within a reasonable time the applicant would have had access to elements which would have helped him with his application”, had been vague.
Article 30 of the Constitution provides as follows, in so far as relevant:
“1. No person shall be denied access to the court assigned to him by or under this Constitution. ...
“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., every person is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by an independent, impartial and competent court...”
Article 144 reads as follows:
“1. A party to any judicial proceedings, including proceedings on appeal, may, at any stage thereof, raise the question of the unconstitutionality of any law or decision or any provision thereof material for the determination of any matter at issue in such proceedings and thereupon the Court before which such question is raised shall reserve the question for the decision of the Supreme Constitutional Court and stay further proceedings until such question is determined by the Supreme Constitutional Court.
The Supreme Constitutional Court, on a question so reserved, shall, after hearing the parties, consider and determine the question so reserved and transmit its decision to the Court by which such question has been reserved.
Any decision of the Supreme Constitutional Court under paragraph 2 of this Article shall be binding on the court by which the question has been reserved and on the parties to the proceedings and shall, in case such decision is to the effect that the law or decision or any provision thereof is unconstitutional, operate as to make such law or decision inapplicable to such proceedings only.”
When issues of constitutionality arise before the Family Courts, these are to be referred to the Supreme Court in accordance with the above provision (Application by Nausika Nicolaou and an other (1991) 1 C.L.R. 1045).
In accordance with the Property Relations of Spouses and other Related Matters Law (Law 232/91) which came into force on 30 December 1991 property disputes between spouses were heard by the District Court. Amending legislation which came into force on 5 April 1996 gave this competence to the Family Courts (Amending Law 34(I) of 1996).
By virtue of section 3 of Law 34(1)/96 interim provision was made for the referral of actions, such as the one in the present application, from the District Court to the Family Court:
“Proceedings pending on the date when this law comes into force whose subject matter concerns property disputes on the basis of Article 2 of the Family Courts Law, as amended by the Family Courts (Amending) Law of 1996, remain and are completed before the District Courts provided that the hearing process before them has commenced with the statements of witnesses, otherwise they are referred at the stage which they are at to the competent Family Court.”
Section 14 of Law 232/91 (as amended by Law 49(1)/95) provided as follows:
“14. (1) In the case where the marriage has been dissolved or annulled, or in the case of separation of the spouses, and the property of the one spouse has increased since the marriage was solemnised, the other spouse, provided that he or she has contributed in any way whatsoever to this increase, is entitled to bring an action before the Court and to claim recovery of the part of the increase which comes from his/her contribution.”
By the Family Courts (Amending) law of 1996 (Law 33(1)/96) the following definition of “property relations” was added:
“property relations” means the relations which concern the movable and immovable property which was acquired after marriage by either one of the spouses, in accordance with the provisions of the Law on the Regulation of the Property Relations of Spouses.”
Under section 15, actions provided for by section 14 have to be filed within two years after the dissolution or annulment of the marriage.
Section 4 of Amending Law 25(I)/1998 made special provision for the filing of claims after dissolution of marriage where a claim which had previously been filed before the District Court after separation was pending before that court on 16 April 1998, that is the entry into force of the amending law, or before the Family Court, following referral under the 1996 transitional provisions. According to section 4:
“Irrespective of the provisions of section 15 (a), claims under section 14 which are or were the subject-matter of a procedure which is pending before the District Court or before a Family Court to which it had been referred by a District Court in accordance with the provisions of section 3 of the Regulation of Spouses’ Property relations (Amendment) Law of 1996, can be submitted to the Family Courts within one year from the date of entry into force of the present law”.
This provision covers property contribution claims under section 14 which had been filed by spouses before District Courts after their separation, and following the 1996 transfer of jurisdiction from those courts to the Family Courts, they either continued by virtue of the 1996 transitional provisions to be dealt with by the District Courts if at the hearing stage, or were transferred to Family Courts.
