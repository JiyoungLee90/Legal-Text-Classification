The case originated in two applications (nos. 56193/00 and 57581/00) against the Slovak Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Ms E.O., a Slovakian national (“the first applicant”) and Mr V.P., a Czech national (“the second applicant”), on 3 December 1999 and 11 May 2000 respectively.
The applicants were represented by Mr I. Gažík, a lawyer practising in Prievidza. The Government of the  (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Vršanský, succeeded by Mr P. Kresák as from 1 April 2003.
The applicants alleged, in particular, that their rights under Articles 6 § 1, 8 and 13 had been violated in the context of proceedings concerning the right to educate a child of whom the first applicant is the grand-mother and who is the daughter of the second applicant.
The applications were allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the cases (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). These cases were assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The Chamber decided to join the proceedings in the applications (Rule 42 § 1).
By a decision of 16 September 2003, the Court declared the applications partly admissible.
On 9 October 2003 the President of the Chamber granted leave to Ms Z.M., the mother of the child whose education was at stake in the proceedings under consideration, to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 61 § 3, as in force at the relevant time).
On 8 December 2003, after having consulted the applicants, the President of the Chamber acceded to the request of Ms Z.M. that the identity of the applicants and the members of the child's family should not be disclosed to the public (Rule 47 § 3). At the same time the President of the Chamber made a ruling under Rule 33 § 1 to the effect that the relevant documents included in the file should remain confidential.
The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). In addition, third-party comments were received from Ms Z.M.. The applicants replied to those comments (Rule 44 § 5).
On 8 January 1996 the first applicant filed an action claiming that she should be granted the right to educate her granddaughter of whom the second applicant is the father.
The girl, who had been born to the first applicant's daughter, was then fourteen years old. The marriage of the second applicant and the first applicant's daughter had been terminated by a decision which had become final on 18 July 1985. The decision granted the custody of the child to the mother. In 1993 the mother married abroad and established her and her daughter's permanent residence there. At the time when the first applicant brought her action, the child and the mother were on a temporary stay in .
In her action of 8 January 1996 the first applicant relied on Section 45 of the Family Act and explained that her daughter had failed to take proper care of the girl. She further submitted that the second applicant was in agreement with her proposal. She also claimed that the parents be ordered to contribute to the child's maintenance.
In January and February 1996 the Dunajská Streda District Court took several procedural steps. On 14 February 1996 the District Court appointed the Veľký Meder District Office to represent the interests of the child in the context of the proceedings. On 19 February 1996 the child's mother appealed against this decision. She claimed that the child's father was in arrears with payment of maintenance and that the officials of the District Office had failed to take appropriate action in that respect.
The District Court had also before it a request for adoption of the child lodged by the husband of the child's mother. The request was later withdrawn and the proceedings discontinued.
A hearing scheduled for 28 February 1996 had to be adjourned as the child's mother was ill.
The court heard the parties on 15 April 1996. On that date the second applicant joined the proceedings and claimed that the first applicant's action be granted.
In April and May 1996 the child's mother sought to disqualify the judge dealing with the case as well as the entire bench of the District Court. For this reason the hearing scheduled for 13 May 1996 was adjourned. The case file was submitted to the  for a decision on the request for disqualification of the judges.
Subsequently the girl was placed in a psychiatric hospital.
On 31 May 1996 the District Office in Veľký Meder issued an interim measure ordering that the child was to be temporarily placed in the first applicant's care. Reference was made to the conclusions of a psychiatrist who treated the child. The decision stated that the child's mother had married abroad in 1993 and that since then the relations between the child and the mother had deteriorated. According to the decision, the girl had expressed the wish to live with her grandparents.
The child's mother refused to comply with the order. Upon the child's release from the psychiatric hospital the mother and the girl went abroad to where their place of permanent residence was.
On 4 July 1996 the Dunajská Streda District Prosecutor joined the proceedings.
On 11 July 1996 the  sent the file back to the District Court and instructed it to invite the child's mother to specify her objection to the District Court judges. Subsequently the police informed the District Court that the child and her mother had left  in June 1996.
On 26 August 1996 the first applicant requested the District Court to issue an interim measure granting her the custody of the child pending the outcome of the proceedings.
The case file was again sent to the  in September 1996. On 18 October 1996 the  returned the file to the District Court after having decided that the latter's judges were not biased.
A hearing before the District Court was held on 28 November 1996. Following their arrival for another temporary stay in , the District Court heard the mother and her husband on 5 December 1996. It also heard the girl on 10 December 1996.
On 18 December 1996 the case was adjourned and on 19 December 1996 the District Court dismissed the first applicant's request for an interim measure to be issued. The decision stated that at that time the mother and the child lived in . The court noted that the girl had stated before it, on 10 December 1996, that she wished to stay with her mother.
On 16 January 1997 the court heard witnesses.
On 30 January 1997 the court appointed an expert with a view to obtaining an opinion on the child.
On 13 February 1997 the expert informed the District Court that she was not in a position to submit an opinion because of a heavy workload.
The second applicant requested that his daughter be prevented from travelling abroad without his consent. On 21 February 1997 the District Court dismissed the request.
Hearings were scheduled for 18 February 1997 and 6 March 1997. On the latter date the District Court heard the parties. The case was adjourned as the court considered it necessary to obtain an expert opinion.
On 7 March 1997 the child's mother filed an appeal “against all decisions” delivered by the judge dealing with the case.
On 10 March 1997 the second applicant appealed against the District Court's decision of 21 February 1997. He also claimed that his right to meet his daughter should be determined by the court.
On 20 March 1997 the mother of the child requested that further documentary evidence be taken.
On 1 April 1997 the case was assigned to a different judge.
On the same day the second applicant's daughter informed the court in writing that she did not wish to meet her father and that she lived abroad where she was undergoing treatment.
On 13 May 1997 the District Court submitted the case file to the  for a decision on the appeals filed by the parties. On 23 June 1997 the  returned the file to the District Court and asked the latter to ensure that formal shortcomings in the mother's appeal of 7 March 1997 be eliminated. It further dismissed the child's appeal against the decision on appointment of an expert and quashed the above District Court's decision of 21 February 1997.
On 4 July and on 5 August 1997 the judge asked the mother of the child to eliminate shortcomings in her submissions.
On 15 September 1997 the grandfather of the child informed the court that his daughter and granddaughter were staying abroad.
On 24 October 1997 the second applicant informed the court that his former wife had left , together with their daughter, on 6 May 1997.
In November 1997 and in January 1998 the court attempted to establish the address of the child and her mother. The information was submitted to it by the police on 29 January 1998.
On 24 February 1998 the District Court issued an interim measure in which, inter alia, it prohibited the mother and the child from travelling abroad. At that time both the mother and the child were abroad. On 25 March 1998 the husband of the child's mother appealed against this decision. The applicants and the child's mother also appealed.
On 14 April 1998 the case file was submitted to the President of the . He returned the file to the District Court on 7 May 1998.
On 8 July 1998, after having taken several procedural steps, the District Court re-submitted the file to the  for a decision on the appeals against the decision of 24 February 1998.
On 26 August 1998 the  quashed the District Court's decision to the extent that it prohibited the mother and the child from travelling abroad. The case file was returned to the District Court on 4 September 1998. On 11 November 1998 and on 10 March 1999 the judge arranged for the 's decision to be served on the parties.
On 28 October 1998 the child's mother requested that further evidence be taken. On 10 December 1998 she informed the District Court that she had withdrawn the authority of her husband to represent her in the proceedings.
The District Court judge dealing with the case was ill for considerable periods of time between August 1998 and January 1999 and also between March and May 1999.
On 21 April 1999 the  found that the first applicant's constitutional right to a hearing without undue delays had been violated. In its decision the  admitted that the length of the proceedings was due, to a certain extent, to the behaviour of the child's mother and her husband. However, the case was not particularly complex and what was at stake in the proceedings called for particular diligence. The Constitutional Court further noted that the District Court had caused undue delays in the proceedings in that, by failing to issue in time an interim measure restricting the mother's and the child's right to travel abroad, it had brought about the need to ask foreign authorities for assistance. Furthermore, by the time the  decided on the case, the District Court judge had not yet arranged for such a request to be sent to the authorities concerned.
The 's decision stated that the District Court had not proceeded with the case efficiently in that it had failed to take evidence, including an expert opinion, required for a decision on the case. Delays in the proceedings had also arisen as a result of the ordinary courts' failure to decide on the requests for an interim measure to be issued within the statutory time-limit. Finally, the  noted that the District Court had failed to take any effective action in the case since 4 September 1998.
On 3 September 1999 the District Court judge prepared a request for assistance which was to be submitted to foreign authorities through the Ministry of Justice.
By two decisions delivered on 21 January 2000 the Dunajská Streda District Court discontinued both the proceedings on the first applicant's claim of 8 January 1996 and on the second applicant's claim of 10 March 1997. The decisions stated that the second applicant's daughter had reached her majority at the end of 1999.
Article 16(1) guarantees to everyone the respect for his or her privacy.
Pursuant to Article 19(1), everybody has the right to protection of human dignity, personal honour as well as of good reputation and name. Paragraph 2 of Article 19 provides that everybody has the right to protection against unjustified interference with his or her private and family life. Paragraph 3 of Article 19 guarantees the right to protection against unjustified collection, publication or other misuse of data about his or her person.
Article 48(2) provides, inter alia, that every person has the right to have his or her case tried without unjustified delay.
Pursuant to Article 130(3), as in force until 30 June 2001, the  could commence proceedings upon a petition (“podnet”) presented by any individual or a corporation claiming that their rights had been violated. According to its case-law under the former Article 130(3) of the Constitution, the  lacked jurisdiction to draw legal consequences from a violation of a petitioner's rights under Article 48(2) of the Constitution. It could neither grant damages to the person concerned nor impose a sanction on the public authority liable for the violation found. In the 's view, it was therefore for the authority concerned to provide redress to the person whose rights were violated.
As from 1 January 2002, the Constitution has been amended in that, inter alia, individuals and legal persons can complain about a violation of their fundamental rights and freedoms pursuant to Article 127. Under this provision the  has the power, in the event that it finds a violation of Article 48(2) of the Constitution, to order the authority concerned to proceed with the case without delay. It may also grant adequate financial satisfaction to the person whose constitutional rights have been violated as a result of excessive length of proceedings (for further details see, e.g., Andrášik and Others v. Slovakia (dec.), nos. 57984/00, 60237/00, 60242/00, 60679/00, 60680/00, 68563/01, 60226/00, 22 October 2002).
According to Article 11, every natural person has the right to protection of his or her personality, in particular of his or her life and health, civil and human dignity, privacy, name and personal characteristics.
Pursuant to Article 13(1), every natural person has the right to request that an unjustified infringement of his or her personal rights should be stopped and the consequences of such infringement eliminated, and to obtain appropriate satisfaction.
Article 13(2) provides that in cases where the satisfaction obtained under Article 13(1) is insufficient, in particular because a person's dignity and position in society has been considerably diminished, the injured person is entitled to compensation for non-pecuniary damage. According to paragraph 3 of Article 13, when determining the amount of such compensation the courts have to take into account the seriousness of the prejudice suffered by the person concerned and also the circumstances under which the violation of that person's rights occurred.
Pursuant to Section 45(1), a court may empower a person other than parents to educate a child when the interests of the child so require and provided that such a person offers the guarantee of educating the child in an appropriate manner. In doing so the court shall determine the scope of rights and obligations such a person shall have in respect of the child.
Under Section 176, courts shall ensure that parents or guardians take proper care of persons under age. They shall examine information and respond to petitions submitted by citizens or legal persons which concern the education of a minor and take appropriate measures in that respect.
In decision No. II. ÚS 47/97 of 27 October 1997 the Constitutional Court found, in proceedings under Article 130(3) of the Constitution, a violation of provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in conjunction with Article 19(2) of the Constitution. The decision stated that a social care authority had failed to take appropriate action with a view to preventing a minor from repeated attacks by other children from the neighbourhood. Prior to addressing herself to the  the child's mother sought redress with the police and with a public prosecutor. In the proceedings before the  the administrative authority concerned unsuccessfully argued that the case fell within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts.
In decision No. I. ÚS 22/01 of 10 July 2002 the Constitutional Court found a violation of Article 19(2) of the Constitution on the ground that an administrative authority had included a minor's name on the register of juvenile delinquents and that the police and a public prosecutor had acted erroneously in that context. In deciding on the case the  also had regard to the Court's case-law under Article 8 of the Convention. Prior to bringing the case to the  the persons concerned did not seek redress before the ordinary courts.
In decision No. I. ÚS 9/00 of 22 March 2000 the Constitutional Court expressed the view that ordinary courts are obliged, in the context of civil proceedings, to interpret and to apply the relevant laws in accordance with the Constitution and with an international treaty. According to the decision, ordinary courts are therefore primarily responsible for respecting rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution or an international treaty.
In decision No. I. ÚS 2/00 of 5 January 2000 the Constitutional Court declared inadmissible a petition in which the plaintiff alleged a violation of Article 19 of the Constitution in that public authorities systematically requested that he should submit his higher education diploma to them. The decision stated that the plaintiff should have sought the protection of the alleged violation of his rights under Article 19(1) of the Constitution by means of an action for protection of his personal rights pursuant to Article 11 et seq. of the Civil Code.
In decision No. II. ÚS 23/00 of 23 March 2000 the Constitutional Court rejected, for lack of jurisdiction, a petition in which the plaintiff had complained about a violation of his rights under Article 19(2) and (3) of the Constitution on the ground that the Minister of Justice had asked him to submit, as president of a District Court, information about his material situation. The  held that the issue fell within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts which had power to deal with it under Articles 11 et seq. of the Civil Code.
In decision No. II. ÚS 94/95 of 13 December 1995 the Constitutional Court held that the purpose of the right to privacy under Article 16 of the Constitution was not only to protect rights guaranteed by Articles 11 et seq. of the Civil Code, but also to prevent unjustified interference by public authorities with individuals' private lives. The purpose of the constitutional right to privacy corresponded  to, inter alia, Article 8 of the Convention.
In this context a former constitutional judge expressed the view that the constitutional right to privacy was not identical with the right to privacy guaranteed by the Civil Code. The latter was a part of the former. However, other legal provisions, such as those included in the Family Act, were also relevant for compliance with the constitutional right of privacy (see J. Drgonec - Základné práva a slobody podľa Ústavy Slovenskej republiky, 1997).
