However, the right of access to the courts is not absolute but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access by its very nature calls for regulation by the State, regulation which may vary in time and in place according to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals. In laying down such regulation, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. Nonetheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (Stanev v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a036760/06, \u00a7\u00a7 229-230, ECHR 2012).",

Accordingly, the Court considers that there is no call to award her any sum on that account. Nevertheless, the Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress for a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 would be to ensure that the applicants, as far as possible, are put in the position in which they would have been had this provision not been disregarded (see Mehmet and Suna Yi\u011fit, cited above, \u00a7 47). The Court finds that this principle applies in the present case as well. Consequently, it considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to quash or otherwise set aside the \u0130zmir Administrative Court\u2019s decision dated 20 April 2005 (paragraph 10 above) and continue the proceedings, in accordance with the requirements of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, should the applicant so request.",
