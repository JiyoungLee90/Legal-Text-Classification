Taken together with Article 15 of the Constitution, these provisions provided for a fundamental right to effective judicial proceedings. The right to an effective remedy also encompassed the right to claim that the proceedings took place within a reasonable time. The Supreme Court also made reference to the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and to the right to an effective remedy in Article 13 of the Convention. The Supreme Court found that the State Liability Act (Riigivastutuse seadus) did not provide for compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by excessive length of a preliminary investigation in criminal proceedings, declared it unconstitutional in this respect and awarded the complainant a sum of money relying on Article 25 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court further considered that the enactment of a special regulation for compensation for damage arising from criminal proceedings was required (for a more extensive summary of the judgment, see Raudsepp v.

Luxembourg, no. 30273/07, \u00a7 50, 11 February 2010). Having regard to the fact that in the present case the applicant lodged her application with the Court on 17 November 2010, after the domestic proceedings had lasted for more than seven years, the fact that the domestic remedy in question was developed by case-law without any specific transitional provisions concerning cases pending before the Strasbourg Court having been enacted and considering the small number of similar cases in respect of the Contracting Party concerned, the Court considers that there are no particular circumstances in this case to justify departing from the general rule that the assessment of whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is carried out with reference to the date on which the application was lodged with the Court (compare, for example, Parizov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a014258/03, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, 7 February 2008, and Eriksson v.\u00a0Sweden, no. 60437/08, \u00a7 53, 12 April 2012).
