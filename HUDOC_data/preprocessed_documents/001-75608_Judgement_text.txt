The case originated in an application (no. 42281/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Ms Gabrijela Vodeb (“the applicant”), on 29 November 2002.
The applicant was represented by the Verstovšek lawyers. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, State Attorney-General.
The applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts to which she was a party was excessive. In substance, she also complained about the lack of an effective domestic remedy in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings (Article 13 of the Convention).
On 15 September 2004 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Kalobje.
On 5 February 1996 the applicant fell on the ice-covered pavement. The company who was responsible for cleaning the pavement had insured its liability with the insurance company ZT.
On 20 January 1999 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZT in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 4,494,208 tolars (approximately 18,750 euros) for the injuries sustained.
On 27 September 1999 and 20 November 2002 the applicant requested that a date be set for a hearing.
Between 22 December 1999 and 7 March 2002 she lodged three preliminary written submissions and/or adduced evidence.
Of the four hearings held between 8 May 2001 and 15 April 2003 none was adjourned at the request of the applicant.
During the proceedings the court appointed a medical expert. The court also sought an additional opinion from the appointed expert.
On 21 October 2002 the applicant and ZT reached a friendly settlement and she withdrew a part of her claim. She continued to seek redress for daily damages.
At the last hearing the court decided to deliver a written judgment. The judgment, upholding the applicant’s claim in part, was served on the applicant on 16 June 2003.
