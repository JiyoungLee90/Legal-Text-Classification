The first applicant submitted that her son had been a student aged seventeen and that his brother had been unemployed, but that in the future she would have benefited from his financial support (paragraph 151). The text of the judgment reproduces the second applicant\u2019s argument that \u201calthough her son had been unemployed at the time of his disappearance as he had been only fifteen years old, according to the regional tradition he was supposed to become the breadwinner for his parents as the youngest son in the family\u201d (paragraph\u00a0153).

The Court indirectly agrees with this argument: \u201c[t]he Court notes that the applicants\u2019 sons were unemployed at the time and, being only fifteen and seventeen years old, were dependent on the applicants\u201d (paragraph 155). But it appears that this conclusion is counterbalanced by others, namely that \u201cthe applicants\u2019 sons were close to coming of age\u201d and \u201cthey would eventually [sic!] have had some earnings\u201d...",
