Irrespective of the lack of legal consequences for the partner, the arrival of a child would change the balance of the receiving couple and the family unit, and an adopted child's previous history made it all the more important to assess the solidity of a couple's approach to any plan to adopt. Accordingly, apart from the fact that R. would necessarily be involved in the child's day-to-day life, her lack of involvement could be seen as a source of insecurity for the child with the risk that the child would find him or herself in competition with the applicant's partner for the applicant's time and affection.

Those best interests were central to many international instruments binding on . There was no right to a child or right to authorisation to adopt one.

With regard to whether a difference in treatment was justified, and after observing that there was no common ground between the legal systems of the Contracting States, the Chamber found it quite natural that the national authorities should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation when they were asked to make rulings on such matters, subject to review by the Court (\u00a7 41). Having regard to the competing interests of the applicant and children who were eligible for adoption, and to the paramountcy of the latter's best interests, it noted that the scientific community was divided over the possible consequences of a child being adopted by one or more homosexual parents, that there were wide differences in national and international opinion and that there were not enough children to adopt to satisfy demand (\u00a7 42). Taking account of the broad margin of appreciation to be left to States in this area and to the need to protect children's best interests to achieve the desired balance, the Chamber considered that the refusal to authorise adoption had not infringed the principle of proportionality and that, accordingly, the justification given by the Government appeared objective and reasonable and the difference in treatment complained of was not discriminatory within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention (\u00a7\u00a7 42 and 43).",

Accordingly, where a male or female applicant, although unmarried, has already set up home with a partner, that partner's attitude and the role he or she will necessarily play on a daily basis in the life of the child joining the home set-up require a full examination in the child's best interests.

A typical example of this is the recent case of Ismailova v. Russia, judgment in which was delivered by the First Section on 29 November 2007. There, the applicant complained that the decisions of the domestic courts granting custody of her two children to their father had been in breach of Article 8 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 14, as they amounted to discrimination on the ground of her religion.

However, I cannot forget that for centuries adoption, an age-old procedure that is known throughout most countries in the world, was the only means whereby couples unable to conceive could found a family with children. While it is undisputed that Article 8 does not guarantee a right to found a family, such a right is, however, guaranteed by Article 12 of the Convention. And whilst a \u201cright\u201d to adopt does not exist, I consider, in the light of our case-law, which over the years has brought more and more rights and possibilities within the ambit of Article 8, that the time has come for the Court to assert that the possibility of applying to adopt a child under the domestic law falls within the ambit of Article 8. Consequently, Article 14 would be applicable.",

No right to adoption is recognised by domestic legislation or by the relevant international instruments, and the parties do not dispute this. On the other hand, we should establish \u2013 and this absolutely must be done and done clearly \u2013 whether the possibility of adopting a child afforded by domestic legislation does or does not fall within the ambit of Article 8.

To my mind, the decision whether or not to grant single persons the possibility of adopting a child is within the State's margin of appreciation; once such a possibility has been granted, however, requiring a single person to establish the presence of a referent of the other sex among his or her immediate circle of family and friends runs the risk of rendering ineffective the right of single persons to apply for authorisation.",

Would it not also be relevant to refer to the personality of a heterosexual partner cohabiting with a prospective adoptive parent in a stable relationship and to his or her attitude to the partner's plans to adopt?
