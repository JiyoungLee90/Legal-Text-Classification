Most of those were apparently the children of medical doctors, paramedical staff and teachers. The parents complained that whereas they were paying thousands of levs for private preparatory lessons, certain pupils had been bragging that they would be admitted to the English Secondary School in Burgas in exchange for paying 300\u00a0Bulgarian levs (BGN); indeed, only a month later this had become a fact. They cited several examples of perfectly healthy children who had been diagnosed as suffering from serious chronic illnesses. They said that they were not blaming the admissions commission, which had merely been taking note of the prior conclusions of medical doctors and allocating the pupils to schools depending on the nature of their purported health problems. They insisted that the Ministry should set up a special commission to investigate. A number of parents subsequently staged daily public protests in front of the building of the Burgas education inspectorate.",

The report, which was not made public, found that the commission had committed a number of violations of the school admissions regulations, such as admitting pupils who did not have the requisite medical conditions, making findings on the basis of invalid medical documents and poorly documenting its activities. It also said that there were indications that Dr N.P. had been forging documents.

It applied Article 78a of the Code (see paragraph 32 below) and replaced the applicant\u2019s criminal liability with four administrative fines of BGN 500 each.

This belief was based on objective facts. These arguments are inapposite and should not be addressed by the court, as in the impugned article [the applicant] did not allege that the complainants had been taking bribes. Seen from this perspective, whether or not [the applicant] believed that bribes had been taken is irrelevant. What matters is whether [the applicant] was aware of the untruthfulness of [the assertion] that on the day of publication of the article the Minister of Education and Science ... would impose on the complainants the disciplinary punishment of \u2018dismissal\u2019 on the grounds that they had taken bribes from sick children. This is so because, [according to the Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s caselaw,] \u2018when [a journalist] has properly verified the truthfulness of the information in line with established journalistic practice [and] the internal nonbinding rules of the relevant newspaper or publishing house\u2019, by using the sources available in practice, [he or she can be said to have acted] in a professional manner and in good faith, which excludes criminal and civil liability for defamation ([citation]). It has not been established that [the applicant acted] in a professional manner and in good faith. None of the sources used by [him] provided information to that effect. The information which [he] received from the head of the inspectorate, [Ms P.], and [other journalists] from  indicated that at the close of the inspection the commission appointed by the Minister was to propose that the complainants be subjected to stiff disciplinary punishments (on unspecified grounds).

The conversations conducted with parents of children [not admitted] could not give [the applicant] reliable information either about the internal control measures envisaged by the Minister or about the grounds for taking them. At the time of publication there was not a single source indicating to [the applicant] that the complainants would be dismissed as a disciplinary measure or that the grounds given by the Minister for that would be bribetaking. The court therefore finds that [the applicant] realised the untruthfulness of the injurious statements he disseminated and that the offence was therefore intentional. [The offence of defamation] does not require the defamed persons to sustain damage. The antisocial consequences of such an act arise simply from the dissemination of the injurious statements.

Since this activity is a constitutional obligation of the State, its performance in strict compliance with the relevant rules is of paramount importance.

For these reasons, the court finds that the reputations of [the complainants] suffered as a result of their own illicit behaviour. When imparting information about this [the applicant] went too far \u2013 alongside the true injurious statement he made an untrue statement about the impending punishments and the grounds for them.

The [lower court\u2019s] reasoning on that point is fully shared by this court and, accordingly, the objections that the [lower court\u2019s] judgment was unfounded or in breach of substantive law do not call for further discussion.",

[The lower court] correctly replaced [the applicant\u2019s] criminal liability [under] Article 78a of [the Criminal Code] with fines in the minimum amount allowed by the law, namely BGN 500 for each of the offences, taking into account [the applicant\u2019s] lack of a criminal record or other antisocial acts, [the] lower level of risk [he poses] to society, [and] his detailed explanations about the facts of the case. In its reasoning the court said that the nonpecuniary damage sustained by the complainants was not significant. That view cannot be shared by [this court]. Unlike pecuniary damage, the non-pecuniary damage caused through a criminal act should not be taken into account for the purpose of fixing the punishment. The nonpecuniary damage suffered by the victims of crime is strictly individual and should be taken into account solely for the purpose of fixing the amount of compensation, not the quantum and type of the punishment. Nevertheless, [this court] considers that the minimum penalties imposed on [the applicant] will [be sufficient to] further the aims of the punishment, as envisaged by [the Criminal Code]. The court therefore finds that this part of the [lower court\u2019s judgment] should be upheld.",

It is true that the complainants sustained non-pecuniary damage \u2013 a blemish on their reputations, concerned as they are about their professional standing and good names \u2013 as a result of the offences against them. [The lower court], however, correctly stated in its reasoning that [the applicant\u2019s] article had reported injurious facts which were true, namely that the complainants had committed violations in their work, which led to the unlawful admission of children to secondary schools, and which were more significant than the fact that the complainants would be dismissed. For this reason, the court considers that [the lower court] was right not to allow the civil claims in full. However, in [this court\u2019s] view, the awards [it] made are too small. The amount of BGN 100 for each of [the complainants] cannot make good their suffering resulting from the affront to their dignity. Regard being had to the way in which the offence was committed \u2013 circulation of the injurious assertions in a publication which is sold nationwide, thus bringing them to the attention of large number of people \u2013, [as well as] the negative impact this had on the complainants\u2019 mental state, health and capacity for work ..., this court finds that it would be just to award the complainants BGN 1,000 each. This part of [the lower court\u2019s] judgment should therefore be modified, by increasing the amount which [the applicant] has to pay to the complainants to BGN 1,000 for each of them in respect of nonpecuniary damage.",

It went on to say that, owing to the accessory nature of a civilparty claim, the general rule of tort law that fault was presumed was not applicable to the examination of tort claims in criminal defamation proceedings. In such proceedings, the rules governing fault as an element of the tort of defamation were those of the criminal law. The court also held that under Bulgarian law strict liability could not be applied in respect of defamation, and referred to the constitutional principle that public officials were subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals.",

Such an approach neglected the role of the press and the context in which the article had been published.

By reason of the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see, among other authorities, Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.

It was therefore inherently impossible for the applicant to know for certain what disciplinary sanctions would be imposed on the four complainants, and on what specific grounds. Of course, he could have overcome that difficulty simply by delaying publication. However, it is not for the Court to substitute its own views for those of the press as to the appropriate timing of publication of a news story. News is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication, even for a short period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest (see Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26\u00a0November 1991, \u00a7 60, Series A no. 216, and Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2), 26 November 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 217).

It should be reiterated in that connection that the situation must be examined as it presented itself to the journalist at the material time, rather than with the benefit of hindsight (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 66 in fine and 72).",

However, the courts did not take the abovementioned matters into account, and disregarded other factors which were equally relevant for determining whether or not the applicant had acted in good faith. For instance, they paid no heed to the overall thrust of the article and the fact that it also included accurate allegations about a number of breaches of the school admissions regulations committed by the four officials. While they treated that matter merely as a circumstance justifying a lower award of damages, the Court considers that, in view of the overall thrust of the article (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, \u00a7 48 in limine, Series A no. 236; Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7\u00a047 in limine, ECHR 2003V; and Timpul InfoMagazin and Anghel v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 42864/05, \u00a7 35, 27 November 2007), that element was equally relevant for the assessment of whether or not the applicant had acted as a responsible journalist. The criterion of responsible journalism should recognise the fact that it is the article as a whole that the journalist presents to the public. It is true that the applicant could have phrased the impugned statement in a more careful manner, so as to highlight the fact that the actual disciplinary penalties to be imposed on the officials and the exact grounds for them were still uncertain. However, it cannot be overlooked that he did point out that \u201cthe Minister [would] decide their fate [that day]\u201d (see paragraph 12 above) and that the article was a short news flash which called for concise wording. The Court therefore sees no reason to find that the applicant acted out of a desire to publish information with reckless disregard for its accuracy. Indeed, the allegations made by the protesting parents, coupled with the high number of irregularities in the school admission procedure (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above), made it at least plausible that the inspection relating to the four officials\u2019 professional conduct might touch upon the issue of corruption and lead to disciplinary sanctions on such grounds. It is noteworthy in that connection that the prosecuting authorities later opened an investigation concerning the officials on suspicion of bribetaking (see paragraph 11 above).",

It would emphasise in that connection that if the national courts apply an overly rigorous approach to the assessment of journalists\u2019 professional conduct, the latter could be unduly deterred from discharging their function of keeping the public informed. The courts must therefore take into account the likely impact of their rulings not only on the individual cases before them but also on the media in general. In the instant case, the four officials\u2019 interest in protecting their reputation was not sufficient to outweigh the vital public interest in ensuring an informed debate on a matter of considerable public interest. It is significant in that connection that, as pointed out by the national courts (see paragraphs 18 and 22 above), the bulk of the harm to the officials\u2019 reputation stemmed not from the untrue allegation made by the applicant in respect of the disciplinary sanctions imposed on them, but from his accurate reporting of their unlawful behaviour in the school admission process.",

In addition, an award of damages for defamation must bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered (see Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, 13 July 1995, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 316B, and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2005II).

Those came to BGN\u00a04,000 and BGN 300 respectively, making the total sum payable BGN\u00a06,300 (EUR 3,221.14).
