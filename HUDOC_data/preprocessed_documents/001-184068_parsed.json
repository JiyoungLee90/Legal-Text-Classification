Thus, they were decisive for the determination of the applicant company\u2019s right over the shares, which was a civil right within the meaning of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention.

Although the applicant company argued that at some stage in those proceedings there had been some inconsistency between the decisions of the commercial courts and those of the courts of general jurisdiction, it has not been demonstrated that this was the case or that the alleged inconsistency persisted until the time when the matter was finally determined by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 60 above).",

Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination.

Under the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judges\u2019 personal conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to their impartiality. In this respect, even appearances may be of a certain importance.

Although it is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute itself for the domestic courts in their assessment of the relevant circumstances, it notes that there are several aspects of the case which are important to the question of whether the above argument could justify the reopening of the case. Firstly, the Office of the Prosecutor General was informed of the original proceedings as early as July 2004, though no representative from that office attended the court hearings, notwithstanding the Kyiv Commercial Court\u2019s specific order in that regard (see paragraph 35 above). Secondly, representatives from different State bodies took part in the proceedings and they became aware of the decision of 22\u00a0October 2004 on the same day, but lodged no appeal against it (see paragraphs 32 and 39 above). In his appeal, the Prosecutor General, who acted on behalf of the State, did not suggest that those representatives had been precluded from defending the State interests at stake in the case. Nor did he suggest that there had been any kind of communication problem within the Government resulting in the information about the outcome of the case in October 2004, which had been a matter of public concern (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above), not reaching those concerned. Thirdly, even assuming that the Office of the Prosecutor General had been informed of the decision of 22\u00a0October 2004 on 30\u00a0December 2004, no explanation was given as to why the appeal had been lodged more than a month after that date, and why the time-limit should be extended to 7\u00a0February 2005.",

Likewise, domestic law must provide a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by the public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see Hasan and Chaush v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2000-XI). It is true that Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 contains no explicit procedural requirements and the absence of judicial review does not amount, in itself, to a violation of that provision (see Fredin v. Sweden (no.\u00a01), 18 February 1991, \u00a7 50, Series\u00a0A no. 192, and S.C. Antares Transport S.A. and S.C. Transroby S.R.L. v.\u00a0Romania, no. 27227/08, \u00a7 46, 15 December 2015). Nevertheless, it implies that any interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must be accompanied by procedural guarantees affording to the individual or entity concerned a reasonable opportunity of presenting their case to the responsible authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by that provision. In ascertaining whether that condition has been satisfied, a comprehensive view must be taken of the applicable judicial and administrative procedures (see Jokela v. Finland, no. 28856/95, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2002-IV with further references, and Stolyarova v. Russia, no. 15711/13, \u00a7 43, 29 January 2015).",

Moreover, it should be reiterated that the various rules incorporated in Article 1 are not distinct in the sense of being unconnected and that the second and third rules are concerned only with particular instances. One of the effects of this is that the existence of a \u201cpublic interest\u201d required under the second sentence, or the \u201cgeneral interest\u201d referred to in the second paragraph, are in fact corollaries of the principle set forth in the first sentence, so that an interference with the exercise of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 must also pursue an aim in the public interest (see Beyeler, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0111).",

Thus, even though the impugned annulment did not directly result in a change in the applicant company\u2019s title to or actual possession of the Kryvorizhstal shares, it might arguably constituted an interference with its right to those assets (see, mutatis mutandis, Rysovskyy v.
