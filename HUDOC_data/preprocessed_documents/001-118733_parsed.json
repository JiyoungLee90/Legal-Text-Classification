In the Iordan Iordanov and Others case, the Court identified the issues that need to be assessed when analysing whether conflicting decisions in similar cases stemming from the same court violate the principle of legal certainty under Article 6 of the Convention: 1) the existence of \"profound and long-lasting divergences\u201d in the relevant case-law; 2) whether the domestic law provides for a mechanism capable of removing the judicial inconsistency; and 3) whether this mechanism was applied and, if so, what were the effects (see Iordan\u00a0Iordanov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 23530/02, \u00a7 49, 2 July 2009).

While the amount of that compensation was not specified in the claim, the plaintiff set the value of the dispute at MKD 10,000. On the basis of an expert report ordered soon after the introduction of the plaintiff\u2019s action, the first-instance court determined that the value of the property at issue was MKD 6,012,944 (see paragraph 7 above). The first-instance court apparently relied on that amount for calculating the value of the dispute since it set the claim value at MKD 3,006,472, which corresponded to half the property\u2019s value as determined by the expert and as claimed by the plaintiff (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). That appears to be in compliance with section 34(1) of the Civil Procedure Act 1998 (see paragraph 21 above). Until 14 November 2005, the date when the first-instance court recognised the plaintiff as equal joint owner of the property in question, the same value of the dispute (MKD 3,006,472) was indicated in almost all court judgments (see paragraphs 8-17 above). During that time, there were four first and second-instance court judgments, as well as two judgments by the Supreme Court. In those judgments given upon an appeal on points of law by the plaintiff, the Supreme Court accepted the value of the dispute specified by the lower courts. That is evident from the introductory parts of its judgments dated 30 September 1999 and 18 May 2005 (see paragraphs\u00a011 and 17 above). The Supreme Court, in those judgments, did not assess the admissibility of the plaintiff\u2019s appeals (see paragraph 27 above). The applicant also did not contest, in reply to the plaintiff\u2019s appeals, the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction in this respect (see paragraph 16 above). However, nothing suggests nor has the Court been presented with any evidence, that the Supreme Court was not vested with a jurisdiction to review, under section 378 of the Civil Proceedings Act 1998 (see paragraph\u00a021 above), the admissibility ratione valoris of the plaintiff\u2019s appeals on its own motion. The Supreme Court, in those judgments, accepted jurisdiction ratione valoris and examined on the merits the plaintiff\u2019s appeals on points of law. In result, it ordered a reconsideration of the case.",

In this connection the Court notes that the same rules on admissibility ratione valoris applied throughout the entire proceedings. Furthermore, no information or evidence has been provided that the plaintiff\u2019s claim or the applicant\u2019s counter claim were amended after the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 18 May 2005. With a judgment of 20 March 2008 the Supreme Court, however, rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law as inadmissible ratione valoris thus departing from its point of view on this issue in its earlier judgments. The Supreme Court, having regard to the value of the dispute specified in the plaintiff\u2019s action (MKD 10,000), evidence of the court fees paid by the plaintiff and legal fees paid by the applicant, ruled that the claim value was below the statutory threshold specified in section 368 (3) of the Civil Proceedings Act 1998. In the absence of any explanation, it remains unclear why it had not taken into consideration those elements in its preceding judgments of 30 September 1999 and 18 May 2005. The Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 20 March 2008 contained no reference to either judgment and provided no explanation as to why different case-law was applied to deal with the same issue in the same case. Furthermore, the Supreme Court was bound, under domestic law, in particular section 320(1) of the Civil Procedure Act 1998 (see paragraph 21 above), by its earlier judgments, which had already resolved the issue of the admissibility ratione valoris of the appeal on points of law in the present case. Those judgments were binding for the same court in the later stages of the same proceedings (see Vusi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 48101/07, \u00a7 43, 1 July 2010).",
