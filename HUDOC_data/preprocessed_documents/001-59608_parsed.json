The witness mentioned as an example the events of 16 October 1998, when it was not clear whether or not the applicant had personally performed the chore imposed on 15 October 1998. Regardless of the statements of Officer Kmieliauskas alleging that the applicant had not performed the task himself, the witness decided that the applicant should have the benefit of the doubt, and that there had been no breach of discipline. However, in another case, concerning the chore imposed on 29 December 1998, the overwhelming evidence suggested that the applicant had indeed breached discipline by ordering another detainee to perform his task. As a result the applicant was punished with solitary confinement.",

By reference to written observations by the prison administration and the detainees\u2019 comments, the Ombudsman established that the applicant, together with B. and P., all of whom were Wing 1 inmates, were stopped by guards when trespassing into the  3. The detainees claimed that they had oral permission from both the prison governor and other guards to go to Wing 3, and that the penalties had thus been arbitrary.

By reference to written observations by the prison administration and the detainees\u2019 comments, as well as the material collected on the spot by a representative of the Ombudsman\u2019s office in January 1999, the Ombudsman established that the applicant and B. had been ordered to clean the areas around their own beds by Officer Kmieliauskas, in execution of the duties imposed on 29 December 1998. The Ombudsman held that the applicant and B., owing to their authority over other prisoners, could indeed have ordered other prisoners to clean up for them, thereby avoiding executing personally the penalties of 29\u00a0December 1998. According to the Ombudsman, it was therefore reasonable for Officer Kmieliauskas to want to supervise the task himself. Such supervision could not amount to an unjustified interference with their honour. The Ombudsman established that the detainees had refused to perform the job under the supervision of Officer Kmieliauskas and another staff member at around 10.50 a.m. on 29 December 1998. Some time later they informed Officer Kmieliauskas that they had nonetheless performed the task whilst alone. The Ombudsman held that both the refusal of the detainees to perform their duties, and their subsequent statements that they had performed the jobs in the absence of staff, testified to their non-compliance with the penalty of 29 December 1998.

This figure must be viewed in the context of the wide freedom of movement enjoyed by the applicant from wake-up time at 6.30 a.m. to lock-in at 10.30 p.m. within the whole SAB area, consisting of the separate dormitory, a leisure room, the kitchen, sanitation areas and the open courtyard. The dormitory was a big room of 92.2 sq. m which did not lack lighting or ventilation. The Court considers that the space, lighting and ventilation conditions in the SAB were substantially better than those established by the Court in Peers, cited above, where an applicant shared a dim and poorly ventilated cell of 7 sq. m with another inmate and had a much more limited possibility of movement outside the cell (loc. cit., \u00a7\u00a7 70-72).",

The general area was somewhat muddy but not unduly smelly. It is true that the Asian-type toilets had lacked partitions until sometime in late 1999. While this temporary absence of partitions was regrettable, it must be noted that the sanitation area was closed off from the rest of the SAB, and the applicant was not obliged to use the toilet in the presence of another detainee (see, by contrast, ibid., \u00a7 73). In his written submissions to the Court and during the meeting with the Court delegates, the applicant never alleged that he had had to use the toilets whilst being seen by another prisoner. Instead he confirmed that, in the absence of partitions, prisoners used the toilets one at a time in order to respect each other\u2019s privacy. Furthermore, whilst the absence of an adequate supply of toilet paper in a prison may raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, it has not been established that the applicant was so deprived in practice. The Court notes that the dormitory had adequate bedding, which was washed and dried regularly in the prison laundry. The applicant was able to wash his clothes in the sanitation area and dry them in the courtyard or on radiators in the accommodation area. In sum, the Court considers that the sanitation and laundry arrangements in the SAB were not incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention.",

While the space allocated for the applicant in the dormitories in Sections 13 and 21 of the wing was, respectively, about 2.7 and 3.2 sq. m, the dormitories themselves measured 86.5 and 55.3 sq. m and did not lack light or air. Furthermore, there was no limitation on the applicant\u2019s moving about within the whole wing or the courtyard from wake-up until lock-in times. Therefore, the scarce space in relative terms was compensated for by the large size in absolute terms of the dormitories, as well as the freedom of movement allowed (see paragraph 103 above).",

The one notable difference between the SAB and Wing 1 was that the applicant did not have unlimited access to the shower in the latter.

There is no evidence that the applicant, or indeed any other prisoner, had been physically affected by the quality of catering in the canteen. In the Court\u2019s view, the ability to receive additional food from relatives, or to purchase it from the prison shop, could have compensated for the applicant\u2019s dissatisfaction with the possibly monotonous diet provided by the prison canteen.

Prisoners were able to go out into the courtyard, walk around and sit down there. There was certainly no obligation on the applicant actually to remain standing during the day. There are no medical records confirming the applicant\u2019s complaints about his poor health, including a heart disease, an urgent need for a knee operation, any need to lie down during the day, or a stomach condition requiring a better diet than that provided by the prison canteen.

In addition, detainees were able to obtain books from the library, watch television, listen to music, exercise in the stroll yard or engage in other recreational activities. The applicant conceded that he had been afforded adequate contacts with the outside world by way of personal visits. Overall, the Court finds that the general situation under the normal regime at Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison was not as grim as the applicant originally alleged. In the light of these circumstances, the Court considers that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention under the normal regime did not attain the minimum level of severity amounting to \u201cdegrading\u201d treatment within the meaning of Article\u00a03 of the Convention (see, by contrast, Peers, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 70-75).",

In the Court\u2019s view, the absence of any record of an inquiry by the prison governor into the applicant\u2019s complaints at the material time about this search shows a reluctance on the part of the prison authorities to investigate the incident properly.
