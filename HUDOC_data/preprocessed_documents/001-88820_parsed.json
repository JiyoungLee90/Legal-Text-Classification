Particulars of the offence play a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of their service that the suspect is formally put on written notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him (see Kamasinski v.

The Court recalls further that the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (a) must in particular be assessed in the light of the more general right to a fair hearing guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In criminal matters the provision of full, detailed information concerning the charges against a defendant, and consequently the legal characterisation that the court might adopt in the matter, is an essential prerequisite for ensuring that the proceedings are fair (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v.

However, the constituent elements of fraud and bribe-taking differed significantly (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above). The offence of fraud presupposed that another person\u2019s property was obtained by way of deception or abuse of confidence, the perpetrator being aware that the victim was divesting himself of the asset as a result of the deceitful conduct. The objective element of bribe-taking consisted in accepting valuable assets in exchange for acts or omissions within the perpetrator\u2019s professional competence and its subjective element required that the bribe-taker be aware that he was obtaining the asset in return for the requested acts or omissions for the benefit of the bribe-giver.
