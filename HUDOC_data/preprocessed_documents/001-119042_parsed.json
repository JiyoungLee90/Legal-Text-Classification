In particular, it follows that the additional expert examination authorised by the trial court was pending without any valid reason for one year, from 29 March 2002 to 31\u00a0March 2003 (see paragraph 25 above). The Government did not provide any explanation in this regard. As to their argument that the first expert examination (which ended on 1 October 1998 and caused a delay of five months within the Court\u2019s competence ratione temporis, see paragraph 14 above) was due to \u201cthe parties\u2019 failure\u201d to pay the relevant expert fees, it does not plainly follow that this failure was exclusively attributable to the applicant. In any event, the Court notes that the report relating to the second examination ordered on 9 June 1997 was submitted on 24 March 1999 (see paragraph 17 above). It should also be recalled that the principal responsibility for the delay due to the expert opinions rests ultimately with the State (see Capuano v. Italy, 25 June 1987, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 119). It is up to the courts to use the measures available to them under domestic law to maintain control over the proceedings. Accordingly, the Court cannot but find that the judicial authorities remain largely responsible for the delays in taking the expert opinions.",
