The officers also kicked him, including in the knees, making him fall. They grabbed him by the collar and hit his head against the wall several times. Occasionally, A.K. pressed his knee against his chest, when he was lying on the floor, and covered his mouth and nose with one hand and strangled him with the other, until he fainted. To bring him to his senses, the two officers burnt his left hand with cigarette butts. The ill-treatment continued for about twelve hours. Subsequently, another police officer, P.I., entered the office and asked A.K. and B.K. to leave. He told the applicant that there was some evidence against him and threatened that, if he did not confess to the robbery, he would be killed and his body never found.

Ukraine, no. 4494/07, \u00a7 63, 7 November 2013).
