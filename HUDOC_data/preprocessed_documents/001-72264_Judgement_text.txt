The case originated in an application (no. 59913/00) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Kiril Yonkov Vasilev (“the applicant”), on 14 April 2000.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr I. Yordanov, a lawyer practising in Veliko Tarnovo. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Kotzeva, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that his pre-trial detention and the criminal proceedings against him were excessively lengthy, in breach of Article 5 § 3 and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, and that the scope of judicial review on the lawfulness of his detention was too narrow and in breach of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention.
The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).
By a decision of 14 December 2004, the Court declared the application partly admissible.
On 20 January 1995 the applicant, who was 21 years old at the time, was charged with armed robbery and assault causing heavy injuries on one person and the death of another.
The charges, as modified later, concerned a number of robberies allegedly committed by an organised armed group who posed as traffic policemen and robbed motor vehicles and their passengers. The applicant had allegedly joined the group for its last two robberies. He was accused of being the one who had made the fatal gunshot killing the victim in one of those robberies.
The preliminary investigation was completed in August 1995 and in October 1995 an indictment was submitted to the Regional Court of Veliko Tarnovo against twelve persons, including the applicant.
The  held hearings on 11 December 1995, 310 January, 3-5 June and 2-12 September 1996. Numerous witnesses were heard and other evidence admitted.
On 12 September 1996 the applicant was convicted and sentenced to 16 years’ imprisonment. Ten other accused persons were also convicted in the same proceedings.
On 16 September 1996 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court held hearings on 14 February, 25 April and 27 June 1997.
In 1997 the judicial system in  was reformed. As a result, the applicant’s case fell within the jurisdiction of the newly created appellate courts. On 1 April 1998 it was assigned to the Veliko Tarnovo Appellate Court and the file transmitted to that newly created court.
The Appellate Court held hearings on 11 January and 8 February 1999.
On 9 February 1999 the court set aside the ’s judgment noting that two of the accused persons had been represented at the preliminary investigation stage by the same lawyer despite an obvious conflict of interest. In the court’s view, that fact vitiated the whole procedure and warranted remitting the case to the investigation stage.
On 5 August 1999 an investigator reformulated the charges against the applicant.
On 23 September 1999 a fresh indictment was submitted to the .
On 5 January 2000 the  remitted the case to the investigation stage.
On 2 May 2000 a third indictment was drawn up and submitted to the . As all but one of the judges at that court had been involved in the examination of the case or had decided on the accused persons’ applications for bail, in June 2000 the case was assigned to another court, the Lovech Regional Court.
A substitute judge and substitute jurors were designated and took part in the proceedings before the .
The court held a hearing on 11 December 2000. It ordered a medical report and adjourned the examination of the case.
Between December 2000 and November 2005 the Lovech Regional Court fixed thirty-two dates for hearings: 12 February, 9 April, 10 September and 29 November 2001, 21 February, 15 April, 14 June, 1 October, 1 November and 11 November 2002, 14 January, 31 January, 14 March, 28 March, 20 May, 26 September and 18 December 2003, 20 February, 5 March, 30 April, 14 May, 28 May, 2 July, 15 July, 1 October, 29 October and 3 December 2004, 25 February, 18 March, 29 April, 30 May and 9 September 2005.
On each of those dates approximately fifteen to twenty-five of the persons summoned appeared before the , including most accused persons and their lawyers. The applicant, who was in pre-trial detention until 31 July 2001 and at liberty thereafter (see paragraphs 24-49 below), and his lawyer were always present. However, on each of the thirtytwo dates at least one of the accused persons or their lawyers did not appear and the , considering that that was a bar to proceeding with the examination of the case, adjourned the hearing.
In most cases the persons who had not appeared had presented medical certificates indicating that they had fallen ill. In some cases one or more of the defence lawyers were unable to attend as they had been summoned in other proceedings. Several other adjournments were the result of unexplained absences of lawyers.
The ’s approach during those five years consisted in noting the absences, adjourning the hearing and, where relevant, issuing orders to the lawyers concerned to explain the reasons for their absence and informing the local Bar about their failure to appear. On one occasion the court also appointed a medical expert to examine one of the accused persons who had been repeatedly absent on health grounds. No fines were imposed on lawyers who had failed to appear. It appears that the local Bar never sanctioned any of the lawyers. The possibility of separating the proceedings concerning some of the co-accused persons was not envisaged.
As of November 2005 the criminal proceedings against the applicant are still pending at the trial stage without any progress being made within the last five years.
In the meantime, in June 2003 two of the accused persons who had been released on bail in 2001 were arrested on charges that they had committed an armed robbery in January 2003 using the same method of operation as that employed in respect of the 1994-95 robberies.
The applicant was detained pending trial on 20 January 1995.
On 12 September 1996 the applicant was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. On 9 February 1999 the Appellate Court set aside his conviction and sentence and remitted the case to the investigation stage. The applicant remained in pre-trial detention.
Between February 1999 and his release in 2001 the applicant submitted a number of appeals against detention.
His appeal of 14 June 1999 was dismissed on 13 July 1999 by the  which noted that the applicant had been charged with very serious crimes, that the authorities had been working on the case actively and that the case was complex as it concerned several accused persons, a number of criminal acts and victims who were foreigners. Therefore, the reasonable time requirement had not been breached. As to the applicant’s contention that the detention had become unjustified, there being allegedly no proof of any danger of his absconding or committing an offence, that argument was flawed, since under Article 152 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Supreme Court’s practice the relevant issue was whether there was proof of absence of any danger of the accused person’s absconding or committing an offence if released. No such proof existed in the applicant’s case.
On 25 August 1999 the  dismissed another appeal by the applicant against his detention.
In his renewed appeal of 11 January 2000 the applicant relied, inter alia, on the new provisions on pre-trial detention, as in force since 1 January 2000. Under those provisions detention was only justified if there was proof of a danger that the accused person might abscond or commit offences.
The appeal was examined by the  at a hearing on 20 January 2000. According to the applicant, the prosecutor was sitting next to the judges.
On 20 January 2000 the  dismissed the appeal. It found that the new provisions in force since 1 January 2000 did not require proof of a danger that the accused person would abscond or commit an offence. The fact that the applicant was charged with a serious offence was sufficient justification.
On 24 January 2000 the applicant appealed to the Appellate Court against the ’s decision of 20 January 2000.
The appeal was examined by the Appellate Court at a hearing on 27 January 2000. At the start of the hearing the applicant’s lawyer requested that the prosecutor should not be allowed to sit next to the judges and thus overhear remarks exchanged between the judges and observe their reactions. Furthermore, it could not be excluded that the judges, knowing that the prosecutor was listening, might not feel free in their decisions. In any event, the sight of the prosecutor sitting with the judges inevitably influenced the general perception of the proceedings and, in particular, could raise doubts as to the court’s independence and the equality between the parties.
The court rejected the lawyer’s objection, stating that the prosecutor’s physical place in the courtroom could not possibly affect the equality of the parties, which was a legal principle that was strictly observed.
The lawyer then requested the judges’ withdrawal, stating that they had demonstrated partiality by accepting to sit together with the prosecutor. That motion was also rejected.
On 27 January 2000 the Appellate Court dismissed the appeal. It stated that under the relevant law as it stood until 1 January 2000 pre-trial detention had been mandatory in all cases concerning serious offences, save in exceptional circumstances. No such exceptional circumstances existed in the applicant’s case: the charges concerned premeditated crimes committed by a group. Also, the nature of the offences and the manner in which they had been committed clearly pointed to a danger that the applicant might abscond or commit another offence if released.
According to the applicant, on 28 March 2000 he filed another appeal against his detention, reiterating his earlier arguments. No details as to its examination have been provided.
At the hearing on 11 December 2000 the applicant appealed against his detention. The  dismissed the appeal on the same day, stating that the case was very complex and that therefore the reasonable time requirement had not been breached.
Upon the applicant’s appeal, the ’s decision was upheld on 28 December 2000 by the Veliko Tarnovo Appellate Court. The court stated, inter alia:
“In accordance with Article 152 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as it was worded at the time when the applicant was initially placed in pre-trial detention, the [relevant authority] is bound to impose pre-trial detention when the charges concerned a “serious offence” [within the meaning of the Penal Code], as in the applicant’s case. In such a case, as here, in accordance with Article 152 § 2 ... the real danger of the accused person’s absconding or committing an offence is presumed a priori. Therefore, the applicant’s complaint that it has not been established that there is a danger of him absconding or committing an offence is ill-founded.”
At the hearing on 12 February 2001 the applicant again requested to be released. That was refused on the same day by the  on the grounds that there were no new circumstances warranting release. The applicant appealed.
On 8 March 2001 the Appellate Court dismissed the appeal. It stated, inter alia, that the term “reasonable time” had to be interpreted with due regard to the particular circumstances of the case, that all adjournments had been inevitable and that the charges concerned offences that were particularly dangerous. The court also stated:
“The very fact that the [charges concern] the applicant’s participation in a criminal group which has committed numerous robberies on the road – [offences] punishable by more than ten years’ imprisonment – implies a danger of the applicant’s absconding or committing an offence. The case file does not contain proof to the contrary and, therefore, the only lawful measure of judicial control for the [applicant] is remand in custody”.
On 9 April 2001 the  decided to release the applicant on bail. No reasons were provided, except that by the same decision the court refused to release some of the other accused persons stating that the charges against them concerned a greater number of robberies. The amount of the recognisance was fixed at 4,000 Bulgarian levs (BGN).
The applicant appealed, considering that amount as excessive. On 27 April 2001 the Appellate Court rejected the appeal, reasoning that when examining an appeal against measures to secure appearance in court the appellate courts’ power was limited to setting aside the particular measure and substituting it with a measure of another type; they had no jurisdiction to modify the amount of the recognisance fixed by the lower court.
On 31 July 2001 the applicant paid the recognisance and was released.
Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as worded at the material time and until 1 January 2000, provided as follows:
“(1)  Detention pending trial shall be ordered [in cases where the charges concern] a serious intentional offence.
(2)  In cases falling under paragraph 1 [detention pending trial] may be dispensed with if there is no danger of the accused’s absconding, obstructing the investigation, or committing further offences.”
According to Article 93 § 7 of the Penal Code a “serious” offence is one punishable by more than five years’ imprisonment.
The Supreme Court’s practice at the time was to construe Article 152 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as requiring that a person charged with a serious intentional offence had to be remanded in custody. An exception was only possible, in accordance with Article 152 § 2, where it was clear and beyond doubt that any danger of absconding or reoffending was objectively excluded, for example, if the accused was seriously ill, elderly, or already detained on other grounds, such as serving a sentence (Decision no. 1 of 4 May1992, case no. 1/92, II Chamber, Bulletin 1992/93, p. 172; Decision no. 4 of 21 February 1995, case no. 76/95, II Chamber; Decision no. 78 of 6 November 1995, case no. 768/95, II Chamber; Decision no. 24, case no. 268/95, I Chamber, Bulletin 1995, p. 149). In some other decisions, the Supreme Court nevertheless embarked on an analysis of the particular facts to justify findings that there existed a danger of absconding or of offending (Decision No. 76 of 25.07.1997, case no. 507/97, II Chamber, Bulletin no. 9-10/97, p. 5; Decision no. 107 of 27.05.1998, case no. 257/98, II Chamber, Bulletin no. 3-4/98, p. 12).
As of that date the legal regime of detention under the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended with the aim to ensure compliance with the Convention (TR 1-02 VKS).
The relevant part of the amended Article 152 provides:
“(1)  Detention pending trial shall be ordered [in cases concerning] offences punishable by imprisonment ... , where the material in the case discloses a real danger that the accused person may abscond or commit an offence.
(2)  In the following circumstances it shall be considered that [such] a danger exists, unless established otherwise on the basis of the evidence in the case:
in cases of special recidivism or repetition;
where the charges concern a serious offence and the accused person has a previous conviction for a serious offence and a non-suspended sentence of not less than one year imprisonment;
where the charges concern an offence punishable by not less than ten years’ imprisonment or a heavier punishment.
(3)  Detention shall be replaced by a more lenient measure of control where there is no longer a danger that the accused person may abscond or commit an offence.”
It appears that divergent interpretations of the above provisions were observed in the initial period of their application, upon their entry into force on 1 January 2000.
In June 2002 the Supreme Court of Cassation clarified that the amended Article 152 excluded any possibility of a mandatory detention. In all cases the existence of a reasonable suspicion against the accused and of a real danger of him absconding or committing an offence had to be established by the authorities. The presumption under paragraph 2 of Article 152 was only a staring point of analysis and did not shift the burden of proof to the accused (TR 1-02 VKS).
On the basis of the relevant law before 1 January 2000, when ruling on appeals against pre-trial detention of a person charged with having committed a “serious” offence, the domestic courts generally disregarded facts and arguments concerning the existence or absence of a danger of the accused person’s absconding or committing offences and stated that every person accused of having committed a serious offence must be remanded in custody unless exceptional circumstances dictated otherwise (see the Supreme Court’s cases cited above and the decisions of the domestic authorities criticised by the Court in the cases of Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, ECHR 1999II, Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, 26 July 2001 and Zaprianov v. Bulgaria, no. 41171/98, 30 September 2004).
In June 2002, interpreting the amended provisions on pre-trial detention, the Supreme Court of Cassation stated that when examining an appeal against pre-trial detention the courts’ task was not only to verify whether the initial decision on remand in custody had been lawful but also to establish whether continued detention was still lawful and justified. In such proceedings the courts had to examine all available evidence on all relevant aspects, including the amount of the recognisance as the case may be (TR 102 VKS).
Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, where an appellate court sets aside a trial court’s judgement, it shall refer the case back to the investigation or indictment stage of the proceedings whenever the grounds for setting aside include, inter alia, a finding that there have been “substantial procedural violations” at those stages of the proceedings (Article 333 § 1(1)). The same criterion governs the trial court’s power to terminate the trial and refer the case back to the prosecutor (Article 287 § 1(1) and Article 246 § 2 in conjunction with Article 241 § 2(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure).
On the basis of the broad statutory definition of the term “substantial procedural violation” under former Article 330 of the Code, in force until 1 April , a wide range of omissions were considered as grounds for remitting a case to the preliminary investigation stage.
The definition of the term “substantial procedural violation” under Article 352 §§ 3 and 4 of the Code (in force since 1 April 1998, applicable mutatis mutandis to all judicial stages of the proceedings) is narrower than that under the former Article 330. Despite that fact, the courts continued to remit cases to the initial stage of the criminal proceedings too often, as noted by the Supreme Court of Cassation in its interpretative decision No. 2 of 7 October 2002.
