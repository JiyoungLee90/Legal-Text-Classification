Nevertheless, the applicants have failed to sufficiently substantiate their allegations that the demonstrations in which they participated were spontaneous. In particular, given that, as submitted by the first applicant, the death of soldiers in the army had already been a widespread problem in the country, it is not clear why it was urgent to hold demonstrations on specific dates \u2013 12 January and 10 March 2013 \u2013 without giving five days\u2019 written notice. Similarly, it is not clear why a demonstration in solidarity with the Ismayilli protests could not have been organised in conformity with the five-day written-notice requirement. In those circumstances, the Court is ready to accept that the dispersal of the demonstrations on 12 January, 26 January and 10 March 2013 was lawful (compare Ibrahimov and Others v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, nos. 69234/11, 69252/11 and 69335/11, \u00a7\u00a7 74-75, 11\u00a0February 2016).",

In particular, the Court noted that the administrative-offence proceedings had lacked the necessary safeguards and guarantees. The time and facilities to prepare the defence had been inadequate (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 78-81). In addition, there had been a strong reliance by the domestic courts on the administrative-offence report prepared by the police (ibid., \u00a7 85), utter disregard by the domestic courts for important factual circumstances and legal issues of the case, inter alia, the peaceful nature of the unauthorised demonstration (ibid., \u00a7 86), an absence of legal assistance at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 90-91), and a failure to provide an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of the applicant\u2019s own choosing (ibid.,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a092).
