The cases originated in sixteen applications (nos. 6033/13, 8927/13, 10549/13, 12275/13, 23890/13, 26309/13, 27161/13, 29197/13, 32224/13, 32331/13, 32351/13, 32368/13, 37173/13, 38490/13, 42340/13 and 42403/13) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by forty-five nationals of the United States of America on their own behalf and on behalf of twenty-seven children who are Russian nationals (“the applicants”). The President of the Section acceded to the applicants’ request not to have their names disclosed (Rule 47 § 4 of the Rules of Court).
The applicants in cases nos. 6033/13, 8927/13, 10549/13, 12275/13, 23890/13, 26309/13, 29197/13, 32224/13, 32331/13, 32351/13, 32368/13, 37173/13, 38490/13, 42340/13 and 42403/13 were represented before the Court by Ms Marina Zakharina, Ms Valentina Bokareva, Ms Viktoria Ivleva-Yorke, Ms Natasha Lisman, Ms Anna Maralyan, Ms Oksana Preobrazhenskaya and Ms Karinna Moskalenko. The applicants in case no. 27161/13 were represented before the Court by Irina O’Rear, a lawyer practising in Russia. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants complained about the application to them of the ban on the adoption of Russian children by US nationals of provided in Law no. 272-FZ.
Between 13 March and 4 July 2013 the President decided to grant the cases priority under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, confidentiality under Rule 33 § 3 of the Rules of Court, and anonymity under Rule 47 § 4 of the Rules of Court.
On 4 November 2013 the applications were communicated to the Government.
Leave to intervene in the written proceedings (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 2) was given to the Harvard Law School’s Child Advocacy Program.
The US nationals (“the US applicants”) started proceedings for the adoption of children from Russia between 2010 and 2012. They had complied with the requirements set by the United States authorities, having obtained favourable appraisals of their living and financial conditions and their suitability to adopt a child. Some of the applicants had had to comply with additional requirements laid down in the Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Regarding Cooperation in Adoption of Children (“Bilateral Agreement on Adoption”) upon its entry into force on 1 November 2012. They then applied to the competent Russian authorities who, except in those cases where the adoption proceedings had focussed on a particular child from the outset, provided them with information concerning the children who were available for adoption.
In most cases the US applicants received a positive decision from the Russian authorities regarding both the impossibility of placing the child in a Russian family and their suitability to become adoptive parents. As part of the adoption procedure, they obtained a referral to visit the child concerned, which enabled them to spend several days with him or her at the respective orphanage. They visited the children and reaffirmed their formal agreement to adopt them. In some cases, according to the US applicants, they had formed a bond with the child even before initiating the adoption procedure, and one case concerned the adoption of the brother of a previously adopted girl (cases nos. 23890/13, 37173/13 and 42340/13 respectively; see the specific circumstances below). In such cases the adoption procedure referred to a particular child from the outset. Many of the prospective adoptive children suffer from serious health issues and require specialist medical care.
By the end of 2012 most of the US applicants had completed all the requisite steps of the adoption procedure prior to submitting the adoption application to a court. However, on 21 December 2012 the Russian State Duma adopted the Federal Law no. 272-FZ on Measures in respect of Persons Involved in a Breach of Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms, Rights and Freedoms of Nationals of the Russian Federation (“Law no. 272FZ”), which, inter alia, banned the adoption of Russian children by nationals of the United States. The law entered into force on 1 January 2013.
Adoption proceedings were halted in respect of those US applicants who had not submitted an adoption application to a court before the entry into force of Law no. 272-FZ.
In respect of those US applicants who had submitted an adoption application to a court but had not attended a hearing before the entry into force of Law no. 272-FZ, the courts discontinued the adoption proceedings, relying on Law no. 272-FZ. Some of the applicants appealed. Their appeals were dismissed.
Applications for adoption submitted by US nationals after 1 January 2013 were rejected on procedural grounds, with similar reference to Law no. 272-FZ. Where an application had been submitted on behalf of the US applicants by an adoption agency, it was rejected on the grounds that the agency could not submit an application to the court because the activities of such agencies had been banned. Where the application had been submitted by some other kind of representative, it was rejected because it should have been submitted by such an adoption agency only.
The US applicants were subsequently removed from the State databank containing information on prospective adoptive parents, meaning that they could no longer be considered as such.
After spring 2013 some of the prospective adoptive children were transferred for adoption by different families or placed in foster families.
On 13 July 2011 the United States and the Russian Federation signed the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption setting out the procedure for intercountry adoption between the two States. It entered into force on 1 November 2012.
On 21 December 2012 the Russian State Duma adopted Law no. 272-FZ ‒ which was signed by the President on 28 December 2012 ‒ also known as the “Anti-Magnitsky Law” or the “Dima Yakovlev Law” due to the circumstances underlying its adoption. The law has been described as a response to the Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 passed by the United States Congress in November/December 2012 and signed by the US President on 14 December 2012 (the “Magnitsky Act”). The Magnitsky Act imposed sanctions on the Russian officials who were thought to be responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who had exposed alleged large-scale tax fraud involving State officials and subsequently died in custody. The Magnitsky Act prohibited the Russian officials from entering the United States and using the United States’ banking system. The list of the eighteen individuals concerned was made public by the Administration of the President of the United States.
The Russian authorities’ response involved the passing of a similar act in respect of United States nationals responsible for gross human rights violations, prohibiting their entry into Russia and freezing their assets within Russia. However, Section 4 § 1 of Law no. 272FZ also introduced a ban on the adoption of Russian children by United States nationals. The introduction of that provision was prompted by the death in 2008 of Dima Yakovlev, a Russian toddler adopted by United States nationals. He was left alone for nine hours strapped in his adoptive father’s car after the latter forgot to take him to his day-care centre. The father was eventually acquitted of involuntary manslaughter. This news created a stir in the Russian media and resulted in the highlighting of a number of abuse cases involving Russian children adopted by United States nationals, leading to calls from certain Russian authorities to restrict or end adoptions by US nationals.
On 28 December 2012 the United States Department of State released a statement concerning the adoption of Law no. 272-FZ which read, insofar as relevant:
“We deeply regret Russia’s passage of a law ending inter-country adoptions between the United States and Russia and restricting Russian civil society organizations that work with American partners. American families have adopted over 60,000 Russian children over the past 20 years, and the vast majority of these children are now thriving thanks to their parents’ loving support. The Russian government’s politically motivated decision will reduce adoption possibilities for children who are now under institutional care. We regret that the Russian government has taken this step rather than seek to implement the bilateral adoption agreement that entered into force in November. We are further concerned about statements that adoptions already underway may be stopped and hope that the Russian government would allow those children who have already met and bonded with their future parents to finish the necessary legal procedures so that they can join their families.”
On 1 January 2013 Law no. 272-FZ entered into force. On the same date the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in Moscow that, pursuant to Section 4 § 2 of Law no. 272-FZ, Russia was terminating the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption. Pursuant to Article 17 of the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption, it should have remained in force until one year from the date on which one of the States Parties informed the other Party of its intention to terminate the Agreement, and this move therefore caused confusion regarding the validity of the agreement and the outcome of the pending adoption cases involving prospective adoptive parents from the United States.
During a briefing on 8 January 2013, a United States Department of State spokesperson announced that Russia had informed the United States of its intention to suspend the Bilateral Adoption Agreement.
On 10 January 2013 news agencies including the BBC and RIA Novosti reported that the Russian President’s Press Secretary had stated that the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption was still in force on that date and that it would remain valid until early January 2014. On the afternoon of the same day the Russian Ministry of External Affairs posted a comment on its website stating that Russia had not merely suspended the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption but had terminated it, and that a communication to this effect had been handed over to the United States Embassy in Moscow on 1 January 2013.
On 13 January 2013 about twenty thousand people gathered on the streets of Moscow to take part in an action called March Against Scoundrels to protest against Law no. 272-FZ.
The law was also criticised by human rights organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch and received numerous negative reactions from the media, including Time, The Economist and The Guardian. Most of the critical commentators argued that the law was politically motivated and detrimental to the children’s interests.
On 15 January 2013 forty-eight members of the United States Congress sent a letter to the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, on behalf of the United States families affected by Law no. 272-FZ. The letter requested exemption for families who were in the final stages of the adoption procedure and invited Russia to re-join the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption.
On 22 January 2013 the Russian Supreme Court issued a letter instructing the lower courts to allow the transfer of adopted Russian children into families of United States nationals where the adoption decision had been taken prior to 1 January 2013, even if it had entered into force after that date.
Proceedings in all cases involving prospective adoptive parents from the United States in which a decision on adoption had not been delivered before 1 January 2013 were halted, irrespective of the status of the proceedings.
On 2 July 2013 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) adopted a Resolution on Intercountry Adoption in which it called on member States “to recognize the foundational bond between prospective adoptive parents and the child and to honor and protect these nascent families” and urged them “to resolve differences, disputes, and controversies related to intercountry adoptions in a positive and humanitarian spirit” so as “to avoid any general, indiscriminate disruption of intercountry adoptions already in progress that could jeopardize the best interests of the child, harm the nascent family, or deter prospective adoptive parents from pursuing an intercountry adoption” see paragraph 301 below). Although Russia was not specifically referred to in the Resolution, it was introduced by US Senator Roger Wicker in direct response to the ban on adoptions by United States nationals.
According to a news report by RIA Novosti of 5 July 2013, the Russian Ministry of External Affairs dismissed as futile any attempts by the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly to make Russia annul the previously adopted decisions concerning intercountry adoption, the latter being in full compliance with international law.
Application no. 6033/13 was lodged on 22 January 2013 by three groups of applicants.
A.J.H., born on 16 May 1976, and J.A.H., born on 26 June 1977, who live in Vaughn, Montana, United States (the US applicants), and D.M., who was born on 17 August 2009 and lives in Lobnya, the Moscow Region.
D.M. suffers, in particular, from Down syndrome, delayed psychological and speech development, congenital heart disease and insufficient blood flow. He was born prematurely.
Having completed the necessary steps for intercountry adoption within the United States, the US applicants were registered in the Russian State databank as prospective adoptive parents on 6 August 2012. They were assisted by the authorised adoption agency “Hand in Hand”.
On 24 September 2012 the US applicants obtained a referral to visit D.M. from the Ministry of Education and Science. They visited him every day between 24 and 28 September 2012 and again between 10 and either 13 or 14 January 2013. Each visit lasted between an hour and an hour and a half.
On 27 September 2012 the US applicants formally agreed to adopt D.M.

On 15 January 2013 the US applicants appeared before the court. However, the hearing was adjourned at the request of the Ministry of Education of the Moscow Region, which cited a lack of guidance from the Supreme Court of Russia on the application of Law no. 272-FZ. A new hearing was scheduled for 21 January 2013.
On 21 January 2013 the US applicants appeared before the court. However, the Moscow Regional Court postponed the hearing until 11 February 2013 in response to a similar request from the Ministry of Education of the Moscow Region.
On 22 January 2013 the US applicants left for the United States. They booked a flight for 9 February 2013 in order to be present at the next hearing.
On 23 January 2013 the US applicants’ representative, Ms Zakharina, was informed that the hearing had been rescheduled for an earlier date, namely 30 January 2013. This left the US applicants insufficient time to reschedule their trip to Russia, and they were unable to be present at the hearing.
On 30 January 2013 the Moscow Regional Court discontinued the adoption procedure on the grounds that under Law no. 272-FZ the US applicants had no right to adopt D.M. The US applicants appealed.
On 14 May 2013 the Moscow Regional Court upheld the decision of 30 January 2013. The US applicants lodged cassation appeal.
On 26 August 2013 the Moscow Regional Court refused leave to have the cassation appeal examined by the Presidium.

On 11 February 2013 the adoption application was submitted to the St. Petersburg City Court.
On 13 February 2013 the St. Petersburg City Court rejected the application on the grounds that G.D.C. could not be represented by her representative, E.F., because an application of this kind could only be submitted by an authorised agency. The US applicant appealed.
On 5 March 2013 the US applicant tried to visit E.G. at the orphanage but was denied access.
On 12 March 2013 the US applicant resubmitted the application through another representative, O.T.
On 21 March 2013 the second application was rejected for the same reasons. The US applicant appealed.

According to the US applicants, they did not ask E.F. to withdraw the application, and she did not apply to the court to have it withdrawn. Rather, the court asked her to take it back. The US applicants were not informed of this ruling, but having learned about it, they filed a complaint against it, arguing that they had never requested their representative to withdraw the application and that the power of attorney did not empower her to do that.

According to the US applicant, she did not have sufficient time to prepare all the necessary documents in order to be able to submit the adoption application to a court before the entry into force of Law no. 272FZ. After its entry into force she realised that this would be futile, although she remained willing to adopt V.O.
On 31 May 2013 the US applicant was informed that she had been removed from the State databank as a prospective adoptive parent.
According to the Government, V.O. is still available for adoption, and the competent authorities provide prospective adoptive parents looking for a child with information about her.

In particular, they were asked to corroborate the powers of their representative to act as such in matters concerning adoption in view of the fact that the power of attorney had been issued to E.F. as a private person, whereas pursuant to Article 4 § 4 of the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption only authorised agencies could act as representatives. On 9 January 2013 the application was returned to E.F. on the grounds that the shortcomings had not been rectified.
According to the US applicants, they were never informed of any alleged shortcomings in their adoption application. Furthermore, several days before 1 January 2013 a judge had called E.F. and had asked her to withdraw the application, even though E.F.’s power of attorney did not authorise her to do so. Several days later E.F. found out that the application had been “lost” and the only record of submission was a note in the court’s register.
The US applicants also allege that on 11 January 2012 the head of a branch of adoption agency “Hand in Hand” had asked the Chairman of the St. Petersburg Committee on Social Policy for permission to continue its activity as an adoption agency in St. Petersburg through its legal representatives E.F. and I.Z. The permission was granted, and on 11 January 2012 the adoption agency “Hand in Hand” issued E.F. with a power of attorney valid for three years to represent the interests of adoptive parents before the courts of St. Petersburg.
According to the Government, the St. Petersburg Committee on Social Policy did not have the competence to authorise the activity of an adoption agency. The matter fell within the exclusive competence of the Ministry of Education. E.F. and I.Z. were registered at the Ministry of Education as employees of the adoption agency “Hand in Hand” during the period 2009-11.
According to the US applicants, on 12 and 28 March and 3 April 2013 their representative O.T. requested a copy of the St. Petersburg City Court’s ruling on their application. However, the file was not in the registry and she was not presented with a copy. On 11 April 2013 O.T. resubmitted her request to Judge G. and the President of the St. Petersburg City Court. In a letter of 16 April 2013 Judge G. refused to provide her with a copy of the ruling. On 22 April 2013 O.T. filed a complaint against the refusal. It is not clear whether the complaint has been examined.
According to the Government, O.T.’s request was refused as there were no procedural means whereby to provide persons acting as intermediaries in adoption proceedings with copies of documents.
On 31 May 2013 the US applicants were informed that they had been removed from the State databank as prospective adoptive parents.
According to the Government, V.G. is still available for adoption, and the competent authorities provide prospective adoptive parents looking for a child with information about her.

On 19 December 2012 the US applicants obtained a referral to visit D.K. They visited her twice a day between 19 and 21 December 2012. Each visit lasted approximately two hours.
On 21 December 2012 the US applicants formally agreed to adopt D.K.
The adoption application was not submitted to the court. According to the US applicants, it would have been submitted if it had not been for the entry into force of Law no. 272-FZ.
According to the Government, on 24 April 2013 the US applicants were informed that they had been removed from the State databank as prospective adoptive parents. According to the US applicants, they were never informed of this fact.

The US applicant was assisted by the authorised adoption agency “International Assistance Group Inc.”.
On 21 November 2012 the US applicant obtained a referral to visit K.R. from the Committee on Social Policy of the St Petersburg Administration. She visited her every day between 21 and 23 November 2012. Each visit lasted two hours.
On 27 November 2012 the US applicant formally agreed to adopt K.R.
On 11 February 2013 the adoption application was submitted to the St. Petersburg City Court by T. from the adoption agency.
On 13 February 2013 the court returned the application on the grounds that the activity of the adoption agency had been banned pursuant to Law no. 272-FZ. The US applicant appealed.
On 27 March 2013 the appeal statement was returned on the grounds that it had been submitted in breach of procedural rules. In particular, it failed to state whether the US applicant had been provided with a translation of the ruling and her signature had not been certified by a notary. The US applicant filed a complaint against this ruling.
On 20 June 2013 the complaint was returned without examination.
On 31 May 2013 the US applicant was informed that she had been removed from the State databank as a prospective adoptive parent.
According to the Government, K.R. has been adopted by a different adoptive family.

On 19 November 2012 the US applicants obtained a referral to visit A.E.A. They visited her twice a day between 19 and 23 November 2012. Each visit lasted between one and a half and two hours.
The adoption application was not submitted to a court. According to the US applicants, after their visit to Russia in November 2012 they had to amend a number of documents in their adoption file so as to make it conform with the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption. However, Law no. 272FZ left them no time to submit the adoption application to a court before its entry into force.
On 24 April 2013 the US applicants were informed that they had been removed from the State databank as prospective adoptive parents.
According to the Government, A.E.A. has been placed with a foster family.

On 4 April 2014 the US applicants’ representative informed the Court that they wished to withdraw the application.
Application no. 23890/13 was lodged on 5 April 2013 by M.W., born on 2 February 1961, and D.W., born on 17 March 1964, who live in Woodstock, Virginia, United States (the US applicants), and M.K., who was born on 21 March 1998 and lives in Chelyabinsk.
M.K. was born prematurely. He suffers, in particular, from RussellSilver syndrome, light cognitive disorder, delay of neurological and behavioural development and chronic gastritis.
Between 2001 and 2012 the US applicants were involved in charity work in the Chelyabinsk Region. In particular, they helped with the renovation of an orphanage, where in 2008 they met M.K.
According to the US applicants, having developed a close relationship with M.K., in the winter of 2011-2012 they decided to adopt him and initiated the adoption procedure. They contacted about forty adoption agencies asking for assistance with the procedure. However, their attempts were unsuccessful as no adoption agency worked with the Chelyabinsk Region. For this reason they decided to proceed on their own, although the adoption agency Beacon House Adoption Services agreed to provide them with advice on the procedure.
In March 2012, during a consultation at the Ministry of Social Relations of the Chelyabinsk Region, the US applicants expressed their wish to adopt M.K. According to the US applicants, the ministry confirmed that there were no authorised adoption agencies operating in the Chelyabinsk Region and stated that the US applicants could proceed on their own. At the same time their adoption file was rejected on the grounds that the apostille on certain documents was incorrect and some additional documents were required.
In March 2012 the US applicants twice visited M.K. at the orphanage, with each meeting lasting three hours.
On 30 July 2012 the US applicants submitted to the Ministry of Social Relations of the Chelyabinsk Region a corrected set of documents for the adoption of M.K.
However, on 8 August 2012 the Minister of Social Relations of the Chelyabinsk Region informed the US applicants that, since the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption had been ratified, with effect from 10 August 2012 individual applications for adoption could not be accepted. For this reason he returned their application for non-compliance with the requirements set by Government Decree no. 654 of 4 November 2006 (see paragraph 318 below).
On 17 August 2012 the US applicants contacted the Head of the State databank, who wrongly informed them that the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption had not been ratified and that they could proceed with the adoption procedure on their own.
In a telephone conversation on 20 August 2012 the US applicants told the Ministry of Social Relations of the Chelyabinsk Region about the information received from the Head of the State databank. According to the ministry, it was awaiting official clarifications from the Head of the State databank to this effect.
On 22 August 2012 the US applicants again contacted the Ministry of Social Relations of the Chelyabinsk Region by telephone and were told that they could proceed with the adoption on their own.
On 22 August 2012 according to the US applicants and on 4 September 2012 according to the Government, the adoption file was resubmitted to the Ministry of Social Relations of the Chelyabinsk Region.
On 19 September 2012 the adoption file was returned and the US applicants were requested to amend certain documents and to enclose some additional documents.
On 3 December 2012, having amended the adoption file, the US applicants again resubmitted the application. By that time the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption ‒ including a provision stating that an adoption application might only be submitted through an authorised agency ‒ had entered into force.
On 11 December 2012 the Ministry of Social Relations of the Chelyabinsk Region rejected the application on the grounds that it had been submitted by the US applicants directly and not by an authorised adoption agency. It was recommended that the US applicants re-apply via an agency.
According to the applicants, the adoption procedure was eventually halted by the entry into force of Law no. 272-FZ.
The US applicants were never registered in the State databank as prospective adoptive parents.

On 19 December 2012 the US applicant submitted the adoption application to the Leningrad Regional Court.
On 25 December 2012 the Leningrad Regional Court stayed the proceedings due to certain shortcomings in the documents submitted. In particular, on the certificate confirming that the US applicant had undergone the requisite training for prospective adoptive parents, her middle name was not indicated, causing the court to express doubts as to whether the certificate had actually been issued to her. In addition, the validity of the certificate confirming her living conditions had expired on 7 November 2012 and she therefore needed to renew it. Moreover, the application did not contain any information about M.I.’s father and siblings, if any; the medical certificate detailing M.I.’s state of health failed to include the opinions of certain doctors; information about the US applicant’s income was not accurate; and a document corroborating the US applicant’s housing rights was not attached.

They were assisted by the authorised adoption agency “New Hope Christian Services”.
On 20 February 2012 the US applicants obtained a referral to visit K.K. from the Committee on Social Policy of the St Petersburg Administration. They visited her every day between 21 and 23 February 2012. Each visit lasted approximately two hours.
On 29 February 2012 the US applicants formally agreed to adopt K.K.
On 8 November 2012 the adoption application was submitted to the St. Petersburg City Court.
On 12 November 2012 the St. Petersburg City Court stayed the proceedings on the grounds that certain documents were not enclosed and instructed the US applicants to submit them by 11 December 2012. At the US applicants’ request, the deadline was subsequently extended to 15 January 2013. According to the US applicants, after the entry into force of the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption, they had to comply with additional requirements introduced by the Agreement. Later they also had to provide proof that their house had not been affected by Hurricane Sandy, which hit the north-eastern United States in October 2012.
On 15 January 2013 the St. Petersburg City Court returned the application without examination on the grounds that the additional documents submitted by the applicants were not complete. In particular, the section of the report on the US applicants’ living conditions containing the date and signature had not been translated. A photograph of the child’s room was not informative. Moreover, there were no photographs of the US applicants with K.K., and a document confirming that the US applicants had undergone the requisite training for prospective adoptive parents had not been enclosed. No appeal was lodged against this ruling.
On 22 May 2013 the US applicants’ representative S. resubmitted the adoption application.
On 23 May 2013 St. Petersburg City Court returned the application without examination on the grounds that it had been submitted by a private person acting on the US applicants’ behalf, whereas pursuant to virtue of Article 4 § 4 of the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption it could only be submitted by an authorised agency. The US applicants appealed.
On 20 June 2013 St. Petersburg City Court returned the appeal statement without examination, making reference to Law no. 272-FZ.
On 31 May 2013 the US applicants were informed that they had been removed from the State databank as prospective adoptive parents.
According to the Government, K.K. has been adopted by a different adoptive family.
Application no. 37173/13 was lodged on 7 June 2013 by J.W.H., born on 29 July 1981, A.M.H., born on 18 March 1969 (the US applicants) and G.N.Y.H., born on 3 December 2008, who live in Smartsville, California, United States, and V.B., who was born on 14 November 2001 and lives in Prokopyevsk.
V.B. suffers from light mental development delay, light speech development delay and a mixed form of dysgraphia and dyslexia.
On 5 July 2010 the US applicants adopted the third applicant, G.N.Y.H. As a result of what appears to be a clerical mistake, the information about her siblings had not been included in the State databank.
According to the Government, the information regarding G.N.Y.H.’s brother, V.B., had been included in G.N.Y.H.’s file, however, and the US applicants had studied this in March 2010.
In the decision of the Kemerovo Region Court of 5 July 2010 on G.N.Y.H.’s adoption it was stated that although G.N.Y.H. had an elder brother, V.B., the court considered it possible for G.N.Y.H. to be adopted alone because the children were being placed in different institutions, their family relations had been interrupted, and the adoption was in the interests of G.N.Y.H.
According to the US applicants, having learned that G.N.Y.H. had a brother, they started corresponding with V.B. and sent him letters, photos and parcels. They also started making enquiries with a view to adopting V.B. as well. In a letter of 29 April 2011 the prosecutor’s office of the Kemerovo Region advised the US applicants that, as they had been registered as the prospective adoptive parents in respect of one particular child, they would have to reapply to the competent authorities and resubmit documents amended accordingly should they wish to adopt another child. In a letter of 15 June 2011 the same prosecutor’s office acknowledged that the information on G.N.Y.H.’s siblings had not been included in the State databank as a result of a clerical mistake. It noted, however, that the information about V.B. had been included in G.N.Y.H.’s personal file, which the US applicants had studied on 24 March 2010. The prosecutor’s office also confirmed that V.B. was available for adoption and that it was open to the US applicants to apply to the competent authorities for his adoption. The US applicants then initiated the adoption procedure.
On 12 May 2012 “Hand in Hand”, an authorised adoption agency acting on behalf of the US applicants, filed an application for V.B.’s adoption with the Directorate of Education and Science of the Kemerovo Region. On the same date the US applicants were registered in the State databank as prospective adoptive parents.
According to the Government, the US applicants had initially intended to visit V.B. in June 2012, but they asked if they might change the dates of their visit to October 2012. However, they did not reapply for a later visit. Accordingly, they were never issued with a referral to visit V.B. and never met him.
According to the US applicants, at the relevant time they had also applied to adopt another child from Russia, X., and they had accepted a referral to visit her in June 2012. They then also received a referral to visit V.B. in June 2012. Although they were willing to meet both children, they were advised that it was necessary to finalise the adoption of X. first. Accordingly, they asked for permission to visit V.B. in October 2012. However, they were subsequently advised that in July 2012 the regional authorities had banned the adoption of children by US nationals following an incident of ill-treatment of a child from the Kemerovo Region by his adoptive parents from the United States.
In December 2012, when the US applicants went to Russia to finalise the adoption of X., they learned that the regional ban on adoption of children by US nationals had been lifted. However, the US applicants were unable to proceed with the adoption of V.B. due to the entry into force of the Law no. 272-FZ.
According to the Government, V.B. is living in an orphanage.
Application no. 38490/13 was lodged on 12 June 2013 by A.B., born on 24 July 1964 and who lives in Bellevue, Nebraska, United States (the US applicant), and Ye.L., who was born on 23 July 2009 and lives in Novosibirsk.
Ye.L. was born prematurely. He suffers from hearing loss, speech development delay and respiratory ailments.
The US applicant initiated the adoption procedure in 2008. As the adoption agency’s licence was later revoked, she had to restart the procedure in 2011. Having completed the necessary steps for intercountry adoption within the United States, the US applicant was registered in the Russian State databank as a prospective adoptive parent on 25 June 2012.
On 19 July 2012 the US applicant obtained a referral to visit Ye.L. She visited him on four consecutive days in July 2012.
On 22 July 2012 the US applicant formally agreed to adopt Ye.L.
According to the US applicant, preparation of an adoption file took more time after the entry into force of the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption, which stipulated a number of additional requirements. The adoption application was ultimately not submitted to a court due to the entry into force of Law no. 272-FZ.
On 10 June 2013 the US applicant was informed that she had been removed from the State databank as a prospective adoptive parent.
According to the Government, Ye.L. has been placed with a foster family.
Application no. 42340/13 was lodged on 30 June 2013 by M.B., born on 28 December 1966, and D.B., born on 9 November 1968, who live in Alabaster, Alabama, United States (the US applicants), and K.S., who was born on 29 November 2005 and lives in St. Petersburg.
K.S. suffers from psychological development delay, atopic dermatitis, planovalgus deformity and a phonematic disorder.
Between 13 December 2010 and 17 January 2011 K.S. stayed at the US applicants’ home as a part of the orphan-hosting programme “New Horizons for Children”.
As soon as K.S. had left, the US applicants started making enquiries about adoption. In March 2011 they started the adoption procedure.
On 20 February 2012 the US applicants were registered in the State databank as prospective adoptive parents.
After 2011, the US applicants met with K.S. on three occasions. Each time they came to St. Petersburg for a week and visited K.S. daily. Each visit lasted from two to three hours.
According to the Government, on 13 December 2011 the US applicants submitted the application for K.S.’s adoption to the St. Petersburg City Court. As certain documents were not enclosed, the proceedings were stayed and the US applicants were instructed to submit the documents requested by 10 January 2012. The term was then extended to 9 February 2012. As the US applicants failed to submit the documents, on the latter date the adoption application was returned to them without examination. No appeal was lodged against this ruling.
According to the US applicants, in November-December 2011 and February-March 2012 they had travelled to Russia as they wished to adopt K.S. and her younger brother. It transpired that they were unable to go ahead with the adoption because, although K.S.’s mother’s parental rights had been revoked, the revocation of her father’s parental rights was pending but not yet finalised. This issue was resolved in March 2012. However, in April 2012 the US applicants were informed that K.S.’s biological mother had had a baby girl, and that K.S. thus had two siblings. In May 2012 they amended the adoption file so as to apply for adoption of three children: K.S. and both her brother and sister. In September 2012 they were obliged to comply with additional requirements introduced by the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption, which included additional training courses. The adoption procedure was ultimately halted by the entry into force of Law no. 272-FZ.
According to the Government, K.S. is still available for adoption, and the competent authorities provide prospective adoptive parents looking for a child with information about her.
Application no. 42403/13 was lodged on 30 June 2013 by M.M., born on 20 September 1974, and J.M., born on 9 August 1976, who live in Westminster, MD, United States (the US applicants), A.M., who was born on 11 June 2002 and lives in Furmanov, the Ivanovo Region, and D.T., who was born on 22 October 2002 and lives in Kineshma, the Ivanovo Region.
A.M. and D.T. are not related. Their parents have been stripped of parental rights. D.T. suffers from mitral heart prolapse, residual encephalopathy, mixed disorder of psychological development and gallbladder anomaly. A.M. had been adopted at the age of five years old but was then returned to the orphanage. She suffers from a mixed disorder of psychological development and light myopia.
The US applicants initiated the adoption procedure in 2011. Having completed the necessary steps for intercountry adoption within the United States, they were registered in the Russian State databank as prospective adoptive parents on 11 April 2012. They were assisted by the authorised adoption agency “Hand in Hand”.
On 13 September 2012 the US applicants obtained a referral to visit both A.M. and D.T. from the Department of Social Security of the Ivanovo Region so as to choose between the two girls. They visited D.T. twice and A.M. three times in September 2012 and eventually decided to adopt both girls.
On 27 September 2012 the US applicants formally agreed to adopt A.M. and D.T. According to the US applicants, A.M. and D.T. met and bonded.
On 31 October 2012 the adoption application was submitted to the Ivanovo Regional Court.
On 6 November 2012 the Ivanovo Regional Court stayed the proceedings on the grounds that certain documents, such as confirmation of the US applicants’ registration in the State databank and the girls’ entry permits for the United States, were not enclosed. It instructed the US applicants to submit the documents requested by 27 November 2012.
According to the US applicants, on 27 November 2012 they provided the documents in question.
On 4 December 2012 the Ivanovo Regional Court returned the adoption application without examination on the grounds that the US applicants had failed to provide the documents requested.
On 14 December 2012 the US applicants resubmitted the adoption application.
On 18 December 2012 the Ivanovo Regional Court stayed the proceedings on the grounds that some of the enclosed documents did not satisfy the procedural requirements. In particular, (i) although the US applicants had submitted a property certificate concerning a plot of land, it did not provide sufficient information about their dwelling; (ii) the attestation of the US applicants’ suitability to become adoptive parents had been issued more than a year previously and was therefore outdated; and (iii) medical opinion concerning the US applicants’ state of health did not satisfy the Ministry of Health requirements. The US applicants were instructed to rectify these shortcomings by 10 January 2013.
On 9 January 2013 the Ivanovo Regional Court rejected the application on the grounds that, pursuant to Law no. 272-FZ, the US applicants did not have a right to adopt A.M. and D.T. The US applicants appealed.
On 4 February 2013 the Ivanovo Regional Court upheld the ruling of 9 January 2013 on appeal. The US applicants lodged an appeal on points of law.
On 17 April 2013 the Presidium of the Ivanovo Regional Court rejected the appeal on points of law.
On 25 April 2013 the US applicants were informed that they had been removed from the State databank as prospective adoptive parents.
According to the Government, A.M. is still available for adoption, and the competent authorities provide prospective adoptive parents looking for a child with information about them. D.T. has been placed with a foster family.
Russia signed the Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption of 29 May 1993 (The Hague Adoption Convention) on 7 September 2000, but it has not yet been ratified. Russia is not a party to the European Convention on the Adoption of Children, which opened for signature in Strasbourg on 24 April 1967.
On 13 June 1990 Russia ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989. The Convention provides, in so far as relevant:
Article 21
“States Parties that recognise and/or permit the system of adoption shall ensure that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration and they shall:
(a)  Ensure that the adoption of a child is authorised only by competent authorities who determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures and on the basis of all pertinent and reliable information, that the adoption is permissible in view of the child’s status concerning parents, relatives and legal guardians and that, if required, the persons concerned have given their informed consent to the adoption on the basis of such counselling as may be necessary;
(b)  Recognise that inter-country adoption may be considered as an alternative means of childcare, if the child cannot be placed in a foster or an adoptive family or cannot in any suitable manner be cared for in the child’s country of origin; ...”
At its twenty-second annual session held in Istanbul, Turkey between 29 June and 3 July 2013, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly adopted the Resolution on Intercountry Adoptions, which reads as follows:
“1.  Desirous that a child, for the full development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love, and understanding,
Understanding the necessity to take appropriate measures to keep the child with his or her birth family but, where that is not possible, to place the child with a substitute family in the child’s country of origin for the purposes of upbringing,
Acknowledging that intercountry adoption may offer the advantages of a permanent family to a child if a suitable family cannot be found for the child in his or her country of origin,
Affirming the sovereign prerogatives and responsibilities of participating States to permit, prohibit, restrict, or otherwise regulate the practice of intercountry adoptions consistent with international norms and commitments,
Concerned that the political volatility of intercountry adoptions can have a deterring effect on the willingness of prospective adoptive parents to commit the substantial emotional and other resources required to pursue an intercountry adoption, thus increasing the likelihood that more children will be deprived of the happiness, love, and understanding of a family,
Sensitive to the fact that a child who is unable to grow up with his or her birth family has suffered loss, rejection, abandonment, neglect, or abuse and that, in all matters relating to the placement of a child outside the care of his or her own parents, the best interests of the child, particularly his or her need for affection and right to security and continuing care, should be the paramount consideration and every effort should be made to spare the child further disappointment and harm,
Recognizing the bond that forms rapidly between a child and prospective adoptive parents during the adoption process but before a legal parent-child relationship has been effected,
Convinced that this bond forms the foundation of a nascent family and that such a family is worthy of the recognition, respect, and protection of participating States,
The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly:
Calls on participating States to recognize the foundational bond between prospective adoptive parents and the child and to honor and protect these nascent families;
Urges participating States to resolve differences, disputes, and controversies related to intercountry adoptions in a positive and humanitarian spirit with special attention being given to avoid any general, indiscriminate disruption of intercountry adoptions already in progress that could jeopardize the best interests of the child, harm the nascent family, or deter prospective adoptive parents from pursuing an intercountry adoption;
Requests the OSCE take the necessary steps in a Ministerial Council decision, possibly in the context of existing human dimension commitments concerning family reunification, to clarify the issue of safeguarding, on a collective basis, the nascent family formed where an intercountry adoption is well-advanced.”
Article 6 § 3 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation provides:
“Foreign nationals and stateless persons have in the Russian Federation the same rights and obligations as nationals of the Russian Federation except as provided in a federal law or an international treaty of the Russian Federation.”
Article 15 provides, insofar as relevant:
“4.  The generally recognised principles and norms of international law and the international treaties of the Russian Federation shall be an integral part of its legal system. If an international treaty of the Russian Federation establishes rules other than those provided for by the law, the rules of the international treaty shall apply.”
Article 269 (2) of the Code provides that nationals of the Russian Federation permanently living abroad, foreign nationals and stateless persons may submit an adoption application to a court according to the place of residence or whereabouts of the child they are seeking to adopt.
Pursuant to Article 270, the adoption application should contain the name of the adoptive parent(s) and his/her/their place of residence; the name, date of birth and place of residence or whereabouts of the child that is the candidate for adoption together with clarification as to whether he/she has any siblings; reasons for the application; a request, if any, to change the child’s name or date of birth.
Article 271 provides a list of documents to be submitted with the adoption application, including:
(1)  a copy of the child’s birth certificate;
(2)  a copy of the adoptive parents’ marriage certificate if the application is submitted by a married couple;
(3)  if the application is submitted by one of the spouses, the other spouse’s consent or a document attesting that marital relations have been discontinued and the spouses have not been living together for over a year, or other written proof thereof;
(4)  medical report on the state of health of the adoptive parent(s);
(5)  employment certificate and either a pay statement or other document attesting income;
(6)  a document either confirming title to a property or the right to use a dwelling;
(7)  a document confirming that the applicant(s) has (have) been included in the register as a prospective adoptive parent;
(8)  a document confirming that the applicant(s) has (have) undergone the requisite training for prospective adoptive parents.
Article 271 (1.1-2) further provides that nationals of the Russian Federation permanently living abroad, foreign nationals and stateless persons should enclose with their application, in addition to the documents listed above, an attestation from the competent agency in the applicant’s home State (or of the Russian national’s permanent place of residence) as to their living conditions and suitability to become adoptive parents, as well as a permit from that State authorising the child’s entry and subsequent permanent residence in the State.
Article 272 (1) states that in the course of its preparation for the hearing, the court must obtain an opinion from the custody and guardianship office concerning the prospective adoption. Pursuant to Article 272 (2), in cases involving the adoption by nationals of the Russian Federation permanently living abroad, foreign nationals and stateless persons, a document attesting to the impossibility of placing the child in the care of Russian nationals or of the child’s relatives ‒ irrespective of their nationality and place of residence ‒ should be enclosed with the opinion.
Pursuant to Article 273, the adoption application is examined by a court in camera in the mandatory presence of the adoptive parent(s), a representative from the custody and guardianship office, the prosecutor, and the child if the latter is over fourteen years old; the presence of the child’s parents, other interested parties and the child ‒ if aged between ten and fourteen years old ‒ can also be required if deemed necessary.
Pursuant to Article 274, if the court grants the adoption application, the rights and obligations of the adoptive parents and the adopted child become established on the date of the entry into force of the decision.
Pursuant to Article 126 of the Code, Russian local executive agencies must keep a register of foreign nationals and stateless persons wishing to adopt a child.
Article 165 of the Code provides that adoption of a child who is a Russian national by foreign persons should be carried out in compliance with the law of the State of the adoptive parents’ nationality. At the same time, the general provisions of Russian law concerning adoption and the provisions of the relevant international treaties should also be complied with.
The Decree provides that adoption by foreign nationals or stateless persons of children who are Russian nationals is allowed only when it appears impossible to place such children in the care of Russian nationals permanently residing in Russia or of the children’s relatives, irrespective of the latter’s nationality and place of residence (Article 24).
The Decree further provides that an adoption agency specifically authorised by a foreign State through its representatives in Russia may represent the interests of Russian nationals permanently living abroad, foreign nationals or stateless persons in respect of adoption-related matters (Article 25).
The law governs the functioning of the State databank of children left without parental care (“the State databank”). According to the law, the State databank should also contain information about persons wishing to adopt a child, including that person’s nationality (Section 7). Information about a person may be removed from the State databank, in particular, if the circumstances allowing that person to accept a child into his or her family have changed (Section 9 § 2). The law uses the terms “federal operator” of the State databank for a federal executive agency and “regional operator” for an executive agency of a subject of the Russian Federation, which carries out the placement in families of children left without parental care (Section 1).
The Decree develops the provisions of Federal Law no. 44-FZ of 16 April 2001 and provides a procedure for persons wishing to adopt a child, with which they must comply prior to submitting an adoption application to a court. Article 20 of the Decree sets out the list of documents that must be submitted to the operator of the State databank of children left without parental care by Russian nationals permanently living abroad, foreign nationals or stateless persons wishing to adopt a child. They include:
(1)  a statement of intent to adopt a child and a request to obtain information on children from the State databank of children left without parental care;
(2)  a completed application form;
(3)  an undertaking to register the child with a Russian consulate abroad;
(4)  an undertaking to allow inspection of the adopted child’s living conditions;
(5)  a copy of an identity document;
(6)  an attestation by the competent agency in the person’s home State as to his or her living conditions and suitability to become an adoptive parent;
(7)  an undertaking by the competent agency in the person’s home State to monitor the adopted child’s living conditions and upbringing in the adoptive parents’ family;
(8)  an undertaking by the competent agency in the person’s home State to ensure that the adopted child is registered with a Russian consulate abroad;
(9)  a copy of the licence or other document confirming the authority of the competent agency in the person’s home State referred to in (6) above.
All the above documents should be notarised and a certified Russian translation of foreign language documents should be provided (Article 23). Upon receipt of the documents, the operator of the State databank will provide the foreign applicant with information about candidate children who correspond to the applicant’s wishes or will return the documents with a written refusal to provide the information requested, indicating the reasons for the refusal (Article 24). If the outcome is favourable, the operator will provide the applicant with a referral to visit the child (Article 25). The referral is valid for a period of ten days, which can be extended by the operator. The applicant must visit the child and subsequently inform the operator whether he/she wishes to continue the adoption procedure (Article 16). Within ten days of receipt of the foreign applicant’s request to adopt a child, the regional operator will transmit the information about the applicant and the child to the federal operator. Within a further ten days the latter will confirm the child’s inclusion in the State databank and the impossibility of placing the child in the care of Russian nationals permanently residing in Russia (Article 28). Within another ten days the foreign applicant should inform the operator in writing (a) that the adoption application has been submitted to a court; (b) of the court’s decision in this respect; (c) of the applicant’s decision to abandon his or her efforts to find a child for adoption and the removal of the information about him/her from the State databank (Article 29).
The Decree contains provisions on the opening, functioning and discontinuation of the activities of foreign adoption agencies’ representative offices in Russia. Article 2 of the Decree authorises the Ministry of Education and Science to issue permits to open a representative office. Pursuant to Article 20 of the Decree, representative offices of foreign adoption agencies may carry out the following activities in Russia:
(1)  submit an application seeking a child for adoption to an executive agency or the Ministry of Education and Science and submit an adoption application to a court;
(2)  obtain information about the child on the basis of the prospective adoptive parents’ application;
(3)  issue invitations and provide visa support for prospective adoptive parents;
(4)  arrange accommodation for prospective adoptive parents and assist them with the adoption procedure;
(5)  participate in court hearings on adoption cases, receive judicial decisions on adoption and assist adoptive parents in obtaining a birth certificate and a passport for the child to enable the latter travel outside Russia;
(6)  carry out on Russian territory any other lawful activity related to the representation of adoptive parents’ and prospective adoptive parents’ interests.
Pursuant to Article 14 of the Decree, the representative office of a foreign adoption agency which has received a decision ordering either the suspension or discontinuation of its activity must cease its adoption-related activity.
The Rules adopted by the Decree govern the activity of the Ministry of Education and Science in so far as it concerns its functions as the federal operator of the State databank.
The Decree contains instructions on measures to be taken with a view to encouraging adoption by Russian nationals. They include, in particular, simplification of the adoption procedure, improvement of the medical care offered to orphaned children and children left without parental care, and an increase in social benefits. The Decree also instructs the Supreme Court to provide clarifications for the lower courts on the application of Law 272-FZ.
The purpose of the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption was explained in a Joint Statement by the Presidents of the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Intercountry Adoption released on 24 June 2010. The Statement reads as follows:
“We are convinced that all children have the right to grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding. Many children throughout the world are deprived of this natural right.
Every year, tens of thousands of children find loving parents through adoptions, including international adoptions. We honor those who have the generosity to welcome adopted children, in particular from other countries, into their families.
However, tragic incidents involving children adopted between our countries caused by the adoptive parents underscore the importance of ensuring reliable protections for the rights, safety, and well-being of adopted children. We are committed to doing everything in our power to achieve this.
In this regard, we have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to conclude a legally binding bilateral agreement on cooperation in the field of intercountry adoption. At our direction, experts from the United States and Russia have already been actively working on a draft, and they have informed us that they have made considerable progress in fulfilling this difficult task.
We will work together so that entry into force of this agreement as soon as possible would create an even stronger legal basis for adoption in the interests of children and families of both our countries.”
The Bilateral Agreement on Adoption was signed in Washington, DC on 13 July 2011. It was ratified by the Russian State Duma on 28 July 2012 (Federal Law no. 150-FZ) and entered into force on 1 November 2012.
The Bilateral Agreement on Adoption sets out the procedure to be followed by Russian nationals for the adoption of children who are nationals of the United States and by nationals of the United States for the adoption of children who are nationals of Russia. It provides, in particular, that the adoption of a child from Russia shall occur only with the assistance of an authorised organisation, except in cases of adoption by the child’s relatives (Article 4 §§ 4 and 5). The authorised organisation must be an entity in the United States authorised to perform activities in the field of intercountry adoption in accordance with the domestic laws of the United States and authorised to perform such activities on Russian territory in accordance with Russian domestic laws and the Bilateral Agreement on Adoption (Article 1 § 5).
The Bilateral Agreement on Adoption further provides that the prospective adoptive parents must obtain written appraisals of their living conditions and their suitability and eligibility to adopt a child, which must be issued by the competent authorities in the receiving country, that is to say in the country where the child will reside after his or her adoption (Article 8 § 1). The procedure for the prospective adoptive parents or an authorised organisation for submitting an adoption application to the competent authority of the country of origin (the country of which the child is a citizen and where he or she is habitually resident prior to the adoption) is determined by the domestic laws of the country of origin (Article 9 § 1). After the prospective adoptive parents have become personally acquainted with the child and have given their formal agreement, the competent authority of the receiving country, if required by the domestic laws of either party, shall:
(a)  review the documentation submitted by the prospective adoptive parents indicating that
(i)  the adoption and transfer are being carried out with the assistance of an authorised organisation;
(ii)  the prospective adoptive parents have been duly informed of the requirements for completing the process of adoption in accordance with the domestic laws of the country of origin;
(b)  confirm that the prospective adoptive parents have received the information and undergone all the requisite psycho-social preparation with the assistance of the authorised organisation or the competent authority; and that the appraisal regarding the prospective adoptive parents’ suitability and eligibility to adopt a child remains legally valid on the basis of all the available information about the child matched against the prospective adoptive parents, including the child’s social situation and medical history, his or her special needs, his or her availability for adoption and a detailed conclusion concerning his or her current state of health;
(c)  issue a preliminary conclusion concerning the eligibility of the prospective adoptive parents to move the child who is being adopted from the country of origin to the receiving country (Article 10 § 1).
The Bilateral Agreement on Adoption also contains the following provisions concerning its purposes, scope, applicable law and termination:
Article 3
“1.  This Agreement is concluded for the purposes of ensuring that adoption of children from the United States of America to the Russian Federation and from the Russian Federation to the United States of America takes place with a view to ensuring the protection of the rights and best interests of the child.
The Parties shall cooperate with the goal of ensuring that adoption of children in accordance with this Agreement is based on the voluntary actions of the individuals involved in accordance with the Parties’ domestic laws.
The Parties shall take appropriate measures provided for by their domestic laws to prevent and suppress illegal activities involving children being adopted ...
The Parties proceed from the premise that this Agreement covers adoptions where the Country of Origin decides, in accordance with its domestic laws, that it is not possible to arrange for the upbringing of the children in their birth families and:
for the adoption of a child from the United States of America – when due consideration has been given to the possibilities for placement of the child with a family in the United States of America in accordance with its domestic law;
for the adoption of a child from the Russian Federation – when it does not appear to be possible to settle him or her for upbringing or place him or her with a family that could provide for his or her upbringing or adoption in the Russian Federation in accordance with its domestic law.”
Article 6
“1.  The adoption and transfer of a child under this Agreement shall be carried out in accordance with the domestic laws of the Parties and the provisions of this Agreement. The requirements for prospective adoptive parents shall be determined by the domestic laws of the Parties and the provisions of this Agreement.
The conditions under which a child may be adopted, the list of persons, organizations or bodies whose consent is required for the adoption, and also the form of such consent shall be determined by the domestic laws of the Country of Origin.
The decision regarding adoption of a child shall be made by the Country of Origin’s Competent Authority that makes a decision regarding adoption.”
Article 17
“... 4.  Prospective adoptive parents whose documents were registered at a Regional Authority of the Country of Origin at the time of entry into force of this Agreement shall have the right to complete the adoption procedure in accordance with the procedure which was in place prior to the entry into force of this Agreement. ...”
This Agreement shall remain in force until one year from the date that one of the Parties informs the other Party through diplomatic channels of its intention to terminate this Agreement. ...
Law no. 272-FZ was adopted by the State Duma on 21 December 2012, approved by the Senate on 26 December 2012 and signed by the President on 28 December 2012. It entered into force on 1 January 2013. Section 1 § 1 lists activities that constitute a breach of Russian nationals’ rights and freedoms, which include:
(a)  involvement in abuse of fundamental human rights and freedoms;
(b)  involvement in crimes against Russian nationals abroad;
(c)  actions or omissions leading to exemption from responsibility of persons involved in crimes against Russian nationals;
(d)  taking decisions resulting in the exemption from responsibility of persons involved in crimes against Russian nationals;
(e)  involvement in kidnapping and arbitrary imprisonment of Russian nationals;
(f)  delivery of arbitrary and biased convictions in respect of Russian nationals;
(g)  arbitrary prosecution of Russian nationals;
(h)  taking arbitrary decisions violating the rights and legitimate interests of Russian nationals.
Sections 1 and 2 of the law provide for a ban on entering Russia and for seizure of assets owned by United States nationals involved in such activities and a ban on carrying out any transactions involving the property and investments of such nationals. Under Section 2 § 1 an executive authority shall draw up a list of persons susceptible to such measures.
Section 3 § 1 also bans activity by non-commercial organisations involved in political life in Russia if they have received free of charge any assets from United States nationals or entities, or if they carry out on Russian territory projects, programmes or other activities which represent a threat to the interests of the Russian Federation. Under Section 3 § 2 a Russian national who is also a United States national may be neither a member nor the head of a non-commercial organisation or of a branch thereof, or of a branch of an international or foreign organisation if that organisation participates in political life in Russia.
The law contains the following provisions concerning the adoption of Russian children by United States nationals:
Article 4
“1.  It is forbidden to transfer children who are nationals of the Russian Federation for adoption by nationals of the United States of America; the operation of agencies and organisations aimed at selecting and transferring children who are nationals of the Russian Federation for adoption by nationals of the United States of America wishing to adopt such children [is also prohibited] on the territory of the Russian Federation.
Due to the prohibition established in paragraph 1 of the present Section on transfer of children who are nationals of the Russian Federation for adoption by the nationals of the United States of America, the Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Regarding Cooperation in Adoption of Children of 13 July 2011 is to be terminated by the Russian Federation.”
The Supreme Court provided the lower courts with the following instructions concerning the application of Law no. 272-FZ:
“In accordance with Article 125 § 3 of the Family Code of the Russian Federation and Article 274 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation, in cases where an adoption application is granted, the rights and obligations of the adoptive parent(s) and the adopted child become established on the date on which the court decision concerning the adoption enters into force.
Therefore, in cases where decisions concerning the adoption of children who are nationals of the Russian Federation by nationals of the United States of America were taken by the courts before 1 January 2013 and duly entered into force (even if after 1 January 2013), the children should be transferred to the adoptive parents.”
The Decree provides, inter alia, that regional operators should ensure that the transfer of children who are to be adopted by families of foreign nationals must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Law no. 272FZ (Article 3.4.3).
The memorandum states that, taking into account the ban on the adoption of Russian children by United States nationals introduced by Law no. 272-FZ, regional operators of the State databank should not issue a referral to visit a child to United States nationals who have been provided with information concerning the prospective adoptee.
Furthermore, in accordance with Section 9 § 2 of the Law on the State Databank, information about a prospective adoptive parent may be removed from the State databank, in particular, if the circumstances enabling the person to accept the child into his or her family for future upbringing have changed. Since the adoption of Russian children by United States nationals has become impossible, regional operators should remove information about prospective adoptive parents who are United States nationals and inform the latter accordingly.
Children left without parental care in respect of whom a referral for a visit has been issued to United States nationals, and/or in respect of whose adoption the said United States nationals have given their formal agreement, may be transferred to other families (excluding those of United States nationals) for future upbringing, as provided by the Family Code and the Law on the State Databank.
When exercising their activity, custody and guardianship, authorities and regional operators should take into account Decree of the Ministry of Education and Science no. 82 of 13 February 2013. In particular, priority should be given to transfer into families of Russian nationals permanently living in Russia when executing the transfer of children for adoption.
