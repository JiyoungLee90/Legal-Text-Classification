The Court has already found that the six-weeks time-limit in the Practice Direction of 1 November 2003 was an indicative, rather than a mandatory one (see Smertin v.

The Court has repeatedly declined to accept similar certificates and statements on the ground that they could not be viewed as sufficiently reliable, given the lapse of time involved and the absence of any supporting documentary evidence (see Manulin v.

It is significant that on each page only the entries concerning the applicant\u2019s cells were corrected, the entries in respect of the other cells remained intact. Moreover, on pages that contain alterations, adding up the numbers of inmates in each cell gives a number below the total number of inmates in the remand prison. The Government did not provide any explanation for this discrepancy. The Court reiterates that alterations in a prison population register, without any explanations as to their origin, reason and timing, make the information contained in it unreliable (see Klyukin v. Russia, no.\u00a054996/07, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59, 17\u00a0October 2013, Vyatkin v. Russia, no. 18813/06, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 11 April 2013, Manulin, cited above, \u00a7 43, and Glotov v.
