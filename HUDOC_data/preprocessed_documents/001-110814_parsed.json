A criminal investigation was opened into the reported incident. On 15\u00a0February 2002, at 3.10 p.m., an acting assistant to the military prosecutor examined the scene of the incident. Junior sergeant L. participated as a witness. The record showed that the grounds adjacent to the military hospital were surrounded by a concrete fence. A road between the hospital building and the fence led to metal gates guarding the entrance to the hospital grounds. A used cartridge from an automatic gun was found on the road approximately twenty-five metres from the entrance gates. The plan of the scene drawn up by the investigator showed that the applicant\u2019s son had started running along the road towards the gates from thirty metres back. He had passed the gates without any attempt being made to stop him. The plan also indicated that junior sergeant L. had also passed the gates in pursuit of the applicant\u2019s son and, having run another seven metres beyond them, had stopped and shot Mr Putintsev. A blood stain measuring sixty by forty\u00a0centimetres was discovered seventy-three metres from the place where Mr\u00a0L. had started shooting, on the road between two fences separating the main grounds of the military unit and the grounds of the disciplinary division where the applicant had been detained. The plan also included a drawing of the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s path from the place where he had started running to the blood stain. According to the drawing, having passed the gates of the hospital grounds, he had been running towards the checkpoint of the main grounds of the military unit situated right across from the hospital gates and then, having turned, had sprinted along the road between the two fences.",

That had not stopped the applicant\u2019s son from running away on their way back from the hospital. Mr L. stressed that despite his warning shouts and his firing two warning shots into the air, Mr Putinstev had continued running away, at the same time inviting Mr L. and accompanying officer K. to catch him. Mr L. had shot at the applicant\u2019s son once, aiming at his legs. Approximately seventy metres had separated the applicant\u2019s son from Mr L. at the moment of the shooting.

The commandant insisted that while giving the evening\u2019s instructions to the convoy groups he had paid particular attention to Mr Putintsev, having heard that he had been \u201cmentally unbalanced\u201d. On the morning of 15 February 2002 the officer had received a report of a dispute between the applicant\u2019s son and a convoy soldier, Mr M., following Mr Putintsev\u2019s refusal to submit to a search. The officer had had a talk with the applicant\u2019s son, during which the latter had complained that convoy soldiers had been beating him up. The commandant had called the officer in charge of the convoy unit, junior sergeant L., and soldier M. and had ordered junior sergeant L. to examine the applicant\u2019s son in their presence to verify whether he had had any injuries. Having complained of insufficient space in the office to perform the examination, Mr L. had asked for the commandant\u2019s permission to do it in another room, where he had then taken Mr Putintsev. On their return only a few minutes later, Mr L. had had an injured lip and had complained of the applicant\u2019s son having attacked him. The commanding officer had authorised a medical examination of the applicant\u2019s son and Mr L. by hospital doctors. He had offered Mr L. the opportunity to step down from convoy duty but the latter had assured him that he had no hard feelings towards the applicant\u2019s son and that he was willing to escort Mr Putintsev to the hospital.",

An inquiry into the circumstances of an alleged disciplinary offence was to precede a decision by which a disciplinary penalty was imposed.

At the time, the applicant\u2019s son had been subject to ten days\u2019 detention for unauthorised leave from military service. When the applicant\u2019s son had started running away while being escorted back from hospital, Mr\u00a0L. had warned him that he would open fire. He had fired two warning shots in the air. All attempts to force the applicant\u2019s son to stop failing, junior sergeant L. had fired a target shot in compliance with the requirements of Article 201 of the Statute of Garrison and Sentry Service. According to the Government, Mr L. had had no intention of killing the applicant\u2019s son, having aimed at his legs in order to minimise the damage to his health. The Government stressed that the incident had been thoroughly investigated. The evidence collected by the investigating authorities (witness statements, expert reports, crime scene examinations, and so forth) had corroborated the investigators\u2019 finding that Mr L.\u2019s actions had not constituted criminal conduct.",

Thus, Mr Putintsev\u2019s loss of life could not be regarded as having been in contravention of the Convention, being covered by the exception in subparagraph (b) of paragraph 2 to Article 2 of the Convention. The Government insisted that, having decided to abscond and having refused to comply with the order to stop, Mr Putintsev had himself placed his life in imminent danger. He had been warned and he had fully understood the consequences of his actions. The deadly force had been used for a lawful purpose and had been a measure of last resort.

However, that legal norm had indicated that deadly force could only be used in specific cases and as a measure of last resort. The Government observed that the wording of Article 201 of the Statute had afforded the same level of protection of the right to life as Article 2 of the Convention. They further noted that in assessing the circumstances of the case the Court should not overlook the fact that the events in question had occurred in the army, a very specific setting characterised by extreme limitations on the rights and freedoms of individuals performing military service. The specific responsibilities of servicemen to respect discipline and the regulations of the Statute of Garrison and Sentry Service, as well as the fact that military service was inherently characterised by unquestionable compliance with orders of higher-ranking officers, had justified the use of deadly force against a serviceman to prevent his escape.",

They noted that the criminal case had been opened on the same day that the incident had occurred. The investigation had been thorough, complete and independent, having been performed by an independent State body, the military prosecution service. Seven forensic expert examinations had been conducted over the course of the investigation. They had covered various subjects and had pursued various purposes, including those of identifying the cause of the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s death, reconstructing the events surrounding the shooting, verifying various versions of the events, assessing the quality of the medical care afforded to the applicant\u2019s son in hospital following the shooting, and so on. An examination of the scene of the incident had been carried out within hours of the shooting. Reconstructions of the events of 15 February 2002 had been organised with the participation of junior sergeant L. and officer K. More than two hundred interviews to identify possible witnesses to the incident had been conducted. Having provided the Court with a copy of the criminal case file, including the written statements of the witnesses collected by the investigating authorities, the Government argued that the evidence had fully supported the finding of the use of force having been lawful and necessary. At the same time, the Government pointed out that the investigating authorities had not only concentrated on the version of events given by Mr\u00a0L. They had looked into the allegations of hazing in the military unit, including the possibility of the applicant\u2019s son having been subjected to some form of violence or degrading treatment or extortion, and had not found any evidence in support of those allegations.",

The Government drew the Court\u2019s attention to its reasoning in the case of Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain ([GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7\u00a7 28-29, ECHR\u00a01999I), having stressed that unless the findings of national courts were clearly arbitrary, the Court had no reason to doubt them.

Responsibility under the Convention is based on its own provisions, which are to be interpreted and applied on the basis of the object and purpose of the Convention and in the light of the relevant principles of international law. The responsibility of a State under the Convention, arising for the acts of its organs, agents and servants, is not to be confused with the domestic legal issues of individual criminal responsibility under examination in the national criminal courts. The Court is not concerned with reaching any findings as to guilt or innocence in that sense (see Av\u015far v.

The Court notes that the aforementioned regulation called for nondiscretionary use of lethal force to prevent the escape of a member of the armed forces from detention, to which he could have been sentenced for even a minor disciplinary offence. The Court does not lose sight of the extremely concise wording of the regulation which permitted the use of lethal force. Apart from requiring a general warning that a firearm would be used, Article 201 did not contain any other safeguards to prevent the arbitrary deprivation of life. It did not make use of firearms dependent on an assessment of the surrounding circumstances, and, most importantly, did not require an evaluation of the nature of the offence committed by the fugitive and of the threat he or she posed. The Court observes that under the regulation in question it was lawful to shoot any fugitive who did not surrender immediately in response to an oral warning or the firing of a warning shot in the air (see paragraph 33 above). The laxity of the regulation on the use of firearms and the manner in which it tolerated the use of lethal force were clearly exposed by the events that led to the fatal shooting of the applicant\u2019s son.",

It appears that there were other means available to prevent the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s escape. The applicant\u2019s son began his attempted escape in the grounds adjacent to the military hospital. He passed through the guarded gates of the hospital grounds without any attempt being made to stop him. He then continued running towards the checkpoint of the military unit, being observed by soldiers guarding it. However, once again no one tried to stop him. Furthermore, officer K. was in hot pursuit after the applicant\u2019s son, with merely twenty metres separating them when Mr Putintsev was shot. The personnel of the military unit had cars. The applicant\u2019s son was running in the middle of the day, along the road between two long fences separating different parts of the grounds of the military unit. He would have been clearly visible for sufficient time to find an alternative solution to the hasty decision to open fire. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s behaviour was apparently predictable, since, during his previous unauthorised leave, he had been found in the local village closest to the military unit\u2019s grounds.",

It was known to the commanding officers that the applicant\u2019s son, who had experienced psychological problems in adjusting to the life in the army, suffered from depression and had already once left the unit without authorisation, was prone to repeat his attempt to leave military service. While the applicant\u2019s son was warned of the consequences of any further attempt to escape, there is no indication that Mr L. received clear instructions about the amount of force necessary in the event that the applicant\u2019s son made a repeated attempt to escape or that Mr L. was provided with some guidance to minimise the risk of loss of life. Furthermore, the Court finds it open to criticism that Mr\u00a0L., the same person with whom the applicant\u2019s son had a physical altercation shortly before the shooting, was entrusted with the task of escorting him to the hospital. While the Court is aware of officer K.\u2019s presence in the convoy, it was Mr L. who was performing the duty of an armed sentry and it was he who took the decision to use force to prevent the escape. Although the Court must be cautious about revisiting events with the wisdom of hindsight (see Bubbins, cited above, \u00a7 147), it cannot but conclude that the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s convoy was organised in an unconsidered manner and that the decision taken by the commandant to entrust Mr L. with the task of escorting the applicant\u2019s son lacked the necessary degree of caution. It follows from the above that the authorities failed to minimise to the greatest extent possible recourse to lethal force and any risk to the life of the applicant\u2019s son.",
