Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in monitoring compliance with this rule, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means amongst other things that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see \u0130lhan v.

The three rules are not, however, distinct in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, inter alia, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7 37, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a098, which reproduces in part the analysis given by the Court in its judgment in Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v.

The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole, including, therefore, the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measures applied by the State, including measures depriving a person of his of her possessions (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20 November 1995, \u00a7\u00a038, Series A no. 332; The former King of Greece and Others v.\u00a0Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, \u00a7\u00a7 8990, ECHR 2000XII; Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth, cited above, \u00a7 73; and Beyeler, cited above, \u00a7 107).",

In a judgment of 15 June 2001, the district court, to which the applicant had appealed, endorsed the valuation made by two panels of experts, which had assessed the value of the building at TRL 90,724,294,000, a sum that they subsequently increased to TRL\u00a0181,448,588,000, stating that the building's architectural, historical and cultural features justified a 100% increase in its value (see paragraphs\u00a01518 above). This judgment, however, was quashed by the Court of Cassation, which, referring to section 15 (d) of the Cultural and Natural Heritage (Protection) Act (Law no. 2863), held that a building's architectural or historical features, or those arising from its rarity, could not be taken into consideration in determining its value (see paragraph\u00a013 above).",

In this regard, the Court can accept the Government's argument emphasising the difficulties inherent in calculating the market value of properties classed as being of cultural, historical, architectural or artistic value. The determination of this amount may depend on numerous factors, and it is not always easy to assess it through comparisons with properties on the market that do not have the same status or the same architectural and historical features.

The Turkish legislature has deliberately set limits on such valuations by excluding the taking into account of such features. Thus, even where the latter seem to imply an increase in the price of the listed property, the domestic courts cannot take them into consideration. In contrast, however, it appears from the Court of Cassation's case-law that where the value of an expropriated property has decreased on account of its registration as a listed building, the courts take such depreciation into account in determining the compensation to be awarded (see paragraph\u00a030 above).",

What is also crystal clear is that the applicant himself did not create the asset's extra value \u2013 he simply took proper care of it, as every responsible and good citizen would.

A brief examination of the relevant references in paragraphs\u00a03134 of the judgment does not provide clear confirmation of such a view. The relevant Council of Europe documents indicate, inter alia, that States are called on to allow \u201ccompulsory purchase of a protected property\u201d (paragraph 31) and that protection of the cultural heritage does not \u201ccreate enforceable rights\u201d (paragraph 32). Nor does the very superficial comparative law overview (paragraph 34) indicate a clear common approach in the Council of Europe's member States; more importantly, the references are to ordinary situations and only a few of the examples given are related to situations and circumstances similar to those in the present case.",

The Court's well-established position is that it is not its task to assess the relevant legislation of Contracting Parties. As was clear from the facts, the experts had de facto considerable freedom in making their assessments and proposals, as did the courts in using them.
