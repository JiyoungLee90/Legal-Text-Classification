As a result, the electrical expert reiterated the conclusions of the Electrical Trade Union and of the Commission, which included the representatives of the YTPP. She further argued that the investigator had failed to investigate who, in what manner, had unlocked the door of the reserve power supply room and which official was responsible for keeping the key. The applicant raised a number of other flaws in the investigation and also complained of the fact that the YTPP had initiated an administrative investigation only a month after the accident and had failed to inform her about it.
