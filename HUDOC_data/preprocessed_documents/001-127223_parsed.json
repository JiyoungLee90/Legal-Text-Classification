For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28\u00a0October 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 102 et seq., Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII, and Mikheyev v. , no. 77617/01, \u00a7\u00a0107 et seq., 26 January 2006).",

The Court further notes that the applicant\u2019s allegation was examined by means of pre-investigation enquiries without a full-scale investigation being opened. However, the Court has previously held in various contexts that this investigative procedure does not comply with the principles of an effective remedy for the following reasons: the enquiring officer can take only a limited number of procedural steps within that procedure; the victims have no formal status, with the result that their effective participation in the procedure is excluded; any other remedy available to the victims, including a claim for damages, had limited chances of success and could be considered as theoretical and illusory (see Davydov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 310-312; Golovan v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 41716/06, \u00a7\u00a075, 5 July 2012; and Savitskyy v.

This consideration is pertinent to the present case which originated from the complaint of a prisoner that he had been ill-treated by a deputy governor of the prison and the latter continued to perform his functions throughout the examination of the matter. The Court considers that the domestic authorities should have carefully scrutinised the reasons for the applicant\u2019s change of mind and clearly established that the retraction of the initial complaint had been made voluntarily. It is notable that the authorities were expressly informed of the applicant\u2019s subsequent statement that the retraction had been made due to psychological pressure having been exerted on him. Nevertheless, it appears that the authorities relied on the intervening retraction of the ill-treatment complaint without properly examining the circumstances in which that complaint was withdrawn.",

In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force that has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Labita v.
