In this respect, it observes that it took the first instance court almost six years to render its decision dated 15 February 2000. From the documents in the case file it appears that, at its hearing on 8 December 1997, the first instance court ordered a forensic examination of the applicant\u2019s handwriting samples and that this report was submitted to the court only on 20 October 1998, i.e. almost ten months later. Furthermore, six hearings between 25\u00a0December 1998 and 14 September 1999 were postponed as one of the prosecution witnesses failed to appear before the trial court to give evidence.",
