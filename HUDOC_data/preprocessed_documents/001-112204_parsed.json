However, neither of these advocates advised the applicant to verify the acts of the proceedings. Thus, neither the applicant nor a legal representative had ever verified whether the respondents had been successfully notified. In consequence, the  found that the applicant was mostly responsible for causing the case to lapse, as he had failed to conduct the necessary verifications and had failed to prove that what had happened had been beyond his control.

The Government contended that the mistake had been deliberate, to avoid immediate eviction while also avoiding the embarrassment of putting forward manifestly unfounded claims. Indeed the applicant, who was not an emphyteutae, was claiming that he should not be evicted, despite the fact that the actual emphyteutae (Caral Ltd) had been evicted and that the emphyteusis contract, to which the applicant had never been a party, had been rescinded.

However, despite the absence of a similar clause for civil litigation, Article 6 \u00a7 1 may sometimes compel the State to provide for the assistance of a lawyer when such assistance proves indispensable to effective access to court, either because legal representation is rendered compulsory, as is done by the domestic law of certain Contracting States for various types of litigation, or by reason of the complexity of the procedure or of the case (see Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 26, Series A no. 32). In discharging its obligation to provide parties to civil proceedings with legal aid, when it is provided by domestic law, the State must display diligence so as to secure to those persons the genuine and effective enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under Article 6 (see, inter alia, Staroszczyk v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a059519/00, \u00a7\u00a0129, 22 March 2007; Sia\u0142kowska v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a08932/05, \u00a7\u00a0106, 22\u00a0March 2007; and B\u0105kowska v. Poland, no. 33539/02, \u00a7 46, 12\u00a0January 2010). An adequate institutional framework should be in place so as to ensure effective legal representation for entitled persons and a sufficient level of protection of their interests (ibid, \u00a7 47). There may be occasions when the State should act and not remain passive when problems of legal representation are brought to the attention of the competent authorities. It will depend on the circumstances of the case whether the relevant authorities should take action and whether, taking the proceedings as a whole, the legal representation may be regarded as \u201cpractical and effective\u201d. Assigning counsel to represent a party to the proceedings does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance (see, for example, Sia\u0142kowska, and Staroszczyk, both cited above, \u00a7 122 and \u00a7 100 respectively).",

Indeed, it appears that it took the applicant nearly two years from the lodging of the appeal application to enquire about the progress of his case and to discover that it had been declared deserted. The fact that he was not present at the hearing of 20 November 2003 and was not notified of any decision in respect of his appeal was again imputable to the same error in the address.",

Given the independence of the legal profession from the State, the conduct of the case is essentially a matter between the defendant and his or her counsel, whether counsel be appointed under a legal-aid scheme or be privately financed, and, as such, cannot, other than in special circumstances, incur the State\u2019s liability under the Convention (see Artico v.\u00a0Italy, 30\u00a0May 1980, Series A no.\u00a037, \u00a7\u00a036; Rutkowski v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 45995/99, ECHR 2000-XI; and Cuscani v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a032771/96, \u00a7\u00a039, 24\u00a0September 2002). The Court makes further reference to the general principles in paragraph 46 above. It further observes that within the ambit of criminal proceedings, the competent national authorities are required under Article 6 to intervene only if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or sufficiently brought to their attention in some other way (see Kamasinski, cited above, \u00a7 65). While reiterating that imposing on the State, for the purposes of civil proceedings, a more far-reaching procedural obligation in respect of legal aid than that applicable to criminal cases would be incompatible with the Court\u2019s case-law (see Smyk v. Poland, no.\u00a08958/04, \u00a7 61, 28 July 2009), as inferred from the Polish cases mentioned above (see, for example, Sia\u0142kowska and Staroszczyk) the Court does not exclude that State responsibility within the ambit of civil proceedings may also be engaged in exceptional circumstances in respect of a failure of a legal-aid lawyer or of the system itself.",

The Court considers that while it would have been at least desirable for Dr M. to check whether the information it contained was correct, it cannot ignore the fact that the person best disposed to check this type of information was the applicant himself.",

The domestic courts held that this failure was the applicant\u2019s fault, since it was up to him and not the lawyer to check that notification had taken place and to carefully track his appeal \u201cas the case is the applicant\u2019s and not the lawyer\u2019s\u201d. The Court does not share this reasoning in full. In particular, it notes that Maltese law specifically states that responsibility for the case rests with the legal-aid lawyer whose duty it was, inter alia, to make the necessary submissions and file the requisite notes, applications, replies, notices, and so on as circumstances may require (see paragraph 27 above). However, it is highly significant that, in the present case, the applicant failed to make any contact with Dr A., the legal-aid lawyer appointed. This matter has not been contested by the applicant and no explanation, let alone a plausible one, has been given in this respect. Indeed, it is also unclear whether the applicant, who acknowledged that it was for the interested party to enquire about the name of the newly appointed legal-aid representative (see paragraph 35 above), ever took any steps to do so. In these circumstances, the Court cannot consider that the responsibility for pursuing the appeal lay with the appointed legal-aid lawyer.",
