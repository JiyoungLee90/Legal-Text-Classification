The Court reiterates that while Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention is mostly concerned with the existence of a lawful basis for detention within criminal proceedings, Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention deals with the possible justification for such detention. Moreover, according to the Court\u2019s established case-law under the latter provision, the persistence of a reasonable suspicion is a sine qua non for the validity of continued detention (see Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova [GC], no. 23755/07, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2016 (extracts)). The Court therefore deems it more appropriate to deal with this complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Khodorkovskiy v.

When deciding whether a person should be released or detained, the authorities are obliged to consider alternative means of ensuring his or her appearance at trial. Justifications which have been deemed \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d reasons (in addition to the existence of reasonable suspicion) in the Court\u2019s case-law, have included such grounds as the danger of absconding, the risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses or of evidence being tampered with, the risk of collusion, the risk of reoffending, the risk of causing public disorder and the need to protect the detainee (see Buzadji, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 87-88). It can be seen from the applicant\u2019s detention orders and the Government\u2019s observations that the primary reason for his detention was the gravity of the charges. Firstly, the domestic courts considered that the applicant, faced with the risk of prison, was likely to abscond, influence witnesses, or interfere with the administration of justice. Secondly, they seemed to suggest that the very nature of the offences in question, together with information about the applicant\u2019s character, made it likely that he would reoffend and obstruct the course of the criminal proceedings. In addition, the courts dismissed his requests for an alternative preventive measure on the grounds that no other measure could secure the course of justice in the case.",

The Court noted, in particular, that the domestic courts\u2019 use of the gravity of the charges as the main factor for the assessment of the potential to abscond, reoffend or obstruct the course of justice, and their reluctance to pay proper attention to a discussion of each applicant\u2019s personal situation or have proper regard to factors pointing in favour of release.

Furthermore, costs and expenses are only recoverable to the extent that they relate to the violation found (see Murray v. the Netherlands [GC], no. , \u00a7\u00a0134, ECHR 2016). In this regard the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s complaints were only partially successful and that a substantial portion of his pleadings concerned an inadmissible part of the application. In such circumstances the Court may find it appropriate to reduce the award in respect of costs and expenses (see Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 76639/11, \u00a7 146, 25 September 2018). Regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 1,000 for the proceedings before the Court, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant.",
