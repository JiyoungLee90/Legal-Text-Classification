Though German law does not provide explicit time-limits \nfor the completion of administrative proceedings, it nevertheless contains similar mechanisms by providing for the possibility to lodge an application with the competent social court if no decision has either been made regarding an application for performance of an administrative act or the competent authority failed to decide upon an administrative appeal within a reasonable time and without sufficient grounds (see Section 88 of the Social Courts Act, set out at paragraph 53 above). If deemed admissible, the court orders the authority to issue a decision. The Court thus considers that a complaint for failure to act under Section 88 of the Social Courts Act constitutes in principle an effective remedy as regards a complaint about the length of proceedings. The applicant failed to make such a complaint as regards the delay caused by the Regional Pension Office, which did not decide on his administrative appeal of 25 July 1994 until 26 February 1996.

The Court accepts that a certain amount of time was necessary for the production of the expert reports. Nevertheless, the number of expert reports prepared - altogether five expert reports in the court proceedings, including two reports on the applicant\u2019s request - accounted to a considerable amount for the length of the proceedings at issue. The Court in particular observes that the national courts did not reject the applicant\u2019s request for further medical reports according to Section 109 \u00a7 2 of the Social Court Act, which is in any event rarely applied in the practice of national courts \n(see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d above). In that respect it has to be noted that a legal provision which provides for the possibility to request a further expert opinion even though the legal and factual requirements for a judicial decision are already met may often contribute - as in the instant case - to the length of proceedings.",

It is true that the applicant received some 5,500 EUR following a first partial acknowledgment before the  two years after he had initiated court proceedings. He also received some 46,000 EUR following a second partial acknowledgment before the Lower Saxony Court of Appeal even though it was made only after the court proceedings had been pending for over eight years. The Court notes in that respect that the second acknowledgment was mainly based on the diseases the applicant developed at a later stage, such as a panic syndrome with agoraphobia, depressions and chronic lumbago (see\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a030-32 above).",

Spain (Article 50), judgment of 13\u00a0June 1994, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0285-C, pp.\u00a057-58, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a016-20; and \n\u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a023657/94, \u00a7\u00a0127, ECHR\u00a01999-IV). \nThe Court observes that in the instant case the pecuniary damage alleged was not caused by the length of proceedings. In particular, the Court cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings at issue might have been if the violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention had not occurred (see Schmautzer v. Austria, judgment of 23\u00a0October 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0328, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a044; Wettstein v. Switzerland, no.\u00a033958/96, \u00a7\u00a053, ECHR\u00a02000-XII).
