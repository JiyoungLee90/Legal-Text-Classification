In respect of the latter, they referred to the fact that the applicant had not confessed and to the close links between the co-defendants. The domestic courts further considered that there had been a risk that the applicant, if released, might exert pressure on P.S., a co-defendant who had incriminated him (see paragraph 16 above). They also invoked the risk of the applicant going into hiding, without however specifying the grounds for such suspicion.

In this respect, the Court recalls that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the charges against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider that such a risk existed. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001).",

In reality, the applicant was convicted of one burglary and the actual sentence, which was 2 years\u2019 and 10 months\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 27 above), was at the lower end of the applicable scale. What is more, the sentence imposed on the applicant was nearly equivalent to the period which he had spent in pre-trial detention. That practice, i.e. of holding an accused in pre-trial detention for a period which practically corresponds to the sentence subsequently imposed on him appears questionable for the Court. In this respect, it recalls that continuation of detention cannot be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, \u00a7\u00a051).",

In so far as the domestic courts appear to have drawn adverse inferences from the fact that the applicant had not confessed, the Court considers that their reasoning showed a manifest disregard for the principle of the presumption of innocence and cannot, in any circumstances, be relied on as a legitimate ground for deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty (see G\u00f3rski v. Poland, no. 28904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4 October 2005; Leszczak v.\u00a0Poland, no. 36576/03, \u00a7 48, 7 March 2006). Secondly, the judicial authorities considered that there had been a risk that the applicant might interfere with the course of the proceedings by exerting pressure on P.S., a co-defendant who had testified against them. The Court observes that it was legitimate for the authorities to consider that factor as capable of justifying the applicant\u2019s detention at the initial stages of the proceedings.
