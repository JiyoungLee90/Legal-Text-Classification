The men were aware that the apartment was used for prostitution and expected its two female occupants to keep valuables and cash in there. They had passed by the apartment in the early evening in order to make sure that no clients were present. Shortly afterwards they rang at the door of the apartment which was attended by its tenant Ms L. After having overpowered L. by force the applicant threatened her with a gas pistol that resembled a real gun ordering her to keep silent. He then went to the kitchen where he found the further occupant of the apartment Ms I., a Lithuanian national who lived and worked there as a prostitute. Pointing his gas pistol at I. he forced her to hand over her mobile phone. While his accomplice was watching over the two women, the applicant searched the apartment for valuables and found five further mobile phones as well as 100 euros (EUR) in I.\u2019s purse. The applicant then threatened to shoot the women should they not disclose where they were keeping any additional money. As a result of his threat L. handed over a further EUR 1,000 which she had kept in the pocket of her jacket. The men then left the apartment with their loot. Later that evening an acquaintance of L. whom she had told about the incident called the police which came to the apartment.",

No warrant for his arrest had yet been issued and he had not been represented by counsel. The investigating judge had excluded the applicant from the hearing in accordance with Article 168 (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure since he had been concerned that the witnesses would be afraid of telling the truth in the presence of the accused.

Minor contradictions in their statements could be explained by their concern not to disclose their illegal residence status and activities to the authorities and by the psychological strain they had been subject to during and following the incident. The witnesses had feared problems with the police and acts of revenge by the perpetrators. This explained why the witnesses had not pressed charges immediately after the events and why the police had only been informed of the crime on 12 February 2007 by their friend L. As regards O. and P.\u2019s\u2019 failure to identify the applicant when confronted with several photos of potential suspects during the police interrogations, the court observed that the witnesses\u2019 attention during the incident had been focussed on the further perpetrator carrying the knife and that the applicant himself had only stayed a short period of time in the apartment.

Such information had been gathered within the scope of police surveillance measures carried out at the relevant time in relation to preliminary criminal proceedings initiated against the accused on suspicion of racketeering and extortion (Schutzgelderpressung) in the G\u00f6ttingen drug scene. The link between the evidence obtained in the course of such separate investigations and the crime at issue could only be made after O. and P. had reported the incident of 3 February 2007 to the police. It followed from the recordings of two mobile phone conversations between one of the co-accused and the applicant in the evening of 3 February 2007 at 8.29 p.m. and 8.31 p.m. that the latter had been present in the victims\u2019 apartment accompanied by B. and that he had jumped from the balcony in order to chase one of the escaping victims whom he failed to capture, while B. had stayed in the apartment.

(\u201cTotalausfall des Fragerechts\u201d), they had as a whole been fair and there had been no reason to exclude the witness statements of O. and P. as evidence.

Furthermore, it had not made their statements the sole or decisive basis of the applicant\u2019s conviction but had taken further significant evidence into account. In view of the various layers of corroborating evidence the applicant had had ample opportunities to put into question the credibility of the two main witnesses and to effectively defend himself.

In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see, among other references, Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7\u00a084, ECHR 2010). In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victims that crime is properly prosecuted (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7\u00a0175, ECHR 2010) and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see, amongst many authorities, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, \u00a7\u00a070, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II). It is also recalled in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a026766/05 and 22228/06, \u00a7\u00a0118, ECHR 2011).",

The underlying principle is that the defendant in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of proceedings (see Luc\u00e0 v.

Such measures form part of the diligence which the Contracting States must exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (see Sadak and Others v. Turkey, nos. 29900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2001VIII; D. v.\u00a0Finland, no. 30542/04, \u00a7\u00a041, 7 July 2009; and Gossa v.

Once all efforts to summon O. and P. to appear before the G\u00f6ttingen Regional Court at trial had failed, the German authorities requested legal assistance from their Latvian counterparts and asked for the witnesses to be heard by a court in Latvia and the hearing to be transmitted by voice and image. Such hearing did, however, not take place on the ground that the witnesses, relying on medical certificates, had demonstrated to the Latvian courts that they were still suffering from post-traumatic disorders as a consequence of the crime and feared possible acts of revenge by the accused. The Regional Court\u2019s objection that according to the standards of German law of criminal procedure the reasons advanced by the witnesses were not sufficiently substantiated to justify their refusal to testify and their proposal that the Latvian courts might consider coercing them to attend the hearing went unanswered. It was only at this point in time that the Regional Court concluded that it did not dispose of any further legal means to enforce a hearing of O. and P. and, having regard to the fact that the recently renewed medical certificates indicated that the witnesses\u2019 state of health would not change any time soon, that it was impossible to have them questioned in the foreseeable future. The Court, as opposed to the applicant\u2019s submissions, finds that in view of the witnesses\u2019 persistent refusal to testify there is nothing to establish that the German authorities would have had further effective means at their disposal with a view to arranging for a confrontation of O. and P. by the defence during the main proceedings. By contrast, it shares the Government\u2019s view that the Regional Court made reasonable efforts to enable the witnesses\u2019 examination at trial and that it had not been imputable to the German authorities that all attempts in this regard remained fruitless.",

It notes in this connection that the Federal Prosecutor in his submissions in the appellate proceedings, as endorsed by the Federal Court of Justice in its decision of 30 October 2008, stated that in view of the important additional evidence taken into account by the Regional Court, O. and P.\u2019s statements could not be said to have been the decisive basis of the applicant\u2019s conviction.

The Court observes that similar considerations are reflected in the Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 25\u00a0April 2008 stating, that since neither the accused nor counsel had been able to examine O. and P., the significant witnesses against the accused, the trial court was requested to take a cautious approach in assessing their statements made at the investigative stage and could only base its decision on such testimony if the latter was corroborated by other significant items of evidence.",

At the same time domestic law contains procedural safeguards in Article 168c of the Code of Criminal Procedure with a view to granting the defence an opportunity to participate in the examination of key witnesses for the prosecution at the investigative stage. In this context the Court accepts the Government\u2019s argument that having regard to the domestic authorities\u2019 obligation to conduct an effective investigation into the offence at issue and taking into account the need to protect O. and P., the victims and witnesses of the crime, the investigative judge\u2019s decision not to inform the applicant of the witness hearing at the pre-trial stage had been justified. Having regard to the violent manner in which the investigated crime had been committed, the judge\u2019s concern that the suspected perpetrators would put pressure on the witnesses once they or counsel were informed of the latters\u2019 hearing, thus jeopardising the ongoing investigations, was not unfounded. The Court further takes note of the Government\u2019s submission that at the time of the interview before the investigative judge it had not been foreseeable for the domestic authorities that the witnesses, who had already given evidence to the investigative authorities on several occasions, would refuse to attend a subsequent trial or to agree at least to be examined by means of an audio-visual transmission in Latvia. In this context it is also relevant to note that O. and P. did not dispose of a statutory right not to testify at the applicant\u2019s ensuing trial under German criminal procedure such as, for instance, family members of an accused (see, a contrario, H\u00fcmmer v. Germany, no. 26171/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041 and 43, 19 July 2012).

The Court agrees with the Regional Court\u2019s finding that the fact that the account of the events given by O. and P. to their friend L. and neighbour E. coincided with the detailed description contained in their pre-trial statements provided a strong indication for the credibility and veracity of such testimony. Moreover, E. had testified that the evening of the crime another neighbour had called on her because she had heard noise coming from O. and P.\u2019s apartment, thus adding a further corroborating element that did not result from the account given by the victims but from a further independent source. The Regional Court also considered that the statements of the further witnesses heard at trial, as well as O. and P.\u2019s testimonies obtained at the investigative stage, had been supported by the data obtained through tapping of the applicant\u2019s and the co-accused\u2019s mobile phones and GPS.

In this connection the Court also accepts the Government\u2019s argument that the similar way in which the crimes in Kassel and in G\u00f6ttingen had been committed and the personal link between the two crimes resulting from the fact that L., the victim of the crime previously committed in Kassel, had been the confident of O. and P. provided a further indication that the applicant had been familiar with the commission of crimes of the kind at issue.",

It observes, however, that in the course of the trial the applicant himself, while denying any participation in the robbery, had conceded that he had been present in the victim\u2019s apartment at the time of the incident and that he had followed P. when she had escaped over the balcony. Thus, a possible examination of the witnesses by the defence could no longer have served the purpose initially pursued by the applicant. In this connection the Court also takes note of the Government\u2019s submissions that the applicant did not substantiate what further purpose he wanted to achieve by confronting O. and P. and did not avail himself of the possibility to cast doubt on the veracity of their testimonies once the records of their examinations at the investigative stage had been read out at trial. The Court recalls in this context that O. and P.\u2019s identity was known to the applicant and it was therefore open to him to challenge their reliability if he wished to do so and to point out any incoherence in their statements or any inconsistencies with the statements of the further witnesses heard at the trial. Furthermore, the applicant, who was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings, was able to provide his own version of the events and to put into question the probity of the additional evidence obtained in the course of the trial.",

The hearsay evidence of neighbour \u2018E\u2019, was testimony only in relation to the fact of having been told what she was told by O and P. It was not testimony as to the truth of what she had been told. The circumstantial evidence (the GPS data)\u2014which I agree could, at best indirectly support the prosecution\u2019s case\u2014was, nevertheless, met with a plausible explanation proffered by the accused (\u00a7\u00a030). Moreover, what the majority refers to as an \u2018independent\u2019 and \u2018further corroborating element\u2019\u2014namely E\u2019s claim (see \u00a7 77) that a different unidentified neighbour had told her that she had heard \u2018noise coming from O and P\u2019s apartment on the evening in question\u2019\u2014does little to point to the guilt of the applicant.",

O and P\u2014neither of whom was either law-abiding or lawfully resident\u2014were the only witnesses to the events of 3 February 2007. They did not press charges immediately. No complaint was made until 12 February 2007. Having made statements at the investigative stage\u2014they then exited the jurisdiction of the respondent State before the end of the same month. They did not identify the applicant from photographs that were shown to them. They did not testify that he was the culprit (\u00a7 26). They did not give evidence against him at trial. He was, nevertheless, convicted of having committed the offences in question.",

Whilst their statements may have been coherent they cannot be said to belong to the category of evidence that can be described as \u2018demonstrably reliable\u2019 (Al-Khawaja and Tahery, \u00a7 160). As in the case of Tahery, their evidence weighed heavily in the balance and required sufficient counterbalancing factors to compensate for the consequential difficulties caused to the defence by its admission. The procedural safeguards relied upon by the majority, whether taken alone or in combination, were not, for the reasons set out above, a sufficient counter-balance to compensate for the denial of the applicant\u2019s minimum right to examine or have examined witnesses against him as guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention.",
