The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 29 May 1995, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in an application (no. 21525/93) against the Kingdom of Spain lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 11 January 1993 by a Spanish national, Mr Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Salvador Torres. The Commission's request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby  recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (a) of the Convention (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-a).",

The applicant was subsequently committed for trial in the Barcelona Audiencia Provincial.

In doing so, the Supreme Court considered that a request to apply this aggravating circumstance could be inferred from the public prosecutor's submissions (see paragraph 10 above).

As to the fact that the applicant's sentence of imprisonment was increased from eighteen months to five years as a result of the finding of the aggravating circumstance, the Government pointed out that, under Spanish law, the Supreme Court's sentencing powers are limited only by the maximum penalty requested by the prosecutor (see paragraph 22 above), which was fifteen years in the present case.",

In Spanish law, the offence of embezzlement of public funds requires that the offender be either a civil servant or an administrator of funds in a public institution, that he should have taken advantage of his position in committing the offence and that the sums embezzled be \"public funds\" (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above).",

In fact, the file of the case shows that this was common ground between the parties (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above). In that capacity, the applicant was clearly occupying a position of a public nature. Neither the Audiencia Provincial nor the Supreme Court characterised the sums embezzled as \"public funds\". Both applied the more general offence of simple embezzlement. However, whereas the Audiencia Provincial found that no aggravating circumstance of a general character applied in this case (see paragraph 9 above), the Supreme Court considered that the fact - as established by the Audiencia Provincial and uncontested by the applicant - that Mr de Salvador Torres had taken advantage of his position as head administrator of a public institution aggravated the offence. In the exercise of its powers (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above), the Supreme Court imposed a sentence which, though heavier than that of the Audiencia Provincial, was well below that requested by the prosecutors at the outset and maintained throughout the proceedings (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above).",

He must accordingly be considered to have been aware of the possibility that the courts - that is, the Audiencia Provincial and the Supreme Court - would find that this underlying factual element could, in the less severe context of simple embezzlement, constitute an aggravating circumstance for the purpose of determining the sentence. Therefore, the Court finds no infringement of the applicant's right under Article 6 para. 3 (a) (art. 6-3-a) to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.",
