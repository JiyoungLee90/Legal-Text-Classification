Under Bulgarian law, decrees adopted by the Presidium of the National Assembly under Article 35 \u00a7 5 and Article 36 of the 1947 Constitution are valid sources of law which have the same force as Acts of Parliament. This has been confirmed many times by the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraph 10 above) and is implicit in the fact that the Constitutional Court accepted to hear a legal challenge to the 1963 Decree much as it would accept to hear a challenge to an Act of Parliament (see paragraph 13 above). The term \u201claw\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention must be understood in its substantive sense, not its formal one. The Court has accepted that detention may be based on a sufficiently established custom (see Drozd and Janousek v. France and , 26 June 1992, \u00a7 107, Series A no. 240) or on caselaw (see Steel and Others v. the , 23 September 1998, \u00a7 55, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VII). It has adopted the same stance to the term \u201claw\u201d as used in Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention (see Kruslin v. , 24 April 1990, \u00a7\u00a029, Series A no. 176A, and The Sunday Times v. the  (no. 1), 26 April 1979, \u00a7 47, Series A no. 30). It follows that the applicant\u2019s detention was provided by Bulgarian law and was imposed in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law (see, mutatis mutandis, Galstyan v.\u00a0, no. 26986/03, \u00a7\u00a7 4649, 15 November 2007).

The fact that that work was not remunerated did not in itself cause it to fall outside that definition. In its decision in Twentyone Detained Persons v. Germany (nos. 3134/67, 3172/67, 31883206/67, Commission decision of 6 April 1968, Collection 27, pp. 97116), the former Commission declared a complaint in that respect inadmissible, noting, inter alia, that Article 4 does not contain any provision concerning the remuneration of prisoners for their work, and observing that it had consistently rejected applications by prisoners claiming higher remuneration for their work. The Court is mindful that there have been subsequent developments in attitudes to that issue, reflected in particular in the 1987 and 2006 European Prison Rules, which call for the equitable remuneration of the work of prisoners \u2013 with the 2006 Rules adding \u201cin all instances\u201d \u2013 (see paragraphs 18 and 21 above). Those Rules, and the modification in their wording, reflect an evolving trend. However, the Court does not consider that as matters stood at the time when the applicant was ordered to carry out the work at issue in the present case \u2013 approximately two years before the adoption of the 2006 Rules \u2013 it could be maintained that there existed an unconditional obligation under Article 4 of the Convention to remunerate the work of all detainees in all circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, Stummer, cited above, \u00a7 132). The Court additionally notes that the applicant\u2019s detention was effected under special rules designed to deal in a speedy way with minor public order offences, and that the period during which the applicant was detained and required to work without remuneration could not by law exceed, and did not in fact exceed, fifteen days (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above). This can hardly be compared to the situation of inmates who have worked many years in prison (see Stummer, cited above, \u00a7 130 in limine).",
