The Court reiterates in this connection that the mere presence of classified information in a case file does not automatically imply a need to close a trial to the public, without balancing openness with national security concerns. It may be important for a State to preserve its secrets, but it is of infinitely greater importance to surround justice with all the requisite safeguards, of which one of the most indispensable is publicity. Before excluding the public from criminal proceedings, courts must make specific findings that closure is necessary to protect a compelling governmental interest and limit secrecy to the extent necessary to preserve such an interest (see, for example, Pichugin v. Russia, no. 38623/03, \u00a7\u00a0187, 23\u00a0October 2012, and Belashev v. Russia, no. , \u00a7 83, 4 December 2008).",

In any event, in the Court\u2019s view, the measures employed to ensure the protection of State secrets should be narrowly tailored and comply with the principle of necessity. The judicial authorities should thoroughly consider all possible alternatives and give preference to a less strict measure over a stricter one when it can achieve the same purpose (compare Krestovskiy v.
