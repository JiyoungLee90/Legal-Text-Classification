However, the period to be taken into consideration began only on 13 September 2013 (see Wcis\u0142o and Cabaj, cited above, \u00a7 173). It thus lasted two years and seven months. The Court finds that the proceedings do not disclose periods of inactivity such as to render them incompatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Nor does the overall length of the proceedings infringe the reasonableness requirement of that provision. It follows that this part of the application must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03 and 4 of the Convention.",
