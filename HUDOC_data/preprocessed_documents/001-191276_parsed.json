Unlike the Code of Practice relating to the powers exercised under section 44 of TACT (the provisions under consideration in Gillan and Quinton), in the present case the relevant Home Office Code of Practice and accompanying Practical Advice (see paragraphs 42 and 43 below) afforded a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by the Executive. Moreover, port and border control was very different from the power to stop and search, exercisable anywhere in the jurisdiction, and conclusions as to the arbitrariness of the latter did not readily translate to conclusions as to the former. The United Kingdom, as an \u201cisland nation\u201d, concentrated controls at its national frontiers and the court was therefore of the view that it was to be accorded a wide margin of appreciation in carrying out these controls.",

First, it noted that many exercises of Schedule 7 powers were unlikely even to engage Article 8 as the intrusions would fall below the threshold of a minimum level of seriousness. Secondly, it considered that the arguments which served to distinguish Gillan and Quinton likewise served to emphasise the important and particular position of port and border controls and the need for such powers. Thirdly, the Schedule 7 powers were applicable only to a limited category of people: namely, travellers in confined geographical areas. Furthermore, while there was no room for complacency, the statistics collated by the Independent Reviewer (see paragraphs 48-49 and 56-61 below) did not suggest arbitrary overuse or misuse in respect of members of ethnic-minority communities. Fourthly, the Schedule 7 powers could only be exercised in respect of that limited category for the purpose of determining whether the person questioned appeared to be a person who was or had been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and these limitations told against the powers being arbitrary. Fifthly, the Schedule 7 powers were principally an aspect of port and border control rather than of a criminal investigation and it was therefore not surprising that there was no requirement of \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d for the powers to be exercised. Sixthly, the court noted that the underlying purpose of the Schedule 7 powers was to protect the public from terrorism.",

Over and above the possibility of legal challenge if misused in an individual case, they are subject to continuing review by the Independent Reviewer. The absence of a requirement of reasonable suspicion is both explicable and justifiable.

Furthermore, it did not follow that the fair balance between the rights of the individual and the interest of the public would fall in the same place. However, although their Lordships expressed doubts about whether detention for as long as six hours could ever be justified, on the facts of the present case they found that, to the extent that there was any deprivation of liberty, it was clear that it was for no longer than necessary to complete the process and therefore there had been no breach of Article 5.",

In particular, he observed that no authorisation was required for an examining officer to have resort to the Schedule 7 powers; the examining officer did not have to consider the use of those powers expedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism; there was no geographical or temporal limitation on the use of those powers, other than that they were to be used at a port of entry into or exit from the United Kingdom; and there was no provision for their automatic lapse, nor was there any question of their renewed authorisation being subject to confirmation. Furthermore, Lord\u00a0Kerr noted that certain features were common to both sets of powers: the width of the powers was similar (in both instances there was no requirement of either reasonable or even subjective suspicion) and challenges to their use on conventional judicial review grounds faced the same difficulties identified in Gillan and Quinton (namely, if an examining officer was not required to have a reasonable suspicion, how was the proportionality of the exercise of his powers to be reviewed?).",

Secondly, and more importantly, the fact that people were accustomed to intrusion moving through ports of entry or exit did not bear on the question of whether the circumstances in which the Schedule 7 powers could be exercised were too widely drawn to satisfy the test of \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d.

If she was asked questions designed to establish whether she appeared to be a terrorist, the potential of her answers to incriminate her if they were of an inculpatory character was indisputable.

As terrorists were not, at any one moment in time, evenly distributed across the various ethnic groups, if the power was being skilfully used, one would expect its exercise to be ethnically \u201cproportionate\u201d not to the United Kingdom population, nor even to the airport-using population, but rather to the terrorist population that travels through United Kingdom ports.

In this regard, the police had clearly recognised that they could not act as a conduit for the furtherance of the Security Service\u2019s purposes, and had had to be persuaded that the conditions for a lawful Schedule 7 stop had been met before they agreed to proceed. Moreover, as Parliament had set the bar for the exercise of the Schedule 7 power at quite a low level, the power having been given to provide an opportunity for the ascertainment of a possibility, the court accepted that the power was exercised for a lawful purpose. In assessing proportionality, the court accepted that the Schedule 7 stop was an interference with press freedom, but held that the compelling national security interests clearly outweighed Mr Miranda\u2019s Article 10 rights on the facts of the case.",

The court\u2019s central concern was that disclosure of journalistic material (whether or not it involved the identification of a journalist\u2019s source) undermined the confidentiality that was inherent in such material and which was necessary to avoid the chilling effect of disclosure and to protect Article 10 rights. If journalists and their sources could have no expectation of confidentiality, they might decide against providing information on sensitive matters of public interest. Consequently, it was of little or no relevance that the Schedule 7 powers could only be exercised in a confined geographical area or that a person could not be detained for longer than nine hours. Similarly, while the fact that the powers had to be exercised rationally, proportionately and in good faith provided a degree of protection, the only safeguard against the powers not being so exercised was the possibility of judicial review proceedings. However, while judicial review might be an adequate safeguard in the context of Articles 5 and 8, it would provide little protection against the damage done if journalistic material was disclosed and used in circumstances where this should not happen.",

First of all, section 44 required a senior officer to give authorisations if he thought it \u201cexpedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism\u201d. In contrast, Schedule 7 powers applied at all times at all ports. Secondly, while powers under sections 44 and 45 were directed at the narrow purpose of \u201csearching for articles of a kind that could be used in connection with terrorism\u201d, Schedule 7 powers had a much broader purpose and permitted a far wider investigation into an individual\u2019s activities, beliefs and movements. Thirdly, section 45 only permitted an officer to search a person\u2019s outer clothing and possessions, and detention was only permitted to the extent necessary to carry out that limited search. In contrast, a Schedule 7 suspicion-less examination could take place at a police station, could permit detailed and intrusive searches, and at the time the applicant was stopped, detention could last for up to nine hours. Fourthly, section 45 contained no power to interrogate, whereas Schedule 7 permitted a lengthy interrogation that a person was required by law to answer. Finally, section\u00a045 permitted an officer to retain items found during the search of a person only if the officer reasonably suspected that the item was intended to be used in connection with terrorism.

Ports and border controls will inevitably provide a crucial focal point for detecting and preventing the movement of terrorists and/or foiling terrorist attacks.

According to the Independent Reviewer, they were \u201cinstrumental\u201d in \u201csecuring evidence which assists in the conviction of terrorists\u201d (see paragraph 48 above). While the majority of examinations which led to convictions were intelligence-led, examinations could be useful even if they did not lead to a conviction. Intelligence gathered during the examinations contributed to a rich picture of the terrorist threat to the United Kingdom and its interests abroad, and could assist in the disruption or deterrence of terrorists\u2019 plans (see paragraph 48 above). Were \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to be required, terrorists could avoid the deterrent threat of Schedule 7 by using people who had not previously attracted the attention of the police (\u201cclean skins\u201d); and the mere fact of a stop could alert a person to the existence of surveillance (see paragraph 49 above).",

While there was no requirement of \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d, guidance was nevertheless provided to examining officers which attempted to clarify when the discretion could be exercised. According to the Guidance Notes accompanying the Code of Practice in force at the time of the applicant\u2019s examination, the power had to be used proportionately and officers had to take particular care to ensure that the selection of persons for examination was not solely based on their ethnic background or religion. Instead, the decision to exercise Schedule 7 powers had to be based on the threat posed by the various active terrorist groups and be based on a number of considerations, including the following factors: known or suspected sources of terrorism; individuals or groups whose current or past involvement in acts or threats of terrorism is known or suspected, and supporters or sponsors of such activity who are known or suspected; any information on the origins and/or location of terrorist groups; possible current, emerging and future terrorist activity; the means of travel (and documentation) that a group or individuals involved in terrorist activity could use; and emerging local trends or patterns of travel through specific ports or in the wider vicinity that may be linked to terrorist activity (see paragraph 42 above). While not relevant to the Court\u2019s assessment of the case at hand, it nevertheless notes that pursuant to the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 and the new Code of Practice, examining officers now have to be accredited by their chief officer as having met a national standard in the use of the powers (see paragraphs\u00a05455 above).",

In the following years, the Independent Reviewer noted a significant decline in the total number of examinations. Furthermore, although persons of minority ethnic communities, and especially those of Asian and North African ethnicity, were stopped more often than their percentage in the travelling population would objectively warrant, as noted by the Independent Reviewer, this did not mean that examinations were misdirected.

The judge therefore found that the officer\u2019s actions had been unlawful (see paragraph 70 above). However, challenges to the lawfulness of the decision to exercise the Schedule 7 power would appear to have been less successful. In R (David Miranda), the Court of Appeal accepted that the detention of a journalist\u2019s spouse at the request of the security service, which was principally concerned with determining whether the material he carried posed a threat to national security, was nevertheless lawful since before agreeing to the stop the police confirmed that the statutory grounds had been made out. In reaching this conclusion, the court observed that \u201cParliament had set the bar for the exercise of the Schedule 7 power at quite a low level, the power having been given to provide an opportunity for the ascertainment of a possibility\u201d (see paragraph 65-68 above). While in R(CC) the court found that the examining officers had not exercised the power for the purpose of determining whether the individual appeared to be a terrorist or not, the judge remarked that it was \u201ca very rare case\u201d since the powers were \u201cproperly given a wide construction\u201d (see paragraph 69 above).",

First of all, the Schedule 7 power did not require police officers to have \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that she was concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. As such, the mere fact of her selection for examination could not be understood as an indication that she herself was suspected of involvement in any criminal offence. On the contrary, the applicant was explicitly told by police officers that she was not under arrest and that the police did not suspect her of being a terrorist (see paragraph 8 above). Moreover, the questions put to her were general in nature and did not relate to her involvement in any criminal offence (see paragraph 11 above). The Court has already noted that the Schedule 7 power is a preliminary power of inquiry expressly provided in order to assist officers stationed at ports and borders to make counter-terrorism inquiries of any person entering or leaving the country (see paragraph 97 above). While it would not exclude the possibility that it could be exercised in such a way as to engage Article 6 of the Convention, there is no evidence to suggest that it was so exercised in the present case.",
