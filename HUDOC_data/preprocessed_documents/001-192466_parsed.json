Nonetheless, the authorities accepted as justification for the use of force an assessment made by the police in which negative inference seemed to have been drawn from the ethnic composition of the community (see paragraphs 13 and 39 above). In accepting that justification, the domestic courts did not censure what seems to be a discriminatory use of ethnic profiling by the authorities. Moreover, the authorities fell back on references to cases in which members of the Roma community had been violent towards law-enforcement officials, without explaining how those examples were of any relevance to the case in issue, in so far as they bore no resemblance to the applicants\u2019 situation and had no direct link to the present case.",

The Court is mindful of the evidence produced by the parties and the available material which show that, in the respondent State, the Roma communities are often confronted with institutionalised racism and are prone to excessive use of force by the law-enforcement authorities (see the references in paragraph 47 above). In this context, the mere fact that in the present case stereotypes about \u201cRoma behaviour\u201d feature in the authorities\u2019 assessment of the situation (see paragraph 37 and 40 above), may give rise to suspicions of discrimination based on ethnic grounds. Such suspicions, coupled with the modalities of the intervention of 15\u00a0December\u00a02011, should have prompted the authorities to take all possible steps to investigate whether or not discrimination may have played a role in the events. However, the applicants\u2019 allegations of discrimination against and criminalization of the Roma community have been dismissed by the domestic authorities and courts without any in-depth analysis of all the relevant circumstances of the case (see paragraphs 30 and 45 above).",

Therefore this complaint is related to the one already examined under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article\u00a03. Having found a violation of Articles 3 and 14 together (see paragraph\u00a081 above), the Court considers that no separate issue arises under Article\u00a03 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2), no. 74025/01, \u00a7 87, 6 October 2005).",
