The case originated in an application (no. 75366/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian company, Fetiš d.o.o. (“the applicant”), on 27 August 2000.
The applicant was represented by Mr J. Nastran, who was a director of the company. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, State Attorney-General.
The applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts to which it was a party was excessive.
On 23 September 2003 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
On 24 June 1994 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against S.H. in the  (Temeljno sodiše v Murski Soboti) seeking payment of 20,000 DEM to recover a debt. It also sought an injunction to secure the payment.
On 28 June 1994 it raised the claim to 30,000 DEM.
On 6 July 1994 the court granted the injunction.
On 5 October 1994 S.H. agreed to pay 20,000 DEM and the court consequently delivered a partial judgment, which became final on 28 October 1994.
On 17 May 1995 S.H. paid the agreed amount.
On 16 January 1996 the applicant lodged preliminary written submissions in which it continued to claim 30,000 DEM.
On 2 July 1998, further to the reorganization of the judicial system, the  (Okrajno sodišče v Murski Soboti) requested the applicant to modify the claim taking into account the partial judgment. Since the applicant refused to do so, the court, having regard to the amount of money requested, found on 9 July 1998 that it lacked jurisdiction over the case. It then reassigned the case to the Murska Sobota District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Murski Soboti).
The latter submitted the question of jurisdiction to the  (Višje sodišče v Mariboru) which, on 28 March 2000, decided that the case should be dealt by the  since the amount at dispute remained only 10,000 DEM.
On 3 April 2000 the applicant lodged a request with the State Attorney (Državno pravobranilstvo) seeking compensation for the damage it suffered due to the delays in the proceedings. On 11 August 2000 the State Attorney rejected the request.
On 22 August 2000, following the applicant’s modification of the claim to raise it to 26,161 DEM, the Murska Sobota Local Court again declared its lack of jurisdiction and sent the case to the District Court.
It appears that at least five hearings were held between 5 October 1994 and 15 December 2003, the second hearing taking place on 10 July 2000. At least two of the hearings were adjourned at the request of the applicant: the one held on 10 July 2000 was adjourned in order for the applicant to modify the claim and the hearing held on 4 September 2002 because the applicant now increased its claim to 30,000 DEM.
Between 28 June 1994 and 3 December 2002 the applicant lodged six written submissions.
During the proceedings, the applicant several times urged the authorities to speed up the proceedings. Between 7 June 1998 and 11 April 2005 it lodged five requests for supervision with the Murska Sobota District Court and on 2 February 1999 a request for supervision with the Ministry of Justice. In their replies, the authorities informed the applicant about the state of advancement of the proceedings.
On 23 December 2003 the court delivered a judgment rejecting the applicant’s claim, and a decision annulling the injunction previously granted.
The judgment and the decision were served on the applicant on 30 December 2003.
On 14 January 2004 the applicant appealed to the .
On 16 June 2004 the court allowed the applicant’s appeal and remitted the case to the first-instance court for re-examination.
The applicant has not informed the Court about the date when that decision was served on it.
In appears that in the re-examination proceedings the Murska Sobota District Court held two hearings on 9 May 2005 and 15 June 2005 respectively.
On 14 July 2005 the court delivered a judgment rejecting the applicant’s claim and a decision rejecting its request for an injunction.
The judgment and the decision were served on the applicant on 16 August 2005.
On 31 August 2005 the applicant appealed to the .
The proceedings are still pending.
