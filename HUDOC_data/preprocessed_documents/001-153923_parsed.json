His term of imprisonment was to end in 2016, that is after some six years from the date of the events in question (see paragraph\u00a06 above). In the decision refusing the applicant\u2019s request for leave, the penitentiary judge also referred to the applicant\u2019s negative behaviour in prison, as confirmed by the negative opinion issued by the penitentiary authorities about him (see paragraph\u00a011 above). The Court therefore accepts that in the circumstances of the present case the risks associated with the applicant\u2019s release from prison could reasonably be considered high and the domestic authorities were justified in finding that his return to prison could not be guaranteed (cf. P\u0142oski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036, and Czarnowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a028586/03, \u00a7\u00a029 , 20\u00a0January 2009).",

However, the Court considers that in the present case the domestic authorities cannot be faulted for this omission (see, a contrario, P\u0142oski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036, and Giszczak v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a040195/08, \u00a7\u00a029, 29\u00a0November 2011). The Court is aware that, by nature, escorted leaves require some organisational and logistical preparations and a realistic time frame for the domestic authorities to act. It notes in that respect that the applicant\u2019s request for leave from prison was examined by the penitentiary judge on 30\u00a0December 2010. The funeral of the applicant\u2019s grandmother was to take place on the same day at 12 noon in a town located at a distance of approximately 100 kilometers from the prison where the applicant was detained (see paragraphs\u00a0911 above). It cannot therefore be said that the domestic authorities had sufficient time to organise an escorted leave in order to allow the applicant to attend the funeral.",

Although the applicant\u2019s grandmother died on 23\u00a0December 2010, he received a telegram informing him of this fact and about the date of the funeral only on 29\u00a0December 2010 in the morning. In contrast, the State authorities handled the applicant\u2019s request for leave diligently and speedily: the prison authorities transmitted it to the Regional Court at 2.46\u00a0p.m. on the same day and the penitentiary judge examined it promptly the next day.",
