The system is inter-disciplinary, involving the participation of the police, educational bodies, doctors and others. At all stages the system involves joint discussions, joint recommendations and joint decisions. The key organisation is the Child Protection Conference, a multi-disciplinary body which decides whether to place the child on the Child Protection Register. This procedure by way of joint action takes place, not merely because it is good practice, but because it is required by guidance having statutory force binding on the local authority. The guidance is extremely detailed and extensive: the current edition of 'Working Together' runs to 126 pages. To introduce into such a system a common law duty of care enforceable against only one of the participant bodies would be manifestly unfair. To impose such liability on all the participant bodies would lead to almost impossible problems of disentangling as between the respective bodies the liability, both primary and by way of contribution, of each for reaching a decision found to be negligent.",

Here, for the first time, the plaintiffs are seeking to erect a common law duty of care in relation to the administration of a statutory social welfare scheme. Such a scheme is designed to protect weaker members of society (children) from harm done to them by others. The scheme involves the administrators in exercising discretion and powers which could not exist in the private sector and which in many cases bring them into conflict with those who, under the general law, are responsible for the child's welfare. To my mind, the nearest analogies are the cases where a common law duty of care has been sought to be imposed upon the police (in seeking to protect vulnerable members of society from wrongs done to them by others) or statutory regulators of financial dealing who are seeking to protect investors from dishonesty. In neither of these cases has it been thought appropriate to superimpose on a statutory regime a common law duty of care giving rise to a claim in damages for failure to protect the weak against the wrongdoer. ... In my judgment, the courts should proceed with great care before holding liable in negligence those who have been charged by Parliament with the task of protecting society from the wrong doings of others.\u201d",

During G.'s stay in their home, the plaintiffs' three children (fourth to sixth plaintiffs) were all sexually abused and suffered psychiatric illness. The plaintiffs brought an action against the local authority and the social worker involved, claiming damages for negligence and for negligent misstatement. On the defendants' application to strike out the statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, the judges struck out the parents' claims but refused to strike out the claims of the children.

In the instant case, the giving of information to the parents was part and parcel of the defendants' performance of their statutory powers and duties, and it had been conceded that it was arguable that those decisions fell outside the ambit of their discretion. Accordingly, since it had also been conceded that the damage to the children was reasonably foreseeable and that there was sufficient proximity, the question for the court was whether it was just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on the council or the social worker. Having regard to the fact that common law duty of care would cut across the whole statutory set up for the protection of children at risk, that the task of the local authority and its servants in dealing with such children was extraordinarily difficult and delicate, that local authorities might adopt a more defensive approach to their duties if liability in damages were imposed, that the relationship between parents and social workers was frequently one of conflict and that the plaintiff children's injuries were compensatable under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, it was not just and reasonable to do so.

It is a prerequisite to there being any liability in negligence at all that as a matter of policy it is fair, just and reasonable in those circumstances to impose liability in negligence. (2)\u00a0\u00a0In a wide range of cases public policy has led to the decision that the imposition of liability would not be fair and reasonable in the circumstances, e.g. some activities of financial regulators, building inspectors, ship surveyors, social workers dealing with sex abuse cases. In all these cases and many others the view has been taken that the proper performance of the defendant's primary functions for the benefit of society as a whole will be inhibited if they are required to look over their shoulder to avoid liability in negligence. In English law the decision as to whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a liability in negligence on a particular class of would-be defendants depends on weighing in the balance the total detriment to the public interest in all cases from holding such class liable in negligence as against the total loss to all would-be plaintiffs if they are not to have a cause of action in respect of the loss they have individually suffered. (3)\u00a0\u00a0In English law, questions of public policy and the question whether it is fair and reasonable to impose liability in negligence are decided as questions of law. Once the decision is taken that, say, company auditors though liable to shareholders for negligent auditing are not liable to those proposing to invest in the company (see Caparo Industries plc v. Dickman [1990] 1 All ER 568, [1990] 2 AC 605), that decision will apply to all future cases of the same kind.  The decision does not depend on weighing the balance between the extent of the damage to the plaintiff and the damage to the public in each particular case.\u201d",

It was under a statutory duty to protect the children and had a range of powers available to them, including the removal of the children from their home.

Over the intervening period of four and a half years, they had been subjected in their home to what the consultant child psychiatrist who examined them referred as horrific experiences (see paragraph 40 above).

The local authority had conceded that they could have foreseen damage to the applicants if they carried out their duties negligently and that there was a proximate relationship, thereby satisfying the first two limbs of the test for the duty of care. There was a strong argument that public policy considerations required a duty of care to be imposed and there was no prior decision excluding liability. The applicants also pointed to the fact that the judge who made the care orders specifically released the case papers to the Official Solicitor so that he could investigate and, if appropriate, pursue negligence claims; that the Official Solicitor considered that there were arguable claims in negligence; that the Legal Aid Board granted legal aid to pursue the claims to the House of Lords; and that the Court of Appeal which rejected the claims by a majority granted leave to appeal to the House of Lords, the precondition for such leave being that the claim was arguable in domestic law; that the Master of the Rolls, in the Court of Appeal, found that there was duty of care, stating the contrary to be \u201can affront to common sense\u201d; and that in previous cases, local authorities had paid settlements in negligence cases, on the basis that they were potentially liable.

The decision to strike out their claim touched on the scope of the domestic law.

In such a procedure, the plaintiff is generally able to submit to the court the arguments supporting his or her claims on the law and the court will rule on those issues at the conclusion of an adversarial procedure (see paragraphs\u00a066-68 above).",

As it has recalled above in paragraph 87, it is a principle of Convention case-law that Article 6 does not in itself guarantee any particular content for civil rights and obligations in national law, although other Articles such as those protecting the right to respect for family life (Article 8) and the right to property (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1) may do so. It is not enough to bring Article 6 \u00a7 1 into play that the non-existence of a cause of action under domestic law may be described as having the same effect as an immunity, in the sense of not enabling the applicant to sue for a given category of harm.",

He weighed that principle against the other public policy concerns in reaching the conclusion that it was not fair, just or reasonable to impose a duty of care on the local authority in the applicants' case. It may be noted that in subsequent cases the domestic courts have further defined this area of law concerning the liability of local authorities in child-care matters, holding that a duty of care may arise in other factual situations, where, for example, a child has suffered harm once in local authority care, or a foster family has suffered harm as a result of the placement in their home by the local authority of an adolescent with a history of abusing younger children (see W. and Others v. Essex County Council and Barrett, both cited above, paragraphs 62-65 above).",

The Court considers that its reasoning in Osman was based on an understanding of the law of negligence (see, in particular, Osman, cited above, pp. 3166-67, \u00a7\u00a7 138-39) which has to be reviewed in the light of the clarifications subsequently made by the domestic courts and notably by the House of Lords. The Court is satisfied that the law of negligence as developed in the domestic courts since the case of Caparo Industries plc (cited above) and as recently analysed in the case of Barrett (cited above, loc. cit.) includes the fair, just and reasonable criterion as an intrinsic element of the duty of care and that the ruling of law concerning that element in this case does not disclose the operation of an immunity. In the present case, the Court is led to the conclusion that the inability of the applicants to sue the local authority flowed not from an immunity but from the applicable principles governing the substantive right of action in domestic law. There was no restriction on access to a court of the kind contemplated in Ashingdane (cited above, loc. cit.). ",

However, the Government accepted that in the particular circumstances of this case, the remedies were insufficient, alone or cumulatively, to satisfy the requirements of Article 13. They conceded that there had been a serious violation of one of the most important Convention rights, that the CICB could only award compensation for criminal acts, not for the consequences of neglect, and that any recommendation by the Ombudsman would not have been legally enforceable.

Where alleged failure by the authorities to protect persons from the acts of others is concerned, Article 13 may not always require that the authorities undertake the responsibility for investigating the allegations. There should, however, be available to the victim or the victim's family a mechanism for establishing any liability of State officials or bodies for acts or omissions involving the breach of their rights under the Convention. Furthermore, in the case of a breach of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, which rank as the most fundamental provisions of the Convention, compensation for the non-pecuniary damage flowing from the breach should in principle be part of the range of available remedies.

He was prone to aggressiveness and had difficulty with everyday tasks. He was currently suffering from a reactive attachment disorder, resulting directly from severe parental neglect and abuse. The prognosis for the future was extremely bleak and he was likely to require intermittent hospitalisation. He was seriously handicapped on the labour market and was unlikely ever to be able to hold down a job. Assuming that he might otherwise have been able to obtain low-paid manual employment earning GBP 15,000 per year, and a normal working life to age 65, and taking into account uncertainties and early settlement, he claimed GBP 150,000 in loss of future earnings. As he had a substantial and continuing need for psychiatric treatment outside the National Health Service (NHS), he claimed GBP\u00a050,000 as a minimum estimate for future treatment. This made a total of GBP 200,000.",

In my view, when the courts in England, proceeding incrementally under the common law system of judicial law-making, hold that a hitherto unconsidered category of harm does not, as a matter of law, fall within the scope of the tort of negligence, they cannot properly be described as creating an \u201cimmunity\u201d, whether blanket or limited (see the speech of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Barrett v. the London Borough of Enfield [1999] 3 Weekly Law Reports 79, paragraph 65 of the judgment in the present case). What the decision of the House of Lords in the present case did was to determine a legal issue fixing the limits on the substantive content of a domestic \u201ccivil right\u201d. In any event the decision was fully and carefully reasoned. It could not be regarded as the product of arbitrariness and it applied only to closely defined circumstances (see paragraphs 98-99 of the judgment). ",

At the same time, however, the Court also stated that the Convention enforcement bodies could not create, by way of interpretation of Article 6, a substantive civil right which had no legal basis in the State concerned. Yet that is what the applicants are inviting the Court to do in the present case.

Instead, it chose to \u201cproceed on the basis that Article 6 \u00a7 1 [was] applicable to the facts of the case\u201d (ibid., pp. 50-51, \n\u00a7 67).

In 1993 he was diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and in 2000 he was diagnosed as suffering from a personality disorder for which the prognosis was unfavourable. B was considered to have a post-traumatic stress disorder in both 1993 and 2000, as well as social difficulties, and in addition in 2000 a generalised anxiety disorder, but the prognosis for him was uncertain rather than unfavourable. On the other hand, the initial diagnosis in 1993 of Z as suffering from a severe depressive illness has not been borne out, though it is considered that she may suffer anxiety and perhaps depressive illness in later life. In 2000 C's difficulties were described as moderate; she was regarded as vulnerable to anxiety and likely to need psychotherapeutic help in the future, but she had not suffered any psychiatric disorder.

As the Court observes in paragraph 101 of the judgment, the applicants may not \u201cclaim that they were deprived of any right to a determination on their merits of their negligence claims. Their claims were properly and fairly examined in the light of the applicable domestic principle concerning the tort of negligence\u201d. And, as it is also stated in paragraph 95, \u201c[t]he arguments before the courts were, therefore, concentrated on the legal issues, primarily whether a duty of care in negligence was owed to the applicants by the local authority\u201d. It is difficult for one to accept this approach. The applicants' claims before the national courts did not, of course, refer to this preliminary issue. Their complaint was that the local authorities acted with gross negligence in a case involving a statutory duty of care and that, because of the damage inflicted on them by the failure of the authorities to properly discharge their responsibilities, compensation was due. They submitted this civil right to the courts and nurtured the legitimate expectation that it would be dealt with by the courts through an examination on the merits following an adversarial procedure that would enable them to prove the veracity of their claims. If it may be asserted that, as a general rule the question of access to a court is determined by the subject matter of the claims before the national courts, then the applicants never enjoyed access: at all stages of the domestic examination of their case, the national courts solely examined the jurisdictional problem of whether they could entertain the merits of the case before them, thus confining themselves to the preliminary question of whether an exclusionary rule exists, preventing them from examining the merits. An exclusionary rule which was eventually established by them, not on the basis of statutory requirements or specific precedents that were binding on them, but on the basis of a particular interpretation by them of the requirements of English law in the light of the circumstances of the case before them.",

Further, the way that the judicial authorities dealt with the matter shows that the case presented serious issues that warranted serious examination: as the applicants pointed out, the judge who made the care orders specifically released the case papers to the Official Solicitor so that he could investigate and, if appropriate, pursue negligence claims; the Official Solicitor considered that there were arguable claims in negligence; the Legal Aid Board granted legal aid to pursue the claims to the House of Lords; and the Court of Appeal, which rejected the claims by a majority, granted leave to appeal to the House of Lords, the precondition for such leave being that the claim was arguable in domestic law; the Master of the Rolls in the Court of Appeal found that there was a duty of care, stating the contrary to be \u201can affront to common sense\u201d; and, in previous cases, local authorities had settled negligence claims on the basis that they were potentially liable.",

The majority, however, holds a different view since it accepts that, even in circumstances where there has been a violation of the substance of Article 3, the Contracting States \u201care afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations ...\u201d provided that some effective remedy exists to deal with individual complaints concerning inhuman and degrading treatment.

If the complaint may involve a violation of core Convention rights \u2013 such as Articles 2 and 3 \u2013 the Court is bound, to my mind, to find that the States are obliged not simply to offer an effective remedy (as required by Article 13), but a judicial remedy covering all the requirements of Article 6.",

It went on to express the opinion that, in cases where the harm sustained by a complainant was of the most serious nature, examination of the merits could not be automatically excluded by the application of a rule which \u201camounts to the grant of an immunity to the police\u201d. In conclusion, the Court in Osman was mainly concerned with the fact that the applicants in a very serious case of possible substantive human-rights violations did not have the opportunity to air their grievances before a court of law; it was not concerned with whether the reason behind it being impossible to examine the case on the merits was or was not the result of an immunity provided for by national law acting as a procedural bar having such an effect. It simply found that the impossibility amounted to a grant of an immunity. Under these circumstances how can we distinguish between Osman and the present case?",

In Osman the Court found that the application of an exclusionary rule barring liability of the police for negligence in the exercise of their functions of investigating and preventing crime constituted a disproportionate restriction on access to a court for the applicants. The majority's reasons for not following the decisions in Osman (see paragraph 100 of the judgment) are not, to my mind, convincing. There seem to have been no striking or significant changes in the law of negligence since that case and all relevant matters concerning the content of domestic law had been brought to the attention of the Court by the parties in Osman.
