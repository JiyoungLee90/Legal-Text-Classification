They were vulnerable and sensitive to change. However, since the permanent care order, T. had slowly become more calm and balanced and had started to learn how to play. She and the applicant had been alone during their meetings and had done various things such as going to the playground, the swimming pool or a restaurant. T. had been very tired after the meetings and she had slept badly and wet her bed. After telephone conversations with the applicant, T. had also been anxious and sad. As regards S., he had become calmer and more relaxed since placed in the family home. He still had difficulties sleeping and suffered from stomach pains and vomiting before and after contact with the applicant, despite the meetings having been very structured and held in the presence of the family home father. S. showed clear signs of fear of his mother and he had expressed a fear that she would come and fetch him. Turning to D., it was observed that she had met with the applicant and that they had usually been alone, playing together. After contact with the applicant, D. used to be worried about things the applicant had told her and she regressed somewhat in her development for a few days after each meeting, wetting her bed and having difficulty sleeping.

On the contrary, it appears to have continuously tried to find a balance where the interests of all parties are taken into account to ensure that the various family members can maintain contact and develop their relationship in a positive manner. In this respect, the Court observes that the three children meet each other with their family home parents approximately once a month, as well as when they meet the applicant and B. Moreover, B. meets the children twice a year and the applicant\u2019s mother has also been present at some of the applicant\u2019s meetings with the children. During the meetings with their parents, the children and their family homes show photos and films of their activities to include their parents in their lives. Furthermore, it would seem that all family members are free to send and receive letters and postcards from each other. The Court also notes that the applicant and B. remain the legal guardians of the children and that the Social Council has taken no measures to transfer this right to the family homes. In these circumstances, the Court finds no reason to question that the ultimate goal of the Swedish authorities is to improve the relationship between the applicant and her children in order for them one day to reunite or at least have a good and close relationship.",

When the children were taken into public care in 2005, their health and development had already been harmed by the lack of care in their home. Thus, they had to be placed in different family homes as one family home could not provide the care and support that each child needed. Moreover, from the very negative physical and mental reactions of the children before, during and after meetings with the applicant, notably their anxiety, bed wetting, nightmares and the regression in their development, the domestic courts found that the applicant\u2019s contact rights had to be limited in order to protect the children from further harm to their development and health and to ensure that they would have some stability and calm in their daily life. This was also found to be necessary so that the children could begin to evolve in those areas where they were lacking and to develop positively without the regular set-backs that the meetings with their mother entailed.",

However, it is clear to the Court that this must have been an added stress factor for the children since they had very few, if any, memories of B., not having seen him since their parents divorced in 2003. Thus, in order not to cause too much anxiety and upset for the children, the Social Council had to balance the interest of each parent to see their children against the children\u2019s continued positive development, resulting in fewer visits for each parent, which the Court finds to be a logical solution to ensure that the best interest of the children was protected.",

In particular T. and S., at the time nine and seven years old, were very negative in their reactions toward their mother and S. even showed clear signs of fear of his mother.

Although the applicant could appeal against each of these decisions, she did not do so until the decision of 11\u00a0August 2008 and then the  increased her contact rights to four times a year. In the Court\u2019s view, it cannot be ruled out that had she appealed against one of the earlier decisions by the Social Council, she might have been granted increased contact rights sooner.

That she took the initiative in protecting her children from her own temporary inability to care for them is an important factor in this case. There was no history of criminal conduct, substance abuse or sexual abuse but the children were, clearly, neglected and in need of immediate attention.

After the permanent order was granted, the entire family was broken up. Within seven months of that initial call for help, the three children were separated and sent to live in different homes. Undoubtedly distressed, the applicant went to live with her sister but was prepared to travel over 1,000 kilometres every month in order to see her children. Indeed, she was willing to do so more frequently but her appeals for increased access were rejected (\u00a7\u00a7 21 and 22 of the judgment).",

That a care order should be regarded as a temporary measure, to be discontinued as soon as circumstances permit is a \u2018guiding principle\u2019 in this Court\u2019s case law under Article 8. Any measures implementing it should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the natural parent and the child (see Olsson v.

The speed with which the decision regarding long-term placement was made and the stringent restriction on access that flowed therefrom is a strong indicator that the possibility of reunification was never, seriously, considered let alone pursued. On any assessment, there appears to have been a manifest prematurity in deciding upon the future of this family. The restrictions imposed at such an early stage in the proceedings cannot but have significantly hindered any possibility of reunification and cannot have been consistent with what the Court\u2019s caselaw identifies as the \u2018ultimate aim\u2019 of care proceedings.",

This, they considered, to be in the children\u2019s best interests having regard to their initial state of neglect and the obvious distress which seeing their mother provoked. However, one cannot but question whether it can ever be in a child\u2019s best interests to have its established relationship with its biological mother ruptured so suddenly and contact with her reduced so radically within such a short period of time, particularly, in circumstances where the main problem in the family home was one of neglect \u2013 as distinct from serious violence or abuse. By bringing about such far-reaching and radical changes in the lives of three young children which saw them, suddenly, deprived of their mother\u2019s care \u2013 (however temporarily inadequate that may have been) \u2013 the authorities cannot but have contributed to the emotional and psychological distress symptoms displayed by them whenever they met with their mother. Ironically, it was these very stress symptoms which were then relied upon by the authorities in support of their applications for the maintenance of such ongoing restrictions.",

Furthermore, at no stage in the proceedings did the domestic courts hear the children themselves either directly or by way of video link. Whilst the Court of Appeal in 2008 directed that their point of view be obtained, there is a manifest want of independence in the manner in which this \u2018evidence\u2019 was ascertained \u2013 the children being interviewed by only one of the parties to the proceedings (the council), in a non-neutral environment and in the presence of their substitute carers.

It is clear that when the applicant first contacted the social services, this family was in need of care and support.
