But he said that it was irrational to recognise that she had an entitlement to a pension by virtue of her contributions to the National Insurance Fund and then not to pay her the same pension as  residents who had made the same contributions.",

The one feature upon which Ms Carson seizes as the basis of her claim to equal treatment (but only in respect of a pension) is that she has paid the same national insurance contributions. That is really the long and the short of her case. In my opinion, however, concentration on this single feature is an over-simplification of the comparison. The situation of the beneficiaries of UK social security is, to quote the European Court in Van der Mussele v Belgium (1983) 6 EHRR 163, 180, para. 46, 'characterised by a corpus of rights and obligations of which it would be artificial to isolate one specific aspect'.",

In effect Ms Carson's argument is that because contributions are a necessary condition for the retirement pension paid to  residents, they ought to be a sufficient condition. No other matters, like whether one lives in the  and participates in the rest of its arrangements for taxation and social security, ought to be taken into account. But that in my opinion is an obvious fallacy. National insurance contributions have no exclusive link to retirement pensions, comparable with contributions to a private pension scheme. In fact the link is a rather tenuous one. National insurance contributions form a source of part of the revenue which pays for all social security benefits and the National Health Service (the rest comes from ordinary taxation). If payment of contributions is a sufficient condition for being entitled to a contributory benefit, Ms Carson should be entitled to all contributory benefits, like maternity benefit and job-seekers allowance.

The main reason for the provision of state pensions is the recognition that the majority of people of pensionable age will need the money. They are not means-tested, but that is only because means-testing is expensive and discourages take-up of the benefit even by people who need it. So state pensions are paid to everyone whether they have adequate income from other sources or not. On the other hand, they are subject to tax. So the state will recover part of the pension from people who have enough income to pay tax and thereby reduce the net cost of the pension. On the other hand, those people who are entirely destitute would be entitled to income support, a non-contributory benefit. So the net cost of paying a retirement pension to such people takes into account the fact that the pension will be set off against their claim to income support.",

But, from the point of view of the citizens who contribute, national insurance contributions are little different from general taxation which disappears into the communal pot of the consolidated fund. The difference is only a matter of public accounting. And although retirement pensions are presently linked to contributions, there is no particular reason why they should be. In fact (mainly because the present system severely disadvantages women who have spent time in the unremunerated work of caring for a family rather than earning a salary) there are proposals for change. Contributory pensions may be replaced with a non-contributory 'citizen's pension' payable to all inhabitants of this country of pensionable age. But there is no reason why this should mean any change in the collection of national insurance contributions to fund the citizen's pension like all the other non-contributory benefits. On Ms Carson's argument, however, a change to a non-contributory pension would make all the difference. Once the retirement pension was non-contributory, the foundation of her argument that she had 'earned' the right to equal treatment would disappear. But she would have paid exactly the same national insurance contributions while she was working here and her contributions would have had as much (or as little) causal relationship to her pension entitlement as they have today.",

I do not think, with all respect to my noble and learned friend, Lord Carswell, that the reasons are subtle and arcane. They are practical and fair. Furthermore, I think that this is very much a case in which Parliament is entitled to decide whether the differences justify a difference in treatment. It cannot be the law that the  is prohibited from treating expatriate pensioners generously unless it treats them in precisely the same way as pensioners at home. Once it is accepted that the position of Ms Carson is relevantly different from that of a  resident and that she therefore cannot claim equality of treatment, the amount (if any) which she receives must be a matter for Parliament. It must be possible to recognise that her past contributions gave her a claim in equity to some pension without having to abandon the reasons why she cannot claim to be treated equally. And in deciding what expatriate pensioners should be paid, Parliament must be entitled to take into account competing claims on public funds. To say that the reason why expatriate pensioners are not paid the annual increases is to save money is true but only in a trivial sense: every decision not to spend more on something is to save money to reduce taxes or spend it on something else.",

Once it is conceded, as Mr Blake accepts, that people resident outside the  are relevantly different and could be denied any pension at all, Parliament does not have to justify to the courts the reasons why they are paid one sum rather than another.

Mr Blake was able to point to government statements to the effect that there was no logical scheme in the arrangements with treaty countries.

But that seems to me an entirely rational basis for differences in treatment. The situation of a  expatriate pensioner who lives in a country which has been willing to enter into suitable reciprocal social security arrangements is relevantly different from that of a pensioner who lives in a country which has not. The treaty enables the government to improve the social security benefits of  nationals in the foreign country on terms which it considers to be favourable, or at least not unduly burdensome. It would be very strange if the government was prohibited from entering into such reciprocal arrangements with any country (for example, as it has with the EEA countries) unless it paid the same benefits to all expatriates in every part of the world.\u201d",

They pointed out that the Court had consistently held that \u201cstatus\u201d within Article\u00a014 meant \u201ca personal characteristic ... by which persons or groups of persons are distinguishable from each other\u201d (Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v. Denmark, judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 23). That interpretation had more recently been followed by the Court in Budak v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 57345/00, 7 September 2004 ) and Beale v. the United Kingdom ((dec.) no. 16743/03, 12 October 2004). Choice of residence was not such a personal characteristic. They submitted that the decision to live outside the  was a matter of choice rather than birth, and was not a choice dictated by the individual's conscience or deeply held belief system. It was difficult to see what core Convention value required the protection of choice of personal residence.\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, choice of residence in most cases inevitably led to a series of differences in the position of the person concerned, which flowed from differences in national systems, including social security systems. The differences between the positions of Ms Carson and her two chosen comparators did not stem from any personal characteristic by which persons or groups were distinguishable from each other, but instead from the different systems and conditions under which individuals had chosen to live. Alternatively, even if choice of residence could be regarded as a personal characteristic within the concept of \u201cother status\u201d, the fact that it was a matter of choice meant that, unlike for example sex or race, it did not require special scrutiny and \u201cvery weighty reasons\u201d to justify a difference of treatment.",

Moreover, in order for an issue to arise under Article\u00a014 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations (D.H.\u00a0and Others v.\u00a0the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, \u00a7 175, ECHR 2007). Such a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (Burden cited above, \u00a7 60). The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background. A wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature's policy choice unless it is \u201cmanifestly without reasonable foundation\u201d (Stec and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR 2006).",

Thus, in previous cases the Court has examined under Article 14 the legitimacy of alleged discrimination based, inter alia, on domicile abroad (Johnston v. Ireland, judgment of 18\u00a0December 1986, Series A no. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 59-61) and registration as a resident (Darby v. Sweden, judgment of 23 October 1990, Series A no. 187, \u00a7\u00a7 31-34).

However, as pointed out by Stanley Burnton J., these cases are not comparable to the present case, which involves the different application of the same pensions legislation to persons depending on their residence and presence abroad.",

In this connection, the Court notes that National Insurance Contributions are only one part of the United Kingdom's complex system of taxation and that the National Insurance Fund is one of a number of sources of revenue used to pay for the United Kingdom's Social Security and National Health systems. It does not consider the applicants' payment of National Insurance Contributions during their working lives in the United Kingdom to be of any more significance than the fact that they may have paid income tax or other taxes while domiciled there (see Stec and Others (dec) [GC], cited above, \u00a7 50). Turning to the applicants' second argument (see paragraph 75 above), the Court is of the view that even between States in close geographical proximity, such as the United States of America and Canada, South Africa and Mauritius, or Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, differences in social security provision, taxation, rates of inflation, interest and currency exchange make it difficult to compare the respective positions of residents.",

While there is some force in the applicants' argument, echoed by Age Concern, that an elderly person's decision to move abroad may be driven by a number of factors, including the desire to be close to family members, place of residence is nonetheless a characteristic which can be changed as a matter of choice. The Court therefore agrees with the Government and the national courts that the individual does not require the same high level of protection against differences of treatment based on this ground as is needed in relation to differences based on an inherent characteristic, such as gender or racial or ethnic origin (see, for example, Van Raalte v. the Netherlands, judgment of 21 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, \u00a7 39; D.H. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 176, and compare Magee, cited above, \u00a7 50). It is, moreover, relevant in this connection that the State took steps to inform  residents moving abroad about the absence of indexlinking for pensions in certain specified countries (see paragraph 42 above). Thus each of the applicants could have taken this factor into account amongst all the other reasons for and against the choice of country of residence.",

Ms Carson, as well as the other applicants, fulfilled her side of the deal in full: for most of her working life she paid contributions (as well as taxes) and those contributions were gladly accepted by the State. Her contributions were spent (as we should hope) on the pensions of current pensioners and also on the annual indexation of their pensions. There was no difference at all between her and other persons working in the  at that time. Now she is no longer of working age, it is time for the State to meet its obligations. However, the State treats her differently from other fellow contributors solely because of her new place of residence.

While it is true that she is no longer a UK taxpayer, there are no prohibitions \u2013 under our Convention \u2013 on imposing a  tax on her UK-based income, whatever its amount. But unlike those who have remained in the , she has been deprived of the index-linking privilege. Considerations of social justice and equity require that persons who have duly contributed towards the pensions of others should not be treated differently in the subsequent calculation of their own pension. Differential treatment based solely on current residence has no link to the contributory nature of pensions and, therefore, is deprived of a reasonable justification.",

But there is a common feature for all countries involved, and this feature is inflation. Thus, it is difficult to accept that the situation of  residents is basically different from that of non-UK residents. The legislature has, of course, no obligation to up-rate pensions according to inflation in the host country. It is also entitled to adjust indexation to take into account differences between particular countries, but it cannot simply ignore the very existence of inflation as a common economic characteristic of the modern world. Such a regulation penalises persons who, after having fulfilled their side of the contributory scheme, move abroad. Such penalisation runs counter to the principle of individual freedom and, therefore, cannot be regarded as reasonably justified.",

As was observed by the domestic authorities (see paragraph 47 of the judgment), it would be difficult \u201cto defend the logic of the present situation ... There is no consistent pattern\u201d. In consequence, the situation of British pensioners varies from country to country. This makes the majority's references to the margin-of-appreciation doctrine (see paragraph 81 of the judgment) less convincing. Under this doctrine, the State is allowed to devise its own ways of addressing social and economic problems. Had the  developed a coherent and logical solution to the issue of index-linking for foreign residents, it would have been easier to accept it. But the doctrine of the margin of appreciation cannot legitimise a situation of an illogical and, therefore, arbitrary nature.",
