Failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands, without a satisfactory explanation, may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.

Between 11 February and 2 March 2001 the applicant underwent surgery and in-patient treatment in  no. 1 in this connection (see paragraphs 16 and 17). The existence of the injuries strongly supported the applicant's account of events. Indeed, regard being had to the fact that the prosecution case against officer B. was based on, among other things, medical reports confirming the above injuries (see paragraph 51), it can be said that the authorities conceded that the allegations had been credible.",

Since the Government did not provide the Court with copies of the decisions analysing that version, as well as copies of documents and evidence on which it may have been based, the Court does not find it possible to speculate on its well-foundedness and concludes that no satisfactory and convincing explanation for the origin of the applicant's injuries has been obtained or advanced either at the domestic level, or in the proceedings before this Court. Without prejudice to the question of the personal criminal liability of the alleged perpetrators of the acts in question, the Court concludes therefore that the Government failed to discharge its burden and that it was not satisfactorily established that the applicant's account of events had been inaccurate or otherwise erroneous.",
