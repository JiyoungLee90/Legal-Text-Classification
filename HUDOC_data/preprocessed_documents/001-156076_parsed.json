It follows that the applicants\u2019 subsequent submissions of 20 and 31\u00a0January 2011, although nominally amendments to the request of 22\u00a0December 2010, were in fact new requests (see paragraphs 21 and 24\u00a0above) and that the period under the Court\u2019s consideration commenced from those dates.",
