In particular, they had arrived in a group during the early morning and had searched the flat. Also, the intruders had spoken Russian without an accent. The Court further notes the applicants' arguments, none of them being disputed by the Government, that at the material time the area where the Yansuyev brothers were abducted had been under the formal control of the State, that the perpetrators could not have passed unnoticed through four federal checkpoints situated in that area, and that at that period a restriction was in place on the movement of vehicles during the night. In respect of the latter, the Court takes account of the fourth applicant's submission that she had seen the tracks of APCs after the incident (see paragraph 15 above) and a statement of Mr B., the applicants' neighbour, that he had heard the noise of engines on the night of the incident (see paragraph 46 above). In the Court's opinion, the fact that a group of men in camouflage uniforms, equipped with automatic firearms and, most probably, vehicles and able to move freely and take a person from his home in a city area presumably under the control of the federal forces and secured by federal check-points strongly supports the applicants' allegation that they were State agents. The Court also takes into account that at least for some time the domestic investigation considered that there were sufficient grounds to believe that State agents had been involved in the abduction and disappearance of the Yansuyev brothers (see paragraph 69 above).",

The absence of Ilyas and Isa Yansuyev or any news of them for over seven years by now corroborates this assumption.

The investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see O\u011fur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, \u00a7 88, ECHR 1999III). In particular, there is an implicit requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition (see Ya\u015fa v. , 2\u00a0September 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 102-04, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI, and Mahmut Kaya v.

However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in the maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the next of kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (see Shanaghan v. the United Kingdom, no. 37715/97, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, 4\u00a0May 2001).",

In that context, it has repeatedly stressed that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. To minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty is amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5 (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 104).",

The Government further argued that the applicants could have appealed in court against actions or omissions of the investigation authorities in accordance with Article 125 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, but had failed to do so. Also, in the Government's view, if the applicants had considered that any action or omission on the part of public officials had caused them damage, they could have sought compensation for that damage in court by virtue of the relevant provisions of the Russian Civil Code, but they had never attempted to avail themselves of that opportunity. In support of this argument, the Government referred to a letter of the Supreme Court of Russia dated 3 August 2007 which stated that the applicants had not complained to the courts in the Chechen Republic of the unlawful detention of their relatives, about the actions of any law-enforcement officials, or of any shortcomings in the investigation into the disappearance of Ilyas and Isa Yansuyev. The Government did not submit the letter to which they referred.",

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although  are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they comply with their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by acts or omissions by the authorities of the respondent State (see Aksoy v.

This obligation requires the Contracting States to furnish all necessary facilities to the Court, whether it is conducting a fact-finding investigation or performing its general duties as regards the examination of applications. Failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands, without a satisfactory explanation, may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.
