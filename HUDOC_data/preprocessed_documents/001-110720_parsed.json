In their view, the six-month rule was not applicable in the instant case, because the non-investigation of the death was a continuous violation.

The situation is however different with regard to the complaint of a breach of the State\u2019s positive obligation to provide medical treatment to Ms Aleksandrovich during her stay in police custody. This complaint was not mentioned in the original application and was raised for the first time in the applicants\u2019 observations in reply to those of the Government, submitted on 2 May 2008. Since more than six months have elapsed since the end of the situation complained about, this complaint has been introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and\u00a04 of the Convention.",

However, on 13 and 29 July 2005 the Pskov Regional and Town Courts determined that the prosecutor\u2019s decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings had been unlawful, because the forensic evidence and witness statements should have been collected in the framework of a criminal investigation. The Government\u2019s claim that Article 109 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure made no distinction between the stage of a preliminary inquest and a criminal investigation sits ill with the textual reading of this provision which allowed the investigator to obtain necessary materials or explanations but prevented him from carrying out any investigative acts, such as for instance a forensic study (see paragraph 29 above). Notwithstanding the findings of the domestic courts, a criminal investigation into Ms Aleksandrovich\u2019s death has never been instituted. The Court considers that the failure to open a criminal case in a situation where an individual has died or has been seriously injured while in police custody was in itself a serious breach of domestic procedural rules capable of undermining the validity of any evidence which had been collected (compare Maslova and Nalbandov v.
