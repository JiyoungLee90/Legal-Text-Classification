He relied on Articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution, Article 177 of the CPC (see paragraphs 38-39 and 46 below) and Articles 5, 6 and 13 of the Convention. He submitted, inter alia, that: (a) the courts had failed to review his detention and issue a relevant decision within 30 days; (b) his detention had already lasted for more than eight months without the indictment having entered into force even though it was statutorily limited to six months; (c)\u00a0the decisions extending his detention had been insufficiently reasoned, the reasoning having been identical, merely copied from one decision to another, and the reasons set out in the first detention order could no longer suffice. In particular, the court had not taken into account the overall length of his detention or his personal circumstances \u2013 he was 77 years old at the time, had a minor daughter, had severe health problems, had never been convicted before, and had been a respectable citizen. Also, the decisions had not specified how long the detention would last, which made them arbitrary and his deprivation of liberty unlawful. The applicant referred to, inter alia, Letellier v. France, 26\u00a0June 1991, Series A no. 207; Clooth v. Belgium, 12\u00a0December 1991, Series A no. 225; and Jablonski v. Poland, no.\u00a033492/96, 21 December 2000.",

It acknowledged that reasonable suspicion was a conditio sine qua non, but that after a certain time it was no longer sufficient. It held, however, that the High Court and the Court of Appeals had examined the existence of reasonable suspicion, assessed the existing evidence and other circumstances justifying the extension of detention, indicated which evidence had been taken into account and given clear and precise explanations in accepting them. Therefore, the disputed decisions were reasoned, there was no arbitrariness in them and hence no violation of Article 5.",

In the latter cases, the Court has accepted that the next-of-kin, close family members or heirs may in principle pursue the application, provided that they have sufficient interest in the case (see Provenzano v. Italy, no. 55080/13, \u00a7 96, 25 October 2018, and the authorities cited therein). It is not only material interests which the successor of a deceased applicant may pursue by his or her wish to maintain the application.

[GC], no.\u00a033071/96, ECHR 2000-XII). Thus, in cases where the direct victim has died after the application was lodged, the decisive factor is not whether the rights at issue are transferable to heirs willing to pursue an application, but whether the persons wishing to pursue the proceedings can claim a legitimate interest in seeking that the Court decide the case on the basis of the applicant\u2019s desire to use his individual and personal right to lodge a case before the Court (see Ergezen v.

These time-limits, however, were not mandatory (prekluzivni). These time limits were just limits within which the existing decision had each time to be reviewed, and the decisions on extension of the detention did not represent new decisions on detention each time after the previous one had expired.
