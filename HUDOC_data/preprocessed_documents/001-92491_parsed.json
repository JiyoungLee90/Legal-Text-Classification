Thus, the national courts never ruled that the enforcement of the judgment of 3 February 2003 was bound to fail due to the fact that the land had been assigned to third parties (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). Moreover, in spite of the fact that the State Property Authority had identified a specific and unoccupied plot of 16 ha of land to be allocated to the applicant, the local authorities alleged that that land was actually claimed by third parties. Although it is not the Court\u2019s task to assess whether the location of that land had been correctly established, it considers that it was up to the authorities to take specific steps to avoid concurrent decisions that they have to enforce or at least to clarify the situation thus created (see Popescu and Da\u015foveanu v. , no. 24681/03, \u00a7 36, 19\u00a0July 2007).
