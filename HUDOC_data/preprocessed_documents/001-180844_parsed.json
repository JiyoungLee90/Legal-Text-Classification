He was unable to name any of the police officers, given the events, but stated that he would be able to recognise them at an identification parade. He had noticed that they were part of an RRF unit.

The appellant instituted legal proceedings against the stay of the criminal investigation.

The domestic courts rejected his action. The Tirana Court of Appeal held that, since the criminal investigation had been ongoing, and since the prosecutor\u2019s office had had the discretion to determine the investigative actions to be carried out, the applicant did not have locus standi. It reconfirmed that there was no right to appeal against a decision to stay criminal proceedings under criminal procedural law. The appellant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court, which was rejected by decision no. 4 of 18\u00a0January\u00a02013. The Constitutional Court held, inter alia, that, there was no remedy under domestic law against a prosecutor\u2019s decision staying a criminal investigation.

The applicant\u2019s account of events was corroborated by two witnesses (N.P. and Ni.P.) questioned in the course of the investigation (see also paragraph 29 above). However, equally consistently, all the police officers in question claimed the opposite. They consistently stated that the applicant had had an injury to the back of his head from the outset, that he had been involved in the fight, and that they had not used any force against him (see\u00a0paragraphs\u00a0 9, 10, 14 and 32-34 above). This account of events was corroborated by witnesses A.S., A.E. and J.K. in their statements of 7\u00a0August and 17\u00a0October 2012 and 15 January 2013. In these circumstances, it is clear that the whole set of events did not \u201clie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities\u201d. While the medical report in respect of the applicant was produced a day after the events, this is not sufficient for the Court to conclude, certainly not beyond reasonable doubt, that he was indeed ill-treated in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Habimi and Others v. Serbia, no.\u00a019072/08, \u00a7 89, 3 June 2014). The second expert report carried out by the FMI stated that it had been impossible to identify the object that had caused the applicant\u2019s injuries. Moreover, there were some indications to the effect that the injuries sustained by the applicant might have been caused as a consequence of him and the other people being involved in the fight before the police intervention. According to the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 13\u00a0May 2013, the applicant had been hit by another man prior to the police intervention during the physical dispute. The Court notes that the prosecutor\u2019s decision stated that doubts had arisen as to whether the offence of abuse of power had been committed, on the grounds that the injuries sustained by the applicant might have been caused while he was being escorted to the police station by the RRF officers. Nevertheless, the Court notes that, in his written observations, the applicant did not submit any claim concerning any alleged ill-treatment against him while being escorted by the police officers to the police station. He strongly maintained that the police officers had beaten him in public in the main street of the city.\u00a0\u00a0In these circumstances, the Court considers that it is not apparent that the applicant was still in good health when the authorities arrived at the scene (see, for instance, Kobets v. Ukraine, no.\u00a016437/04, \u00a7\u00a7 46-48, 14\u00a0February\u00a02008).",

However, some of the essential investigative measures were taken inexplicably late. In this connection, the Court notes that, although the applicant had complained to the authorities on the day of the incident, 6 August 2012, and had also lodged a criminal complaint against the RRF police officers two days after the incident, the police officers involved were only questioned by the prosecutor five months after the incident. In this connection, the Court reiterates that it has repeatedly underlined the importance of contacting and questioning witnesses in the immediate aftermath of such incidents, when memories are fresh (see, for example, Doiciu v. Romania, no. , \u00a7 62, 5 May 2015). Furthermore, the second forensic medical report in the case was produced seven months after the incident (see Dinu v. Romania, no. 64356/14, \u00a7 82, 7\u00a0February\u00a02017).",

The prosecuting authorities questioned two witnesses who testified in support of the applicant, and six police officers and three witnesses who testified against him. However, the reasoning in the prosecutor\u2019s decision to stay the investigation did not contain any assessment of the witness testimonies in favour of the applicant. The prosecutor did not provide any explanation as to why those testimonies were considered less credible than the statements of the police officers and the three other witnesses (see Mustafa Hajili\u00a0v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 42119/12, \u00a7 52, 24 November 2016). Despite the fact that their statements clearly conflicted with the applicant\u2019s statement, the prosecutor in charge of the case did not order a formal face-to-face confrontation between the applicant and the police officers or even an identification parade, even though the applicant explicitly asked for one (see\u00a0Chmil\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 20806/10, \u00a7 89, 29 October 2015, and Hilal\u00a0Mammadov v.

Likewise, it does not refute the possibility that the injuries in question could have resulted from police violence, the prosecutor herself casting doubt on the cause of the applicant\u2019s injuries, without giving further reasons. Furthermore, in reply to the Government\u2019s submission that the investigation has not yet been completed, the Court notes that, even though more than four years have elapsed since the investigation was stayed, the police authorities have not taken any other investigative steps since then. The Government did not provide any document to report on the progress made by the police authorities in a further attempt to clarify the facts complained of by the applicant. Therefore, in view of the seriousness of the issues at stake, the Court does not consider that the applicant should have waited for the outcome of any further investigation by the ICS, as in any event the police authorities had not taken any further investigative measures since the staying of the proceedings by the district prosecutor on 13 May 2013 (see\u00a0mutatis mutandis, Barakhoyev v. Russia, no. 8516/08, \u00a7 38, 17\u00a0January\u00a02017).",

However, the Court notes that the CCP did not provide for any right to appeal against a prosecutor\u2019s decision staying a criminal investigation. Furthermore, in its decision of 18 January 2013 the Constitutional Court noted that there was no remedy under domestic law against a prosecutor\u2019s decision staying an investigation. Moreover, under Article 326 of the CCP, the investigation could only be reopened by a prosecutor\u2019s decision. In view of the above considerations, and also noting that the Government did not submit any domestic case-law, the Court has serious doubts as to whether the domestic courts would indeed have admitted for examination an appeal by the applicant against the decision of 13 May 2013. Taking the above-mentioned factors into consideration, the Court considers that the remedy in issue would not have provided the applicant with any adequate redress for his grievances.",
