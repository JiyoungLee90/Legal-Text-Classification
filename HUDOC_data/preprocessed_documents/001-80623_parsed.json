The administrative investigation was assigned to an officer serving at the police's sub-directorate of administrative investigations. As part of the investigation the investigating police officer summoned as witnesses the three police officers who had been involved in the incident. The various witness statements available were studied but no further inquiry was conducted regarding the gunshots fired or the general legitimacy of the initial identity check. It was observed in the report of the administrative investigation issued on 9 August 2002 that \u201cpersons involved in the incident refused to comply with the police officers' orders and, furthermore, one of them [Zelilof] had intended to \u201ccontrol\u201d the police officers who were performing the identity check, considering arbitrarily and cheekily that he had an inexistent right .... Taking into account also the unprovoked, violent and disproportionate assault by other individuals on the police officers, it is concluded that the police officers properly assessed the relevant circumstances and acted correctly. The brawl between the police officers and the individuals in question was inevitable. The police officers used necessary physical force against the civilians, mainly in order to defend their physical integrity that was under imminent threat. There was a clear danger that the police officers' firearms would be snatched by the individuals concerned in the context of a disproportionate assault by ten to fifteen of them on the police officers. Thus, apart from the injuries inflicted on the police officers, which could easily have been more serious, there was an imminent danger that firearms would be used by civilians in an extreme way (fatal shooting of the police officers, etc.)\u201d.",

The Court acknowledges that the three police officers must have felt insecure and vulnerable as they were suddenly outnumbered by a group of persons assaulting them verbally and physically. In the Court's view, this is an important factor that could justify the firing of gunshots by Police Officer Apostolidis in order to intimidate them. However, the Court considers that acts of self-defence against the persons who ran out from the caf\u00e9 could not, in the specific circumstances of the case, also justify the infliction of serious injuries on the applicant, who, by that time, was not the one threatening the physical integrity of the police officers. The Court considers that weight should be given in this respect to the significant difference in extent of the applicant's and the police officers' injuries: according to the medical reports and certificates, the former was hospitalized for five days and was expected to convalesce for eighteen to twenty-one days, whereas the three police officers, allegedly assaulted by a mob of ten to fifteen people, were admitted to hospital late on 23 February and were discharged the next day.",

In particular, the Court notes that the Government claimed that twenty-eight witnesses were examined during the investigation. Nonetheless, the Court observes that the administrative inquiry included excerpts from the testimonies given mainly by the applicant, two of his acquaintances present at the scene and some other individuals accused of assaulting the police officers. It is also apparent from the relevant report that the agent based his conclusions mainly on the testimonies given by the police officers involved in the incident. He thus observed, initially, that the violent behaviour transpired from the testimonies of the persons who had provoked the illegal acts. However, he did not consider these testimonies to be credible for two reasons: firstly, because they undoubtedly reflected personal opinions and assessments that would be of assistance to the accused during the trial; and secondly, because they could be considered as constituting defence tactics by the applicant's acquaintances, who were already facing grave criminal charges and whose depositions aimed to damage the credibility of the police officers. However, the administrative inquiry did accept as such the credibility of the police officers' testimonies by considering that \u201cnot all the testimonies have been proven; on the contrary, the police officers (involved in the events) have denied them. The latter insisted in their testimonies that there had been no violence in the police station and that all the injuries sustained by the civilians had been provoked before their transfer to the police station\u201d. In the Court's view, the administrative inquiry applied different standards when assessing the testimonies as those given by the civilians involved in the events were recognised as subjective but not those given by the police officers. However, the credibility of the latter testimonies should also have been questioned as the administrative proceedings had also sought to establish whether they were liable on disciplinary grounds (see Ognyanova and Choban v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a046317/99, \u00a7\u00a099, 23 February 2006).",

However, it drew a negative conclusion only in respect of the applicant as it accepted that this omission revealed the latter's intention to prevent the disclosure of new evidence facilitating the investigation of the case. As far as the police officers were concerned, it was accepted that \u201cthe disciplinary liability that derived from that omission was obvious in the present case but was of minor importance in the context of the case as a whole\u201d.",

However, where it is alleged \u2013 as here \u2013 that a violent act was motivated by racial prejudice, such an approach would amount to requiring the respondent Government to prove the absence of a particular subjective attitude on the part of the person concerned. While in the legal systems of many countries proof of the discriminatory effect of a policy or decision will dispense with the need to prove intent in respect of alleged discrimination in employment or the provision of services, that approach is difficult to transpose to a case where it is alleged that an act of violence was racially motivated (see Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0157).",

I also agree with the basic reasoning preceding this conclusion, according to which \u201cregard being had to the applicant's allegations, which were corroborated by the medical reports, and to the circumstances in which the applicant sustained the injuries, the Court considers that the Government have not furnished convincing or credible arguments which would provide a basis to explain or justify the degree of force used against the applicant\u201d (see paragraph 51).",
