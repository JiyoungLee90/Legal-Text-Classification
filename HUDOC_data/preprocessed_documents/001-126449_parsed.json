Turkey (dec.), nos.\u00a046506/99, 46569/99, 46570/99 and 46939/99, 4 September 2001; Natoli v.

Turkey [GC], no.\u00a044774/98, ECHR 2005-XI, the Government contended that Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention was not applicable to the applicant\u2019s case, given that the domestic legal requirements in respect of prison education were not met in the absence of the required minimum number of students. They argued that the applicant had already completed the compulsory education requirement of ten school grades by the time of his incarceration, and that therefore the essence of his right to education had not been impaired. In addition, following his request of 21 September 2009 addressed to the Rahova Prison authorities to be allowed to continue his high-school studies, he was informed by the authorities that he could not do so at that time. Even if he had been transferred to a detention facility for young people and minors, the authorities would have been under a duty to enrol him unconditionally only in courses that would have allowed him to complete the minimum number of school years required by law. Also, following his request of 28\u00a0July\u00a02011, the Jilava Prison authorities granted his request to be enrolled on courses for senior high-school students, but the applicant applied for a transfer to Bistri\u0163a Prison, where he was enrolled on and attended a course training skilled workers for the food industry and which was in line with the studies undertaken by the applicant prior to his incarceration. Moreover, an obligation on the State to arrange a course for the applicant would have imposed an excessive financial burden on the authorities.",
