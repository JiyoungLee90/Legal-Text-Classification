Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection regarding exhaustion of domestic remedies. As to the Government\u2019s contention that the applicant failed to comply with the six months time-limit, the Court recalls that, in assessing whether or not a trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8\u00a0February 1996, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996I). Furthermore, in the Okul decision, referred to by the Government, the Court had referred to Article\u00a0324 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that, if the Court of Cassation holds a hearing, it should deliver its decision within one week following that hearing.
