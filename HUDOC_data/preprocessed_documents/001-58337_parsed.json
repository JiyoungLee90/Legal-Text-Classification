He argued that in his case, where there had been an unlawful deprivation of property, Law no. 112/1995 \u2013 which concerned lawful expropriations \u2013 did not apply. Accordingly, his only means of protecting his right of property was an action for recovery of possession. However, since he had already brought such an action, and since the Court of First Instance, in a final judgment of 9 December 1993, had held him to be the owner of the house, he believed himself to be debarred from bringing a fresh action for recovery of possession. Consequently, he sought a declaration that he was the owner of the whole house and stated that he was not seeking compensation under Law no. 112/1995.",

The Court further notes that, as of that date, the applicant ceased to pay rent on the flat he was occupying in the house and that from April 1994 until April 1996 the applicant paid land tax on the house. The Court observes that the effect of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice was to deprive the applicant of all the fruits of the final judgment in his favour by holding that the State had demonstrated its title to the house under the nationalisation decree. Following that decision, the applicant was informed that the house would again be classified as State property with effect from April 1996. In consequence of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice, the applicant was accordingly deprived of the rights of ownership of the house which had been vested in him by virtue of the final judgment in his favour. In particular, he was no longer able to sell, devise, donate or otherwise dispose of the property.

The existing case-law indicates that the notion of a right to a court, or of access to a court, is not by any means limited to the stage of instituting proceedings or having a charge determined through a judicial procedure but also includes the right to a court that can effectively impose its verdict or decision and administer justice unobstructed by external interferences.

But his right to a court became illusory when the Procurator-General and the Supreme Court intervened, applying Article 330 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and effaced the judgment of the first-instance court and its beneficial consequences. When a legal system accords a court the power to issue final judgments but then allows its decisions to be annulled by subsequent procedures, not only does legal certainty suffer, but the very existence of that court is called into question since, in essence, it has no power at all definitively to determine a legal issue.",

This is all the more so where, as here, the judgment of the Bucharest Court of First Instance had not only become final and enforceable but had actually been enforced by the relevant authorities which had ordered the house to be restored to the applicant, an order which had been complied with several months before the application for annulment was lodged.",
