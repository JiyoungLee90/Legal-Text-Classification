The new CCrP and the Transitional Law, adopted after the applicant's conviction, afforded the applicant the possibility to appeal under the new rules of criminal procedure against the final judgment delivered under the old rules of criminal procedure.

Take, for example, two recent judgments delivered by the Chamber. In the Abbasov case the Court stated: \u201cAs it was found above, the proceedings before the Supreme Court did not comply with the requirement of fairness as the applicant was deprived of the opportunity to exercise any of his rights under Article 6 of the Convention. In such circumstances, the Court considers that a retrial or the reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation in the present case. It is not for the Court to indicate how any new trial (or reexamination of the applicant's appeal) is to proceed and what form it is to take. The respondent State remains free, subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, to choose the means by which it will discharge its obligation to put the applicant, as far as possible, in the position he would have been in had the requirements of the Convention not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26 October 1984, Series\u00a0A no. 85, p. 16, \u00a7\u00a012), provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court's judgment (see Assanidze, cited above, \u00a7 202, with further references)\u201d (Abbasov v. Azerbaijan, no. 24271/05, \u00a7 41-42, 17 January 2008).",

Italy, no.\u00a067972/01, \u00a7\u00a086, ECHR 2004IV).\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes, in this connection, that Article 413 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\u00a0of the Russian Federation provides that criminal proceedings may be reopened if the Court finds a violation of the Convention\u201d (Shulepov v.
