It is incumbent on the parties to verify the accuracy of the statement of facts and to submit such documents, which are in their possession or which are readily available to the State authorities concerned, as are necessary to complement the description of the circumstances of the case (see Rule 44A of the Rules of Court and Kalinin, cited above, \u00a7 15, with further references).",

In earlier cases against Russia concerning the conditions of detention in correctional colonies, the Court has considered the detention in overcrowded dormitories where the personal space afforded to the detainees fell below the domestic standard of two square metres, if only at night, to be one of the decisive factors weighing in favour of finding a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see Sergey Babushkin v.
