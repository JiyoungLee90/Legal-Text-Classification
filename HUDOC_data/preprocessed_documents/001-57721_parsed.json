The Government said at the Commission hearing that their record of the first interview with Mr Hartley showed that he was questioned about terrorist activities in a specific small, geographical area, and about his involvement with the Provisional IRA.

It was necessary that the arresting officer suspected the person he was arresting to be a terrorist; otherwise the arrest was unlawful. He could form that suspicion on the basis of information given to him by his superior officer, but he could not arrest under section 11 on the instructions of a superior officer who held the necessary suspicion unless the arresting officer himself held that suspicion. Lord Roskill, with whom the other Law Lords agreed, stated that the suspicion need not be a reasonable suspicion but it had to be honestly held. The requirement of a suspicion in the mind of a constable was a subjective test. That being so, the courts could only enquire as to the bona fides of the existence of the suspicion.

Having regard to all the circumstances and to the facts and information before the Court, including in the case of Mr Fox and Ms Campbell the fact that they had previously been involved in and convicted of terrorist activities, we are satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion justifying the arrest and detention of the applicants in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c). We also see no reason to doubt that the applicants were detained and questioned with a view to criminal proceedings if sufficient and usable evidence had been obtained. It is true that they were released without any charges being brought against them, but this in no way invalidates the measures taken since it is the purpose of such investigation to find out whether the suspicion is confirmed and supported by any additional evidence.",
