The lack of details in the description of the injuries recorded at the IVS made it impossible to determine the time of their infliction. As regards the injuries recorded at SIZO-1, they could have been inflicted on 19 March 2007 and very unlikely prior to that date. The injuries had been inflicted by a hard blunt object. The expert did not find it possible to give an opinion as to whether the injures could have been inflicted by electric current. The applicant had received at least one traumatic impact to his face and no less than three traumatic impacts to his torso. The expert found it difficult to determine the number of traumatic impacts to the applicant\u2019s upper and lower limbs in view of the multiplicity of the injuries. The injuries were located within the reach of the first applicant\u2019s own hand (except for the bruise on the left shoulder blade) and could have therefore been selfinflicted.

It also noted complaints by the applicants\u2019 coaccused V.Z. and A.S. that the first applicant had allegedly threatened them with physical retaliation. In his appeal against those decisions the first applicant\u2019s lawyer noted that the complaints by V.Z. and A.S. had not been read out and examined at the hearing, that they appeared to be meaningless in view of the fact that V.Z. and A.S. had themselves been detained pending trial and that the first applicant had lodged a counter-complaint with the police that they had slandered him. According to the first applicant, V.Z. and A.S. had not confirmed their complaints in the course of the relevant inquiry. In upholding the Regional Court\u2019s decisions the Supreme Court did not address the arguments concerning the complaints by V.Z. and A.S. The Regional Court further issued detention extension orders similar to the previous orders on 11\u00a0June 2008 (concerning the first applicant, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on 11\u00a0September 2008) and 16 June 2008 (concerning the second applicant).",

On 27\u00a0January 2009 the Supreme Court upheld the decision of 16 September 2008 on appeal. Essentially the same reasons were relied on in extending the applicants\u2019 detention in the Regional Court\u2019s decision of 25 February 2009, upheld on 10 June 2009 by the Supreme Court, which noted, without providing any details, that some victims in the case had expressed fears for their safety and that some defendants had abused their rights delaying the proceedings.",

It was noted that identification parades at the preliminary investigation had been conducted in a way that the visualisation of some victims by the accused had been excluded, in order to ensure the victims\u2019 safety. According to the first applicant, it was not shown that this had been requested by the victims.\u00a0The Regional Court also referred to alleged pressure on a coaccused and witnesses by the first applicant by way of written instructions as to what statements to give at the trial.

The first applicant\u2019s wrist injuries could have been inflicted by handcuffs with further squeezing.\u00a0The witness statements suggest that the first applicant had no injuries before his arrest and that he had injuries the next day, and that he was seen being delivered a blow, having shackles on his hands pushed on by the police officers and lying on the floor in one of the UBOP offices and was heard screaming at the UBOP premises (see paragraphs 21 and 34 above). There is no indication in the official records, in particular in the records of their arrest, that the applicants had any injuries when they were arrested.

This makes it doubtful whether the applicants\u2019 examination was complete and accurate (according to the second applicant, he was not examined fully undressed, see paragraph 13 above), and explains that the applicants could not freely describe the police ill-treatment to the expert. Despite being alerted by the first applicant in March 2007 about the alleged use of electric shocks by the police officers, the investigating authority obtained the relevant forensic medical expert\u2019s report only three years and eleven months later. According to that report, the expert did not find it possible to give an opinion as to whether the first applicant\u2019s injuries could have been caused as a result of a contact with a current-carrying conductor, as was alleged by the applicant (see paragraph 18 above). No forensic medical examination was carried out in respect of the similar allegations by the second applicant. Instead, the investigating authority referred to a telephone conversation with the expert in rejecting the second applicant\u2019s allegations (see paragraph 24 above).",

The Government stated that the decision by the governor of SIZO3 on 20 May 2009 to place the applicant in solitary confinement had been made because of the lack of detainees who could be detained together with the applicant in compliance with Section 33 of the Pre-trial Detention Act on the separation of prisoners. Under Section 32 \u00a7 2 of the Act, no approval by the prosecutor had been required for that decision because the separation of prisoners could not otherwise be enforced. The Government argued that the applicant had received \u201cindividual consultations and psycho-correctional work\u201d sessions.",

He noted that solitary confinement was used as a punishment for disciplinary violations, and that he had thus been punished for an indefinite duration for a violation which he had never committed. On his admission to SIZO-3 his personal TV set had been seized and the provision of newspapers had been poor. His complaints to the prosecutor and the trial court about the conditions of his detention had been to no avail. According to the applicant, no monitoring of his physical and mental condition in order to ensure its compatibility with continued solitary confinement had been carried out.",
