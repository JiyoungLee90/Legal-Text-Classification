To control the crowd the police cordon forced the protestors to remain within the barriers; there were numerous clashes between the two sides.

In the absence of other grievances, the Court is not in a position to rule that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment (see, mutatis mutandis, Topal v. the Republic of Moldova (dec.), no. 37509/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-38, 18 March 2014).

The Court reiterates that while Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention is mostly concerned with the existence of a lawful basis for detention within criminal proceedings, Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention deals with the possible justification for such detention. Moreover, according to the Court\u2019s established case-law under the latter provision, the persistence of a reasonable suspicion is a sine qua non for the validity of continued detention (see Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova [GC], no. 23755/07, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2016 (extracts)).

However, the domestic courts did not establish the particular circumstances of the applicant\u2019s behaviour and dismissed his arguments about excessive use of force by the police as unfounded. It appears that no attempts were made to find and question the protester who was the alleged victim of ill-treatment by the police and whom the applicant tried to protect.

The main justification put forward by the Government for such a harsh sentence was the serious risk of civil unrest existing at the time, in particular that there was a threat to political stability and public order. The gravity of the punishment under Article 212 of the Criminal Code was thus attributable to the general context of the applicant\u2019s assault on the policeman (already imputed under Article 318 of the Code), not to the harm he thus inflicted. Regard being had to the other acts imputed to the applicant under Article 212, it transpires that his staying at the site of the rally and building a line of metal barriers against the advancing police accounted for an additional two years and three months to his prison term.",

In the present case, the applicant was affected by the brutality of the police officers, who had severely beaten a protester using truncheons. The applicant\u2019s behaviour, in my view, was not violent. Instead, he tried to stop the violence, so he grabbed the police officer\u2019s hand and pulled it off a protester. Therefore, the present case should be differentiated from the cases of Barabanov, cited above, and Zimin v. Russia (nos. 63686/13 and 60894/14, 30 January 2018).",
