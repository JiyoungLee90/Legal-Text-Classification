It was the task of the city council\u2019s specialist departments to lay down the practical arrangements for implementing the decision. That did not happen.

The authors of the article alleged that these two people had, on the city council\u2019s behalf, signed a contract with a company for the service of impounding illegally parked vehicles; the contract had been signed without any legal basis and had disregarded a decision by the city council. Those dealings had been discovered by the city\u2019s , and this had apparently caused the city council to find pretexts for terminating the contract.

Firstly, the case concerns freedom of the press, which, according to our Court\u2019s settled case-law, plays a \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d role in a democracy. Secondly, there was an indisputable public interest in ascertaining whether a contract to perform a local public service had been concluded lawfully and whether there had been any corruption involved. Such an interest is a factor carrying significant weight (see, for example, Thorgeir Thorgeirson v.\u00a0Iceland, judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 28, \u00a7 68). Thirdly, there are clearly no grounds here for applying the well-known case-law (Lingens, Oberschlick, Jerusalem, etc.) to the effect that politicians, such as the former deputy mayor, enjoy less protection than private individuals, because the criminal complaint against the applicants was lodged by R.M. alone; however, the article in issue also, and perhaps above all, criticised the conduct of this local politician (who had the same interest as R.M. in securing the journalists\u2019 conviction), and the context in which the whole episode took place was very much a political one, which further heightens the public interest in a debate concerning the circumstances in which the contract was signed. Fourthly, disparaging though it was, the cartoon \u2013 on which the domestic courts placed considerable importance \u2013 took the form of a caricature, which, etymologically speaking, is a loaded or distorted image. Satirical newspapers, which make extensive use of them, should not be discouraged. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, \u201cthe nature and severity of the penalties imposed are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference\u201d (see, for example, S\u00fcrek v.\u00a0 (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, \u00a7 64, ECHR 1999-IV, or Perna v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2003-V). Here we do not agree with the majority, who attach weight to the pardon granted to the convicted journalists. A pardon is a discretionary favour dependent on a prerogative order. It dispenses offenders from having to serve the sentence imposed on them, but does not erase their conviction. Sentencing the applicants to imprisonment was in itself excessive. Moreover, for more than a year the sentence was very real, had even been upheld by the Supreme Court and hung over the applicants\u2019 heads like the sword of Damocles. The other professional and pecuniary sanctions were likewise disproportionately heavy. Although one may conclude, as the majority did, that the prohibition on the applicants\u2019 working as journalists had no real consequences, that penalty, which has serious implications in terms of freedom of the press, was not remitted.",

Overall, however, the balance was tipped slightly too far; in our opinion, there was no \u201cpressing social need\u201d justifying the lengths to which the Romanian courts went.",
