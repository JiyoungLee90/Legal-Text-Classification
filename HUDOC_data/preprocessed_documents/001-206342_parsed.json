The Court therefore found a violation of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(c) of the Convention (see Shilbergs v.\u00a0Russia, no. 20075/03, \u00a7\u00a7 120-24, 17 December 2009; and Shulepov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a015435/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a034-39, 26 June 2008). Moreover, the exercise of the right to legal assistance takes on particular significance where the applicant communicates with the courtroom by video link (see Golubev v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no.\u00a026260/02, 9\u00a0November 2006, and Shulepov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035). Also, the mere assigning of counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he or she may afford an accused (see Sakhnovskiy v. Russia [GC], no. 21272/03, \u00a7\u00a095, 2\u00a0November 2010, with further references). In this context, decisive consideration should be given to whether the domestic authorities made sufficient arrangements for contact between the lawyer and the applicant that respected the rights of the defence (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 107, and Ichetovkina and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a030) and whether and how the respective Government explained that it was impossible to make different arrangements (Sakhnovskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106).",

He participated in the hearing via video link and was assisted by a newly appointed lawyer. The Court is therefore of the view, bearing also in mind the appellate court wide powers in determining his appeal, that the interests of justice required the judicial authorities to ascertain prior to embarking on the merits of the appeal whether the applicant had had adequate time and opportunity to consult his newly appointed lawyer. However, nothing in the case file materials indicates that the appeal court did so (compare and contrast Sesler v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a067772/10, \u00a7 22, 1 September 2020). In this context, there is no need for the Court to examine whether the applicant had properly raised his complaints about insufficient time to prepare his defence before the appeal court. The Court considers that his conduct could not of itself relieve the authorities of their obligation to take steps to guarantee him an effective defence (see Shekhov v. Russia, no. 12440/04, \u00a7 42, 19 June 2014, with further references). The Government\u2019s preliminary objection should therefore be rejected.",
