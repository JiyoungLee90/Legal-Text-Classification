Although the court was required to examine quite an extensive amount of documentary evidence, the issues before the court were not complicated enough to cause an extensive prolongation of the consideration of the applicant's case.

In particular, no hearings were postponed for the sole reason of the applicant's failure to appear. Although it was always the applicant who initiated the appellate proceedings, the Court notes that such argument did not justify the lengthy consideration of the case by the first instance court as in the present case the major part of proceedings took place in the first instance court (almost four years). Furthermore, the applicant's cassation appeal was sent to the Supreme Court only one year and a half after it was lodged since the court erroneously refused to prolong a time-limit for its submission.",
