It is true that these delays may have been imputable partly to the applicant who had insisted on those persons\u2019 attendance as part of his defence, the authorities having only responded to his demands to safeguard his defence rights. Nevertheless, ultimately the applicant\u2019s case was decided without hearing the foreign complainants. The question arises therefore whether that decision could have been taken earlier (also see paragraphs 53-54 below). Moreover, the Court notes that the investigating authorities were found at fault by the domestic courts as a result of their failure to duly summon certain victims and witnesses. The need to correct those errors warranted quashing the judgment of 24 August 1999 and caused a further delay in the final determination of the case (see, in particular, paragraphs 27, 30 and 31 above).",

The applicant complained that 18 foreign complainants and one foreign witness - tourists who had been allegedly subjected to the applicant\u2019s unlawful demands - had not been examined at trial. The Court considers that the complainants in the proceedings should, for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention, also be regarded as witnesses - a term which enjoys an autonomous interpretation - because their statements, as recorded by the police, were used in evidence to ground the applicant\u2019s conviction (ibid.).",

Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s conviction was not based solely or to a decisive extent on the foreign tourists\u2019 complaints. Their statements were corroborated by other evidence which the applicant had been fully able to contest in open court. In particular, six witnesses were examined by the trial court and the parties in relation to the bribery charges, and five witnesses were questioned on the fraud charges. Therefore, the foreigners\u2019 failure to appear did not necessitate discontinuing the prosecution, even more so as the applicant\u2019s counsel had himself asked the trial court to proceed with the case without hearing them (paragraphs 25 and 30 above). Furthermore, there is no evidence that the applicant\u2019s conviction was based on any document which had been written in a foreign language and which had not been translated into Lithuanian (paragraph 35 above). Therefore the Court is satisfied that the domestic courts\u2019 handling of the evidence did not breach the principle of the equality of arms or the applicant\u2019s defence rights (see the Scheper decision cited above, where the substantial evidence of three alleged victims of rape, who had failed to appear at trial, had been used to found a conviction in conformity with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention).",

In addition, the Court notes that there is no evidence of a statement by a State official published by the press, which was capable of raising issues of the presumption of innocence or the impartiality of courts in relation to the applicant\u2019s case, even more so as the charges against him were determined by professional judges, and not a jury (see, Butkevi\u010dius v.
