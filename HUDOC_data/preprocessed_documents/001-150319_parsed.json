On the following day he had been informally questioned by the investigator at the prosecutor\u2019s office and his confession statements had been arbitrarily recorded on an \u201cexplanation\u201d form. Only after obtaining the \u201cexplanation\u201d had the investigative authorities regularised his status as a suspect and a detainee, notified him of his procedural rights and provided a legal-aid lawyer. However, when questioned as a suspect in that lawyer\u2019s presence he had been afraid to protest his innocence since he had believed that a lawyer appointed by the police would not be willing to represent his interests in good faith and that unless he cooperated with the investigation he would be subjected to further ill-treatment once he returned to the police detention facility. Moreover, at the material time he was being questioned as a suspect of non-aggravated murder only. He could not foresee that the investigation, which already had substantial information on the details of the crime, would subsequently reclassify the charges as aggravated murder, rape and robbery. Once the charges had been so reclassified and he had obtained access to a privately hired lawyer, he had retracted his confessions and pleaded innocent. However, the confessions had been decisive for his conviction, as there was no other direct evidence of his involvement in the offence. As the initial confessions had been obtained in breach of basic procedural guarantees and had affected his further defence strategy, he considered that the domestic judicial authorities should have excluded them from the body of evidence.",

Moreover, he had requested the Supreme Court to summon his first lawyer, M., to take part in the cassation proceedings. This showed that he had full confidence in her.

Thus, Article 6 \u2013\u00a0especially paragraph 3 thereof \u2013 may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions (see Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 275; \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2005IV; Salduz v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2008). The Court further recalls that the guarantees in paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair hearing set forth in paragraph 1 of this provision which must be taken into account in any assessment of the fairness of proceedings (Martin v. Estonia, no. 35985/09, \u00a7 94, 30 May 2013). In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see, as recent authorities, Taxquet v.\u00a0Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2010, with further references therein; Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a026766/05 and 22228/06, ECHR 2011; Martin, ibid.).",

There is also no proof that the initial confessions given by the applicant without a lawyer were extracted by ill-treatment or under the threat thereof. On the other hand, the Court notes that at the time when the applicant volunteered his original confessions, he might not have been fully aware of their significance, as the initial charges against him concerned non-aggravated murder only. Once they were reclassified as aggravated murder, rape and robbery he chose, possibly on the advice of his lawyer, to remain silent and subsequently retracted his confessions. What is even more important is that the original confessions which, as noted above, were obtained in breach of the applicant\u2019s right to legal assistance, formed part of the case file. Thus, they affected the investigation strategy and set the framework within which the applicant\u2019s further defence had to be mounted. It follows that regardless of whether the applicant chose to retract or maintain these confessions, the initial breach of his right to defence could not be remedied by the mere fact that he was subsequently provided with legal assistance.

Italy, 12 February 1985, \u00a7 27, Series A no.\u00a089). The personal attendance of the defendant does not take on the same crucial significance for an appeal hearing as it does for a trial hearing (see, for example, Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, \u00a7 106, Series A no. 168).",

Any derogation from this principle should be exceptional and subjected to restrictive interpretation (see, for example, S\u00e1ndor Lajos Kiss v. Hungary, no. 26958/05, \u00a7\u00a022, 29 September 2009, and Popa and T\u0103n\u0103sescu v. Romania, no. 19946/04, \u00a7\u00a046, 10 April 2012). In order to decide whether the restriction was compatible with the Convention, regard must be had, among other considerations, to the specific features of the proceedings in question and to the manner in which the applicant\u2019s interests were actually presented and protected before the appellate court, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it and of their importance to the appellant (see Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. , \u00a7\u00a062, ECHR 2006XII). The personal participation of the defendant in the appeal hearing takes on particular importance where the appellate review concerns an assessment of their personality and character (see, for example, Kremzow v. Austria, 21 September 1993, \u00a7\u00a067, Series A no. 268B), or where they claim that they did not commit the offences imputed to them and an appellate court is called upon to make a full assessment of the question of their guilt or innocence (see, among other authorities, Dondarini v. San Marino, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 27, 6 July 2004). Further issues of importance are the extent to which the conviction bears social stigma and whether the defendant\u2019s personal liberty is at stake (see, among other authorities, Belziuk v. Poland, 25 March 1998, \u00a7\u00a038, Reports 1998II; Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2006XIV; Suurip\u00e4\u00e4 v.

He asked the Supreme Court to quash the conviction and remit the case for fresh investigation. Consequently, the issues to be determined by the Supreme Court in deciding the applicant\u2019s liability were both factual and legal.

If the newly introduced time-limit was to be calculated from the date of receipt of the first version of the appealed judgment on 21 December 2005, the new provision would have been applied retroactively in the applicant\u2019s case, as the new rule which entered into force on 7 February 2006 required him to submit his request to participate in the proceedings by 21 January, that is, before the legislative amendment had come into force. Moreover, under the new law it seems that the Supreme Court, while not bound to allow the applicant to attend the hearing in the case of a request out of time, could still have used its discretion to accede to the applicant\u2019s request. If the time-limit was to be calculated from the date of receipt of the final version of the appealed judgment, on 20 January 2006, it had not yet expired when the applicant lodged his request for attendance.
