In the Government\u2019s submission, however, this apparent limitation in the law has to be read in the light of the actual practice followed whereby the advice also extended to the issue of detention and was invariably followed by the referring officer (see paragraph 16, final sub-paragraph above). This \"standard procedure\" meant, so it was argued, that the auditeur-militair in fact decided since his advice as to whether to detain or not was treated as a \"binding recommendation\" by the officer who had the formal power of decision. In sum, the Government maintained that \"the substance should prevail over the form\".",

Nonetheless, the Court, like the Commission (see paragraph 63 of the report), is unable to accept the Government\u2019s reasoning. Admittedly, in determining Convention rights one must frequently look beyond the appearances and the language used and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see, for example, in relation to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (art. 5-1), the Van Droogenbroeck judgment of 24 June 1982, Series A no. 50, p. 20, \u00a7 38). However, formal, visible requirements stated in the \"law\" are especially important for the identification of the judicial authority empowered to decide on the liberty of the individual in view of the confidence which that authority must inspire in the public in a democratic society (see, mutatis mutandis, the Piersack judgment of 1 October 1982, Series A no. 53, p. 14, \u00a7 30 (a)). There was no official directive or even policy instruction to auditeurs-militair and referring officers to interpret the Military Code in this way, only a purely internal practice of no binding force that could at any moment lawfully be departed from. That is not sufficient to constitute authority given by \"law\" to exercise the requisite \"judicial power\" contemplated by Article 5 \u00a7 3 (art. 5-3) (see the final part of the passage from the Schiesser judgment cited above at paragraph 41).",

He would thereby become a committed party to any criminal proceedings subsequently brought against the serviceman on whose detention he was advising at the stage prior to referral for trial. In sum, the auditeur-militair could not be \"independent of the parties\" (see the extract from the Schiesser judgment quoted above at paragraph 41) at this preliminary stage precisely because he was liable to become one of the parties at the next stage of the procedure (see the judgment of today\u2019s date in the case of Duinhof and Duijf, Series A no. 79, \u00a7 38).",
