In this connection it recalls that, because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures which may interfere with property rights. Where the legislature has made a choice by enacting laws which it considers to be in the general interest, the possible existence of alternative solutions does not in itself nullify the justification behind the contested legislation. Accordingly, States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in this sphere (see, Malama v. Greece, no. 43622/98, \u00a7 46, ECHR\u00a02001-II). It is not for the Court to say whether the legislation represented the best solution, provided that the authorities remain within the bounds of that margin (see, mutatis mutandis, Mellacher and Others v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 19\u00a0December 1989, Series A no. 169, p. 28, \u00a7 53).\u00a0",

Thus the Act pursued the legitimate aim of safeguarding the lawfulness of legal transactions. It promoted the principles of a democratic society and provided redress for past injustices. In these circumstances, and having regard to the State's margin of appreciation, the Court accepts that the deprivation of property experienced by the applicants served not only the interests of the original owners of the house in question, but also the general interests of society as a whole (see, mutatis mutandis, Pinc and Pincov\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 36548/97, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2002VIII).",

Instead, the Court observes, on the one hand, that the Act did not require compensatory accommodation to be provided and that the applicants were reimbursed the original purchase price, fixed in January 1986 but not paid until July 2003, by which time the sum had obviously suffered considerable devaluation.

The latter would then be required to compensate any difference between the price at the time of the submission of their restoration request and the original purchase price. The Court notes in this regard that the proceedings instituted against the applicants by the former owners, in which the applicants made a counterclaim, are still pending before the District Court (paragraph 9 above). In addition, the decision of the District Court by which the applicants were awarded interest for the delays in payment of the purchase price since 18 January 1999 by the Ministry of Finance is the subject of pending appellate proceedings (paragraphs 32-33 above).",
