It held that there was no doubt that the applicant had been tried before an impartial tribunal established by law and that the trial had been fair. The fact that the Attorney General (in his role as public prosecutor) could choose the forum in which to try the accused did not give him the powers of a judge in that instance. In essence the public prosecutor had no control over the finding of guilt or innocence of an individual. The situation would have been different had the public prosecutor been involved in the determination of an individual\u2019s guilt. In reference to domestic jurisprudence, it added that the means by which a case was brought before a court could not impair its independence. In so far as an individual was aware of the minimum and maximum punishments established by law at the time when the crime was committed, there could be no violation of Articles 6 or 7 of the Convention. Moreover, the applicant had not shown in what way this decision had affected him. Nevertheless, noting that the Attorney General (in his role as public prosecutor) exercised his own discretion in choosing the appropriate forum also according to the seriousness of the crime, the Constitutional Court considered that it would be desirable, for the sake of fairness and transparency, that criteria to be used by the public prosecutor should be established.",

He considered that any assumption to the contrary would be in contrast with the wording of the law. Indeed in the case of The  v.  Chircop (decided by the Criminal Court on 11 January 2008) the court had held that, as the law stood, it could only give effect to the recommendation of clemency made by the jury by imposing the minimum sentence established by law for the Criminal Court, but it could not impose a sentence below the minimum.

For example, the applicant made reference to a domestic case whereby two persons (M. and G.) had been charged with possession of the same quantity of drugs with intention to supply. Following the decision of the Attorney General, M. had been tried before the Court of Magistrates, where he had been sentenced to fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment. G., however, had been tried before the Criminal Court, where he had eventually been given a twenty-year prison sentence which was reduced on appeal to nine years (The Republic of Malta v Godfrey Ellul, decided by the Court of Criminal Appeal () on 17\u00a0March 2005). In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal had noted that \u201cWhile the difference in the punishment existed, there was little to be said about it - the Court of Magistrates had considered, according to its discretion, fifteen months as a fair punishment, indeed the parameters of punishment of that court were much lower\u201d.",

If the decision was that the accused should be tried in the Criminal Court, the inquiry (before the Court of Criminal Inquiry) was carried out by the Executive Police, under the supervision of the Attorney General, to ensure that all the evidence was produced. If the Court of Criminal Inquiry decided that there was sufficient evidence, the Attorney General issued a bill of indictment. At that stage, taking account of the evidence, the Attorney General could also send the case back to be tried by the Court of Magistrates instead of the Criminal Court if this appeared to be more suitable. Thus, his decision could be subject to change on the basis of the inquiry. However, once the accused had been charged, the Attorney General could only issue counter-orders to the benefit of the accused, but not to his or her prejudice. Therefore, in order for an accused to be tried before the Criminal Court, the Court of Criminal Inquiry must have issued an Article 6-compliant decision to commit for trial, in respect of which the Attorney General had no say.",

While acknowledging that the Attorney General had links with the executive, the Government argued that he was not a member of the tribunal and could not therefore participate in any finding of guilt or innocence and therefore there could be no breach of the independence or impartiality requirement. Indeed the Attorney General did not undertake the investigation of the crime, nor did he have the power to issue a detention order (with reference to Huber v. Switzerland, 23\u00a0October 1990, Series A no. 188), or have any other judicial function, but exclusively performed the function of prosecutor. They contended that the Attorney General enjoyed independence from the executive in his functions as a prosecutor as laid down in the Constitution (see \u201cRelevant Domestic Law\u201d). The Government compared the impugned decision to that which a prosecutor made in his or her administrative capacity in respect of the offences with which the accused was to be charged. They argued that this discretion was necessary given that the circumstances which enabled the identification of more serious drug-related crimes varied considerably and could not be exhaustively listed a priori. Therefore, the system allowed for the examination of cases on an individual basis rather than providing for pre-established categories. This discretion served a legitimate and proportionate aim given the difference between the cost to society of ordinary drug-related crimes and more serious large-scale drug dealing.",

Attorney General, decided by the First Hall of the  in its constitutional jurisdiction on 5 July 2005 - referring to The  v. Grech, decided by the  on 27 September 1990) finding that such a discretion (although in relation to section 22 of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance \u2013 but still comparable to the one at issue) did not impair the fairness of the proceedings. They further pointed out that, according to unspecified case-law of the Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction and the case of The Republic of Malta v. Mario Camilleri (decided on 23 January 2001 by the Criminal Court), the Criminal Court retained the power to impose sentences below the minimum established by law and to apply Article 21 of the Criminal Code (see \u201cRelevant Domestic Law\u201d) on constitutional grounds where it found that the Attorney General had abused his power when he referred the case to the Criminal Court. This was so, despite the exclusion of the application of this Article to cases of drug trafficking under the ordinary law, particularly in view of the proviso to that exception (see \u201cRelevant Domestic Law\u201d). In the Government\u2019s submission, it was therefore a possibility that the minimum punishment before the Criminal Court would not be handed down. The Government further referred to the case of Claudio Porsenna v. the Attorney General (decided by the First Hall of the Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction on 6 April 2011) whereby in relation to the discretion arising from section 22 of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, the court held that such discretion, when exercised in a reasonable manner, would not be exercised during the pendency of the criminal proceedings and therefore fell outside the scope of the relevant provisions dealing with a fair trial. Things would be different if any discretion were exercised during the proceedings, even during the proceedings before the Court of Criminal Inquiry, in which case the exercise of that discretion would have to be scrutinised and examined from the point of view of both the Constitution and the Convention.",

Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the Convention sets forth the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege). It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see Scoppola v.

One of the standard techniques of regulation by rules is to use general categorisations as opposed to exhaustive lists. That means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent are vague, and their interpretation and application depend on practice. Consequently, in any system of law, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, including a criminal law provision, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances (see Scoppola (no. 2), cited above \u00a7 100).",

In fact, it provided for two different possible punishments, namely a punishment of four years to life imprisonment in the event that the applicant was tried before the Criminal Court, or six months to ten years if he was tried before the Court of Magistrates. While it is clear that the punishment imposed was established by law and did not exceed the limits fixed by section 120A (2) of the above-mentioned Ordinance, it remains to be determined whether the Ordinance\u2019s qualitative requirements, particularly that of foreseeability, were satisfied, regard being had to the manner of choice of jurisdiction, as this reflected on the penalty that the offence in question carried.",

However, G. was tried before the Criminal Court and eventually sentenced to nine years\u2019 imprisonment whereas M. was tried before the Court of Magistrates and sentenced to fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment. More generally, the domestic case-law presented to this Court seems to indicate that such decisions were at times unpredictable.

The law did not provide for any guidance on what would amount to a more serious offence or a less serious one (based on enumerated factors and criteria). The  (see paragraph 14 above) noted that there existed no guidelines which would aid the Attorney General in taking such a decision. Thus, the law did not determine with any degree of precision the circumstances in which a particular punishment bracket applied. An insoluble problem was posed by fixing different minimum penalties. The Attorney General had in effect an unfettered discretion to decide which minimum penalty would be applicable with respect to the same offence. The decision was inevitably subjective and left room for arbitrariness, particularly given the lack of procedural safeguards. Neither could such a decision be seen only or mainly in terms of abuse of power, even if, as the Government suggested without however substantiating their view, this might be subject to constitutional control (see paragraph 29 above). The Court is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument to the effect that it was possible that the minimum punishment before the Criminal Court would not be handed down. The Court considers that the domestic courts were bound by the Attorney General\u2019s decision as to which court would have been competent to try the accused. The Court observes that Article 21 of the Criminal Code provides for the passing of sentences below the prescribed minimum on the basis of special and exceptional reasons. However, section 120A of the Medical and Kindred Professions Ordinance, which provides for the offence with which the applicant was charged, specifically states in its subsection (7) that Article 21 of the Criminal Code shall not be applicable in respect of any person convicted of the offence at issue. On an examination of the provision, the Court finds that it would not be possible to interpret the wording of that provision otherwise. Moreover, this interpretation has been confirmed by the domestic courts, the most recent decision being that of 2008 in the above-mentioned case of The Republic of Malta v. Stanley Chircop, in which the Criminal Court considered that the application of Article 21 to the relevant offences was excluded and therefore the court could not impose a sentence below the minimum established by law. Furthermore, the Government have not provided any examples of decisions showing that a domestic court had actually done so. Thus, a lesser sentence could not be imposed despite any concerns the judge might have had as to the use of the prosecutor\u2019s discretion (ibid.).",

No further examples of \u201cunpredictability\u201d were given. Given the scarcity of details on the cases, and with one case having been decided as far back as 1998, it is difficult to assess how \u201cunpredictable\u201d the decision of the Attorney General was. But even with this drawback and even if one were simply to concede that there was some form of inconsistency, one case is simply not enough to amount to consistent unpredictability. Hence, I find it impossible to go along with the Court\u2019s reasoning as reflected in the last sentence of paragraph 42. No legal adviser, either before or after the commission of the crime or at the time of arraignment, would have taken the risk of assuring the applicant that with 953 ecstasy pills his case would be decided by the Court of Magistrates and thus attract the lesser penalty.

According to a raft of case-law, all these have a bearing on the Attorney General\u2019s final decision. The case-law reveals that only in some instances, where the quantity of drugs involved was substantial, the Attorney General ordered that the Court of Magistrates should be the competent court to try the case. In any case, a crime has to be very loosely defined before the European Court of Human Rights will find a violation of this provision (see Kokkinakis vs Greece, 25 May 1993, \u00a7 52, Series A no.\u00a0260-A).",

First of all, this Article of the Criminal Code is hardly ever used as it has been supplanted by probation orders, conditional or unconditional discharges and suspended prison sentences. Secondly, the inapplicability of this Article applies to both the Court of Magistrates and to the Criminal Court. However, in practice, the Court of Magistrates and the Criminal Court can still go below the minimum established by Chapter 31 in certain circumstances. Hence, in cases where the quantity of drugs is not too high, and the accused has filed an early guilty plea and has benefited from the reduction of the penalty by one or two degrees contemplated under Article 29 for persons who help the police to trace the sources of supply, it is possible to go below the six months\u2019 tariff. This has happened repeatedly in many cases decided by the Court of Magistrates, whether the person was a minor or not. In the case of minors, it is not the first time that the penalty was reduced to just a fine (multa). In my view, there is nothing to stop the Criminal Court from going below the minimum of four years if the evidence reveals circumstances identical to those which may apply before the Court of Magistrates.",
