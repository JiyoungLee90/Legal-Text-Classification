The Court considers that the medical evidence and the applicant's complaints submitted to the competent domestic authorities (see paragraph 43 below), created at least a reasonable suspicion that his injuries might have been caused by an excessive use of force. As such, his complaints constituted an arguable claim in respect of which the Turkish authorities were under an obligation to conduct an effective investigation.",

Although the applicant's medical examinations of 15 and 19 February 2001 revealed that he had sustained injuries to various parts of his body, no attempts were made to investigate the applicant's allegations. The Court observes that a public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged, under Article 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in force at the material time, to investigate the facts by conducting the necessary inquiries. In this connection, the Court considers that once a credible allegation of excessive police force has been brought to their attention, the national authorities cannot rely on the purported victim's attitude, such as his wish not to lodge an official complaint against the police officers, to explain their failure to take the necessary investigative measures. The Court concludes therefore that the applicant's allegations of having been beaten during his arrest were not effectively investigated by the domestic authorities, as required by Article 3 of the Convention.",
