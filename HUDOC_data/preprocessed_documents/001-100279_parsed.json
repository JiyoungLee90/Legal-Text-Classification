In the Government's submissions, the applicant had been responsible for four hundred and twenty-six days of delay in examination of the case, as hearings had been postponed because of his illness. The lawyers' inability to appear before the courts had caused in total a delay of sixteen days. Some delays had occurred because of the victim's and witnesses' absence.

This right is implicit in the very notion of an adversarial procedure and can also be derived from the guarantees contained in sub-paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of paragraph 3 of Article\u00a06 \u2013 \u201cto defend himself in person\u201d, \u201cto examine or have examined witnesses\u201d, and \u201cto have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court\u201d (see Colozza v.

Even where the court of appeal has jurisdiction to review the case both as to facts and as to law, Article 6 does not always require a right to a public hearing, still less a right to appear in person (see Fejde v. Sweden, 29 October 1991, \u00a7\u00a031, Series A no. 212-C). In order to decide this question, regard must be had, among other considerations, to the specific features of the proceedings in question and to the manner in which the applicant's interests were actually presented and protected before the appellate court, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it and of their importance to the appellant (see Hermi v.

When quashing a first-instance judgment, an appeal court is empowered both to remit a case for a new examination to a lower court and to amend the judgment (see paragraph 65 above).

It takes note of the Government's submission that that suspension was required because it was impossible to examine the case in the absence of the applicant's co-accused. The applicant did not object to the decision on suspension; moreover, on 14 March 2002 the applicant's counsel requested to suspend the proceedings for the second time pending the search for Mr P. (see paragraph 25 above). The Court thus cannot conclude that the period of inactivity between 2 July 1999 and 24 January 2002 was attributable to the State.",
