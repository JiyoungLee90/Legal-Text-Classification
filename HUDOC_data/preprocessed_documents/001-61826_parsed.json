The Court observed in those judgments that in order to obtain a stay of proceedings on this ground it was necessary to persuade the jury, on the basis of firm medical evidence, that the accused was so intellectually impaired that he was unable even to understand whether or not he was guilty. As noted above, Dr Brennan found that, \u201con balance\u201d, the applicant probably did have sufficient intelligence to understand that what he had done was wrong, and that he was therefore fit to plead.

Thus, in the present case, unlike the two earlier cases, the legal professionals did not wear wigs and gowns and the applicant was allowed to sit next to his social worker. He was not required to sit in the dock (see paragraph 15 of the judgment) during his one-day trial, in contrast to the situation in T. and V., where the accused were placed in a specially raised dock for the whole three-week trial (see V. v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7 88). Also in contrast to the above-mentioned cases, the applicant's arrest and trial were not the subject of high levels of public and media interest and hostility and there is no evidence that the atmosphere in the courtroom was particularly tense or intimidating. Nor is there any suggestion that the trial would have caused the applicant post-traumatic effects comparable to those in T. and V. (see V. v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7 89).

In so far as this may reflect an acceptance of the social worker's belief that some jury members had been antagonised by the applicant and thus somehow may have lost their subjective impartiality, I recall the well-established case-law according to which subjective impartiality is to be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see, for example, De Cubber v. Belgium, judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no.\u00a086, p. 14, \u00a7 25).

Even accepting, for that purpose, that there has been a violation, I consider that the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage. I also voted with the majority as regards the award of legal costs and expenses. Since the majority have found a violation, I consider it proper that the applicant should be compensated for his legal expenses.",
