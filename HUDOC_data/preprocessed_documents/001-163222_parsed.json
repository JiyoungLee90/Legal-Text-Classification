The applicant\u2019s mother was present, having been summoned to appear at the hearings, and asked to have a lawyer officially appointed to represent her daughter in the proceedings. The applicant also asked to have a lawyer appointed. The court granted their request. It heard evidence from the applicant, her officially appointed lawyer, a representative of the local committee, an inspector from the child protection team (\u0414\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f), a representative of the district prosecutor\u2019s office, a representative of the municipal child protection department and two social workers from the children\u2019s crisis centre where the applicant was living. The inspector from the child protection team stated that the applicant engaged in prostitution and had been found offering prostitution services on a motorway near Devnia, some 270 km from her home town. The two social workers from the children\u2019s crisis centre pointed out that that factor had served as a ground for placing her in the centre as a protective measure for a child at risk. They added that after her admission to the centre, the child had remained in contact with the people who had incited her to engage in prostitution despite the steps that had been taken to protect her. In the social workers\u2019 opinion, the applicant\u2019s family environment was unsuitable for her. She came from a large family where the mother did not exert any parental control. The mother did not have a job and her partner drank and was violent towards her and her children. The mother had also stayed at the children\u2019s crisis centre with two of her other children. After intensive psychological and social counselling, a positive development had been noted in the applicant and there were plans to find different accommodation arrangements for her. However, the social workers added that by the time of the hearing the applicant\u2019s situation had worsened as she did not follow the rules in place, came back late from school or was brought back by the police when she failed to return, and continued to associate with individuals known to the police, to engage in sexual relations and to behave aggressively towards the staff. She had attended a series of talks on prevention of \u201clover boy\u201d-type human trafficking but had not been receptive to the protective measures recommended. The social workers expressed the opinion that the applicant faced a strong risk of being driven into prostitution and that the arrangements in place at the crisis centre did not afford her the necessary protection. In their view, such protection would only be provided in a secure centre with a restrictive regime. Lastly, the representative of the local committee stated that four educational measures had already been imposed on the applicant, including strict monitoring by a supervisor, the ban on associating with certain individuals and the warning recommending placement in a correctional boarding school. He viewed those measures as insufficient.",

The officially appointed lawyer called for the adoption of less severe educational measures. The representatives of the district prosecutor\u2019s office and of the municipal child protection department supported the proposal by the local committee. The representative of the municipal child protection department stated that during the hearing all the safeguards laid down in the Child Protection Act had been observed. In his opinion, the possibilities for the child\u2019s upbringing in the crisis centre had been exhausted, the risk of her renewed involvement in human trafficking was very high and she was unaware of this. Accordingly, the measure of placement in a correctional boarding school was in fact in her interests.",

In its reasoning the court held that despite the judicial decision of 1 April 2013 in which a compromise solution had been adopted for the applicant, namely the confirmation and extension of her placement in the children\u2019s crisis centre, she was still failing to abide by the institution\u2019s internal rules, was not returning to the centre by the designated time after school, was in contact with individuals identified as \u201cdelinquents\u201d and was still behaving rudely and aggressively towards the social workers at the centre. It noted that, in the absence of adequate parental control, the applicant had developed serious antisocial habits and that her placement in a children\u2019s crisis centre no longer had the intended educational and preventive effect on her behaviour. In the court\u2019s view, the applicant no longer displayed any willingness to abide by the rules of society, or even those of the institution in which she was living, and it was therefore advisable to remove her from her circle of acquaintances who were harming her personal development, and to provide her with enhanced educational support in order to eradicate her negative behavioural traits. The court noted that educational measures had already been imposed on her, but they had not produced a positive result. It concluded that the measure of admission to a correctional boarding school was necessary not only for her own benefit but in the interests of society.",

During\u00a02009, twenty children ran away from the schools and eight left them following a positive annual assessment by the pedagogical council. During 2012/13, fewer than four children had a positive assessment and were therefore able to leave the correctional boarding schools. During the 2013/14 school year, there were no instances of children leaving the schools following a positive assessment. As regards the results achieved across all secure educational institutions in Bulgaria, the reports indicate that in 2009, 10% of pupils were awarded a vocational qualification, 35% successfully completed their secondary education up to the age of 14 and 3% successfully completed their secondary education up to the age of 18. The remaining 52% of pupils failed to complete their education. The 2013 report mentions a low success rate among pupils, with average marks of between 3 and 4 out of 6. According to the reports, these figures point to a problem as to the effectiveness of educational and rehabilitative measures, and even raise questions as to whether \u201csuch measures exist in practice\u201d.",

Objectives relating to learning, education and development are general in nature and do not include any specific activities tailored to the individual needs, abilities, age and interests of the children concerned. The 2013 report is particularly critical of the prevalence of serious incidents involving suicide attempts or assaults on other pupils, and deplores the fact that no provision is made for follow-up action in the individual plans of the pupils concerned so that consideration can be given to the reasons for their actions and to their psychological state.",

The reports nevertheless conclude that the number of people employed to run extracurricular activities is insufficient, although the children\u2019s wide-ranging needs and their vulnerability suggest that educational activities should be arranged in small groups.

It allows for the detention of a minor where this has been ordered for the purpose of educational supervision (see A. and Others v. Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7 66). Since the applicant did not reach the age of majority during the application of the measure in issue, the only question for the Court is whether her detention was lawful and was ordered \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of her educational supervision (see Bouamar v. Belgium, 29\u00a0February 1988, \u00a7\u00a050, Series A no. 129; D.G. v. Ireland, no. 39474/98, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR\u00a02002-III; and, more recently, Blokhin v.

The Convention here refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to its substantive and procedural rules, but it also requires that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Bouamar, cited above, \u00a7 47, and D.G. v. Ireland, cited above, \u00a7 75). In addition, there must be a relationship between the ground of permitted deprivation of liberty relied on and the place and conditions of detention (see D.G. v.

It is undeniable that the Juvenile Antisocial Behaviour Act appears somewhat obsolete (see paragraph 76 below) and does not include an exhaustive list of the acts deemed to be \u201cantisocial\u201d, which is why it does not explicitly refer to the acts which the applicant was said to have committed. The Act in question simply provides a general definition of the concept of \u201cantisocial behaviour\u201d ... However, the Court refers to its finding in A. and Others v. Bulgaria (cited above) that, according to established judicial practice, prostitution and absconding are regarded as antisocial acts that may give rise to educational measures, including placement in a specialist institution (ibid., \u00a7 68 ...).

It is the Court\u2019s task to ascertain whether the applicant\u2019s placement was such as to provide for her \u201ceducational supervision\u201d (see Bouamar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050, and Blokhin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 166-67). Once the State had chosen to introduce a system of educational supervision involving deprivation of liberty, it was under an obligation to put in place appropriate institutional facilities which met the demands of security and the relevant educational objectives, in order to be able to satisfy the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (d) (see Bouamar, cited above, \u00a7 50; D.G. v. Ireland, cited above, \u00a7 79; and Blokhin, cited above, \u00a7 167). It is also accepted that, in the context of the detention of minors, the words \u201ceducational supervision\u201d must not be equated rigidly with notions of classroom teaching: in the context of a young person in local authority care, educational supervision must embrace many aspects of the exercise, by the local authority, of parental rights for the benefit and protection of the person concerned (see Koniarska v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 33670/96, 12\u00a0October 2000; D.G. v. Ireland, cited above, \u00a7 80; A. and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7 69; and P. and S. v. Poland, no. 57375/08, \u00a7 147, 30 October 2012). The Court has recently had the opportunity to point out that schooling in line with the normal school curriculum should be standard practice for all minors deprived of their liberty and placed under the State\u2019s responsibility, even when they are placed in a temporary detention centre for a limited period of time, in order to avoid gaps in their education (see Blokhin, cited above, \u00a7 170). The Court finds it necessary to add in the present case that, as with the cases of detention provided for in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) and (e), the requirement of \u201clawfulness\u201d in the context of detention \u201cfor the purpose of educational supervision\u201d also implies the duty to ensure that the measure taken was proportionate to those aims (see, mutatis mutandis, Vasileva v. Denmark, no. 52792/99, \u00a7\u00a7 37-42, 25 September 2003, and Enhorn v. Sweden, no. 56529/00, \u00a7\u00a7 41 et seq., ECHR 2005-I). Where the detention concerns a minor, as in the present case, the Court considers, in the light of the relevant international standards, that an essential criterion for the assessment of proportionality is whether the detention was ordered as a last resort, in the child\u2019s best interests, and was aimed at preventing serious risks for the child\u2019s development. When this criterion is no longer fulfilled, the basis for the deprivation of liberty ceases to exist.",

It notes firstly that the Juvenile Antisocial Behaviour Act is undeniably obsolete and that, for historical reasons, it is based more on a philosophy of \u201cpunishing\u201d than \u201cprotecting\u201d children, a fact that has attracted criticism from international and national organisations (see paragraphs 39 ... above). Furthermore, when examining the first application by the local committee for the applicant\u2019s placement, the court found that the Podem school was an \u201cunfavourable environment\u201d (see paragraph 9 above). Subsequently, the State Agency for Child Protection and the Ombudsman both indicated their concerns as to the appropriateness of judicial proceedings concerning minors, the implementation of educational and support programmes, and the physical living conditions in the secure institutions for juveniles (see paragraphs 31-38 ... above). On this point, the Court is compelled to note that a national reform, encompassing wide-ranging legislative and administrative measures and encouraged by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, is currently being planned (see paragraphs 39 ... above). It also takes the view that its task is not to conduct an abstract examination, from the standpoint of the Convention, of the Bulgarian system of educational measures for minors, but to review the manner in which the existing system was applied in this specific case (see Deweer v.\u00a0Belgium, 27 February 1980, \u00a7\u00a040, Series A no. 35; Schiesser v.\u00a0Switzerland, 4\u00a0December 1979, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 34; and A. and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070).",

In the present case it observes, despite the criticisms levelled in general (see paragraph 76 above), that the applicant was able to follow a school curriculum, that individual efforts were made to alleviate her learning difficulties, that she achieved a mark allowing her to move up to the next class, and that she was eventually awarded a professional qualification offering her prospects of reintegrating into the community at a later stage (see paragraphs 24 and 26-27 above). Those factors are sufficient for the Court to conclude that the State cannot be accused of having failed to comply with its obligation under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (d) to ensure that the placement pursued an educational objective (contrast Bouamar, cited above, \u00a7 52; D.G. v. Ireland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 83-85; and Ichin and Others v.\u00a0Ukraine, nos. 28189/04 and 28192/04, \u00a7\u00a7 39-40, 21 December 2010).

The applicant\u2019s mother was also present and a lawyer was officially appointed at her request.

The most stringent of these measures \u2013 placement in a correctional boarding school \u2013 can only be applied where the other, less severe measures have had no effect ... As far as the Court is able to establish, the applicable procedure does not require the authorities ordering such a measure to draw up an individual plan setting out the practical educational objectives to be achieved by the children concerned. Similarly, although the statutory maximum duration of such a placement is set at three years ..., there does not appear to be any requirement for the courts to determine the length of the placement at the time of their initial decision. In the present case, those matters, and the question whether the Podem school was an appropriate institution in view of the applicant\u2019s circumstances, were not discussed during the judicial proceedings. The Court notes, despite those failings in the system, that the authorities had first established that the applicant was not living in a suitable family environment for her own development, and this had already been the reason for her admission to another institution as a protective measure in August 2012, under the Child Protection Act. Furthermore, in the course of the judicial proceedings the applicant\u2019s situation, her lifestyle and the risks to which she was exposed were highlighted in particular in the statements by the two social workers at the crisis centre, who had the closest contact with her. Their evidence indicated in particular that she still had dealings with the individuals who had initially incited her to engage in prostitution, that she was the victim of a \u201clover boy\u201d-type trafficking scheme but refused to admit it and protect herself, that she behaved aggressively towards the staff at the centre and that she did not go straight back to the centre in the evenings after school. The two social workers confirmed that the applicant\u2019s family environment was not favourable to her as there were indications that her mother had herself been a victim of violence and needed protection (see paragraph 11 above). The Court observes, moreover, that the mother had the option of addressing the court at the hearing, but it does not appear from the case file that she ever requested to do so ... The Court also notes that the applicant had clearly received educational support in the past, including less stringent educational measures than placement in the school (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). It does not find it arbitrary that the measures taken in her case were deemed insufficient by the authorities on account of the factors set out above.",

Admittedly, the courts\u2019 reasoning may appear somewhat brief and did not mention all the relevant circumstances. A particular cause for concern in this regard is that the courts did not address the issues relating to the individual plan for the applicant or to the duration and regular review of her placement. Nevertheless, the courts\u2019 decisions clearly reflected the statements by the two social workers who had direct responsibility for the applicant in the crisis centre. Thus, it appears that following an examination of the applicant\u2019s family situation, her social environment, her behaviour and the impact of the educational measures already implemented by the social workers, the judicial authorities reviewed and upheld the welfare institutions\u2019 conclusion that the child required heightened educational supervision. The Court observes that the domestic authorities\u2019 decision was largely driven by the concern to provide the applicant with an environment where she would be sheltered from specific, clearly identified risks, and hence to protect her interests as an adolescent in the process of psychological and social development. The material in the case file does not allow the Court to call into question the authorities\u2019 conclusion on the matter.",

This applies, for example, to persons charged with a criminal offence who are detained pending trial (see Bezicheri v.

However, it must be observed that the applicable legislation does not allow minors who have been placed in a correctional boarding school to apply to the courts for a review of their detention.

Moreover, it can accept that the correspondence of juveniles in a secure educational facility may be monitored in order to prevent the arrival of, among other things, substances and items that may cause damage to the health and rights of other juveniles, or that risk undermining the established order within the institution. This is clear from the wording of Article 25, point 10, of the Podem school\u2019s internal regulations (see paragraphs ... and 100 above).

The Court reiterates that some measure of control over the correspondence of persons who have been deprived of their liberty is called for and is not of itself incompatible with the Convention (see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 98, Series A no. 61, and Campbell, cited above, \u00a7 45).",

It considers in this regard that the margin of appreciation which the authorities may be afforded in such circumstances is narrower than in the area of monitoring prisoners who have committed a criminal offence. This stems from the very nature of the admission of juveniles to institutions for the purpose of educating them and preparing them for life in the community. Where juveniles are in the care of the authorities, as in the present case, all steps must be taken to ensure that they have sufficient contact with the outside world, including by means of written correspondence, as this is an integral part of their right to be treated with dignity and is essential in preparing them for reintegration into society.

The regulations make no distinction between the categories of people with whom the juveniles may correspond. However, the Court has frequently held that correspondence between detainees and their lawyers should in principle enjoy privileged status (see, among many other authorities, Campbell, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 47-48; Erdem v.\u00a0Germany, no. 38321/97, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2001-VII (extracts); and Petrov, cited above, \u00a7 43). In the Court\u2019s view, similar considerations may apply in the present case as regards the applicant\u2019s potential correspondence with her lawyer or with non-governmental organisations protecting children\u2019s rights. It observes that the applicable regulations do not safeguard the confidentiality of correspondence of this kind and instead subject it to the general monitoring measures.",

Italy, 15 November 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports 1996-V, and Petrov, cited above, \u00a7 44). The Court therefore concludes that Article 25, point 10, of the Podem school\u2019s internal regulations grants the school authorities full discretion to monitor juveniles\u2019 correspondence regardless of the category of addressee, the duration of this measure and the reasons that may justify it, and that such a system cannot be regarded as compatible with the purposes of Article 8.",

The Court would also emphasise how important it is that the authorities ensure that any measures restricting private and family life are as mild as possible where they are implemented in the context of deprivation of liberty for educational purposes alone. With this in mind, the Court is obliged to accord a narrow margin of appreciation to the State, and the considerations regarding the need to ensure conditions that are conducive to preserving contact between juveniles and the outside world are equally valid in relation to telephone conversations (see paragraph 104 above).",

The Court has never formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of national authorities might constitute \u201carbitrariness\u201d. It has, however, developed key principles on a case-by-case basis. The order to detain and the execution of the detention must genuinely conform with the purpose of the restrictions permitted by the relevant sub-paragraph of Article 5 \u00a7 1. There must, in addition, be some relationship between the ground of permitted deprivation of liberty relied on and the place and conditions of detention.",

In the context of a young person in local authority care, educational supervision must embrace many aspects of the exercise, by the local authority, of parental rights for the benefit and protection of the person concerned. Furthermore, detention for educational supervision pursuant to this provision of the Convention must take place in an appropriate facility with the resources to meet the necessary educational objectives and security requirements. In Blokhin, the Grand Chamber recently stressed that any placement which is justified with reference to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (d) must be \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of educational supervision and be characterised by the quality of the schooling and care provided as distinct from simply providing a disciplinary regime.",

In other words, the primary if not exclusive purpose of the system should be educational and the supervision provided, as well as the context in which it is provided, must be fit for purpose.

The educational and protective purpose of the detention, without which the deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty pursuant to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (d) cannot be justified, is obscured if not lost. While the situation of the applicant in the Blokhin case can be factually distinguished \u2013 he was placed in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders \u2013 the Court found his detention unlawful both because of the absence of an adequate schooling programme and, more importantly, because his detention was for \u201c\u2018behaviour correction\u2019 and the need to prevent him from committing further delinquent acts\u201d, neither of which the Grand Chamber considered a valid ground covered by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (d).

Two months later, the detention order was granted, despite the fact that the psychological and social work done in the less restrictive care facility had been producing positive results and that the applicant\u2019s behaviour seemed to deteriorate around the time of the detention hearing. The applicant attempted suicide after her detention was ordered; an attempt which she succeeded in repeating while in detention. Remarkably, a minor who had attempted suicide on 13\u00a0September 2013 and who was medically certified as being in a fragile state was detained just two days later for an undisclosed period, without the possibility of review (see the complaint in relation to Article 5 \u00a7 4, upheld by the Chamber unanimously) and without, it would seem, any further assessment of her psychological state or needs. Before being detained, the applicant appealed the detention order, complaining that the length of her detention had not been specified and that her mother had not been heard. The majority judgment regrets the absence of any reference by the District Court to the length and possibility of review of the detention but states that the applicant\u2019s mother could have requested to be heard by that court, despite the fact that the Regional Court had held that hearing the mother was not required by national law. Regarding the detention itself, the applicant emphasises that the educational council of the Podem centre did not evaluate any student positively in 2012 and 2013, either from an educational or a behavioural perspective, which meant no student could be considered for release. The applicant claims that she continued to be threatened by her traffickers while in detention; an allegation not contested by the respondent Government. Violent outbreaks in Bulgaria\u2019s closed educational institutions led to a court-ordered review of all of them, including the Podem centre. While in detention, the applicant could not request that her deprivation of liberty be periodically reviewed. Furthermore, her communications with her family were subject to automatic and undifferentiated control by the centre\u2019s authorities, although such contact is recognised as essential for the psychological and social development of minors and what should be the primary purpose of their educational supervision for it to be considered as coming within the scope of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (d), namely education, rehabilitation and reintegration into society.",

As stated previously, while I would not contest that the applicant\u2019s detention may appear formally regular and that other measures had been tried, it is impossible, on the basis of the information in the case file, to conclude that the means chosen were fit for purpose and capable of being judged appropriate for the achievement of the aims pursued. The Court\u2019s existing case-law on Article 5 \u00a7 1 (d) suggests that when an institution formally ticks this provision\u2019s boxes, the Court will not engage in a qualitative assessment of the supervision provided. Given the age and vulnerability of those whose deprivation of liberty is sought to be justified under this sub-paragraph, and given the Court\u2019s own tests for assessing arbitrariness and proportionality (see paragraphs 2, 3 and 11 above), this is to be regretted.",

One can of course view these complaints separately and with clinical judicial detachment; but the fact remains that a 14-year-old girl was detained, without the possibility of review, in conditions not conducive to her social and psychological development, while contact with her family was interfered with or denied. The Court has of course held that Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 are separate provisions, such that the observance of one does not necessarily entail observance of the other. Nevertheless, when examining whether the detention of a minor can be considered \u201carbitrary\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (d), the extent and nature of the separate, but related, violations of Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 8 can hardly be considered irrelevant.",

Further comfort could be drawn from the action plan formulated by the responsible Minister but not acted upon to date. However, to deprive someone of their liberty is to deprive them of a fundamental right considered by the Court to be of primary importance in a democracy. Unlike the applicants in A. and Others v. Bulgaria, who were detained between 2008 and 2010, when the problems besetting the Bulgarian centres for educational supervision were not yet known or only coming to light, the applicant was detained in September 2013, when those problems were well-documented and severe. The majority judgment refers to case-law and international instruments which require that the child\u2019s best interests be the primary consideration of decision-makers in circumstances such as these. The recent Grand Chamber judgment in Blokhin is even more prolific in this regard. However, if the Court fails, when required, to condemn systems which ostensibly seek to protect children but which, in their organisation and functioning, fail to do so then these references are neither necessary nor useful.",
