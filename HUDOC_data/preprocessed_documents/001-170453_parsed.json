The sending of a notification constitutes service and it is considered that the person has been duly notified of the place and time of the hearing. When an appellate court examines a case in an oral hearing, the parties are notified of it, but their absence does not preclude examination of the case if they have been duly notified ... Such a legal requirement implies an obligation on the appellate court, before examining the case at the hearing, to examine whether a party to the proceedings has been duly notified ... The Supreme Court reiterates that a court cannot examine a case if any of the parties to the proceedings have not been duly notified of the place and time of the hearing, as to do so would be contrary to the right to be heard and the principles of equality of arms and adversarial proceedings ...\u201d",

Nonetheless, the Court considers that in the interests of the administration of justice a litigant should be notified of a court hearing in such a way as to not only have knowledge of the date and place of the hearing, but also to have enough time to prepare his or her case and to attend the court hearing. A formal dispatch of a notification letter without any confidence that it will reach the applicant in good time cannot be considered by the Court as proper notification (see Kolegovy, cited above, \u00a7 40, and the cases cited therein).",

However, the applicant argued before the domestic courts and this Court that the notification had not been put in his letter box until 14\u00a0October\u00a02010 (see paragraphs 9 and 19 above). The Government contested that argument, claiming that the notification had been sent on 21\u00a0September\u00a02010 and most likely reached the applicant within five days at the latest. However, they were unable to provide any evidence to that effect because the relevant case material had already been destroyed (see paragraph\u00a021 above). The Court observes that in previous cases it has considered that it was incumbent on the Government to submit evidence showing that a notification had reached an applicant in good time (see Mokrushina v.\u00a0Russia, no. 23377/02, \u00a7 20, 5\u00a0October 2006; Prokopenko v. Russia, no.\u00a08630/03, \u00a7 18, 3 May 2007; Kolegovy, cited above, \u00a7 41; and Buterlevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 59), and it sees no reason to adopt a different approach in the present case. Accordingly, in the light of the material in its possession, the Court concludes that the applicant was not notified of the hearing of 11\u00a0October\u00a02010 in due time. The Court also notes that the domestic law did not require the applicant to identify a legal representative at the appeal stage or to look up the schedule of hearings on the Court of Appeal\u2019s website (see paragraphs 10 and 15 above), so the fact that he did not do so cannot relieve the Government of the obligation it had to duly notify the applicant of the hearing.",

The Court notes that the domestic law states that employees of the post office, bailiffs or couriers serving a notification must record its delivery in the relevant registers, indicating, inter alia, the date (see paragraph 13 above). It also notes that the domestic law lays an obligation on a court to verify whether the party who is absent from a hearing has been duly notified (see paragraphs 15-16 above). In those circumstances, the Court is of the view that the Court of Appeal had both the obligation and the possibility to examine whether the applicant had been duly notified of the hearing of 11 October 2010, and, if he had not been, whether examination of the appeal should have been adjourned (see, mutatis mutandis, Yakovlev, cited above, \u00a7 22; Gusak v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a028956/05, \u00a7 26, 7 June 2011; and Kolegovy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041). Although the Government argued that if there had been any shortcomings in the proceedings before the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court would have examined the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law (see paragraph 21 above), the Court reiterates that it is not its role to speculate whether the Supreme Court should have examined the applicant\u2019s appeal, or for what reasons it may have decided not to do so (see, mutatis mutandis, Pyrantien\u0117 v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 45092/07, \u00a7\u00a7 75-76, 12\u00a0November\u00a02013).",

Contrary to the Government\u2019s arguments (see paragraph\u00a023 above), the Court considers that it should not speculate on whether the hearing before the Court of Appeal was important to the applicant, because the very fact that the other party had the opportunity to submit observations on the applicant\u2019s appeal \u2013 whereas the applicant was not able to express his views on those observations \u2013 was sufficient to undermine his confidence in the workings of justice (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0160ven\u010dionien\u0117 v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 37259/04, \u00a7 29, 25\u00a0November 2008, and Gusak, cited above, \u00a7 27).",
