On 17 May 2006 the first interim order was issued. In the course of the proceedings, the applicant lodged eight requests for an interim contact order and the court issued eleven such orders in total. All interim contact orders were immediately enforceable (see paragraph 12).",

The longer periods of obstructed contact visits coincide, as noted by the domestic court, with \u0106. being ill and on several occasions hospitalised (see paragraphs 25, 31 and 39), which cannot be attributable to the State. The Court also notes that the relationship between father and son was gradually improving throughout the proceedings; that being particularly evident in the second half of the proceedings where both parties referred to the contacts as satisfactory (see paragraph 60 above). The Court is aware that in such difficult situations as the present one, involving unresolved issues between the parents, a certain amount of time has to pass in order for the parents to overcome the emotional hurdles and establish a mature relationship focusing on the best interests of the child.",

Both requests were rejected as unsubstantiated. Instead he kept resorting to lodging criminal complaints (see paragraphs 16 and 28) and new requests for interim orders. The Court cannot therefore accept that the applicant did everything in his power to obtain the enforcement of the interim contact orders to ensure contacts with his son had he considered that S.\u0106. was not complying with them.",

The court issued eleven interim contact orders, held six hearings and appointed one expert. The Court is satisfied that aside from a few delays, which were however not excessive (see, for example, paragraphs 54\u201357 and 58\u201359 above), the proceedings were sufficiently prompt and effective, considering that the court had had to deal with a large number of requests for new interim contact orders and objections to and appeals against such orders. Moreover, the contact visits between the applicant and \u0106. had generally been allowed to happen. In this connection the Court also notes that with every newly issued order the access arrangements were modified so to allow more frequent contact taking into account the best interest of the child.",
