Therefore, it is evident, even without the quotation marks, that this was not the applicant\u2019s personal opinion of Ms Kandi\u0107, but that she was merely transmitting how Ms Kandi\u0107 was perceived by others. The Court has already held that a general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press\u2019s role of providing information on current events, opinions and ideas (see Thoma, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 63-65).\u00a0The Court does not consider that the sheer absence of quotation marks alone can be regarded as \u201cparticularly cogent reasons\u201d capable of justifying the imposition of a penalty on the journalist (see, mutatis mutandis, Thoma, cited above, \u00a7 64).",

In the present case, the domestic courts found that the applicant had committed a criminal offence of insult and issued against her a judicial warning, which could be considered an aggravating circumstance, should she commit another criminal offence (see paragraph 19 above). The Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s sentence was lenient. In the Court\u2019s view, what matters is not that the applicant was issued a judicial warning \u201conly\u201d, but that she was convicted for an insult at all (see Lopes Gomes da Silva v. Portugal, no. 37698/97, \u00a7\u00a036, ECHR 2000-X). Irrespective of the severity of the penalty which is liable to be imposed, a recourse to the criminal prosecution of journalists for purported insults, with the attendant risk of a criminal conviction and a criminal penalty, for criticising a public figure in a manner which can be regarded as personally insulting, is likely to deter journalists from contributing to the public discussion of issues affecting the life of the community (see paragraph 19 above; see, also, Bodro\u017ei\u0107 and Vujin v.
