On 5 December 1997 charges were brought against the applicant.
In 1998-1999 the applicant’s detention was extended on several occasions.
On 21 April 1999 the pre-trial investigation ended and the applicant was allowed to examine the case file which was made up of 145 volumes – 9 of which contained the summons of the victims, 6 volumes contained accounting documents and 118 volumes contained the statements of the victims (seven thousand and thirty-six clients of the bank). A deadline of 8 November 1999 was given for the reading of the file. As the applicant had not managed to read all the volumes by the given deadline, the time was extended to 12 November 1999. No further extensions were granted.
On 5 January 2000 the trial commenced.
The applicant asked the court to send the case file back to the investigator due to the numerous alleged procedural violations and the lack of sufficient time given for the examination of the file.

The Government submitted that the proceedings were adjourned due to the court’s actions on one occasion only, i.e. from 13 to 20 January 2003, the presiding judge being on a regular holiday leave.
