If the accused sought leave to appeal against an appellate court decision, the application for leave to appeal out of time should be [lodged with and] examined by the appellate court instead of the District Court. What confused the interpretation of the above term was the use of the words \u201cwith the court of appeal\u201d in Article 147 \u00a7 6 of the CCP. The  decided that those words were unconstitutional and that they could be replaced by the words \u201cwith a higher court\u201d. Since Article 147 of the CCP did not provide for the parties\u2019 [direct] right to appeal against a decision granting leave to appeal out of time (Article 147 \u00a7 5 of the CCP) as opposed to the parties\u2019 right to appeal against a decision refusing leave to appeal out of time (Article 147 \u00a7 6 of the CPP), the Constitutional Court further held that the legislature should separately provide for the parties\u2019 right to appeal against the granting of the application for leave to appeal out of time prior to the examination of the merits of the appeal. The law as it stood meant that, in the examination of the merits, the Supreme Court would also have to examine the lawfulness and substantiation of the application for leave to appeal out of time, which was not compatible with the nature of proceedings before that instance.",
