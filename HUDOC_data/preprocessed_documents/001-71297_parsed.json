This body was mentioned in the Meetings and Marches Act, which had been enacted prior to the Constitution of 1991, when the municipal authorities had been structured differently. Under the Constitution of 1991 the Executive Committee, which had been part of the executive branch of the local authorities, had ceased to exist. It was erroneous to hold that the Municipal Council \u2013 the municipal legislative body \u2013 was the successor to the Executive Committee, and as such competent to examine appeals against orders of the mayor. Moreover, the Municipal Council convened at long intervals, which had prevented it from examining the appeal in time for the planned rally.",

Only if the Municipal Council dismissed the appeal the dispute could be brought before the court. By section 35(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act, judicial review of administrative acts was only possible if the administrative remedies had been exhausted, or the timelimit for doing so had expired. In the case at hand no administrative appeal had been lodged, whereas the appeal to the Sofia District Court had been lodged on 2 September 1998, i.e. before the expiry of the twentyfour hours\u2019 timelimit laid down in section\u00a012(4) of the Meetings and Marches Act. The court went on to state that the argument that the Municipal Council convened at long intervals and was hence not in a position to examine the appeal in time was unavailing, because, on the one hand, an infelicitous legal rule still had to be complied with, and on the other, if the administrative body failed to rule on the appeal within twentyfour hours, the planned event could take place, as provided by section 12(5) of the Meetings and Marches Act. Furthermore, it could not be said that the Municipal Council did not have the power to rule an appeal against the mayoral ban, because by the terms of section 21(2) of the Local SelfGovernment and Local Administration Act it could decide on all questions of importance for the local community.",

There were no legal grounds to conclude that that body had been superseded by the Municipal Council.

Thirdly, the Government had not produced a single decision of a municipal council delivered pursuant to an appeal against a mayoral ban of a public event. Fourthly, the facts of the case indicated that an appeal to the Municipal Council would be pointless, because the Council had never ruled on the appeal referred by the Sofia District Court to the Executive Committee of the People\u2019s Council. Finally, the applicants averred that the Sofia Municipal Council could not have considered an appeal in a timely manner, because it had not held sessions in August 1998 and after that had held a session only on 17 September 1998, whereas the planned events had been scheduled for 10 August and 12\u00a0September 1998 and had been banned on 3 August and 1 September 1998 respectively.",

Moreover, the bans were imposed in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Meetings and Marches Act. It may thus be accepted that they were prescribed by law (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a081 and 82).

Thus, even assuming that the legitimate aims pursued were public safety and the prevention of disorder, it can hardly be concluded that the authorities gave relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the prohibitions of the rallies, substantiating their finding that there was a risk to public order, and that the bans were thus necessary in a democratic society.
