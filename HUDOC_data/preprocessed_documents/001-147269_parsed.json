Similarly, Article 141 of the Code of Criminal Procedure governed the compensation of persons detained in the context of a criminal investigation or prosecution in strictly defined circumstances, whereas he had not been detained in a criminal context. Lastly, the administrative remedies cited by the Government would not have been effective because there had been no administrative court judgments so far that had ruled, in an expeditious manner, on the unlawfulness of an asylum seeker\u2019s detention. He submitted a number of examples where attempts by asylum seekers in similar positions to his to instigate proceedings before administrative or criminal courts under the legal provisions indicated by the Government had proved unsuccessful.",

Although there was a yard outside the detention centre, which was used as a car park, he had not been allowed to go outside for fresh air even once throughout his stay. No social or recreational activity had been offered indoors either.

When assessing conditions of detention, account must be taken of the cumulative effects of these conditions, as well as of specific allegations made by the applicant (see Dougoz v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a040907/98, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2001II).

Other aspects of physical conditions of detention that are relevant for the assessment of compliance with Article 3 include the availability of outdoor exercise, access to natural light or air, ventilation, and compliance with basic sanitary and hygiene requirements (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 149 et seq. for further details; and M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, \u00a7\u00a0222, ECHR 2011). The Court notes in particular that the prison standards developed by the CPT make specific mention of outdoor exercise and consider it a basic safeguard of prisoners\u2019 well-being that all of them, without exception, be allowed at least one hour of exercise in the open air every day and preferably as part of a broader programme of outofcell activities (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 150).",

Since the Government have not presented any evidence or arguments to justify a departure from that finding, the Court is led to conclude that the conditions of his detention at Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre caused the applicant distress which exceeded the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and attained the threshold of degrading treatment proscribed by Article 3 (see, Yarashonen, cited above, \u00a7 80).",
