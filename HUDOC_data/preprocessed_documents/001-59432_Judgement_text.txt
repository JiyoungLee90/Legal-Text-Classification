The case originated in an application (no. 41513/98) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Italian nationals, Mr Luigi Di Donato, Mr Raffaele Romano, Mr Vincenzo La Brocca and Mr Luigi Nunziato (“the applicants”), on 26 November 1997.
The applicants were represented by Mr Giovanni Romano, a lawyer practising in Benevento. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, assisted by their Co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicants complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of a set of criminal proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 21 October 1999 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicants were born respectively in 1937, 1941, 1949 and 1956 and are currently residing in Benevento. The first applicant is a professor, the second one is an accountant, the third one is a lawyer and the fourth one is a doctor.
In 1990 and 1991 the applicants were members of the Benevento Town Council (“giunta municipale di Benevento”). On 5 February 1993 the Benevento Public Prosecutor's Office informed the applicants that criminal proceedings had been instituted against them for abuse of power and misconduct in office.
On 17 April and 29 November 1993 and 31 May 1994, the Benevento Public Prosecutor requested the investigating judge to prolong the maximum period for the duration of the investigations.
On 26 January 1995 the Benevento Public Prosecutor's Office requested that the applicants and twenty-four other persons be committed for trial on the above-mentioned charges. The preliminary hearing, scheduled for 22 March 1995, was adjourned on four occasions because the lawyers of the Benevento Bar Association were on strike and eventually took place on 22 September 1995. On the latter date and on 25 September 1995 some of the accused were examined. The proceedings were adjourned until 6 October 1995.
After two hearings, on 1 December 1995, the investigating judge ordered a stay of proceedings pending a Constitutional Court judgment concerning a procedural issue which he considered to be relevant to the present case. In a judgment of 26 June 1996, filed with the registry on 3 July 1996, the Constitutional Court declared that this issue was manifestly ill-founded.
On 9 January 1997 the case was assigned to another investigating judge.  The preliminary hearing was scheduled for 1 April 1997. On 18 April 1997 the parties presented their final submissions.
In a judgment of the same day, filed with the registry on 3 May 1997, the Benevento investigating judge decided to drop all the charges against the applicants. This decision became final on 3 June 1997.
