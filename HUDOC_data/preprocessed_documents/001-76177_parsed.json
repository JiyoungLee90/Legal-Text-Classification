The Court further observes that the applicant lodged several motions and appeals concerning exemption from the court fees, all of them being examined by the courts and their decisions being sufficiently reasoned (see paragraphs 35-46). The domestic courts emphasised that in repeatedly lodging his complaints, the applicant had not submitted relevant documents concerning his financial situation that would allow for examination of his motions on the merits, nor had he invoked any new circumstances each time he renewed his motions. The examinations of his repeated motions (at least six concerning the same request for exemption from the court fee) took almost two years (\u00a7 80). The domestic court cannot be said to have acted arbitrarily in refusing to allow his requests (see paragraph 40). Consequently, the Court is of the view that the applicant did not effectively avail himself of the possibility of obtaining exemption from the court fee guaranteed by the relevant legal provisions.",
