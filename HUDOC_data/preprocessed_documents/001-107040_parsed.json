In particular, the Court found that an action for damages lodged with a court was not a remedy within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, for instance Aleksandr Makarov v. Russia, no. 15217/07, \u00a7\u00a7 87-89, 12 March 2009, and Artyomov v. Russia, no. 14146/02, \u00a7\u00a7 110-112, 27 May 2010). The Court does not see any reason to depart from such a finding in the present case. The Court notes that the Government cited several judgments in cases in which domestic courts awarded compensation for appalling conditions of detention. However, the Government did not provide copies of these judgments. In the absence of documents supporting the Government\u2019s assertion, the Court is unable to assess the relevance of the judgments in question to the issue of the effectiveness of an action for damages as a remedy in the present case. As regards the Government\u2019s reliance on the Shilbergs case, the Court notes that the Russian courts in that case did not acknowledge a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, but rather accepted that some aspects of Mr Shilbergs\u2019 detention had fallen short of domestic legal requirements. Furthermore, the amount awarded in compensation by the Government in that case was substantially reduced on account of the State\u2019s financial difficulties, to a level at which it became, in the Court\u2019s assessment, insufficient and manifestly unreasonable in the light of its case-law (see Shilbergs, \u00a7\u00a7 69-79, cited above). Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, the Government\u2019s submissions in the present case do not suffice to show the existence of settled domestic practice capable of demonstrating that a civil claim is an effective domestic remedy for a complaint of inhuman or degrading conditions of detention (see, for a similar approach, Aleksandr Makarov v. Russia, cited above \u00a7 87, 12 March 2009). Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Government\u2019s objection as to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

Nevertheless, it is obvious that, at the times when the number of inmates detained in the same cell as the applicant reached the maximum number indicated by the Government, detainees were afforded less than one and a half square metres of floor space per person. Therefore, the Court finds that during his detention in remand prison no.\u00a047/1, which lasted for approximately three years and one month, the applicant was afforded less than one and a half square metres of personal space and was confined to his cell day and night, save for one hour of outdoor exercise per day.",

Special considerations may apply in exceptional cases where an applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the circumstances which make that remedy ineffective.

Although it is not always necessary for the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 to be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see Reinprecht v. Austria, no. 67175/01, \u00a7 31, ECHR 2005-..., with further references). The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties. In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), a hearing is required (see Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999II). The opportunity for a detainee to be heard either in person or through some form of representation features among the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty (see Kampanis v.

The Court further notes that according to the summary table of the hearings provided by the Government, the case was adjourned on six occasions between April 2001 and 1 October 2002 because witnesses failed to appear (see paragraphs 19, 20, 22 and 37 above). The resulting delay was of approximately six months. The Court is mindful that the trial court took measures to ensure the attendance of the witnesses, by issuing orders to bring them to trial. However, it appears that these were not effective since at least ten witnesses failed to appear throughout the trial and the trial court was obliged to read out their statements in their absence (see paragraph 44 above). Therefore, the Court considers that the delay occasioned by the failure of witnesses to attend the hearings is attributable to the State (see see Ku\u015bmierek v.
