Another witness, a doorkeeper at the Vegas club, testified that he had seen someone kick the man as he lay on the floor. To him this seemed a kick, but he could not state who kicked, nor where the kick hit the body. The witness did not mention this when making his statement to the police on 14 May 1997. When questioned again by the police 2 days later, the witness was quoted as saying: 'This was a fight where he saw hands beating and feet kicking, but he could not determine who beat whom or whether somebody kicked somebody'. Considering the case as a whole, the charges are not borne out by this witness statement. I find that the prosecution has failed to establish the [applicant's] guilt and that his acquittal by the District Court is therefore to be upheld.\u201d",

Firstly, it refers to the assessment of the credibility of a witness and his or her statements considered on its own. For this purpose it is necessary that the witness appear in court and be questioned by the judge directly. Secondly, the provision in Article 159 (4) refers to the weight of his or her testimony as compared with that of other evidence in the case, where the Supreme Court has accepted the District Court's assessment of the witness' credibility. The main purpose of the provision is to guarantee that the Supreme Court will not reassess the credibility of a witness who has given oral evidence to the District Court. According to the Government, this interpretation finds support in the explanatory report accompanying the bill for the Act No. 37/1994 amending the provisions regarding proceedings before the Supreme Court. If the latter considers that the District Court has assessed the credibility of the witness statements wrongly, it would quash the first instance judgment and, in so far as necessary, order the District Court to take new oral evidence and give a new judgment. An example of the Supreme Court having taken evidence under Article 159 (4) could be found in Supreme Court case no. 11/2001, adjudicated on 21 February 2002, where the Supreme Court, after having already once quashed the District Court's assessment of the matter, found it necessary in a second round to appraise itself of the credibility of the accused's defence.",
