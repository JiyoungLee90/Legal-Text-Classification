They concluded that the applicant or his wife had attacked the service personnel, opening fire with the Kalashnikov and shouting All\u0101hu akbar! In response the service personnel had had to return fire to protect themselves. The fact that no cartridge cases from the Kalashnikov had been found might be explained by the narrow area of the crime scene that had been examined, which had not exceeded 6 or 7 metres in diametre, whereas the cartridges cases may be ejected out to up to 9.5 metres away from the Kalashnikov (see paragraph 36 above). The absence of gunshot residue on the applicant and his late wife might have been a result of the swabs having been taken belatedly (see paragraph 17 above). Lastly, the bullet from the Kalashnikov chamber might have been removed by an unidentified officer shortly after the operation as a safety measure (see paragraph 37 above). It is unclear when the applicant was informed of that decision.",

Consequently, where a death has occurred, applicant relatives are expected to take steps to keep track of the investigation\u2019s progress, or lack thereof, and to lodge their applications with due expedition once they have become, or should have become, aware of the lack of any effective criminal investigation (see Bulut and Yavuz v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no. 73065/01, 28 May 2002, and Bayram and Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a038587/97, ECHR 2002III).

Then the investigation was suspended, discontinued and resumed or reopened on several occasions without significant periods of inactivity on the part of the investigators. There was slow but steady progress in the investigation. Even several years after the incident, the investigators took important steps: in 2010 they exhumed the applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s body and had a post-mortem examination carried out (see paragraphs 30 and 33 above). In 2012, they ordered a number of ballistic expert examinations and subjected several of the implicated police officers to lie-detector tests (see paragraphs 42, 43, 46 and 49 above). All those actions might have given the applicant hope of a positive outcome regarding the identification of the perpetrators and their prosecution. At the time of the lodging of the application with the Court \u2013 24 July 2013 \u2013 the investigation was still ongoing.

The explanation proposed by the investigators was based on the improbable claim that owing to a combination of various factors all of the key evidence of the attack on the officers had been lost. The only material evidence of the alleged gunfire attack by the applicant and his wife \u2013 bullet traces on the shed roof which, according to the experts, might have been caused by gunshots from their location on the ground \u2013 is insufficient to support the investigators\u2019 version.
