The cases originated in three applications (nos. 61981/09, 57632/10 and 48915/11) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Turkish nationals, Mr Nuri Ünal, Mr Ahmet Gurlaş and Mr İsa Ünlü (“the applicants”), whose details are set out in the attached appendix.
The Government were represented by their Agent.
On 22 September 2015 the complaints raised under Article 6 of the Convention were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible.
The applicants were cadets in military schools. Based on classified investigation reports, they were expelled from their schools. None of the applicants had access to these classified reports. They all filed actions against the Ministry of Defence with the Supreme Military Administrative Court to have annulment of the impugned decisions.
Relying on the classified investigation reports, the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicants’ requests and their subsequent requests for rectification on different dates shown in detail in the attached list.
