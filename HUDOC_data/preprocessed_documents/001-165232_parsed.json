In those cases it consistently held that, given the attested widespread and routine use of torture and other ill-treatment by law-enforcement agencies in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan in respect of members of the Uzbek community, the impunity of lawenforcement officers, and the absence of sufficient safeguards for the applicants in the requesting country, there were substantial grounds for believing that the applicants would face a real risk of exposure to treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention if returned to Kyrgyzstan (see Khamrakulov, cited above, \u00a7 65; Mamadaliyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a05614/13, \u00a7\u00a060, 24\u00a0July 2014; Kadirzhanov and Mamashev, cited above, \u00a7 91; Gayratbek Saliyev, cited above, \u00a7 61; and Makhmudzhan Ergashev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a049747/11, \u00a7\u00a7 7173, 16 October 2012).

The Court is mindful of the fact that the domestic courts\u2019 reasoning in the applicant\u2019s case was more detailed (see, by contrast, Kadirzhanov and Mamashev, cited above, \u00a7 94; Khamrakulov, cited above, \u00a7 67; Turgunov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 52-53; Gayratbek Saliyev, cited above, \u00a7 63; and compare to Nabid Abdullayev, cited above, \u00a7 65). However, their arguments justifying rejection of the applicant\u2019s claims have already been addressed by the Court in its previous judgments and found insufficient by it (see in particular as regards the insufficiency of diplomatic assurances and of the monitoring mechanism Nabid Abdullayev, cited above, \u00a7 53 and \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06569). As to the last argument relied upon by the Supreme Court and based on the fact that the applicant\u2019s extradition was sought for ordinary criminal offences, to some of which he had initially confessed (see paragraph 24 above), the Court can only reiterate that the applicant\u2019s conduct \u2012 however undesirable or dangerous it might have been \u2012 cannot overturn the absolute prohibition of ill-treatment under Article 3 of the Convention (see Chahal v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 79-80, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V). In this respect, the Court recalls that the applicant is an ethnic Uzbek, whose extradition was sought by the Kyrgyz authorities for crimes allegedly committed in the course of the violence of June 2010 (see paragraph 9 above). He is thus a member of a group that is systematically exposed to a practice of ill-treatment (see paragraph 30 above).",

In the present case, the applicant\u2019s detention was authorised for a fixed period from 16 January 2015 to 23 July 2015. The changed circumstances which might have had an impact on the lawfulness of the detention were the Court\u2019s interim measure on 24 March 2015 and the extradition order becoming final on 25 March 2015. There was therefore a period of a little short of four months during which it was not open to the applicant to bring about a judicial review of the lawfulness of his detention.",
