It had summoned doctor A.S., who had not only never appeared at the hearings but whose presence would in any event have been insufficient to meet the requirements set out in the medical reports. Thus, in the applicant\u2019s view, the mere summoning of doctor A.S. had not satisfied the requirement of effective medical care being made available at the hearings. Moreover, there had been no good reason for holding a hearing in the absence of his defence lawyer. As to the domestic courts\u2019 reference to the fact that he had been involved in other proceedings at the same time, the applicant asserted that while it was true that he had been a party to several sets of proceedings he had never attended the court hearings in those cases and had always been represented by a lawyer.",

He and his lawyer had been duly summoned to the court hearings and the \u0160ibenik Municipal Court had ensured the presence of a doctor, as required by the medical expert reports. There had therefore been no reason for the applicant not to appear. The Government pointed out that the medical expert reports had indicated that the applicant had been suffering from health problems of a temporary nature and not that he was permanently unable to attend court hearings. The report of 19 June 2007 had therefore indicated that the applicant could attend the court hearings if the necessary medical support was available. In the Government\u2019s view, it had been for the domestic courts to assess whether there had been a good reason for the applicant not to appear at the hearings and accordingly to take the necessary measures under applicable domestic law, which, given that the applicant was being tried as an accused under summary procedure, had allowed the court to hold a hearing in his absence. In particular, the trial court had had to conduct the proceedings before it efficiently and to prevent any unjustified obstruction of the process. It had therefore had the ability to refuse a request for the adjournment of the hearings, particularly when the circumstances had suggested that the applicant had decided not to appear. The Government considered that the applicant had attempted to delay the proceedings in order that the prosecution became time-barred. As to the fact that the applicant\u2019s lawyer B.B. had not been summoned to the hearing of 19 December 2007, the Government pointed out that the applicant had engaged her services at the time when it had been obvious that she could not attend the hearings because she was on maternity leave and therefore considered that there had been no reason for the trial court to summon her to the hearing. Lastly, the Government pointed out that the criminal proceedings against the applicant, taken as a whole, had been fair.",

Croatia, no. 58590/11, \u00a7\u00a7 58-60, 25 April 2013). However, the applicant and his defence lawyer were not able to take part in the hearing (see paragraph 29 above) and thus the appeal court failed to cure the defects in the proceedings caused by the trial court. In such circumstances, the only possible means of redressing the defects of the trial proceedings would have been for the appellate court to quash the verdict in its entirety and to refer the matter back for a hearing de novo. By not doing so, the appellate court failed to redress the violation of the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial (see Idalov, cited above, \u00a7 180).",
