From the documents submitted it appears that from the very beginning of the proceedings, as early as 20 November 2004, the investigators were officially informed about the alleged involvement of lawenforcement officers in the killing of the applicant\u2019s son (see paragraph\u00a027 above). However, it does not appear that the investigators took any steps to examine this allegation or to elucidate the circumstances of the shooting. Furthermore, as it appears from the official witness statements, the applicant informed the investigators about her son\u2019s killing by lawenforcement officers \u2018by mistake\u2019 in January 2005, but the investigators failed to follow up on this information and to verify the circumstances of the recovery of the service guns and of KhozhAkhmed Akhmadov\u2019s service identity documents, despite the supervising prosecutors\u2019 orders to this end (see paragraphs 35, 43, 45, 49 and 52 above). It is also noteworthy that the investigators, despite having obtained witness statements from KhozhAkhmed Akhmadov\u2019s superiors concerning the possible involvement of law-enforcement officers in the incident (see paragraphs\u00a039 and 50 above), failed to verify this information. Moreover, the Court notes that, as can be seen from the orders of the supervising Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the investigators also failed to take such basic steps as questioning key witnesses or establishing the owners of the vehicles used by the perpetrators (see paragraph 52 above). It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2004XII).",

The Court observes that the applicant, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged the acts or omissions of the investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this respect that while the suspension or reopening of proceedings is not in itself a sign that the proceedings are ineffective, in the present case the decisions to suspend were made without the necessary investigative steps having been taken, which led to numerous periods of inactivity and thus unnecessary protraction. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that this remedy was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses the preliminary objection as regards the applicant\u2019s failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
