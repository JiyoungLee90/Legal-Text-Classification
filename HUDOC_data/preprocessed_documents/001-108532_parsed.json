There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence. As a general rule, paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6 require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question witnesses against him, either when they make their statements or at a later stage (see L\u00fcdi v. Switzerland, judgment of 15 June 1992, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 238). A conviction should not be based either solely or to a decisive extent on statements which the defence has not been able to challenge (see, mutatis mutandis, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, \u00a7 76, Reports 1996II).",

There is no indication or allegation that the applicant made any statements against himself that he would later retract or change. It appears that the applicant consistently advanced his version of events (see paragraph 5 above), which did not change from the first time he was questioned to the submission made before this Court. His version had been overturned by the results of numerous forensic expert examinations and not through any illicit means or methods. Furthermore, in the appeal proceedings the applicant complained that his right to defence had been violated on the sole ground that he had to be legally represented under domestic law as the maximum possible punishment for the crime he had been charged with had been a life sentence. He did not advance any arguments and did not suggest the existence of any concrete prejudice caused by lack of lawyer during the initial stage of investigation. The higher courts did not find any such prejudice either. In particular, the Supreme Court established no procedural violations serious enough to necessitate a referral of the case for re-investigation or retrial (see paragraph 28 above).",

The Court has frequently repeated that in order to determine whether the aim of Article 6 \u2013 a fair trial \u2013 has been achieved, regard must be had to the entirety of the proceedings, including, the pre-trial proceedings (see Panovits v Cyprus, \u00a7 64, and Imbrioscia v Switzerland, no. 13972/88, \u00a7 38, 24 November 1993).",

Indeed, the concept of fairness enshrined in Article 6 \u201crequires that the accused be given the benefit of the assistance of a lawyer already at the initial stages of police interrogation\u201d (see Panovits, cited above, \u00a7 66). This principle reflects the Court\u2019s recognition of the fact that evidence obtained during the investigation stage can determine the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the trial (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a054). From the moment of arrest until the handing down of sentence, criminal proceedings form an organic and interconnected whole and an event that occurs at one stage may influence and, at times, determine what transpires at another. This \u2018holistic\u2019 approach to criminal proceedings is reflected in the Grand Chamber\u2019s finding in Salduz that neither the legal assistance provided subsequently nor the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings could cure the defects which had occurred during the time spent in police custody (Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 58). Consequently, the Court proceeded to find a violation of Article 6 in that case.",

The correct test, in our view, is that Article 6 \u00a71 requires, that as a rule, a suspect has a right of access to a lawyer from his or her first interrogation by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right (Salduz, cited above, \u00a755). In other words, there is a presumption that a trial will be unfair unless access to a lawyer has been given from a suspect\u2019s initial interrogation by police. However, even proceeding upon the test used by the majority, we cannot share its view that the absence of legal assistance at the early stage of investigation appears to have had no bearing on the general fairness of the applicant\u2019s trial. One simply cannot speculate as to how that trial would have proceeded or how the defence would have been conducted had the applicant been given access to a lawyer at that initial stage of the proceedings.",

However, it does not follow that the lack of legal assistance at such a crucial stage in the criminal investigation had no bearing on the general fairness of the applicant\u2019s trial. To draw such a conclusion is to overlook the fact that access to a lawyer involves much more than advice in relation to the making of statements. The applicant complains that because of the absence of a lawyer the gathering of evidence in support of his defence was unsatisfactory. This submission appears to us to be entirely plausible. Legal assistance includes a whole panoply of services which are put at an accused person\u2019s disposal so that he can defend himself, effectively, in a criminal trial. As the Court has stated in Dayanan v , no. 7377/03, 13\u00a0October\u00a02009:",

The applicant, however, claims that, prior to the waiver, he was informed by the investigator that \u2018it would take a lot of time to fetch a lawyer\u2019 and that he agreed to forsake such assistance \u201csince he wanted to help the investigation\u201d (\u00a7 7).
