A measure which in itself is in conformity with the requirements of the Article enshrining the right or freedom in question may, however, infringe it when read in conjunction with Article\u00a014, for the reason that it is of a discriminatory nature.

The national authorities are thus, in principle, better placed than an international court to evaluate what is adequate compensation for the specific damage suffered by an individual. The issue which has to be determined, however, is whether or not the reasoning of the Bucharest Court of Appeal led to a difference of treatment of the applicants based solely on their age, amounting to a breach of Article 14 in conjunction with Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Morais, cited above, \u00a7 51).",
