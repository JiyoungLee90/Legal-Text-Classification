He did not claim that a judge in such a position would conduct himself with personal bias, but argued that the kind of decisions he would be called upon to make at the pre-trial stage would require him, under the law, to assess the strength of the evidence and the character of the accused, thereby inevitably colouring his appreciation of the evidence and issues at the subsequent trial. In the applicant\u2019s submission, a defendant was entitled to face trial with reasonable confidence in the impartiality of the court sitting in judgment on him. He contended that any reasonable observer would consider that a trial judge who had performed such a supervisory function could not but engender apprehension and unease on the part of the defendant.

Sections 60(2) and 62 of the Administration of Justice Act (\"the Act\"), which are cited in full in paragraph 28 of the Court\u2019s judgment, clearly indicate - in accordance with the explanations given on pages 21 and 22 of the original proposal, dated March 1875, that led to the adoption of the Act - that normally a judge in a criminal case is not disqualified because he has had to deal with the case in another capacity before trial, but that disqualification may ensue because of special circumstances as mentioned in those sections. Consequently an appeal founded on the system itself, i.e. on the fact that judges who delivered pre-trial decisions are not normally disqualified from taking part in the trial, would undoubtedly have been unsuccessful. The relevant questions in the present case, however, are whether on a special appeal the Court of Appeal (the High Court) or the Supreme Court would have found that the impartiality of Judge Larsen or of the High Court judges was impaired because of his or their involvement in the case before the first-instance or the second-instance trial. Under the relevant provisions of the Act, the result of an appeal alleging that the first-instance judge or the second-instance judges lacked impartiality would have depended on the circumstances of the case as it stood before the City Court or later before the High Court. At that time - in 1981 and in 1983 - all relevant information could have been produced to and evaluated by the High Court or the Supreme Court. The only information available now, years later, in the case before this Court is a simple list of the number and contents of decisions made by various judges. It is not possible to arrive, solely on the basis of such a list, at a well-informed opinion on the partiality or impartiality of the trial judges.",

The doubts that have been raised as to whether this is also true where the decisions have been rendered under section 762(2) of the Act are an indication that the wording of this particular provision - as it appears in the translations - may not be fortunate. This, however, does not alter the fact that the strong traditions of the judiciary and the ability of the judges, deriving from their education and training, provide the necessary effective and visible guarantee of impartiality. Judicial control of the question whether the prosecution has reasonable grounds for requesting detention on remand, solitary confinement, searches and seizure, etc. is a function that is different from the court\u2019s evaluation of the evidence presented by the parties at the trial. For authorisation of detention on remand, information is not presented in the same way as evidence during the hearings before the trial court. The procedure is a summary one. Court sittings at the pre-trial stage are concluded in a matter of hours, whereas both of Mr Hauschildt\u2019s trials lasted for months. After the City Court had passed judgment, that judgment became an important factor for the High Court judges in determining whether Mr Hauschildt should remain in custody during his de novo trial on appeal.",

In the present case the City Court\u2019s first - and important - decision that Mr Hauschildt be detained on remand, that of 1 and 2 February 1980, was rendered not by Judge Larsen but by another judge (Mr Dalgas Rasmussen). Where the court proceedings last for several months, as in Mr Hauschildt\u2019s case, the rule in section 767 of the Act that detention on remand cannot be authorised for more than four weeks necessitates continued decisions on this matter during the trial.",

Indeed it is of course the trial judge (or appeal-court judge) who is the most familiar with the case and who consequently is the best placed to determine the appropriateness of or the necessity for the measures envisaged, even if this assessment requires him to adopt a fairly clear-cut position on the case.
