However, it appears that the ear injury was also recorded by the forensic medical expert earlier on that date (prior to the applicant\u2019s arrival at the ITT). It follows from the expert\u2019s report that the injury was sustained between seven and ten days before the examination and, as suggested by the applicant to the expert, was self-inflicted (see paragraph 17 above). While the applicant alleged that the expert had failed to record all his injuries, it does not appear from his submissions that he disputed the expert\u2019s conclusions as to the injury the latter had recorded.",

The X-ray examinations in June 2011 and in 2013 indeed confirmed the above diagnosis and also revealed a healed fracture of a bone in the applicant\u2019s right wrist.

It can be seen from the Government\u2019s submissions that the domestic authorities treated the ambulance record as a preliminary diagnosis that did not appear to have been confirmed at the hospital.
