As a rule, it was not possible to transfer the ownership of Crown land before it had been transformed into privately owned land (perinn\u00f6ksiosto, skattek\u00f6p). It was nevertheless possible to establish various rights relating to the enjoyment of the property and benefiting private individuals, municipalities or the Church. For example, the Crown could transfer a so-called permanent and exclusive right of possession in respect of the land, subject to a payment. Such a right required the land to be used for a specific purpose, and the Crown was entitled to regain possession of it either on payment of compensation or without having to redeem it. Over time the State\u2019s title to the land could change into an ordinary one, whereas it was not, for example, possible to change the amount of the payment (stadga) collected from the holder of a right attaching to the property.",

By upholding the State\u2019s ownership of the Berg\u00f6-H\u00f6gholm property, as registered in 1991, the Court of Appeal had in its judgment of 1996 effectively confiscated the applicants\u2019 property without any justification under the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01.

Their right to make use of the property had been equivalent to a right of ownership peacefully enjoyed for over 300 years, the sole limitation being that the legal title could not be transferred from the State to the owners of the Karsby mansion. In all other respects those owners had continuously enjoyed the rights and obligations pertaining to a de facto proprietary interest: the State had levied payments of a fiscal nature and later wealth tax; it had levied inheritance tax following Olof Bruncrona\u2019s death; the owners\u2019 right had been recorded as a right of perpetual usufruct in the official land register; and over the centuries the authorities had on several occasions confirmed the nature of that right.",

The Court of Appeal had thus deprived the applicants of the possibility of relying on any other means of evidence. All known relevant land-register extracts and court decisions had been produced in the domestic proceedings, and the transfer of the relevant right to the applicants\u2019 predecessors had never been based on a specific deed or agreement.

The evidence adduced had contained nothing to support the Court of Appeal\u2019s view that the applicants\u2019 right constituted a leasing right, as opposed to a right of perpetual usufruct. On the contrary, the permanent nature of their right had been clearly evidenced by the documentation and, by analogy, by the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment no. 1989:73.

The applicants had tried in vain to obtain confirmation either of their formal ownership of the property or of their right of permanent usufruct. The courts had twice examined whether ownership of the Crown land in question had been transferred from the State to the owners of the Karsby mansion, whether the owners of the mansion had a permanent right of usufruct in respect of the land and, if so, whether that right could be considered to constitute formal ownership. To that end the courts had examined legal documents from the 18th century onwards (in contrast to the position in The Holy Monasteries, cited above, p. 32, \u00a7 60). Different interpretations had been possible, as was demonstrated by the different decisions given by the courts. The legal experts relied on by the parties had also disagreed with one another. The Court of Appeal had found, in the light of the evidence adduced, that the applicants had never enjoyed full ownership or even a permanent right of usufruct, as the right originally afforded to the Karsby mansion had had the character of a mere lease. The restricted right of usufruct afforded by that lease did not under current domestic law entail a right of ownership on the mere ground that the property had been in the tenant\u2019s actual possession for a long time. It was not for the European Court to take the place of the national courts in determining whether the land in question belonged to the State or whether \u2013 contrary to the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of 1996 \u2013 the applicants should have been recognised as owners of the land on one legal basis or another.",

The first rule, set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The three rules are not \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, for example, Fredin v. Sweden (no. 1), judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 192, p. 14, \u00a7 41).",

The applicants could reasonably have expected at the very least to be informed of the date of the expiry of the lease in the notice of termination. Although the existing provision to this effect in current Finnish law (see the Rent on Land Act, paragraph 41 above) was not directly applicable in the present case, the same requirement should be regarded as a minimum under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
