She also claimed that she was not aware of the fact that she had to submit a request to renew the time-limit for lodging a complaint separately, and asked the court to provide her with an opportunity to do that. Her requests were granted and the examination of the case was postponed until 9\u00a0May 2006. On 19 April 2006 the applicant lodged a modified claim in which, inter alia, she asked the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court to (i)\u00a0annul the assessment of the value of the buildings made by the Centre of Registers, (ii)\u00a0to annul that part of the order of the authorities for her property rights to be restored in which the value of the buildings was indicated and (iii)\u00a0to renew the time-limit for lodging a complaint. On 9\u00a0May 2006, during the hearing at the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court, the applicant asked for the appointment of an expert to determine the market value of the buildings. On 6 June 2006 the court suspended the proceedings, appointed an expert and asked the expert (i)\u00a0what the market value of the buildings had been on 14 July 2003 and (ii)\u00a0what the market value of the buildings had been today, i. e. when the expert had been appointed. In April 2007 the expert stated that on 14 July 2003 the market value of the buildings had been LTL 56,850 (approximately EUR\u00a016,465) and that the market value of the buildings at the time that the examination of the case had started had been LTL 164,900 (approximately EUR 47,758). Subsequently the court proceedings were resumed, and on 21\u00a0September\u00a02007 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court held that the new assessment of value of the buildings was more accurate and decided to annul the assessment of value of 14\u00a0July 2003 by the Centre of Registers and that part of the decision of 9\u00a0October 2003 to restore the applicant\u2019s property rights in which the value of the buildings was set at LTL 36,000 (approximately EUR 10,426) (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above).

The decision establishing a legal fact had been taken on 28 May 2003 (see\u00a0paragraph 9 above). Without any significant delays the assessment of the value of the buildings had been undertaken on 14 July 2003, and on 9\u00a0October 2003, the authorities had decided to restore the applicant\u2019s property rights by paying her compensation in securities (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). The Government submitted that 9 October 2003 was the date on which the applicant\u2019s right to compensation had been recognised and that that was the date from which the duration of the restitution process had to be calculated. The Government held that the end date of the process of restitution in the applicant\u2019s case was 1 February 2011, when the transfer of securities had been concluded (see paragraph 23 above). That meant that the restitution process had lasted approximately seven years and four months, which was not unreasonably lengthy.",

Lithuania, no.\u00a027576/05, \u00a7 86, 21 July 2009; Igarien\u0117 and Petrauskien\u0117 v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 26892/05, \u00a7 58, 21 July 2009, and Pauk\u0161tis v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a017467/07, \u00a7 84, 24 November 2015). It follows that certain impediments to the realisation of the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions are not in themselves open to criticism (ibid.). It is true that in restitution proceedings the executive authorities are required to carry out a complex set of actions under the domestic legislation on restitution of property, rather than to perform a clear one-off act, such as payment of a particular amount of money (see Nekvedavi\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 1471/05, \u00a7 62, 10\u00a0December 2013). Even so, the Court has emphasised that that uncertainty \u2013 be it legislative, administrative or arising from the practices applied by the authorities \u2013 is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State\u2019s conduct. Indeed, where an issue in the general interest is at stake, it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time and in an appropriate and consistent manner (see Pauk\u0161tis, cited above, \u00a7 84; and Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a033202/96, \u00a7\u00a7 110 in fine, and 120 in fine, ECHR 2000-I).",

The Court notes that before that date the applicant had no legitimate expectation to restore her property rights. The Court considers that the fact that the authorities delayed in providing compensation to the applicant until 2011 amounted to interference with her right to property, within the meaning of the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Lyubomir Popov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 69855/01, \u00a7 119, 7\u00a0January\u00a02010). Furthermore, the Court is not insensitive to the complexities inherent in the restitution process and accepts that this interference was lawful, as there were no special time-limits for providing compensation under the relevant legislation, and was legitimately undertaken in the public interest, namely with the aim of protecting the rights of others, as the authorities needed to accommodate the claims of other owners in the rather complex restitution process.",

The Court also observes that the delay in the applicant\u2019s case amounted to approximately seven years and four months, that is to say from the decision of 9\u00a0October\u00a02003 to restore her property rights (see paragraph 11 above) until the finalisation of the transfer of securities on 1 February 2011 (see paragraph 23 above).",

The Court also notes that the applicant started several sets of court proceedings even later, repeatedly challenging the assessment of the value of the buildings (see paragraphs 18 and 25 above). After the amendment to the decision of 9\u00a0October 2003 was adopted on 5 June 2009 (see paragraph 22 above), it was for the applicant to submit a request for compensation in securities to the State Property Fund. However, she only did so on 16 August 2010 (see paragraph 23 above). In view of the above considerations, the Court considers that the restitution process was protracted in great part because of the conduct of the applicant. The Court therefore accepts that the Lithuanian authorities took the necessary actions in order to finalise the process of restitution for the applicant without undue delays (see paragraphs 22 - 24 above).",

The Court has also already accepted that Lithuania has chosen the principle of partial restitution to rectify old wrongs (see Pauk\u0161tis, cited above, \u00a7 81). The Court finds that as the first assessment of value was undertaken on 14 July 2003 and the decision to restore the applicant\u2019s property rights was taken on 9 October 2003 (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above), the assessment of the value of the buildings was at the value that they had in that particular year. In this context the Court cannot accept the applicant\u2019s claim that she should be compensated for the full market value of the buildings, since no such right had been guaranteed to her under the applicable domestic law or in the judgment of 21 September 2007 (see paragraphs 17 and 33 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, Nekvedavi\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7 20). The Court thus finds no reason to conclude that the compensation calculated was not pertinent.",
