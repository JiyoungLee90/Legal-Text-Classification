It should be recalled that in assessing the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings account must be taken of the state of the proceedings on the date of entry of the Convention into force in respect of the Contracting State (see, among other authorities, Billi v. Italy, judgment of 26 February 1993, Series A no. 257-G, \u00a7 16). In this respect, the Court observes that overall the proceedings had been pending for more than eight years before the Town Court. Moreover, a specific deficiency that occurred in the course of these proceedings consisted of unexplained procrastination in carrying out of the expert examinations which caused a delay of almost two years (see paragraph 12). The Government did not provide any explanation in this regard. Nevertheless, the Court recalls that the principal responsibility for the delay due to the expert opinions rests ultimately with the State (see Capuano v. , 25 June 1987, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 119). It is up to the courts to use the measures available to them under domestic law to maintain control over the proceedings. The Court considers therefore that in the circumstances of the present case the\u00a0above defect in the authorities\u2019 handling of the case at hand were serious enough to lead to a breach of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.",
