First, the criminal proceedings are conducted before a criminal court in order to determine whether the accused has committed an act constituting a criminal offence while lacking mental capacity and, if that proves to be the case, whether there is a high degree of probability that due to the reasons leading to his or her lack of mental capacity that person could commit a serious offence in the future. If all this is proven, the criminal court then imposes a psychiatric internment order which may last at most as long as the maximum possible sentence for the relevant offence. In the second stage of the procedure, on the basis of the internment order issued by the criminal court, a special procedure is instituted and conducted before a single judge of the relevant County Court for the adoption of the decision on the person\u2019s actual placement in the appropriate institution (see paragraphs 31-32 above).",

The reasons given for that decision were the same as the reasons cited for the refusal to hear oral evidence from the applicant\u2019s general practitioner, namely lack of expertise in psychiatry and the fact that the relevant medical record had been taken into account by E.S. (see paragraphs 17 above). These findings were accepted and upheld by the Zagreb County Court, acting as the court of appeal in the case. That court also considered that there was no reason to hear evidence from V.G. as he was not a certified court expert (see paragraphs 22 above).",

The domestic courts\u2019 reliance on the fact that E.S. had obtained the medical record held by the applicant\u2019s general practitioner, in a matter as important as an individual\u2019s internment in the psychiatric hospital, does not avert the risk that the medical record held by the general practitioner, without the supporting medical documentation, was incomplete to understand the reality of the applicant\u2019s situation.
