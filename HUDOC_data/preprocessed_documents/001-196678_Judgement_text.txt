The case originated in an application (no. 58764/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Mehmet Nida Garipoğlu (“the applicant”), on 14 October 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Feyzioğlu, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 22 November 2018 the Government were given notice of the complaint concerning Article 5 § 4 of the Convention and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Istanbul.
On 27 April 2009 the applicant was placed under detention on remand by the Istanbul Magistrates’ Court in Criminal Matters (“the Magistrates’ Court”) after being heard in the presence of his lawyer, on suspicion of committing murder.
On 31 August 2009 the Magistrates’ Court ordered the continued detention of the applicant on the basis of the case-file and without holding a hearing.
On various dates between 18 May 2009 and 12 November 2009 the applicant requested his release pending trial. The Magistrates’ Court rejected the applicant’s requests each time on the basis of the case file, without hearing the applicant.
On 17 November 2009 the Public Prosecutor filed an indictment with the Istanbul Assize Court, charging the applicant with complicity to premeditated murder.
In its first hearing on 26 February 2010, the Istanbul Assize Court heard the applicant in the presence of his lawyer, and dismissed his request for release and ordered the continuation of his detention.
On 30 April 2010 the Istanbul Assize Court ordered the applicant’s release.
On 18 November 2011 the applicant was acquitted by a decision of the Istanbul Assize Court.
