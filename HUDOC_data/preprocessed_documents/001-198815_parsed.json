It notes that the compensation proceedings initiated by the applicant against the Directorate and the Company solely pertained to the instantaneous interference which had occurred in 1995. During the course of the proceedings before the Bozcaada Civil Court, in particular, the period between 1996 and 2003, the applicant lodged four criminal complaints, as a result of which the Bozcaada Public Prosecutor filed three indictments, accusing certain people of theft or breaching the relevant law. The Court observes that during that period, where the applicant noticed several times that his land had been littered and used for quarrying stone, he only filed complaints before the Public Prosecutor, while it was open to him to institute administrative proceedings for compensation against the relevant public authorities, or civil proceedings against the persons indicated by the Public Prosecutor. The Court notes in that connection that the effectiveness of those remedies did not depend on the outcome of the criminal proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Kur\u015fun v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 22677/10, \u00a7 131, 30 October 2018).",

Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7\u00a066, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV). Moreover, an applicant who has exhausted a remedy that is apparently effective and sufficient cannot be required also to have tried others that were available but probably no more likely to be successful (see Lagutin and Others v. Russia, nos. 6228/09 and 4\u00a0others, \u00a7 75, 24 April 2014). The Court considers accordingly that the applicant was not obliged to have recourse to the remedy provided by Law no. 3091 in order to prevent the interference which occurred in 1995, as he had already initiated compensation proceedings, which prove to be the effective remedy regarding his complaint. In that connection it notes that, in the circumstances of the present case, the remedy under Law no. 3091 was unlikely to be as successful as the civil-law remedy, given that it did not provide appropriate civil redress such as compensation, and as the District Governor had already taken the necessary steps to prevent further damage to the stone quarry in 1995 (see paragraph 8 above). Consequently, the Court dismisses the Government\u2019s objection under this head.",

It notes that it dismissed similar arguments in previous cases (see Aka v. Turkey, 23\u00a0September 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 347, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI, and Sait I\u015f\u0131k v.
