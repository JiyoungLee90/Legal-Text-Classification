It notes that Article\u00a051 of the CCrP states that legal representation is mandatory unless expressly waived by the suspect or the accused, with the exception of certain categories of cases where this right cannot be waived at all (see paragraph 10 above). In the present case, the applicant was represented in the firstinstance proceedings by the lawyer Mr\u00a0F. and there is no indication that he intended to refuse legal assistance in the appeal proceedings. The Court notes that any waiver would have to be filed in writing and entered in the official records (Article 52 \u00a7 1 of the CCrP). No implicit waiver would therefore follow from the fact that the counsel who had represented the applicant in the first-instance proceedings was absent from the appeal hearing (see Grigoryevskikh v.
