The information gathered by the CPT during its visits to the North Caucasian region in late February/early March and in April 2000 strongly indicated that many persons were physically ill-treated in a detention facility at Chernokozovo during the period December 1999 to early February 2000. Ever since the beginning of March 2000, the CPT has been urging the Russian authorities to carry out a thorough and independent inquiry into events at this detention facility during that period. To date, an inquiry of the kind requested by the CPT has not been carried out and the Russian authorities have now made it clear that they have no intention of organising such an inquiry. A particularly disturbing aspect of the Russian authorities' current position is their contention that no facilities intended for accommodating detainees were established by public authorities in the area of Chernokozovo during the period referred to by the CPT.",

The CPT's delegation interviewed many persons who stated that they had been held in a detention facility at Chernokozovo during that period. Numerous Russian officials (prosecutors, investigators, custodial staff) met by the delegation confirmed that the establishment designated as from 8 February 2000 as SIZO no. 2 had prior to that date been used as a detention facility. The CPT is in possession of a copy of the medical journal of the establishment covering the period 8\u00a0November 1999 to 12 February 2000, in which the day by day arrival of detainees (and any injuries they bore) was recorded; the staff who completed that journal referred to the establishment first as an 'IVS' (temporary detention facility) and at a later stage as a 'temporary reception and distribution centre'. The Russian authorities have themselves, in earlier correspondence, provided to the CPT written statements signed by officers attesting to the fact that they worked in the detention facility during the period December 1999 to early February 2000 as well as written statements signed by persons who certified that they were held at Chernokozovo during that period.",

It transpires from that document that the real reason for the first applicant's detention was the suspicion of her having committed a criminal act. However, it appears that the domestic procedural requirements relating to the detention of criminal suspects were completely disregarded. No charges were brought against the applicant, no decision to detain or to release her was given by a competent authority, and her detention was not formally linked to any criminal investigation. She did not benefit from the procedural safeguards applicable to persons deprived of their liberty. The Court can only characterise such detention as arbitrary and in total disregard of the requirement of lawfulness.",

The Court notes a number of documents which are in contradiction even with this statement: the Decree of the Ministry of Justice of 8 August 2000 ordered the transfer of the pre-trial detention centre from the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria to that of the Chechen Republic (see paragraph 26 above), but in 2005 the prosecutor's service failed to obtain any information about the centre's alleged attachment to the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria prior to 8 August 2000 or to identify the persons who had served as guards there (see paragraphs 70-71 above).",

The Court finds it inconceivable that in a State subject to the rule of law a person could be deprived of his or her liberty in a detention facility over which for a significant period of time no responsible authority was exercised by a competent State institution. This situation fosters impunity for all kinds of abuses and is absolutely incompatible with the responsibility of the authorities to account for individuals under their control. Once brought to the attention of the competent bodies, it should have prompted urgent and comprehensive steps in order to identify and bring to justice those responsible, to provide redress for the victims and to ensure that no such situation would arise in the future.

However, this statement has not been substantiated. The Government did not produce any copies of these documents, or even disclose their content any further; nor can their content be ascertained from the documents in the investigation file submitted to the Court.

The prosecutor's order of 9 December 2005 cites the same facts as those set out in the decision of 21\u00a0May 2003 to open a criminal investigation. Thus, it does not appear that the investigation was able to establish the number of perpetrators of the killings, whether they had used any vehicles, the sequence of their actions, the routes they had taken to enter or to leave the village or the type of weapons they had used. Most notably, it does not appear that the investigation was able to discern any motive for the killings or to come up with an explanation as to what had happened on that particular night in Kalinovskaya. The Court further notes that the second applicant asked to be granted victim status in November 2003, but that a decision on the matter was not taken until 2005 (see paragraphs 34 and 77 above). The only information communicated to the victims, it appears, concerned the decisions to adjourn and to reopen the investigation, and these letters did not refer to any progress in solving the crime (see paragraph 80 above).",

Whether a member of the family of a \u201cdisappeared person\u201d is a victim of treatment contrary to Article 3 will depend on the existence of special factors which give the suffering of the relative a dimension and character distinct from the emotional distress which may be regarded as inevitably caused to relatives of a victim of serious violations of human rights. Relevant elements will include the proximity of the family tie, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, the involvement of the family members in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person and the way in which the authorities responded to those enquiries (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 357-360). In some cases the Court has extended the application of Article 3 to the relatives of persons who have been killed, where the news of their death was preceded by a marked period of disappearance, thus entailing the uncertainty, anguish and distress characteristic of the specific phenomenon of disappearances (see Luluyev and Others v. , no.\u00a069480/01, \u00a7\u00a0115, ECHR 2006...). The Court has consistently refused to extend the application of Article 3 to the relatives of persons who have been killed by the authorities in violation of Article 2, as opposed to the relatives of the victims of enforced disappearances (see Yasin Ate\u015f v.

Accordingly, in the light of the particular seriousness of the case, I am not persuaded that there are no special factors in this case which give the suffering of the second applicant a dimension and character distinct from the emotional distress which is inevitably caused to relatives of a victim of a serious human rights violation. I find it somewhat artificial that a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention should be limited to cases of \u201cdisappeared persons\u201d. Moreover, I note that some of the factors mentioned in paragraph 152 of the judgment, if they had been applied to the facts of the present case, would have carried particular weight. Thus, among the relevant factors, I would refer to the fact that the second applicant is the daughter of the first applicant and that her status as victim was recognised on 15 and 28 December 2005 by the investigating authority (see paragraph 77 of the judgment).",
