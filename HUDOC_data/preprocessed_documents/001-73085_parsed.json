On 10 March 1978 the applicants had concluded an agreement with the above company allowing the latter to build a block of flats and a restaurant on their land. In return the company would have 75% of the flats (twenty five in total) and a share equivalent to that percentage in the restaurant. The company had also undertaken to complete and deliver to the applicants in a specified period of time the remaining ten flats tantamount to a 25% share in the building. The applicants would also have a share of 25% in the restaurant. Following an agreement between the above company, the applicants and another company (A. Pieri Alakatoudi Beach Court Ltd) on 7\u00a0April 1978, the above company transferred all the rights it had in the block to A. Pieri Alakatoudi Beach Court Ltd.

Following an agreement on 26 March 1982 between the purchasers and A. Pieri Alakatoudi Beach Court Ltd, the flats were completed and delivered to the applicants and the purchasers.

The applicants argued that even though they had had the right to deal and use their possessions in theory, their ability to do so in practice had been greatly reduced since they had been unable to develop or receive income from their property and to recover possession of their flats. Furthermore, since the ownership of the share in the building had been essentially in dispute, the prospect of sale had been severely affected in that potential purchasers were deterred by the dubious legal position of the property. They noted that they could not have applied for title deeds due to the fact that the building had not yet been completed and that two interim orders had been issued in relation to the property in 1985 and 1986 in other actions taken against them.",

The report covered the period between 1985, when the proceedings had commenced, until 31\u00a0March 2004, the date the valuation report had been completed. The applicants finally pointed out that in the assessment of damages the loss of enjoyment and revenue they suffered due to the fact that they had been unable to benefit from the tourist development in the coastal area of Limassol where the property was situated, should be taken into account.",

Concerning in particular the applicants\u2019 claim for pecuniary damage they noted that the proceedings as such, and therefore also their duration, did not have negative repercussions on the applicants\u2019 property rights. In this respect they stressed firstly, that the proceedings did not concern the flats the applicants\u2019 had under the agreement but the ones pertaining to the plaintiffs under the relevant agreements with the defendant company. The applicants had not applied to the competent authorities for a certificate of approval for division of those flats and separate title deeds, enabling them to sell, transfer or mortgage them. In any event, even if the flats had been registered into the applicants\u2019 names, what affected their ability to deal with them was not the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for a declaratory judgment in the proceedings but the applicants\u2019 differences with the developers concerning their obligations under the agreement concluded with them and the repudiation thereof. Secondly, the applicants had not taken any steps to take possession of the flats occupied by the plaintiffs before or pending the proceedings and had not raised a counterclaim against them in the proceedings to this effect. Thirdly, no interim orders had been issued against the applicants in these proceedings preventing them to alienate or transfer the property to third parties or from registering the flats in their names or in the names of third parties.",

Under the initial agreement between the applicants and the company, the applicants were only entitled to 25% of the flats, which they took possession of in 1983. It notes that what was at stake in the proceedings was only the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in respect of the flats they had bought from the defendant company, i.e. the failure of the defendant company to fulfil its obligations towards them. In any event, the applicants have not made any counter-claims in the proceedings concerning their rights over the flats claimed by the plaintiffs or brought action for gaining possession of the remaining flats.
