The Regional Court found that the applicant had intimidated numerous persons by threats of murder, but that he could not be held responsible because he was suffering from a mental illness.

In a judgment of October 1991, the St. P\u00f6lten District Court (Bezirksgericht) had decided against the applicant.  The applicant had filed counter-claims for compensation in respect of an illness suffered while serving a prison sentence and had threatened terrorist attacks.

The Regional Court, having regard to the details stated in the applicant's various letters, found that his threats of murder were of such a nature as to intimidate third persons in general, and he had in fact intended to intimidate the persons concerned.

As the Public Prosecutor did not appeal, the Supreme Court had no power to convict the applicant and to impose a regular prison sentence on him. Thus, the present case is not comparable to cases in which an increase of sentence is at stake for the applicant (see the aforementioned Kremzow judgment, p. 45, \u00a7 67).",
