The applicant\u2019s arguments were summarised in the decision as follows: \u201cThe defence objected to the extension, considering that the preventive measure [in respect of the applicant] could be changed to a milder one.\u201d The court found, in particular, that the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case had not changed and there were no grounds to modify the preventive measure. The court established that the applicant had been charged in Uzbekistan with serious offences punishable by more than one year\u2019s imprisonment under Uzbek and Russian law, that he did not have permanent residence in , and that he might flee from justice if released. Furthermore, there were no circumstances, such as, for example, the applicant\u2019s state of health, precluding his detention. In these circumstances, the court found that the applicant\u2019s detention was \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d in order to secure his extradition to the Uzbek authorities.",

Contrary to the court\u2019s findings, the period of the applicant\u2019s residence in  without a valid registration had started running on 30\u00a0April 2011. The domestic law provided that a foreign national temporarily residing in Russia should have obtained such registration within seven days, and, accordingly, the seven-day period had not expired on the date of the administrative removal ruling of 4\u00a0May 2011. Thus, the applicant submitted that he had not breached the registration rules and requested that the administrative proceedings be discontinued. Furthermore, according to the applicant, the court had incorrectly admitted the administrative offence record, since it contained inaccurate information. He further claimed that the first-instance court had failed to establish all the relevant circumstances of the case and, in particular, had disregarded the fact that extradition and refugee status proceedings were pending. First, he could not be removed from  because his appeal in the asylum proceedings was pending before the domestic authorities. Second, a district court was not competent to examine the issue of the administrative removal of a person in so far as extradition proceedings had been opened against him.

That procedure consisted of, in particular, Article 466 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Code and the norms in its Chapter 13 (\u201cPreventive measures\u201d), which, by virtue of their general character and position in Part I of the Code (\u201cGeneral provisions\u201d), applied to all stages and forms of criminal proceedings, including proceedings for the examination of extradition requests.

As regards the subsequent period, the applicant had been remanded in custody pursuant to a court order and in accordance with the procedure and the time-limits set out in Article 109 of CCrP.

In particular, as confirmed by the Government, his detention from 29\u00a0October to 27\u00a0December 2010 had been based on a detention order issued by an Uzbek court. However, Chapter 13 and, in particular, Article 108 of the CCrP, on which the Government had relied, only referred to an order of a Russian court as a basis for detention. His detention on the basis of a foreign court\u2019s order had therefore been unlawful. He further argued that during that period he was deprived of protection against arbitrariness due to the ambiguity of the law and the prosecutor\u2019s failure to indicate the time-limits for detention in the decision of 31 October 2010, as well as to specify a legal provision which could serve as a basis for detention as from 7\u00a0December 2010. He further submitted that the detention order of 27\u00a0December 2010 had amounted, in essence, to an extension of unlawful detention, and therefore it had also been unlawful. Furthermore, the domestic court had disregarded the fact that in the meantime the applicant had applied for refugee status, he had been waiting for the outcome of the refugee status proceedings and therefore had no reason to abscond.",

In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the \u201cquality of the law\u201d, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. \u201cQuality of law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Khudoyorov v. , no.\u00a06847/02, \u00a7\u00a0125, ECHR 2005-X (extracts), Je\u010dius v.

The Court considers that this provision was neither precise nor foreseeable in its application, for the following reasons. First, Article 466\u00a0\u00a7 2, as follows from its wording, starts to apply from the moment of the receipt of the extradition request. In the present case, such request was received by the Irkutsk Transport prosecutor\u2019s office on 6 December 2010 (see paragraphs\u00a021-22 above), that is more than a month after the applicant\u2019s arrest had been ordered with reference to that provision. Second, in any event, Article\u00a0466 \u00a7\u00a02 remains silent on which procedure is to be followed when placing a person in custody or extending the term of such detention; nor does it set any time-limit for the detention.",

However, first, that Constitutional Court\u2019s decision did not contain any findings as to the procedures to be followed in situations covered by Article 466 \u00a7 2 of the CCrP actually applied in the present case (see paragraph 83 above). Second, the Court has already found that Article 108 of the CCrP could not serve as a suitable legal basis for the prosecutor\u2019s decision to place the applicant in custody on the ground that an arrest warrant had been issued against him by a foreign court, whilst Article 108 \u00a7 4 of the CCrP taken in conjunction with of Articles 5 \u00a7 48 and 31 \u00a7 2 of the CCrP refers to a court established and operating under Russian law (see Dzhurayev v.

This conclusion is further strengthened by the fact that the initial custody order of 31\u00a0October 2010 did not set any time-limit on the applicant\u2019s detention or refer to any legal provision establishing such a time-limit. This is incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and the protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see, mutatis mutandis, Baranowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056, ECHR 2000-III). The deprivation of liberty to which the applicant was subjected during that period was not circumscribed by adequate safeguards against arbitrariness. The Russian law therefore fell short of the \u201cquality of law\u201d standard required under the Convention.

No period of inactivity in the examination of the appeal was attributable to the domestic authorities.

In any event, the ineffectiveness of the procedure set out in Article\u00a0125 had been amply demonstrated in practice in his own case, since on 23\u00a0December 2010 the Sverdlovskiy District Court had refused to consider such complaint the merits. Furthermore, the complaints regarding the unlawfulness of the two persecutor\u2019s orders, even though submitted on four occasions in two sets of proceedings, including the extension proceedings, had remained unexamined by the domestic courts. He further reiterated the Court\u2019s earlier findings that neither Article 108 nor Article\u00a0109 of the CCrP entitled a detainee to initiate proceedings for examination of the lawfulness of his detention. He concluded therefore that the only available way of challenging the lawfulness of his detention was an appeal against the extension decision.

A remedy must be made available during a person\u2019s detention to allow that person to obtain speedy judicial review of its lawfulness. That review should be capable of leading, where appropriate, to release. The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Stoichkov\u00a0v.

It is not the Court\u2019s task to enquire into what would be the most appropriate system in the sphere under examination. It is not excluded that a system of automatic periodic review of the lawfulness of detention by a court may ensure compliance with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Megyeri v. , 12 May 1992, \u00a7 22, Series A no. 237-A). However, where an automatic review of the lawfulness of detention has been instituted, the decisions on the lawfulness of detention must follow at \u201creasonable intervals\u201d (see, among others, Herczegfalvy v.\u00a0Austria, 24\u00a0September 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 75 and 77, Series A no. 244, and Blackstock v. the United Kingdom, no. 59512/00, \u00a7 42, 21 June 2005). The rationale underlying the requirements of speediness and periodic judicial review at reasonable intervals within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 4 and the Court\u2019s case-law respectively is that a detainee should not run the risk of remaining in detention long after his deprivation of liberty has become unjustified (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, \u00a7\u00a088, ECHR 2003I (extracts), with further references).",

Article 5\u00a0\u00a7 4 does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention. However, where domestic law provides for an appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7 4, for instance as concerns the speediness of the review by appeal proceedings (see Lebedev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7 96, 25\u00a0October 2007). At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to proceedings before an appeal court. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right to judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 is primarily intended to avoid the arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Where detention is authorised by a court, subsequent proceedings are less concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention. Therefore, the Court would not be concerned, to the same extent, with the speediness of the proceedings before the appeal court if the detention order under review had been imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees (ibid.).",

The Court also observes that the District and Regional Courts were geographically rather close, which ought, in principle, to have contributed to swifter communication between them, particularly as far as the transfer of the case materials or the scheduling of the appeal hearings were concerned. It further appears that, having received the file, the appeal court started examining the file on 27\u00a0January 2011, that is, within the three-day time-limit set out in the domestic law (ibid.), and gave its decision on 31\u00a0January 2011, that is, six days after the date of the receipt of the case file.

The Court finds nothing in the case materials to depart from this conclusion and notes, in addition, that the applicant was not represented in the proceedings of 4\u00a0May 2011 (see paragraphs 59-62 above). At the same time, it is again reiterated that the fact that certain flaws in the procedure were found on appeal does not in itself mean that the detention was unlawful (see Gaidjurgis v. Lithuania (dec.), no.\u00a049098/99, 16 January 2001, and Benham\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, 10\u00a0June 1996, \u00a7\u00a047, Reports 1996III).",

First, the first-instance court had found that the applicant had chosen to stay in Russia voluntarily after the expiry of his registration on 9\u00a0December 2010, which was clearly at variance with the fact that between that date and 29\u00a0April 2011 he had been detained in , as confirmed by the release certificate from the remand prison. Second, as established by the appeal court, domestic legislation excluded, in non-ambiguous terms, the administrative removal of a person if refugee status proceedings were in progress in respect of him or her. Even assuming that this information was not available at the hearing of 4 May 2011, it is clear from the case file that the applicant and his lawyer consistently raised these issues, first, before the appeal court on 17 June 2011 and, more importantly, before the Kirovskiy District Court during a new examination of the administrative removal case on 5\u00a0July 2011. Furthermore, the Court agrees with the applicant that both the certificate from the remand prison confirming the date of the applicant\u2019s release and a copy of the applicant\u2019s appeal in the refugee status proceedings had already been made available to the appeal court on 17\u00a0June 2011, and to the firstinstance court at the time of the hearing of 5 July 2011. Moreover, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the Irkutsk Regional Court, when deciding on the remittal of the case on 17 June 2011, unambiguously indicated that the first-instance court at the outset was under an obligation to examine the complaint carefully, and reiterated that the purpose of the administrative proceedings as set out in Article 24.1 of the CoAO was to establish the circumstances of the case and examine it in its entirety. However, it appears that the first-instance court did not comply with these instructions on 5\u00a0July 2011. On that basis the  declared the applicant\u2019s administrative removal unlawful from the outset.",

In these circumstances, and given that the detention orders of 4\u00a0May and 5\u00a0July 2011 did not address the detention issue other than in the context of the necessity to ensure the applicant\u2019s administrative removal, the Court agrees with the assessment of the appeal court, which in the final instance acknowledged serious defects in the initial administrative removal order of 4\u00a0May 2011, reproduced in the decision on 5\u00a0July 2011 (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7 1\u00a0(c), Romanova v. , no. 23215/02, \u00a7 111, 11\u00a0October 2011, and contrast Alim, \u00a7 58, cited above, and Lui, \u00a7\u00a7 81-83, cited above).

In the present case, the appeal against the detention order of 4\u00a0May 2011, introduced by the applicant\u2019s lawyer on 6\u00a0May 2011, was examined by the Irkutsk Regional Court on 17\u00a0June 2011, that is, after forty-two days, even though the domestic law calls for examination of such cases within one day of the submission of the appeal (see paragraph 93 above).

It did not set a time-limit for the applicant\u2019s continued detention, or provide any reasons for it. It has been the Court\u2019s constant approach that permitting a detained person to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific limit on the duration of that detention would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see, among many others in the context of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7 1 (c), Chumakov v. , no. 41794/04, \u00a7 130, 24 April 2012, Avdeyev and Veryayev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 2737/04, \u00a7\u00a7 45-47, 9 July 2009, and Khudoyorov v.
