The Court also notes that there had to be a \u201cnear-certainty\u201d of loss of life to make expulsion an \u201cintentional deprivation of life\u201d prohibited by Article\u00a02 (see Dougoz v.

Turkey ([GC], no. 46221/99, ECHR 2005-IV), the Grand Chamber of the Court noted that the territories encompassed by the member States of the Council of Europe had become a zone free of capital punishment and that it could be said that capital punishment in peacetime, having regard, inter alia, to the fact that all member States had signed Protocol No. 6 and almost all had ratified it, had come to be regarded as an unacceptable form of punishment which was no longer permissible under Article 2 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 163; for a survey on the Council of Europe\u2019s stance regarding capital punishment, see \u00d6calan, \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 59). The Court, however, abstained from reaching any firm conclusion as to whether Article 2 of the Convention could be considered to have been amended so as to prohibit the death penalty in all circumstances (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0165) but concluded that it would be contrary to the Convention, even if Article 2 were to be construed as still permitting the death penalty, to implement a death sentence following an unfair trial, as an arbitrary deprivation of life was prohibited (\u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a046221/99, \u00a7\u00a0166, ECHR 2005IV). The Court also found that to impose a death sentence on a person after an unfair trial would generate, in circumstances where there existed a real possibility that the sentence would be enforced, a significant degree of human anguish and fear, bringing the treatment within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0168169).",

In these circumstances, Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi\u00a0v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0124-125, ECHR 2008-...). The establishment of such responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of conditions in the receiving country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention. Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the receiving country, whether under general international law, under the Convention or otherwise. In so far as any liability under the Convention is or may be incurred, it is liability incurred by the Contracting State which deports or, as in the present case, extradites an individual, by reason of its having taken action which has as a direct consequence the exposure of that individual to proscribed ill-treatment (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a089-91, Series A no.\u00a0161, and Garabayev v.

The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 162, Series A no.\u00a025). Furthermore, in considering whether treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it has adversely affected his or her personality in a\u00a0manner incompatible with Article 3. Even the absence of such a purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of this provision (see Peers v.\u00a0Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68 and 74, ECHR\u00a02001-III, and Vala\u0161inas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a0101, ECHR\u00a02001-VIII).",
