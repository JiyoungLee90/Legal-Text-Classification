In July 1994 and June 1995 the village guards had helped members of the PKK to ambush security forces. In the first incident, three members of the security forces had lost their lives and fifteen of them had been injured, and in the second incident fifteen members of the security forces had been killed. According to the report, as a result of pressure from the PKK the villagers moved to the Atrush camp in northern  in July 1994.\u00a0\u00a0Following the closure of the Atrush camp by the United Nations, the villagers had returned to their homes in December 1997. Thirteen persons who had been involved in the illegal activities of the PKK had then surrendered to the authorities and seven of them had been put on trial after having been questioned. However, the residents of the Ormanc\u0131k hamlet, particularly the women who had been questioned by the authorities on their return, had not mentioned anyone having been killed. Nor had they made any such allegations to the authorities. Consequently, it was considered that the allegations were unfounded.",

Special considerations may apply in exceptional cases where an applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of circumstances which make that remedy ineffective. In such a situation, the six-month period may be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware, or should have become aware, of these circumstances (see Hazar and Others (dec.), cited above; Bulut and Yavuz (dec.), cited above; and Bayram and Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m (dec.), cited above).",

In this connection, the Court observes that the applicants submitted that they left Turkey and went to  to live in a refugee camp which was under the control of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. According to their submissions, the applicants left northern  and returned to \u015eemdinli only after the United Nations had closed down the camp (see paragraph 10 above). The Court further observes that the Government did not deny the veracity of this claim, nor did they claim or attempt to demonstrate that the applicants had actually been living in  during those years. In any case, the \u015eemdinli public prosecutor who conducted the initial investigation referred to the applicants\u2019 statement that they had been in  until the autumn of 1997 and did not question the authenticity of this claim in his report of 13\u00a0April 1999 containing a request for the punishment of two military officers. Besides, the report of the Human Rights Commission attached to the Turkish Grand National Assembly also states that the applicants were in Northern Iraq between July 1994 and December 1997 (see paragraph 14 above).",

In the Court\u2019s view, in the instant case, the applicants could not have been expected to initiate an investigation in  concerning the alleged events of July 1994 while they were living as refugees in a camp in another country. The Court therefore concludes that special circumstances prevented the applicants from using domestic remedies during this period.",

(cited above), and Hazar and Others (dec.) (cited above). In the case of Bulut and Yavuz (dec.) (cited above), the applicants alleged that they had become aware of the ineffectiveness of the proceedings almost five years after the last decision taken in the investigation. In its decision in that case, the Court considered that the applicants, whose close relative had been killed, might be expected to display a certain amount of diligence and initiative in informing themselves about the progress made in the investigation and ruled that the applicants had been negligent in that respect.\u00a0The Court similarly declared Hazar and Others (dec.) (cited above), inadmissible, holding that the applicants, who had not availed themselves of any remedy for seven years after the destruction of their homes, should have become aware of the ineffectiveness of the remedies much earlier.",

Firstly, most of the applicants in the present case are rural women who are illiterate and who do not speak Turkish. Secondly, they had to leave their village and then their country, for more than three years after the alleged events took place, during which time they lived as refugees. In the Court\u2019s view, therefore, they could not have been expected to have applied to the domestic authorities immediately after their return to  in the autumn of 1997. Nevertheless, they contacted Mr Geylani (a member of parliament at that time) in July 1998 and explained the events that had allegedly taken place in July 1994 (see paragraph 13 above). Furthermore, in 1998 and 1999 a parliamentary investigation took place at Mr Geylani\u2019s request, based on the applicants\u2019 account of events. The Court further notes that in 1998 and 1999 the applicants made statements when they were summoned to testify in the investigation which was initiated by the \u015eemdinli public prosecutor of his own motion (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). They cooperated with the prosecutor and provided him with evidence. In fact, this investigation continued to be actively conducted by the prosecutor, who carried out a detailed examination of the events in question before asking the Hakkari public prosecutor to lodge a bill of indictment with the  in April 1999 accusing the two military officers of various crimes (see paragraph 19 above).",

Besides, unlike the cases referred to by the Government, the applicants in the present case have not claimed that they lodged their case pending an investigation because they found the latter ineffective.

Furthermore, as the Court held recently, the nature of the investigations into disappearances is such that relatives of a disappeared person may be justified in waiting lengthy periods of time for the national authorities to conclude their investigations. Thus, in the case of Er and Others v. Turkey (no. 23016/04, \u00a7\u00a7 55-58, 31 July 2012) the applicants, who had waited for a period of almost ten years after the disappearance of their relative before lodging their application, were held to have complied with the six-month rule because an investigation was being conducted at the national level into the disappearance (see, a contrario, Yeti\u015fen v. Turkey (dec.), no. 21099/06, 10 July 2012).",

Nevertheless, given that the \u015eemdinli public prosecutor did not find it necessary to conduct separate investigations into the above-mentioned allegations and considering that the examination of the compliance with the six-month rule is intrinsically linked to the investigation conducted, the Court finds that the aforementioned factors which were taken into consideration in the case of Er and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45-60) are also relevant in the present case.",

In these circumstances, the Court concludes that this decision was not served on the applicants. As the Court has considered that the applicants could reasonably have awaited the outcome of the investigation (see paragraph 40 above) and since the decision of the Van Regional Administrative Court was not served on the applicants before their lawyer requested information from the \u015eemdinli public prosecutor\u2019s office, the Court is of the opinion that 5 April 2002, that is the day after the date on which the applicants\u2019 lawyer was notified of the decisions in the investigation, should be taken as the starting-point of the six-month period.",

The second and primary factor is the absence of a judicial investigation into the alleged killing.

The Court finds it more appropriate to deal with the consequences of this failure when examining the applicants\u2019 complaint concerning the Government\u2019s alleged failure to fulfil their obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation (see paragraphs 70-78 below).",

The Court has stressed in that connection that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention (see, for example, \u0130pek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0187; Ucar, cited above, \u00a7 163; and Er and Others, cited above, \u00a7 102).",

The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5 of the Convention. Bearing in mind the responsibility of the authorities to account for individuals under their control, Article 5 of the Convention requires them to take effective measures to safeguard against the risk of disappearance and to conduct a prompt and effective investigation into an arguable claim that a person has been taken into custody and has not been seen since (see Er and Others, cited above, \u00a7 103, and Akdeniz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0129 and the authorities cited therein).",

In the view of the Court, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of detainees. Furthermore, the absence of records of such details as the date, time and location of the detention, the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention, the name of the person effecting it and the time and date of release must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Er and Others, cited above, \u00a7 104, and Akdeniz, cited above, \u00a7 130).",

Spain (Article 50), 13 June 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 16-20, Series A no. 285C; and \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 127). The Court has found that the authorities were liable under Article 2 of the Convention for the disappearance and death of the applicants\u2019 relatives (see paragraphs 60 and 63 above). The Court observes that although the applicants have failed to submit to the Court itemised claims detailing their loss of financial support, the fact remains that the applicants\u2019 missing and deceased relatives had been providing their families with a living and this has not been disputed by the Government. In these circumstances, the Court finds it established that there was a direct causal link between the violation of Article 2 and the applicants\u2019 loss of the financial support provided by their missing and deceased relatives.",
