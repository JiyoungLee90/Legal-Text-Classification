The Chamber observed that, during her employment, the applicant had contributed to the social-security system as required by the law.

Following an analysis of different lines of cases concerning legitimate expectations, the Court concluded that its case-law did not contemplate the existence of a \u201cgenuine dispute\u201d or an \u201carguable claim\u201d as a criterion for determining whether there was a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It took the view that \u201cwhere the proprietary interest is in the nature of a claim it may be regarded as an \u201casset\u201d only where it has a sufficient basis in national law, for example where there is settled case-law of the domestic courts confirming it\u201d (see Kopeck\u00fd, cited above, \u00a7 52).",

In this line of cases, the \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d was thus based on a reasonably justified reliance on a legal act which had a sound legal basis and which bore on property rights (see Kopeck\u00fd, cited above, \u00a7 47). Respect for such reliance follows from one aspect of the rule of law, which is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention and which implies, inter alia, that there must be a measure of legal protection in domestic law against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see, as a recent authority, Kar\u00e1csony and Others v.

The principles which apply generally in cases under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are equally relevant when it comes to social and welfare benefits (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, \u00a7 54). The Court has previously addressed the issue of legitimate expectation in the context of social benefits on a number of occasions (see, for example, Kjartan \u00c1smundsson v. Iceland, no.\u00a060669/00, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 2004IX, and Klein v. Austria, no. 57028/00, \u00a7 45, 3\u00a0March 2011.",

Such insurance schemes, which are typically mandatory, provide such protection, that is, the availability of benefits, for the entire period of insurance and on every occasion when the conditions of the insurance are satisfied. The relevant legal conditions are however subject to evolution. In this connection, it may be reiterated that in Gaygusuz v. Austria (16\u00a0September 1996, \u00a7 41, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV) the Court found that the right to emergency assistance \u2013 a social benefit linked to the payment of contributions to the unemployment insurance fund \u2013 was, in so far as provided for in the applicable legislation, a pecuniary right for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In Klein (cited above, \u00a7\u00a043) it was noted that entitlement to a social benefit \u2013 in that instance, a pension payable from a lawyers\u2019 pension scheme \u2013 was linked to the payment of contributions, and, when such contributions had been made, an award could not be denied to the person concerned. Contributions to a pension fund may thus, in certain circumstances and according to the domestic law, create a property right (see Kjartan \u00c1smundsson, cited above, \u00a7 39; Apostolakis v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a039574/07, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 35, 22\u00a0October 2009; Bellet, Huertas and Vialatte v.\u00a0France (dec.), nos.\u00a040832/98, 40833/98 and 40906/98, 27\u00a0April 1999; Sk\u00f3rkiewicz v.

This is the case when there is a direct link between the level of contributions and the benefits awarded (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, \u00a7 43). The payment of contributions to a pension fund may in certain circumstances create a property right in a portion of such a fund and a modification of the pension rights under such a system could therefore in principle raise an issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1; even if it is assumed that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 guarantees to persons who have paid contributions to a special insurance system the right to derive benefit from the system, it cannot be interpreted as entitling that person to a pension of a particular amount (see M\u00fcller v.

Accordingly, from 2001 until 2009/10, that is, for almost ten years, the applicant fulfilled all the conditions of eligibility for receiving a disability pension as of right (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, \u00a7 51, quoted in paragraph 80 above). The decision granting her a disability pension in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Act and which formed the basis of her original entitlement could thus be regarded as representing an \u201cexisting possession\u201d (see Kopeck\u00fd, \u00a7 35(c)). Further, it seems undeniable that throughout the said period, she could, on the basis of the said \u201clegal act\u201d, entertain a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 47) of continuing to receive disability benefits should her disability persist to the requisite degree, there being no dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law (ibid., \u00a7 50).",

The Court finds it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one and will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see, mutatis mutandis, The former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2000-XII; Wieczorek, cited above, \u00a7 59; Frimu and Others v.

However, the fair balance test cannot be based solely on the amount or percentage of the reduction suffered, in the abstract.

This element gains particular importance in view of the fact that the applicant did not have any other significant income on which to subsist (see paragraph\u00a025 above; compare also Kjartan \u00c1smundsson, cited above, \u00a7 44) and that she evidently had difficulties in pursuing gainful employment and belonged to the vulnerable group of disabled persons (see Alajos Kiss v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a038832/06, \u00a7 42, 20 May 2010).

A possession is a subjective right, defined by domestic law. It exists only if it exists in domestic law and it exists only to the extent that it is recognised in domestic law. The domestic law defines, in particular, the right-holder, the right-obligors, the content of the right and the scope of the obligors\u2019 obligations correlated with this right, as well as the tools for and degree of the protection. The importance of this last element should not be underestimated, as it co-defines, together with other elements, the content of the right itself. A right exists as a right with a certain strength. Some rights are unconditional and enjoy strong protection, including protection vis-\u00e0-vis the legislator, whereas some rights are precarious and enjoy weak protection, especially vis-\u00e0-vis the legislator.",

In principle, the legislator is free to decide whether or not a specific interest will be protected by subjective rights (possessions in the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1). If the legislator is free to create possessions, then it is logical to recognise that it is also free to determine the strength of a right\u2019s protection. If the legislator was free not to grant a specific right at all, then is there any reason that say that it could not grant a precarious and conditional right?

                        "content": "35.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant brought two requests based on the law on disability allowances (Act no. CXCI of 2011). As indicated above, that law made the entitlement to a disability allowance dependent on two conditions: a health condition and a \u2013 now stricter \u2013 contribution condition (see \u00a7 30 above). The first request was rejected on 5 June 2012 on the ground that she did not fulfil the new contribution condition (see paragraph 19 of the judgment). The second request was also rejected, by a decision taken on 23\u00a0November 2012 and confirmed by an appellate body on 27 February 2013, and the applicant\u2019s challenge to that decision was rejected by the Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za Administrative and Labour Court on 20 June 2013, again on the ground that the applicant did not fulfil the new contribution condition (see paragraphs 21-23 of the judgment). The applicant does not argue that the interpretation or the application of the new law by the domestic authorities was arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable, and we see no reason to conclude that they were. As indicated above, the Court has consistently held that no legitimate expectation for the purpose of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 can be said to arise where there is a dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law and where, as here, the applicant\u2019s submissions are subsequently rejected by the national courts (see \u00a7 10 above). Thus, the conclusion to be drawn from the fact that the applicant\u2019s requests were rejected on the ground that she did not fulfil one of the conditions laid down by the applicable law on disability allowances is that her claims had no basis in the new law or, in other words, that she had no \u201cenforceable claim\u201d under that law.",

In this regard, we would like to point to the reasoning in the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision no.\u00a040/2012 (XII.6.) AB (see paragraph 33 of the judgment), where it held that the Fundamental Law which replaced the former Constitution as of 1 January 2012 provides for general State objectives, rather than for rights conferred on individuals, as far as its Article XIX on social security is concerned. Moreover, the legislature was already expressly entitled to reduce, transform into a social allowance or terminate disability pensions under the former Constitution, as from 6 June 2011. The Constitutional Court also referred to its well-established case-law, which does not interpret the State\u2019s obligation to guarantee basic subsistence as a source of specific, directly enforceable constitutional rights. We are therefore not persuaded that the constitutional principles relied on by the applicant created an enforceable right, to be implemented by the legislature.",

Neither has it ratified the European Code of Social Security or ILO Conventions Nos. 102 and 128 (see paragraphs 38, 40 and 41 of the judgment): it has thus not accepted the undertaking to secure at least a reduced invalidity benefit for those persons who have completed a period of five years of contribution prior to the contingency (see paragraph 42 of the judgment). In addition, the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (see paragraph 39 of the judgment), although ratified by Hungary, do not contain any specific obligation that would entitle the applicant to a disability benefit.",
