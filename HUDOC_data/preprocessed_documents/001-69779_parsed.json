It reasoned that the general rule under Article 120 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution was that administrative acts were subject to judicial review unless otherwise provided by statute. The commissions' decisions affected the individuals' rights and were thus administrative acts within the meaning of Article 120 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution and section 2 of the APA. Since the exclusion of judicial review of the commissions' decisions was set out in statutory instruments, it was invalid and their decisions were appealable before a court. In a number of those judgments and decisions the court also relied on Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and, in particular, its access-to-a-court requirement (\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 1580 \u043e\u0442 4 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 1999 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 4869/1998 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u0406 \u043e.; \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 4491 \u043e\u0442 6 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442 1999 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 937/1999 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u0406 \u043e.; \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 446 \u043e\u0442 1 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 2000 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 3513/1999 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u0406 \u043e.; \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 3450 \u043e\u0442 30 \u043c\u0430\u0439 2000 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 7347/1999 \u0433, \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u0406 \u043e.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 6475 \u043e\u0442 3 \u044e\u043b\u0438 2002\u00a0\u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 2611/2002 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432).",

It must therefore determine whether the CLEMC's decision to deny the applicant firstdegree disability status was decisive for a civil right of his. In this connection, the Court notes that under Bulgarian law, as in force at the material time, the amount of a disabled's pension was directly dependent on the degree of his or her disability (see paragraph 17 above). Moreover, a person would be entitled to a supplement to his or her pension depending on whether he or she was deemed a disabled in need of another person's assistance or not (see paragraph 18 above). It could thus be concluded that the CLEMC's determination, with which the applicant disagreed, was directly decisive for the rights in issue. This was also the view of the , expressed in a series of decisions and judgments delivered in 19992002 (see paragraph 24 above). Furthermore, the Court notes that this determination was made on the basis of specific criteria contained in the law and that the CLEMC apparently had no discretion in this respect (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). It is also beyond doubt that the pension and the related benefits, which were purely economic in nature, were civil rights within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Francesco Lombardo, cited above, pp. 2627, \u00a7 17, SchulerZgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, p. 17, \u00a7 46, and Massa v. Italy, judgment of 24 August 1993, Series A no. 265B, p. 20, \u00a7\u00a026).

As regards procedural guarantees, it appears that the commissions had no clear rules of procedure (see H v.
