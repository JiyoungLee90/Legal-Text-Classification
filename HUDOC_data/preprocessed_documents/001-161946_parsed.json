Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination.

Russia (dec.), no. 33408/03, 6 May 2004).

This conclusion was reached by the Court in view of the maintaining of several consecutive supervisory review levels at both regional and federal level, the existence of an overall six-month time-limit open to differing interpretations, and not least the unfettered powers of the President of the Supreme Court and his or her deputy to reverse any decision taken by a judge of the same court dismissing a supervisory review application (see Martynets, cited above).",

In the Markova application a new decision was delivered partially satisfying the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, and in the Trapeznikov and Bychkov and Others applications the matter was sent back to the lower courts. The proceedings were then continued in the light of the presidia\u2019s findings before first-instance and second-instance courts, which partially granted the applicant\u2019s claims in the Trapeznikov application and dismissed all of the applicants\u2019 claims in the Bychkov and Others application.
