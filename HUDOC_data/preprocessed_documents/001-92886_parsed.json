However, as stated above, while this element is to be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 and may justify a longer period of detention than in a case concerning an individual offender, a member of an organised criminal gang is entitled to the protection against unreasonably lengthy detention afforded by this provision (see paragraphs 34, 37 and 38 above). As in other numerous similar detention cases, the authorities did not justify the applicant's continued detention by relevant and sufficient reasons (see paragraphs 32-37 above). Moreover, as demonstrated by the ever increasing number of judgments in which the Court has found Poland to be in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in respect of applicants involved in organised crime, the present case is by no means an isolated example of the imposition of unjustifiably lengthy detention but a confirmation of a practice found to be contrary to the Convention (see, among many other examples, Celejewski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, 4\u00a0May 2006; K\u0105kol v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a03994/03, 6\u00a0September 2007; Malikowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a015154/03, 16 October 2007). Consequently, the Court sees no reason to diverge from its findings made in Kauczor as to the existence of a structural problem and the need for the Polish State to adopt measures to remedy the situation (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-62 ).",
