The aim of the assembly in which the applicant had taken part conflicted with public order considerations, as St Bernard's Church had been occupied with a view to defending and legitimising a deliberate breach of the French immigration rules that rendered those responsible liable to prosecution. The unlawfulness of the assembly was therefore particularly flagrant and the very purpose of that assembly in itself entailed a breach of public order.

The fact that the occupied building was a place of worship, whose use was regulated by the Law of 9\u00a0December 1905 on the Separation of Church and State, meant that the assembly could not be classed as peaceful. Contending that the parish priest's refusal to intervene sufficed to establish that the assembly was peaceful in nature would be tantamount to saying that he was the sole person qualified to determine the extent of the harm done to public order and freedom of religion. Responsibility for implementing the Law of 9\u00a0December 1905 lay with the ordinary law-enforcement authorities, who were under a duty to maintain public order and to ensure that the premises were reserved for worship, in the interest of the congregation. The Court of Cassation had already ruled that the ecclesiastical authorities had no obligations of a material nature, such as ensuring safety.
