In the instant case the Court notes that, according to the correspondence in the file, the applicant purportedly sent his first letter on 7 October 2003 by registered post and that the Court never received it. By a fax of 21 June 2004 the applicant requested information about his application. On 23 June 2004, the Court Registry informed him that his application had not been received and requested him to re-send his application form. By a letter dated 3 August 2004 the applicant sent the receipt of the registered letter (which indicates that he received the receipt on 10 October 2003) for his missing application form. On 7\u00a0December 2004, he re-sent his full application form dated 7 October 2003. In light of the foregoing, the Court observes that the full application form was resubmitted on 7 December 2004 with the receipt of the registered post which shows that the applicant\u2019s application form dated 7\u00a0October 2003 was missing even though it was sent by registered post. In the light of the registered post receipt submitted by the applicant, the Court considers the date of introduction of the application to be 7 October 2003 (see \u00d6zbent and Others v.

Turkey, 9\u00a0June 1998, \u00a7 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-IV, and \u00c7iraklar v.\u00a0Turkey, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 39, Reports 1998-VII). The Court also found in \u00d6calan (v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7\u00a7 114-15, ECHR 2005IV) that when a military judge participated in one or more interlocutory decisions that remained in effect during the criminal proceedings in question, the military judge\u2019s replacement by a civilian judge in the course of those proceedings, before the verdict was delivered, failed to dissipate the applicant\u2019s reasonably held concern about that trial court\u2019s independence and impartiality, unless it was established that the procedure subsequently followed in the State Security Court sufficiently allayed that concern. In this connection, it is necessary to examine the nature of the procedural acts carried out with the participation of the military judge and to verify whether the proceedings on the merits were properly renewed after the military judge had been replaced (see Ceylan v. Turkey (dec.), no. 68953/01, ECHR 2005X).",

                                        "content": "33.\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the Court notes that the military judge was only present at one preliminary hearing and three hearings on the merits. In those three hearings, six of the accused, including the applicant, gave evidence in person and some minor procedural acts were carried out. Moreover, none of the other five accused made any statements, be it incriminatory or not, in respect of the applicant. However, the fact remains that the applicant made his initial defence submissions before a court whose bench included a military judge. The Court is aware that the hearing of an accused by a court is an important procedural step on the merits in a criminal case. Thus, it has to ascertain whether the State Security Court in its new composition properly renewed that procedural act. In this connection, the Court notes that after the removal of the military judge from its bench, the trial court held fourteen more hearings and the case was examined by three civilian judges. Moreover, both the applicant and his lawyer were able to put forward their detailed defence arguments, including the ones against the public prosecutor\u2019s opinion on the merits, during those hearings (by contrast Akg\u00fcl v. Turkey, no. 65897/01, \u00a7 24, 16 January 2007). Likewise, the witnesses who made incriminating statements in respect of the applicant were also heard by the trial court composed of three civilian judges who ultimately delivered the judgment and the applicant was able to submit his views in respect of those witnesses before the same court (compare and contrast \u00c7amlar v. Turkey, no. 28226/04, \u00a7 44, 10 November 2015). The above considerations, taken cumulatively, are sufficient to warrant the conclusion that the procedure followed by the State Security Court in its new composition is sufficient to allay the applicant\u2019s reasonably held concerns about the trial court\u2019s independence and impartiality. Therefore, the Court finds that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the replacement of the military judge before the end of the proceedings disposed of the applicant\u2019s reasonably held concern about the trial court\u2019s independence and impartiality (see Kabasakal and Atar v.\u00a0Turkey, nos.\u00a070084/01 and 70085/01, \u00a7 34, 19 September 2006)",

The Court does not consider it necessary to examine whether the systematic nature of the restriction on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer was, in itself, sufficient to find a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention, as, in any event, the Government have not offered any compelling reasons for the restriction or demonstrated that the absence of legal assistance at the initial stage of the investigation did not irretrievably prejudice the applicant\u2019s defence rights (Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 58; and Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, \u00a7 274.)

Moreover, it did not examine the admissibility of evidence at the trial. Likewise, the Court of Cassation dealt with this issue in a formalistic manner and failed to remedy this shortcoming (see, Bayram Ko\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 38907/09, 5\u00a0September 2017).",
