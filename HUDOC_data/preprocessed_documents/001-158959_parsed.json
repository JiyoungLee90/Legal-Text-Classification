The concept of \u201cpossessions\u201d has an autonomous meaning which is independent of the formal classification in domestic law (Former King of Greece and Others v.\u00a0Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2000-XII). \u201cPossessions\u201d can be \u201cexisting possessions\u201d or assets, including claims in respect of which an applicant can argue that he has at least a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d (which must be more concrete than a mere hope) that they will be realised, that is, that he or she will obtain effective enjoyment of a property right (see Gratzinger and Gratzingerova v. the Czech Republic (dec.) [GC], no.\u00a039794/98, ECHR 2002-VII, \u00a7 69, and Kopeck\u00fd v. Slovakia [GC], no.\u00a044912/98, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2004-IX). A claim may be regarded as an asset only when it is sufficiently established to be enforceable (see Kopeck\u00fd, cited above, \u00a7 49; and Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis\u00a0v.\u00a0Greece, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-B, p.\u00a084, \u00a7 59). By way of contrast, the hope of recognition of the existence of an old property right which it has long been impossible to exercise effectively cannot be considered as a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, nor can a conditional claim which lapses as a result of the non-fulfilment of the condition (see Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 42527/98, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2001VIII). In the Court\u2019s view, a claim is conditional when it depends upon an uncertain future event. No \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d can come into play in the absence of a claim sufficiently established to constitute an asset.",

Consequently, the application did not concern \u201cexisting possessions\u201d of the applicant himself.

Such a decision does not of itself confer on a claimant property rights or any other rights whatsoever. Under domestic law, the recognition of a claimant\u2019s property rights was contingent upon the Commission, which was the competent administrative authority to deal with former owners\u2019 restitution and compensation of property claims (see Ramadhi and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a025). The Commission did not automatically allow a claimant\u2019s application for the restoration and/or compensation of his alleged property rights, which had been acknowledged by a court pursuant to Article 388 of the CCP. It had to ensure that the application complied with the statutory requirements as laid down in the Property Act. The Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent case-law lends support to the view that such a court decision did not suffice to recognise automatically a claimant\u2019s property rights (see paragraph 22 above).",
