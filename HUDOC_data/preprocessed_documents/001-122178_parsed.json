The court also held that further detention on remand was the only preventive measure capable of securing the proper course of the proceedings until the delivery of a final judgment. In particular, the court pointed to the high risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding, resulting from the severity of the imposed penalty.

The court first of all made clear that lifting the detention order or commuting it to another, less rigorous preventive measure, would be unacceptable in the circumstances of the case. Further, it restated the grounds invoked in the previous decisions which had extended the applicant\u2019s detention and confirmed that these grounds remained valid. Lastly, the Court of Appeal concluded that, given the nature and the gravity of the applicant\u2019s charges, the period of his detention on remand had not been excessive. It nevertheless acknowledged that the overall duration of the applicant\u2019s detention had been relatively long, and considered it appropriate to shorten the period for which it would be further extended.",
