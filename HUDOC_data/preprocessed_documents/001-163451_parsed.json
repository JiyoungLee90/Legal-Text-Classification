As the first and second applicants had still not substantiated their personal identities or given a credible statement concerning their place of residence in Sudan, the Minister considered that they had not established that they did not belong to the group of more highly educated people able to reject the practice of female circumcision. The Minister also considered that the second applicant constituted a danger to public order, having accepted a negotiated penalty (transactieaanbod) in order to settle out of court a criminal charge for shoplifting.",

The parental freedom of choice (as the court understands, whether or not to have their daughters circumcised) is connected to the cultural attitudes of the family and surroundings. Women with a higher education in larger towns will generally not have their daughters circumcised. This will generally not give rise to problems from their social environment. The term \u2018women with a higher education\u2019 is to be understood to mean women who have had an academic or higher vocational education. According to the official report of 3 February 2004, women with a low level of education living in rural areas have little choice.

It considered that, pursuant to section 31 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Aliens Act 2000 (Vreemdelingenwet 2000), it was for the applicants to demonstrate as plausible those facts and circumstances which could lead to the conclusion that they were eligible for admission pursuant to the policy in force, and not for the Minister to demonstrate the opposite. As not only the applicants\u2019 statements about their identity and origin but also their asylum statement had been found to lack credibility in a decision of 17\u00a0January 2002 which had obtained the force of res iudicata, the Minister could reasonably have found that the applicants had not made out a persuasive case to show that they complied with the conditions for admission under the policy concerned, that the authorities could not provide them with protection, and that there was no internal relocation alternative for them. No further appeal lay against this ruling.",

In such circumstances, Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country. \u00a0Article 3 principally applies to prevent a deportation or expulsion in cases where the risk of illtreatment in the receiving country emanates from intentionally inflicted acts by the public authorities there or from non-State bodies when the authorities are unable to afford the applicant appropriate protection (see N.\u00a0v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 26565/05, \u00a7\u00a7 30-31 with further references, ECHR 2008).",

The Court has further noted that, although the reported average prevalence rate of FGM in Sudan varies between 68% and 88%, action is being taken in Sudan, both within government and by NGOs, to combat FGM in all its forms and these efforts have resulted in both a perceptible decline in the prevalence of FMG and a noticeable drop in support for this practice (see paragraph 32 above).",
