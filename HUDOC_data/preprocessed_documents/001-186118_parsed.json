However, when read in conjunction with the whole leaflet, the statements had a \u201cpillory effect\u201d and amounted to a serious interference with Dr S.\u2019s personality rights, which was not justified by the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression. The court came to this conclusion based on the facts that the applicant had singled out Dr S. by mentioning him by name and distributing the leaflets in the vicinity of his practice, that he had quoted the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment only in parts and had omitted the parts that stated that doctors had not been subject to criminal liability, that he had implied by defining aggravated murder that Dr S. had committed this criminal offence and that he had associated Dr S. with the Holocaust. Nonetheless, in regard to non-pecuniary damage the court concluded that even though the attacks on Dr S.\u2019s reputation had been grave enough to justify the injunction, they had not been sufficiently serious to justify non-pecuniary damage.",

However, it partly modified the Regional Court\u2019s judgment concerning the precise wording of the requested injunction. It ordered the applicant to desist from asserting in public that Dr S. performed unlawful abortions in his medical practice and asserting in direct connection to this that \u201caggravated murder is the intentional \u2018bringing-to-death\u2019 of an innocent human being\u201d. The Court of Appeal further ordered the applicant to desist from asserting that Dr S. performed unlawful abortions causing \u201cinfanticide\u201d. At the outset, it emphasised that the applicant\u2019s view that abortions should be subject to criminal liability and were not compatible with higher-ranking law fell within the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression. However, the court also noted that the very wording of the applicant\u2019s statements showed that he labelled abortions, as performed by the plaintiff, aggravated murder, which could not be tolerated, neither if the statements were considered statements of fact nor if considered value judgments. In the court\u2019s view the applicant had created an unacceptable \u201cpillory effect\u201d by singling out the plaintiff, who had not given the applicant any reason to do so. In that regard the court noted that Dr S. had not been involved in the public debate about abortions in any way.",

Similarly to the first leaflet, a not negligible part of the readers would have understood from the leaflet that Dr S.\u2019s professional activities had constituted aggravated murder. However, even if understood in a non-legal sense, the leaflet had made it understood that the applicant had conducted illegal and punishable abortions. Since the applicant had not clarified that he had only been criticising abortions, which were according to the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court (see paragraph 17 below) unlawful but not subject to criminal liability, he had exceeded the limits of justifiable criticism. As to the claim for damages the Court of Appeal upheld the firstinstance judgment. It also did not grant leave to appeal on points of law.",

In contrast, the applicant even reinforced the assumption that the abortions provided by Dr\u00a0S. were subject to criminal liability by providing his own definition of aggravated murder in international law in the first leaflet and calling abortions \u201cinfanticide\u201d in the second leaflet. The Court therefore agrees with the domestic courts, that, when taking into account the leaflets as a whole, they could be understood as alleging that Dr S.\u2019s professional activities constituted aggravated murder. This conclusion is not called into question by the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Annen (cited above), since in that case the leaflet in question had provided sufficiently clear further explanation, according to which the abortions were not subject to criminal liability.",

The Court notes that the applicant has neither in the domestic proceedings nor before the Court submitted any indication that Dr S. committed aggravated murder or that the abortions performed by him were subject to criminal liability. Moreover, in so far as the applicant argued before the Court that abortions could be considered aggravated murder within the meaning of Article 211 of the Criminal Code, the Court notes that there is no evidence for that argument in domestic law or domestic case-law. In contrast, Article 218 of the Criminal Code clearly defines abortions that are not exempted from criminal liability under Article 218a of the Criminal Code. In sum, the Court finds that, even assuming that the applicant\u2019s statements were to be considered value judgments, there was not a sufficient factual basis for calling abortions as performed by Dr S. \u201cmurder\u201d. In that regard the Court also notes that these accusations were not only very serious, something reflected in the fact that a conviction for aggravated murder would carry a life sentence, but might also incite to hatred and aggression.",

In addition the injunction was limited in scope and \u201conly\u201d prevented the applicant from stating that Dr S. was performing unlawful abortions and putting these within the same context as \u201caggravated murder\u201d, and/or expressly characterising them as \u201cinfanticide\u201d. In that regard the Court notes that the applicant was not per se prohibited from campaigning against abortions or criticising doctors that conducted abortions.",
