Thus, with reference to Article 15 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court considered that the first-instance court was empowered not to apply Article 281 of the Code and to rely directly on the Constitution. That approach allowed the trial court to proceed with the reading-out of the pre-trial deposition despite the absence of consent from one of the parties. The Supreme Court interpreted Article 281 as requiring consent from both parties only when the trial court decided to read out a pre-trial statement of its own motion rather than in response to a request from one of the parties.",

If a party insisted on calling a witness whose testimony might be important to the case, the court had to take all available measures to ensure that witness\u2019s presence in court. Where that witness was available for questioning, the reading-out of his or her deposition should be considered inadmissible evidence and should not be relied upon. However, where the witness was not available for questioning, the defence was still to be provided with appropriate procedural safeguards such as a challenge to the deposition in question, a motion to challenge it by way of examining further evidence or a pre-trial face-to-face confrontation between that witness and the defendant, at which the latter was given an opportunity to put questions to the former (see also the admissibility decision of 7 December 2006 (no.\u00a0548-O)).",

There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence.\u00a0As a general rule, paragraphs 1 and 3\u00a0(d) of Article 6 require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he makes his statements or at a later stage (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, \u00a7\u00a051, Reports 1997III, L\u00fcdi v. Switzerland, 15\u00a0June 1992, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 238). Indeed, as the Court has stated on a number of occasions (see, among other authorities, L\u00fcdi, cited above, \u00a7 47), it may prove necessary in certain circumstances to refer to statements made during the investigative stage. If the defendant has been given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge the statements, their admission in evidence will not in itself contravene Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention (see, for instance, Belevitskiy v. , no. 72967/01, \u00a7\u00a0117, 1\u00a0March 2007). The corollary of that, however, is that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on statements that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined at some stage of the proceedings, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see Unterpertinger v. Austria, 24\u00a0November 1986, \u00a7\u00a7 31-33, Series A no. 110; Sa\u00efdi v. France 20\u00a0September 1993, \u00a7\u00a7 43-44, Series A no.\u00a0261-C; Luc\u00e0 v.

Bulgaria, no.\u00a060018/00, \u00a7 43, 8 June 2006). The Court also considers that while the appearance of a witness is a prerequisite for the defence\u2019s opportunities to confront this witness, there must also be an adequate opportunity to question him or her (see Kaste and Mathisen v.\u00a0Norway, nos.\u00a018885/04 and 21166/04, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2006...).",

Mr Isgr\u00f2 had also been able to repeat in person his claims before the firstinstance and appeal courts. Despite the fact that Mr Isgr\u00f2 had not been represented during the confrontation in question, the Court noted that the public prosecutor had likewise been absent, and that the purpose of the confrontation did not render the presence of the applicant\u2019s lawyer indispensable. The Court also noted that the national authorities had made efforts to take evidence from the witness in person; having been unable to do so, they had based their decision solely on the witness\u2019s pre-trial statements; those statements had been made by him to an investigating judge, whose impartiality had not been contested; the courts had regard to other testimony and to the observations submitted by the applicant during the investigation and at the trial. Since it had been open to the applicant to put questions and to make comments himself, the Court concluded that the applicant enjoyed the guarantees secured under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) to a sufficient extent.",

Russia (dec.), no.\u00a060333/00, 9\u00a0November 2006). The Court noted that the applicant had not explained in what other respect the confrontations had been procedurally deficient and why further questioning of the above witnesses before the trial court had been necessary. The Court was not provided with any evidence that the defence had somehow been placed in a disadvantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis the prosecution during the face-to-face confrontations. Lastly, noting that the applicant\u2019s conviction on the relevant charges had not been based solely on the testimonies of the above witnesses, the Court held that although the latter had been absent at the trial, the applicant\u2019s right under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a03 (d) had been properly secured at the pre-trial investigation stage (see also, for similar reasoning, Vozhigov v.

The Court\u2019s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among other authorities, Van Mechelen, cited above, \u00a7 50, and Doorson, cited above, \u00a7 67; see also Babkin v.

The national courts\u2019 analysis in the present case was limited to stating that S.\u2019s absence at the trial was counterbalanced by the fact that the applicant had had a previous opportunity to question him during the pre-trial face-to-face confrontation (see paragraph 38 above).",

The Court has previously underlined the importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of the criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the trial (Can v. Austria, no.\u00a09300/81, Commission report of 12 July 1984, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 96, and, more recently, Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a036391/02, \u00a7 54, 27\u00a0November 2008). At the same time, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 54). Thus, it is unlikely that in the absence of legal advice the applicant was in a position to understand the confrontation procedure and effectively exercise his right to examine a \u201cwitness\u201d with a view to casting doubt on the authenticity and credibility of S.\u2019s incriminating statement.

It is uncontested in the present case that the applicant\u2019s representative before the Court was in possession of a valid authority form and that the only reason for refusing her permission to see the applicant was the absence of a formal request from the latter. The Court observes that although the Code of Execution of Sentences did not require a prisoner to make a formal request in order to have a meeting with his or her lawyer, the prison authorities relied on the secondary legislation, which apparently contradicted the Code (see paragraphs 47 and 48 above). Be that as it may, there is no doubt that the prison staff took steps to obtain such a request from the applicant on 2\u00a0August 2006. As is clear from Mr Sm.\u2019s report, the representative was required to wait outside the prison administrative building in the meantime. Apparently, she was not given any indicative time when she would be able to see the applicant. However, there is insufficient factual evidence before the Court to enable it to consider that the prison staff subsequently acted in a way which would amount to unjustified interference with the applicant\u2019s right of individual petition.",
