In the present case, the Austrian courts were not to be blamed for their inactivity as initially, under the Turkish legislation applicable to the proceedings at issue, no decision on the custody could be taken since such decision had to be taken in the framework of divorce proceedings which were at the time still pending. After the applicant's new request for custody of F. in June\u00a01996, the courts acted without delay. The Government further pointed out that a transfer of F.'s custody from his father to the applicant could at no time be considered as granted. The procedural steps taken in the proceedings at issue exclusively served the best interest of the children.",

The Court notes that the applicant lost factual custody of F. when leaving the common household with her husband at the end of May 1991.

The case hinges, however, on the question whether the Austrian courts were under a duty to decide on the custody of F. before he moved to . For this reason the Court will view the case as one involving an allegation of failure on the part of the respondent State to comply with a positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention. In this connection, the Court recalls that the essential object of Article\u00a08 is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities. However, there may in addition be positive obligations inherent in effective \u201crespect\u201d for family life which may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for family life even in the sphere of relations between individuals (see, amongst other authorities, Kosmopoulou\u00a0v. , no. 60457/00, \u00a7 43-46, 5 February 2004, with further references). Furthermore, the Court has repeatedly found that in cases concerning a person's relationship with his or her child, there is a duty to exercise exceptional diligence in view of the risk that the passage of time may result in a de facto determination of the matter. This duty is decisive in assessing whether a case concerning access to children had been heard within a reasonable time as required by Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention and also forms part of the procedural requirements implicit in Article\u00a08, Hoppe\u00a0v. , no. 28422/95, \u00a7 54, 5 December 2002 (see, inter alia, Nuutinen v.

This event, in itself, does not reveal anything about the outcome of the custody dispute between the applicant and her former husband and, in any event, cannot be imputed to the Austrian authorities. The Court observes, however, that before jurisdiction moved to Turkey the proceedings at issue were pending for more than five years and five months before the first instance court in , namely the Kirchberg/Wagram District Court. The Court notes that the applicant had a considerable interest in the outcome of these proceedings. Furthermore, the passage of time certainly did not play at her advantage as F. had been left at a very young age in the factual custody of his father. However, the proceedings before the District Court were, above all, characterised by its inactivity. The Court notes in this regard that the applicant filed her request for custody of F. in July 1991. Seven months later, in February 1992, the District Court informed her that for the time being it would not take any measures in this regard. It did not react upon the applicant's further requests for custody of F., made in April 1992 and June 1996 respectively, until June\u00a01997 when it found that it had no longer jurisdiction to deal with the case.",
