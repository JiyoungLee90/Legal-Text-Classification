The applicant was an Armenian citizen which meant that he was entitled to all the rights and freedoms, and was subject to all the obligations prescribed by the Constitution and laws, regardless of his convictions. Military service was a constitutional obligation of all citizens. While Section 12 of the Military Liability Act prescribed a number of exceptions to this rule, they did not include such grounds as being a Jehovah's Witness. Thus, exemption from compulsory military service on a ground not prescribed by law would have been in breach of the principle of equality and non-discrimination. The fulfilment of an obligation prescribed by the Constitution could not be considered as an interference with the applicant's rights, since all citizens were subject to such duties regardless of their religious convictions. In the case of Valsamis v. Greece the Commission considered that Article 9 did not confer a right to exemption from disciplinary rules which applied generally and in a neutral manner (judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996VI, \u00a7\u00a036). Furthermore, this Article did not give conscientious objectors the right to be exempted from military or substitute civilian service, and it did not prevent a Contracting Party from imposing sanctions on those who rejected such service (see Heudens v. Belgium, application no.\u00a024630/94, Commission decision of 22 May 1995, unreported). Relying on this and a similar finding made in the case of Peters v. the Netherlands (application no. 22793/93, Commission decision of 30 November 1994, unreported), the Government contended that there had been no interference with the applicant's freedom of thought or conscience. In sum, there had not been a violation of Article 9.",

However, the question of whether this or that Article of the Convention was applicable to the present case was to be considered from the point of view of the interpretation of the Convention existing at the time when the events of the case took place. The applicant was convicted in the years 2001-2002 and his conviction at that time was in line with the approach of the international community. Moreover, as already indicated above, the conviction for conscientious objection was also considered to be lawful and justified under the Convention. Nor did the rights guaranteed by Article 9 in any way concern exemption from compulsory military service on religious, political or any other grounds. The above-mentioned cases of Heudens and Peters, even if about ten years old, were the latest decisions on the matter and the Court had not rendered since then a single judgment which reached different conclusions. Besides, the Court did not recognise the applicability of Article 9 to the disputed relations even in its more recent judgments. In the case of Thlimmenos v. Greece the Court did not find it necessary to examine whether the applicant's initial conviction and the authorities' subsequent refusal to appoint him to a chartered accountant's post amounted to interference with his rights under Article 9. The Court did not address the question of whether, notwithstanding the wording of Article\u00a04 \u00a7 3 (b), the imposition of such sanctions on conscientious objectors to compulsory military service might in itself infringe the rights guaranteed by Article 9 ([GC], no.\u00a034369/97, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 2000IV). The Court had a similar approach in the case of \u00dclke v.  (no.\u00a039437/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a053-54, 24 January 2006). Based on the above, the Government insisted that up until now, and moreover in the period when the circumstances of the case took place, conviction for conscientious objection was not considered to infringe the rights guaranteed by Article 9 and the Armenian authorities had therefore acted in compliance with the requirements of the Convention. Given the established case-law on this matter, they could not anticipate the possibility of a new interpretation of Article 9 by the Court and consequently could not make their actions comply with that possible \u201cnew approach\u201d. In conclusion, the fact that the Convention was a \u201cliving instrument\u201d did not in this case imply modification of the Court's approach to the question of applicability of Article 9.",

So if each of them insisted that military service was against their religious convictions, a situation would arise in which not only members of Jehovah's Witnesses but also those of other religious organisations would be able to refuse to perform their obligation to defend their home country. Furthermore, the Constitution prescribed three types of obligations towards the State, namely defence of home country, payment of taxes and duties, and respect for laws and the rights and freedoms of others. Consequently, members of Jehovah's Witnesses or any other religious organisation might equally assert that, for instance, payment of taxes and duties was against their religious convictions and the State would be obliged not to convict them as this might be found to be in violation of Article 9. Such an approach was not acceptable taking into account the fact that a person, in order to avoid the fulfilment of his or her obligations towards the State, could become a member of this or that religious organisation. Based on the above, the Government asserted that religious convictions could not serve as a means for a citizen to avoid the fulfilment of obligations prescribed by the Constitution.",

Thus, at present conscientious objectors were being convicted only if they also refused to perform the alternative service. As regards the obligation to pardon all conscientious objectors sentenced to prison terms, the Government insisted that the authorities had complied with it by exempting the applicant from serving the imposed sentence.

Furthermore, this right was also confirmed by the 2004 Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe. Considering the \u201cliving instrument\u201d doctrine, the applicant asked the Court to review the Commission's and Court's case-law which allowed Article\u00a04\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 (b) to override the guarantees of Article 9, in the light of the evolution of the law and the current practice among member states, the greater majority of which had recognised the right of conscientious objection.

It follows also from PACE Opinion No. 221 (2000) that the Armenian authorities were well aware of the general recognition by member states of the right to conscientious objection and of the different resolutions previously adopted by the Council of Europe on the rights of conscientious objectors. The Armenian Government, at that time, assured the Committee of Ministers of its full compliance with this principle by committing itself to \u201cpardon all conscientious objectors sentenced to prison terms\u201d. This was in conformity with \u201cpresent-day\u201d conditions which existed in the Council of Europe in 2000. Thus, the claim by the Government that they \u201ccould not anticipate the possibility of new interpretation of Article 9\u201d was misleading. Furthermore, the Government's arguments concerning the refusal to pay taxes could not apply to the present case since, as opposed to the recognition of the right of conscientious objection, the non-payment of taxes because of religious convictions could not be said to be regional practice that had become a binding rule on new members of the Council of Europe.",

As far as public safety and the protection of public order were concerned, no court made any attempt to explain how his conviction was connected with the pursuit of such aims. Finally, given the customary practice now adopted by most of the member states, the imposition of criminal sanctions on conscientious objectors, even in those few member states that had not yet implemented alternative civilian service, could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society.  acknowledged this when it undertook a commitment to refrain from imprisonment of conscientious objectors even before such a law was passed as a condition of membership in the Council of Europe.

Austria, in which the Commission stated that, in interpreting Article 9 of the Convention, it had also taken into consideration the terms of Article 4 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Convention which states that forced or compulsory labour shall not include \u201cany service of a military character or, in cases of conscientious objectors, in countries where they are recognised, service exacted instead of compulsory military service\u201d. This provision clearly showed that, by including the words \u201cin countries where they are recognised\u201d in Article 4 \u00a7 3 (b), a choice was left to the High Contracting Parties to the Convention whether or not to recognise conscientious objectors and, if so recognised, to provide some substitute service. The Commission, for this reason, found that Article 9, as qualified by Article\u00a04\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 (b), did not impose on a state the obligation to recognise conscientious objectors and, consequently, to make special arrangements for the exercise of their right to freedom of conscience and religion as far as it affected their compulsory military service. It followed that these Articles did not prevent a State which had not recognised conscientious objectors from punishing those who refused to do military service (no. 5591/72, Commission decision of 2 April 1973, Collection 43, p. 161).",

In the case of A. v.

The Court did not find it necessary in that case to examine whether the applicant's initial conviction and the subsequent refusal interfered with his rights under Article 9. It stated, in particular, that it did not have to address the question of whether, notwithstanding the wording of Article 4 \u00a7 3 (b), the imposition of such sanctions on conscientious objectors to compulsory military service might in itself infringe the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion guaranteed by Article 9 (see Thlimmenos, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 53).",

Instead, this issue was examined under Article 3, a violation of which was found since the multiple convictions were considered to amount to degrading treatment as they caused the applicant severe pain and suffering which went beyond the normal element of humiliation inherent in any criminal sentence or detention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 63-64).",

The Court does not doubt that the applicant's objection to compulsory military service was based on his genuine religious convictions and accepts that the very fact that Armenia, by its declaration, officially committed itself to the outside world, must have given him a legitimate expectation to be allowed to perform alternative service after the entry into force of the new law instead of having to serve a prison sentence.

The Council of Europe (as far back as 1987), the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the European Parliament have all underscored this point. Indeed, the respondent state's own declaration made in 2000 confirmed its acceptance of what were, even then, current and common European legal standards in this area and its subsequent conduct in convicting and imprisoning the applicant was inconsistent with its recognition of those standards and its commitment to apply them in practice.

It is evident that the Court regards the question as one that raises important issues of human rights. In Thlimmenos v. Greece the Grand Chamber considered that, unlike other criminal offences, a conviction for refusing on religious and philosophical grounds to wear the military uniform cannot imply any dishonesty or moral turpitude and that the ongoing adverse consequences of the applicant's earlier criminal conviction in this regard (a prohibition on entry to a profession) was sufficient to constitute a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article\u00a09. In Stefanov v. Bulgaria the Court agreed to strike out the case when satisfied that a settlement reached between the parties \u201cwas based on respect for human rights\u201d as defined in the Convention. Its decision recorded in detail the terms of the settlement which provided for the dismissal of all criminal proceedings against the applicant (and others) for refusing to perform military service, the elimination of all penalties imposed, the furnishing of undertakings by the respondent state to introduce legislation providing for a total amnesty of these cases and for a purely civilian alternative to military service and, finally, for the payment of the applicant's costs and expenses. Six years later, in \u00dclke v.  the Court found that the repeated imprisonment of a peace activist for refusing to serve in the military constituted a violation of Article 3. It considered that the domestic law had failed to make provision for conscientious objectors and did not provide an appropriate means of dealing with refusals to perform military service on account of one's beliefs. In view of the foregoing, it would appear that the majority's finding is not just incompatible with current European standards on the question of conscientious objection but that it parts company with the Court itself in terms of the overall direction of the jurisprudence as discernible in the case law.",

The onus was on that state to demonstrate this necessity, all the more so in circumstances where it had already confirmed its recognition of and commitment to current European standards in this area. It has not established that the applicant's imprisonment was necessary, thus failing the proportionality test, and this failure confirms me in my view that there has been a violation of Article 9. Insofar as the majority did not carry out the supervisory function reserved to this Court, its approach, it seems to me, is not consistent with the Court's practice in interpreting the necessity of state interference with a protected Convention right.",
