On the other hand, what was decisive for the person\u2019s reintegration into society was whether or not the information mentioning his or her name was still accessible, even though material published on the Internet was generally less widely disseminated than that broadcast on television or radio or in the press. The Court of Appeal also noted the risk that other persons, such as a neighbour, an employer or co-workers, could identify the applicants\u2019 names and contribute to a further spread of old material about the applicants\u2019 involvement in the crime, thereby jeopardising their resocialisation.",

The Court of Appeal added that the radio station was thus responsible for the interference with the applicants\u2019 rights and that it could not argue that the information in question was contained only in digital archives. In the court\u2019s view, the archived information was accessible in the same way as any other information available on the radio station\u2019s website.

The Federal Court of Justice began by observing that the provision of the impugned material constituted interference with the exercise of the applicants\u2019 right to protection of their personality (allgemeines Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsrecht) and their right to privacy under Articles 1 \u00a7 1 and 2 \u00a7 1 of the Basic Law and Article 8 of the Convention. Those rights had to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press as guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Basic Law and Article 10 of the Convention (see \u201cDomestic law\u201d, paragraph 46 below). Owing to its particular nature, the scope of the right to protection of personality was not defined in advance but had to be assessed by weighing it against the divergent interests at stake; in order to do so the courts had to take into account, in particular, the specific circumstances of the case and the rights and freedoms protected by the Convention.",

Referring to the criteria established in that regard by the Federal Constitutional Court and its own case-law, the Federal Court of Justice observed in particular that truthful reports could infringe personality rights where the damage they caused outweighed the public\u2019s interest in knowing the truth, for instance when dissemination had a significant impact or when the report stigmatised the person concerned and thus had the effect of isolating him or her socially. However, reports concerning criminal offences were part of contemporary history, which the media had a responsibility to report on. In that regard the Federal Court of Justice observed that the more a case went beyond the scope of ordinary criminal behaviour, the greater the public interest in being informed about it. In the case of reports on topical events, the public\u2019s interest in being informed generally took precedence over the right of the person concerned to protection of his or her personality. In the Federal Court of Justice\u2019s view, anyone who broke the law and harmed others should expect not only to receive criminal sanctions, but also to be the subject of reports in the media.",

Referring to the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court and this Court\u2019s judgment in \u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk v. Austria (no. 35841/02, \u00a7 68, 7 December 2006), however, the Federal Court of Justice pointed out that even if offenders had served their sentence, they could not claim an absolute right no longer to be confronted with their wrongdoing. The courts were called upon to consider the seriousness of the infringement of the right to personality and the offender\u2019s interest in resocialisation; in that regard, account had to be taken of the way in which the person concerned was presented in the report and, in particular, the extent of its dissemination.",

It acknowledged that the applicants\u2019 interest in no longer being the subject of reports concerning their crime was considerable, since the crime had been committed a long time previously and they had been released from prison, the first applicant in August 2007 and the second in January 2008. However, in the view of the Federal Court of Justice, in the circumstances of the case the impugned passage from the report of 14 July 2000 did not affect the applicants\u2019 personality rights in a significant manner (erheblich), as it was not liable to cause them to be \u201cpilloried for all time\u201d or to draw them into the spotlight (ins Licht der \u00d6ffentlichkeit zerren) in a way that would stigmatise them again as criminals.",

In the view of the Federal Court of Justice, the passage in question did not stigmatise the applicants as the perpetrators of the crime or as murderers, but stated that the two brothers had been convicted of murder after a six-month criminal trial based entirely on circumstantial evidence and that they continued to protest their innocence; this left it open to the reader to conclude that they had been wrongly convicted. The Federal Court of Justice found that there was therefore no doubt that, on the day on which the transcript of the report had been posted on the radio\u2019s website, the identification of the applicants in the radio programme had been justified in view of the seriousness of the crime, the fact that the victim had been well known, the considerable public attention the crime had received and the fact that the applicants had tried after 2000 to have their convictions quashed using all conceivable remedies (alle denkbaren Rechtsbehelfe).",

The resulting obligation for the radio station to regularly check all its archives would unduly restrict its freedom of expression and freedom of the press. In view of the time and personnel that such checks would entail, the Federal Court of Justice found that there was a real risk that Deutschlandradio would cease to archive its reports or would omit information \u2013 such as the names of the persons concerned \u2013 that might subsequently make such reports unlawful, even though the public had an interest worthy of protection in having access to it.",

In a judgment of 22 February 2011 concerning the second applicant and relating to an article published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily newspaper on 14 January 2005, the Federal Court of Justice noted that, according to the findings of the Regional Court, the applicant had contacted the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung daily newspaper in August and November 2004 and requested it to continue reporting on him. The newspaper had responded to the request by publishing an article (containing text and photos) about the second applicant. The Federal Court of Justice concluded that, under these circumstances, the public\u2019s interest in being fully (umfassend) informed about the criminal act in question had not weakened or, at least, had resumed in the summer of 2004. This was further demonstrated by the numerous reports regarding the second applicant that could be found until June 2006 on the website of his criminal lawyer. Hence, the applicant had at that time been in the public eye and had not been unlawfully drawn into the spotlight by the publication of the article (no. VI ZR 346/09).",

The case originated in a complaint lodged by a Spanish national with the Spanish Data Protection Agency against a Spanish daily newspaper and Google. The applicant had complained that, when an Internet user entered his name in Google\u2019s search engine, the list of results displayed links to two pages of the newspaper mentioning his name in connection with an auction following attachment proceedings. He had requested the newspaper either to remove or alter those pages so that the personal data relating to him no longer appeared or to use certain tools made available by search engines in order to protect his data. He had also requested Google to remove or conceal the personal data relating to him so that they ceased to be included in the search results and no longer appeared in the links to the newspaper. While the Spanish Agency had rejected the complaint against the newspaper, it had upheld the complaint against Google, which brought an action before the Spanish courts. It was in the context of this judicial dispute that the case was referred to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling.",

It stated that, in so far as the activity of a search engine could be distinguished from and was additional to that carried out by publishers of websites and also affected the fundamental rights of the person concerned, the operator of the search engine had to ensure in particular that the guarantees laid down by the directive could have full effect. Moreover, given the ease with which information published on a website could be replicated on other sites, effective and complete protection of data users, and particularly of their right to privacy, could not be achieved if they had to obtain first or in parallel the erasure of the information relating to them from the publishers of websites. The CJEU concluded that the operator of a search engine was obliged to remove links to web pages that were published by third parties and contained information relating to a person from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of that person\u2019s name, including in cases where the name or information had not been erased beforehand or simultaneously from those web pages and even, as applicable, when its publication on those pages was in itself lawful.",

That was so in particular where they appeared to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to those purposes and in the light of the time that had elapsed. The CJEU concluded that, as the persons concerned had a right under Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the European Union\u2019s Charter of Fundamental Rights to ensure that the information in question relating to them personally should no longer be linked to their name by a list of results, and they were thus entitled to request that the information in question no longer be made available to the general public on account of its inclusion in such a list of results, those rights overrode, as a rule, not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in having access to that information through a search relating to the names of the persons concerned. However, according to the CJEU, that would not be the case if it appeared, for particular reasons such as the role played by the persons concerned in public life, that the interference with their fundamental rights was justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having, on account of its inclusion in the list of results, access to the information in question.",

In examining this balance the Court must have regard, among other factors, to the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, \u00a7 23, Series A no. 91, and Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 98), and to the principles established in its settled case-law regarding the essential role played by the press in a democratic society, which includes reporting and commenting on court proceedings. It is inconceivable that there can be no prior or contemporaneous discussion of the subject matter of trials, be it in specialised journals, in the general press or amongst the public at large. Not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas; the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 79-81).

However, because of this amplifying effect on the dissemination of information and the nature of the activity underlying the publication of information on the person concerned, the obligations of search engines towards the individual who is the subject of the information may differ from those of the entity which originally published the information. Consequently, the balancing of the interests at stake may result in different outcomes depending on whether a request for deletion concerns the original publisher of the information, whose activity is generally at the heart of what freedom of expression is intended to protect, or a search engine whose main interest is not in publishing the initial information about the person concerned, but in particular in facilitating identification of any available information on that person and establishing a profile of him or her (in this connection, see also the CJEU judgment of 13 May 2014, No C-131/12, paragraphs 59-62 above).",

The Federal Court of Justice also noted that the applicants had tried up to and beyond the year 2000 to obtain the reopening of the criminal proceedings against them. It further stressed the truthful and objective nature of the reports. The Court can agree with this view, since the public has an interest in principle in being informed about criminal proceedings and in being able to obtain information in that regard, especially when the proceedings concern particularly serious judicial facts which attracted considerable attention (see, for instance, Schweizerische Radio und Fernsehgesellschaft SRG v.

However, it reiterates that the approach to covering a given subject is a matter of journalistic freedom and that Article 10 of the Convention leaves it to journalists to decide what details ought to be published in order to ensure an article\u2019s credibility, provided that the choices which they make in that regard are based on their profession\u2019s ethical rules and codes of conduct\u00a0(see Satakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi Oy and Satamedia Oy, cited above, \u00a7 186).

However, it observes that the applicants\u2019 public profile was closely linked to the fact that they had committed the murder and to the subsequent criminal trial. Therefore, while there is nothing to suggest that the applicants were known to the public before their crime, they nevertheless acquired a certain notoriety during the trial, which according to the findings of the civil courts attracted considerable public attention because of the nature and circumstances of the crime and the fame of the victim. While subsequently, with the passage of time, the public\u2019s interest in the crime \u2013 and, consequently, the applicants\u2019 notoriety \u2013 declined, the Court observes that the applicants returned to the limelight after making several attempts to have the criminal proceedings against them reopened and after addressing the press on the subject. The Court concludes from this that the applicants were not simply private individuals unknown to the public at the time their requests for anonymity were made.",

In addition, as the Government pointed out, in the course of their most recent application for reopening in 2004, that is to say, two and a half and three years respectively before their release, the applicants contacted the press, to which they forwarded a number of documents partly related to their application for reopening, while inviting journalists to keep the public informed. It is also worth noting that, as the Federal Court of Justice pointed out in its judgment of 22 February 2011 concerning the second applicant (see paragraph 45 above), numerous reports on his client could be found until 2006 on the website of the second applicant\u2019s criminal lawyer.",

Specifically, as a result of their conduct towards the press in particular, the applicants\u2019 interest in no longer being confronted with their conviction through the information stored on the Internet portals of a number of media outlets was of less significance in the present case. The Court concludes that the applicants, even as their release approached, therefore had only a limited legitimate expectation (see, mutatis mutandis, Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7 101) of obtaining anonymity in the reports or even a right to be forgotten online.",

The texts in question were written by the media in the exercise of their freedom of expression. They reported objectively on a court decision and their veracity and lawful origin were at no time called into question (see, conversely, W\u0119grzynowski and Smolczewski, cited above, \u00a7 60). As to the Spiegel online file, the Court accepts that certain articles, and in particular the one published in the edition of 30 November 1992 (see paragraph 28 above), might be open to question owing to the nature of the information provided. However, it observes that the details of the accused\u2019s lives reported by the author of the articles form part of the information that criminal-law judges are regularly required to take into consideration in assessing the circumstances of the crime and the elements of individual guilt, and thus generally form part of the discussions during public hearings. Furthermore, these articles did not reflect an intention to present the applicants in a disparaging way or to harm their reputation (see Lillo Stenberg and S\u00e6ther v. Norway, no. 13258/09, \u00a7 41, 16 January 2014, and Sihler-Jauch and Jauch v. Germany (dec.), nos. 68273/10 and 34194/11, \u00a7\u00a038, 24 May 2016).",

The applicants contested this reasoning and argued in particular that the Federal Court of Justice had misunderstood the realities of the Internet era and underestimated the dangers linked to the lasting nature of online information, owing especially to the existence of powerful and effective search engines.",

Switzerland [GC], no. 16354/06, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). Furthermore, the Court sees no indication that maintaining access to the reports was intended to redisseminate information about the applicants. To that extent the Court can accept the conclusions of the Federal Court of Justice, according to which the extent of dissemination of the reports was limited (see Fuchsmann, cited above, \u00a7 52), especially since some of the information was subject to additional restrictions (paid access in the case of Spiegel online and subscriber-only access in the case of Mannheimer Morgen).",

In that connection the Court, while aware of the lasting accessibility of any information once it is published on the Internet, notes that the applicants made no mention of any attempts to contact searchengine operators with a view to making the information concerning them less easy to find (see Fuchsmann, cited above, \u00a7 53, and Phil v.\u00a0Sweden (dec.), no. 74742/14, 7 February 2017). Moreover, the Court considers that it is not called upon to rule on the possibility that the domestic courts could have ordered measures that were less restrictive of the media outlets\u2019 freedom of expression, given that these were not discussed before the courts in the domestic proceedings or, indeed, in the proceedings before the Court.",

It also observes, as the Federal Court of Justice correctly pointed out, that the images showed the applicants\u2019 appearance as it had been in 1994, that is, almost thirteen years before their release, a fact which reduced the likelihood of their being recognised by third parties on the basis of the photos.",

It cannot therefore be said that by refusing to grant the applicants\u2019 request the Federal Court of Justice failed to fulfil the German State\u2019s positive obligation to protect the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their private life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention.
