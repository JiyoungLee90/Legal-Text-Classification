Further, the Reviewing Authority gave weight to the fact that the second applicant had stated that following the demonstration he had allegedly participated in, nothing had actually happened to him and that he had not been sought by the authorities. In his asylum application he had stated that he had not been arrested, detained, harassed, persecuted or wanted by the Syrian authorities. He had also been able to leave Syria legally.

The court noted, inter alia, that the main ground for which the second applicant\u2019s asylum claim had not been accepted was the lack of plausibility of his principal allegations and the existence of significant contradictions and omissions which had undermined his credibility. The second applicant had not substantiated that he was at risk of persecution if returned to Syria because he had allegedly participated in a demonstration. Furthermore, the fact that the second applicant was of Kurdish origin was not sufficient in itself to justify the granting of refugee status. The Supreme Court also held that new grounds and allegations concerning his detention, arrest and ill-treatment following the events could not be taken into account. Its jurisdiction under Article 146 of the Constitution was limited to reviewing his claim as it had been made before the Asylum Service and the Reviewing Authority (see paragraph 89 below).

They were protesting against the restrictive policies of the Cypriot Asylum Service in granting international protection. About 150 Kurds from Syria, including the applicants, remained in the area around the clock, having set up about eighty tents on the pavement. According to the Government, the encampment conditions were unsanitary and protesters were obstructing road and pedestrian traffic. The encampment had become a hazard to public health and created a public nuisance. The protesters performed their daily chores on the pavement, including cooking and washing in unsanitary conditions. The sewage pits had overflown, causing a nuisance and offensive odours. The public lavatories were dirty and the rubbish bins of the Government buildings were being used and, as a result, were continuously overflowing. Furthermore, the protesters were unlawfully obtaining electricity from the Printing Office. Members of the public who lived or worked in the area had complained to the authorities.

The applicants were not estopped from bringing a habeas corpus application just because they had not challenged the deportation and detention orders issued against them. Even if the lawfulness of the detention was assumed, detention for the purpose of deportation could not be indefinite and the detainee left without the right to seek his release. The Supreme Court also rejected the argument that the applicants were estopped from bringing the application because their continued detention had been brought about by their own action, that is, by their application to the Strasbourg Court for an interim measure suspending their deportation.",

It noted that the EU Returns Directive had direct effect in the domestic law, as the period for transposition had expired and the Directive had not been transposed. It could therefore be relied on in the proceedings. However, it went on to hold that the six-month period provided for in the Directive had not yet started to run. The applicants had been arrested on 11 June 2010 with a view to their deportation but had not been deported by the Government in view of the application by the Court on 14 June 2010 of Rule 39 and the issuing of an interim measure suspending their deportation. Consequently, the authorities had not been able to deport them even though, as they stated before the court, they had been ready to do so from 18 June 2010. As the applicants themselves had taken steps to suspend their deportation, the ensuing time could not be held against the Government and could not be taken into account for the purposes of Article\u00a015 (5) and (6) of the Directive. The six-month period would start to run from the moment that the interim measure had been lifted. From that moment onwards the Government had been under an obligation in accordance with Article 15 (1) of the Directive to proceed with the applicants\u2019 deportation with due diligence. The situation would have been different if the deportation had not been effected owing to delays attributable to the authorities.",

The competent authority does not treat these cases as new applications or administrative appeals but as further steps to the initial application or initial appeal (section\u00a016D(4)). The competent authority carries out a preliminary examination to see whether there were new elements which it had not taken into account when it had issued its decision (Section 16D 5(a)). If it decides that the subsequent application or new elements are admissible it will proceed to examine the substance after informing the applicant (section\u00a016D\u00a05(b)).

If the above requirements, however, are not satisfied then the decision refusing to admit the new elements or the new application is not considered a new decision but a confirmation of the previous decision taken.

Up to March 2014, 720 out of 1200 applications and requests pending had been introduced by Syrians. The Ombudsman was informed that Syrian applicants were considered prima facie eligible for complementary protection, unless it was ascertained after an interview and the examination of the application that the granting of refugee status was justified. For this reason applications by Syrians were subject to the normal examination procedure. The length of time required for the examination of the application or request depended on the particular circumstances of the cases. There were cases in which the examination was completed in fifteen days whilst in other cases more time was needed. An average period of six months was given as a rough estimate.

The Reviewing Authority carried out a preliminary examination of the elements within ten days. If it considered that an examination of the substance was required it provided the person concerned with a confirmation which gave him the right to stay in the country until the final decision. In certain cases examination was discontinued when the application was without object, for example, when the person in question refused to co-operate, did not show up for the interview or had been deported. The Ombudsman was informed that in the recent months applicants had principally been given complementary protection. It was also noted that in all re-opening requests made since 2011 when the unrest in Syria started, no application by a Syrian had been dismissed.

They also were deprived of fundamental rights. The absence of status or a certificate as proof of their status led to various problems, such as lack of access to public and private services or to the job market. She observed that delays also occurred during the preliminary examination of new elements put forward in the context of a re-opening request. She recommended, in this regard, that despite the fact that section 16D provided for a preliminary examination of the elements, in the case of applications by Syrians, this could be confined to a confirmation of the Syrian origin of the applicants, as the situation in the country was in itself a ground for re-opening, irrespective of any other elements which might exist. Furthermore, even though the Refugee Law did not set a time-limit for the examination of applications and requests, it did provide that this should take place as soon as possible. It also appeared or could be implied that the legislator considered six months was an adequate time frame. This was confirmed by Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\u00a0June 2013 on common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection which would become binding for Cyprus from 21\u00a0July 2015. The Ombudsman considered that the delays in the processing of applications and requests were not justified in light of the situation in Syria especially since Syrians were considered prima facie eligible for complementary protection. She recalled in this respect that the rights of asylum seekers (for example, access to the job market and certain social rights) were limited in comparison to those who had received international protection.",

This constitutes the fourth update following his position paper on 2 March 2012 in which he had recommended that States adopt a moratorium on all returns to Syria, pending an assessment of when the changed situation in the country would permit return in safety and dignity (UNHCR \u201cInternational Protection Considerations with regard to people fleeing the Syrian Arab Republic\u201d, June and December 2012 and October 2013). According to the paper, the situation in Syria had severely deteriorated in terms of security, human rights, displacement and humanitarian needs. Nearly all parts of the country were now embroiled in violence, which was playing out between different actors in partially overlapping conflicts and was exacerbated by the participation of foreign fighters on all sides. As international efforts to find a political solution to the Syria situation had so far not been successful, the conflict, continued to cause further civilian casualties, displacement and destruction of the country\u2019s infrastructure. The paper noted that by April\u00a02014 the number of persons killed as a result of the conflict had reportedly surpassed 191,000 and hundreds of thousands of people wounded. The conflict in Syria had caused the largest refugee displacement crisis of our times, with Syrians now the world\u2019s largest refugee population under UNHCR\u2019s mandate. It continued to generate increasing levels of displacement each day with an average of 100,000 refugees arriving in host countries in the region every month in 2014.",

They had come to realise that they had no future in Cyprus and the only way that they could have protection and live in security and with dignity was to leave. This is why they had attempted to leave via illegal means in November 2012. The other family that had been arrested at the airport with them had subsequently managed to leave Cyprus irregularly and had gone to Austria where they had been immediately given refugee status on the sole ground that they were Syrians. The applicants observed that the second applicant had been detained until 20 December 2012, inter alia, on deportation and detention orders, as the authorities considered that he had been an illegal immigrant and even though his deportation had been suspended. Upon his release he had been informed that he would be given a residence permit for six months on the condition that he would sign a contract of employment with an employer approved by the Department of Labour. Although the second applicant had found employment he had been informed that the employer in question did not have a right to employ him. The Department of Labour did not refer him to an eligible employer. The first applicant had not been given any possibility to have a residence permit. Therefore they both remained in an irregular situation and risked detention again.",

The authorities had not believed them in the context of their first asylum application and they considered that a new application would only suffer the same fate and they would end up in detention. The shortcomings in the asylum proceedings, including their lengthy nature, had also been a deterrent. Other Syrian Kurds had been involved in asylum proceedings for more than eight or nine years with no final decision yet taken, despite the situation in Syria and the fact that they should be recognised as refugees in line with the policy of all other Member States of the European Union.

Section\u00a014 of that law provided a wide margin of discretion to the Chief Immigration Officer to detain indefinitely for the purpose of deportation. Although at the material time the Minister of the Interior had a policy of a six-month maximum detention period if asylum seekers or migrants could not be deported for any reason, unless there were other concerns, such as public order or security, this policy was not applied consistently. Once the deadline for transposition of the EU Returns Directive had expired on 24\u00a0December 2010 and it had direct effect in domestic law (see paragraphs\u00a053 and 100 above), the applicants had brought habeas corpus applications on the ground that the maximum detention period of six months, had elapsed in their cases. The Supreme Court, however, then ruled that their detention had been lawful as the period during which deportation had been suspended by the Court, did not count when assessing the length of detention and that the six-month time-limit would start to run from the moment that the interim measure had been lifted. As a result, although the applicants had been detained for over eleven months the six-month time-limit did not apply to them. This was despite the fact that the specific circumstances provided for in Article 15 (6) of the Directive allowing the extension of detention with a view to deportation were not applicable in their cases (see paragraphs 53-54 above). Furthermore, the applicants pointed out that domestic law did not provide for periodic review of detention for the purpose of deportation as provided for in the Directive (see paragraph 101 above). Their lawyer had sent letters to the authorities requesting a review but these had remained unanswered.",

The Government had not provided any evidence that they had taken any action after the interim measure had been adopted in respect of the applicants\u2019 deportation.

The applicants had been \u201cprohibited immigrants\u201d within the meaning of 6 (1) (k) of the Aliens and Immigration Law as they had stayed in the Republic unlawfully after the rejection of their asylum applications. The Reviewing Authority had dismissed their appeal and they had therefore become illegal immigrants by virtue of section 6 (1) (k) of the above law .The applicants had been asked to leave Cyprus by a letter dated 1 June 2010. They had been charged with the criminal offence of unlawful stay which was a flagrant offence punishable by imprisonment under section 19 (2) of the Aliens and Immigration Law (see paragraph 86 above). Article 11 (4) of the Constitution permitted arrest without a warrant for flagrant offences carrying a term of imprisonment (see paragraph 110 above).

This provision does not require that the detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing; in this respect Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c) (see Chahal, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 112-113 and \u010conka v.

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 50, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III).

However, the implementation of an interim measure indicated by the Court does not in itself have any bearing on whether the deprivation of liberty to which that individual may be subjected complies with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v. France, no. 25389/05, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2007II). Detention should still be lawful and not arbitrary (see Azimov v. Russia, no.\u00a067474/11, \u00a7 169, 18\u00a0April 2013).",

Consequently, the applicants could have been kept in detention for an indeterminate period pending the determination by the Court of their application (see, mutatis mutandis, Louled Massoud v.\u00a0Malta, no. 24340/08, \u00a7 71, 27 July 2010). However, this did not happen as despite the outcome of their habeas corpus applications they were released by the authorities. The Court reiterates in this connection that in proceedings originating in an individual application it has to confine itself, as far as possible, to an examination of the concrete case before it (see Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, no. 30141/04, \u00a7\u00a0103, ECHR 2010).

Shortly after, when questioned by the police officer, again with the assistance of an interpreter, he was informed of the subject matter of the questioning. This is incorporated in his statement which he confirmed and signed. The second applicant admitted in his statement that he had not obtained a residence permit and that he had false passport. On 25 November 2011 he was brought before the Paphos District Court which ordered his detention in remand. The second applicant has not complained about these proceedings.",
