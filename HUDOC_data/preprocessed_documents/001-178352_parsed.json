It must also verify whether there were still questions that should be addressed in the subsequent judgment, but which had not been included in the settlement agreement. The court noted that according to Article 245 of the CCrP, the settlement agreement did not necessarily have to address matters dealing with the costs of criminal procedure or cover the extent of granting the civil claim or of compensating for the damage caused by the criminal offence. However, referring to Article 306 \u00a7\u00a7 11, 13 and 14 of the CCrP and Article 248 \u00a7 1 (3) of the CCrP, the Supreme Court considered that those matters should not be overlooked by the court concerned (see paragraphs 30 and 31 below).",

Article 240(3) currently provides that the prosecutor must request the consent of the victim to the settlement procedure and ask the victim (where he or she is a natural person) whether he or she wishes to receive notification of the time of the relevant court hearing, unless the victim has expressed his or her opinion about these issues earlier in the course of the criminal proceedings. The prosecutor must also explain that the victim has no right to withdraw his or her consent to the settlement procedure. Under Article 240(4), the prosecutor may, if necessary, grant the victim a reasonable deadline for lodging a civil action or a claim for compensation for procedural costs. Under Article 246 \u00a7 11, as it entered into force on 16 January 2016, the court must now notify a victim who is a natural person of the time of a court hearing, if the victim has so requested. The failure of a victim to appear in court must not hinder the court. According to the explanatory memorandum attached to the draft legislation introducing the above-mentioned amendments to the CCrP, the Code did not previously provide for a clear deadline for submitting a claim for the reimbursement of procedural costs.",

On the facts of the case, it is clear that there was a dispute over the right to claim legal costs. The domestic courts, as stated by the Government, had jurisdiction to decide the applicants\u2019 claim (see paragraph 45 above). In the light of the statements made by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 22 above), it is clear that the decision of the Harju County Court would have been decisive for the outcome of the dispute over costs. As the Government itself stated, had the applicants submitted their itemised list of costs and the supporting documents on time \u2013 the deadline which was not clearly provided in the domestic law (see paragraph 61 below) \u2013 the court would have had to decide the applicants\u2019 claim (see paragraph 45 above).
