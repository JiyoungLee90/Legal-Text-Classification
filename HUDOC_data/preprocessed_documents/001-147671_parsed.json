They said that the quality and quantity of food served to inmates had been fully adequate, and that hygienic conditions in the prison canteen, including in relation to cutlery, had been maintained in line with the applicable standards. Water in the prison had not been muddy; it came from the same pipeline as the water supplied to the town of Bobov Dol. Inmates could also buy bottled mineral water from the prison canteen. The allegation that iron pieces had protruded from the applicant\u2019s bed was not true, and his bed sheets had been changed and washed every week. Bathing time had not been counted as part of the outdoor walk time; unlike other inmates, who had only had one hour of daily outdoor walk time, life prisoners had been allowed one and a half hours. The only reasons for interrupting that walk had been rowdy conduct or bad weather; in the latter case, more outdoor time had been made available later on. The yard designated for the daily outdoor walk did not have a toilet for security and hygiene reasons. Such a toilet was in any event not needed because that yard was adjacent to the applicant\u2019s cell, which was equipped with a toilet. If the applicant had felt an urgent need to go to the toilet during his daily walk, he could have always used that one, and would have never been prevented from doing so. The prison administration was not under a duty to provide inmates with waterproof clothing; when such clothing had been provided as a matter of courtesy, the inmates had very quickly damaged it. It was not true that guard dogs had been kept near the applicant\u2019s cell; such dogs had not been used at all in the zone at issue. Nor had there been rats inside the applicant\u2019s cell; its door, windows and piping had been built in a way not permitting rats to come in, and the prison administration was under a duty regularly to carry out pest control. The applicant\u2019s cell had had central heating since 2007, and the temperature inside the cell and the bathroom had been around eighteen degrees Celsius. The cell\u2019s window, which, like all windows in Bobov Dol Prison, had had its old wooden frame replaced with a new PVC one, did not have any covers preventing sunlight from coming in and could be freely opened, and the cell\u2019s floor was covered with linoleum which was in a good condition. Cleaning products were distributed weekly. Cable television was available in the cell. Lastly, works were under way for enlargement of the area for outdoor walks.",

The court noted that although there was evidence that sometimes, especially after heavy rains, the quality of that water had been bad, the laboratory analysis had confirmed that it had been safe for drinking. The prison was connected to the general water supply system and got the same water as that supplied to households nearby. The applicant\u2019s allegations, for instance that he had endured acute stomach pain and had required medical assistance, had not been made out. Moreover, the applicant had had the possibility to buy bottled mineral water from the prison canteen or, if he did not have the necessary means for that, boil tap water using a device which he confirmed that he had in his cell, or filter it. The applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law against that judgment was not examined by the Supreme Administrative Court as he failed to pay the requisite fee of BGN 5 for the processing of the appeal (see \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 9496 \u043e\u0442 28 \u044e\u043d\u0438 2011 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 8190/2011 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u0406\u0406\u0406 \u043e.).",

The court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim that he had endured stress because of his fear of dogs.

It appears that in his statement of claim the applicant had made confused assertions about the periods of time to which those claims related and that he eventually only claimed non-pecuniary damages in respect of a limited period of time in the first half of 2010. The court dismissed all of the applicant\u2019s claims. With regard, in particular, to the surface of the area for daily outdoor walks, it found that it was one hundred square metres. It went on to note that the bodily searches to which the applicant had been subjected had not involved any undressing or inappropriate touching of his private parts but patting, through his clothes, with a view to determining whether or not he had had on him any unauthorised items. The systematic handcuffing of the applicant was not in breach of the Execution of Punishments and PreTrial Detention Act 2009 or the regulations for its application, was not inconsistent with the applicant\u2019s prison regime, could be considered necessary in view of the seriousness of the offences in relation to which he had been sentenced to life imprisonment, and had not been intended to humiliate the applicant. With regard to the claim that the applicant had not been transferred to a multi-occupancy cell despite the possibility to do so for life prisoners serving their life sentence under the \u201csevere\u201d regime, the court found that those matters fell within the discretion of the special commission for the execution of sentences; there had therefore not been a failure on the part of the prison authorities to observe a binding legal obligation. The same went for educational courses.

In a judgment of 9\u00a0June 2011 the Kyustendil Administrative Court found that the prison administration had provided the applicant with enough coal to secure a temperature of approximately twenty degrees Celsius in his cell during the first period, and that central heating had been installed before the second period.

It therefore relates to the content of primary legislation. It is clear, and indeed confirmed by the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s case-law, that a claim under section 1 of the State and Municipalities Liability for Damage Act 1988 does not lie in respect of that (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7 145).",

While the Kyustendil Administrative Court discontinued the proceedings pursuant to a number of those claims for various reasons, it did examine some of the claims on the merits (see paragraphs 25-28 above). However, under the Court\u2019s well-established case-law claims for damages can only be regarded as an effective domestic remedy in respect of allegedly poor conditions of detention if the applicant has been released or placed in Article 3-compliant conditions (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 222-25, with further references). The applicant is still incarcerated, and it does not appear that, except with respect to heating, cell windows and size of the outdoor walk area, the conditions of his detention \u2013 in particular, his very restrictive prison regime \u2013 have significantly changed in recent years (see paragraphs\u00a08-10 and 30 above). A claim for damages under section 1 of the State and Municipalities Liability for Damage Act 1988 or another legal provision is therefore, on its own, not capable of providing the applicant adequate relief. Moreover, such a claim, in so far as directed against conditions of incarceration that flow directly from the prison regime applicable to the applicant, would not have stood any prospect of success, given that the Bulgarian courts have already dismissed such claims on the basis that such conditions were not unlawful (ibid., \u00a7 226). Indeed, that is what happened in one of the cases brought by the applicant, in relation to his claim concerning the systematic use of handcuffs (see paragraph 27 above).",

In its recent judgment in Harakchiev and Tolumov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 203-09), the Court found that such automatic isolation, in application of the relevant provisions of the Execution of Punishments Act\u00a01969 and later of the Execution of Punishments and Pre-Trial Detention Act 2009, as well as the regulations for their application, was in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.

The Court has already had occasion to hold that, if not based on proper risk considerations, the systematic use of handcuffs in respect of prisoners taken out of their cells but still kept in a secure environment was in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see Kashavelov v. Bulgaria, no. 891/05, \u00a7\u00a7 38-40, 20 January 2011, as well as Piechowicz v. Poland, no. 20071/07, \u00a7 174, 17 April 2012, and Horych v. Poland, no. 13621/08, \u00a7 99, 17 April 2012). As already noted, in the present case there is no allegation that the applicant has ever behaved aggressively or tried to abscond, or that there existed reasons to believe that he posed a security risk to prison staff or other inmates (see paragraph 18 above). Nonetheless, he was, throughout his incarceration in Bobov Dol Prison, systematically handcuffed each time he was taken out of his cell, a practice apparently regarded as fully justified solely on account of the seriousness of the offences in respect of which he was sentenced to life imprisonment (see paragraph 27 above).",

The Court found that from the time when that sentence had become final \u2013 November 2004 \u2013 until the beginning of 2012, it could not be regarded as reducible, as required under the Court\u2019s case-law under Article 3 in relation to life sentences, for two reasons. First, it was unclear whether before a 2006 amendment to the Criminal Code 1968 that had expressly provided that the presidential power of clemency extended to that type of sentence, the sentence had been de jure reducible. Secondly, the manner in which the presidential power of clemency had been exercised before the early months of 2012 had been quite opaque, and there had existed no concrete examples showing that persons serving sentences of life imprisonment without commutation could hope to benefit from the exercise of that power and obtain an adjustment of their sentence. Mr Harakchiev\u2019s sentence could not therefore be regarded as de facto reducible before that time. The Court went on to say that although there was no right to rehabilitation under the Convention, its Article 3 required the Contracting States to give life prisoners a chance, however remote, to someday regain their freedom. For that chance to be genuine, those prisoners had to be given a proper opportunity to rehabilitate themselves. In that context, while Contracting States had a wide margin of appreciation to decide on such things as the regime and conditions of a life prisoner\u2019s incarceration, those points could not be considered as a matter of indifference. Mr Harakchiev had been subjected to a particularly stringent prison regime, which had entailed almost complete isolation and very limited possibilities for social contacts, work or education, and had been kept in unsatisfactory material conditions. He could not therefore be regarded as being able to entertain a real hope that he might one day achieve and demonstrate progress towards rehabilitation and on that basis seek an adjustment of his sentence. The Court accordingly found that there had been a breach of Article 3 of the Convention, but went on to caution that this finding was not to be understood as giving Mr Harakchiev the prospect of imminent release.",

In those circumstances, the Court sees no reason to depart from its ruling in Harakchiev and Tolumov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 247-67), and finds that there has been a breach of Article 3 of the Convention.
