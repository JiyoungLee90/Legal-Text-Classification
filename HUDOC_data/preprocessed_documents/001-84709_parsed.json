However, relying on the Court\u2019s judgment in Amuur v. France (25 June 1996, \u00a7 43, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III), and what he considered to be a \u201csensible reading\u201d of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), he found that it was not permissible under the Convention to detain, solely for purposes of administrative efficiency, an asylum-seeker who had followed the proper procedures and presented no risk of absconding. Even if the detention did fall within Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), it was disproportionate to detain asylum-seekers for the purpose of quickly processing their claims, since it had not been demonstrated that stringent conditions of residence, falling short of twenty-four hour detention, might not suffice. He also found (as did the Court of Appeal and House of Lords) that the applicant had not been given adequate reasons for his detention.",

In the  the average monthly number of applications from July to September 1999 was nearly 7,000: 60% higher than the previous year.

In one way or another they will be required to be present in a centre at all times when they may be needed for interviews, which it is impossible to schedule to a pre-determined timetable. Would applicants voluntarily submit to such a regime, if not detained? Many no doubt would, but it is impossible to condemn as irrational the policy of subjecting those asylum-seekers whose applications appear susceptible to rapid resolution to a short period of detention designed to ensure that the regime operates without dislocation.",

Getting a speedy decision is in the interests not only of the applicants but of those increasingly in the queue. Accepting as I do that the arrangements made at Oakington provide reasonable conditions, both for individuals and families and that the period taken is not in any sense excessive, I consider that the balance is in favour of recognising that detention under the Oakington procedure is proportionate and reasonable.

In addition to the existing detention criteria, applicants will be detained at Oakington where it appears that their applications can be decided quickly, including those which may be certified as manifestly unfounded. Oakington will consider applications from adults and families with children, for whom separate accommodation is being provided, but not from unaccompanied minors. Detention will initially be for a period of about seven days to enable applicants to be interviewed and an initial decision to be made. Legal advice will be available on site. If the claim cannot be decided in that period, the applicant will be granted temporary admission or, if necessary in line with existing criteria, moved to another place of detention. If the claim is refused, a decision about further detention will similarly be made in accordance with existing criteria. Thus, detention in this latter category of cases will normally be to effect removal or where it has become apparent that the person will fail to keep in contact with the Immigration Service.\u201d",

The first concerns the frequent resort to detention for asylum-seekers at the very outset of proceedings. Whilst detention is not automatic in such proceedings, there would appear to be a strong presumption in its favour; mooted plans to increase the asylum detention estate in precisely this area suggest that this is the direction in which the  is headed. The UK authorities have indicated to me that the  courts have approved detention for the sole purpose of processing asylum applications. I do not exclude the possibility of detention being appropriate in certain circumstances, but I do not believe that this would be an appropriate rule. Open processing centres providing on-site accommodation and proceedings are, I believe, a more appropriate solution for the vast majority of applicants whose requests are capable of being determined rapidly.\u201d",

Subject, as always, to the rule against arbitrariness, the Chamber accepted that the State had a broader discretion to decide whether to detain potential immigrants than was the case for other interferences with the right to liberty. Accordingly, there was no requirement in Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f) that the detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing. All that was required was that the detention should be a genuine part of the process to determine whether the individual should be granted immigration clearance and/or asylum, and that it should not otherwise be arbitrary, for example on account of its length.",

To argue, as did the applicant, that the detention had been arbitrary because it might have been possible to achieve the same purpose by use of an \u201caccommodation centre\u201d, with similar conditions of residence but no confinement, was misplaced since it involved seeking to reintroduce the \u201cnecessity\u201d requirement through the requirement of lack of arbitrariness.

The purpose defined by the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) was to prevent unlawful immigration, that is, entry and residence in a country by the circumvention of immigration control. There had to be a direct and precise causal relationship between the detention and the risk of unauthorised entry. This purpose was underlined by the words \u201chis effecting\u201d, indicating that the focus was upon whether the particular individual, if not detained, would otherwise effect an entry that was unauthorised. It was clear from the facts of the applicant\u2019s case that, if he had not been detained, he would have been lawfully present in the United Kingdom with \u201ctemporary admission\u201d, an \u201cauthorised\u201d status in fact and law (see, inter alia, the House of Lords\u2019 judgment in Szoma, paragraph 21 above). The interpretation he advanced would allow for initial detention for the purposes of verification and assessment of the individual risk of unauthorised entry; such procedure formed part of the ordinary process of immigration control, and was plainly detention for the purpose of preventing the individual effecting an unauthorised entry.

Although the Court in Chahal (cited above) did not require a necessity test in respect of Mr\u00a0Chahal\u2019s detention under the second part of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), there was good reason for distinguishing between the two limbs. Firstly, as was clear from \u00a7 112 of the Chahal judgment, the contrast made with the other sub-paragraphs of Article 5 \u00a7 1 was based on the language of the provision under which Mr Chahal was detained, which required only that \u201caction [was] being taken with a view to deportation\u201d, whereas the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) stipulated that detention had to be for the purpose of preventing unauthorised entry.

In contrast, a necessity test should apply to those like the present applicant who \u201chave [not] committed criminal offences but ... who, often fearing for their lives, have fled from their own country\u201d (Amuur, cited above, \u00a7 43).",

As the Court has remarked before, subject to their obligations under the Convention, States enjoy an \u201cundeniable sovereign right to control aliens\u2019 entry into and residence in their territory\u201d (see Amuur, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041; Chahal, cited above, \u00a7 73; and Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the , 28 May 1985, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68, Series A no. 94). It is a necessary adjunct to this right that States are permitted to detain would-be immigrants who have applied for permission to enter, whether by way of asylum or not.

To interpret the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) as permitting detention only of a person who is shown to be trying to evade entry restrictions would be to place too narrow a construction on the terms of the provision and on the power of the State to exercise its undeniable right of control referred to above.

The particular circumstances of this case, moreover, demonstrate this implicitly but with certainty. On his arrival at the airport on 30 December 2000 the applicant was granted temporary admission (see paragraphs 20-21 of the judgment), under the terms of which he could spend the night in the hotel of his choice but had to return to the airport the following morning. On 31 December 2000 the applicant reported as required and was again granted temporary admission until the next day. When he again reported to the airport as agreed he was granted temporary admission for the third time until 10 a.m. the following day, 2 January 2001. It was not until 2 January, after reporting as required, that he was detained and transferred to the Oakington Reception Centre, where there is a prison-like atmosphere. In any event, the theoretical debate as to whether a person is unlawfully present within a country\u2019s territory until he or she has been granted leave to enter is of no real relevance in this case, given that the applicant was in fact given permission to enter for three days.",

However, the majority deem it necessary to consider what is meant by \u201cprotection against arbitrariness\u201d in the present case, and take the view that \u201cthe principle that detention should not be arbitrary must apply to detention under the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) in the same manner as it applies to detention under the second limb. Since States enjoy the right to control equally an alien\u2019s entry into and residence in their country ..., it would be artificial to apply a different proportionality test to cases of detention at the point of entry than that which applies to deportation, extradition or expulsion of a person already in the country\u201d (see paragraph 73). Hence, the judgment does not hesitate to treat completely without distinction all categories of nonnationals in all situations \u2013 illegal immigrants, persons liable to be deported and those who have committed offences \u2013 by including them without qualification under the general heading of immigration control, which falls within the scope of States\u2019 unlimited sovereignty.",

In order to achieve this objective it was necessary to schedule up to 150 interviews a day and even small delays might disrupt the entire programme.

This has in no sense been established in the present case, as the applicant did not enter or attempt to enter the country unlawfully. On the other hand, if the authorities had objectively verifiable grounds to believe that the applicant was liable to abscond before his claim for asylum had been determined, they could have made use of detention in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention. In that case, the detention would have been aimed at preventing the asylum-seeker from entering or remaining in the country for a purpose other than that for which he had been granted temporary admission.

As Judges Casadevall, Traja and \u0160ikuta rightly observed in their dissenting opinion annexed to the Chamber judgment of 11 July 2006, such a situation creates great legal uncertainty for asylum-seekers, stemming from the fact that they could be detained at any time during examination of their application without their being able to take the necessary action to avoid detention.

In so doing, it is accepting a period of detention which it does not generally sanction in the other cases of deprivation of liberty contemplated by Article 5 of the Convention. Granted, it is understandable that in certain situations, for example concerning extradition, the State must be allowed greater latitude than in the case of other interferences with the right to liberty. However, we can see no justification for adopting such an approach in relation to asylum-seekers, with the attendant risk that the scrutiny of deprivations of liberty under the European Convention on Human Rights will be substantially weakened as a result. Moreover, if a seven-day period of detention is not considered excessive, where and how do we draw the line for what is unacceptable?",

We fail to see what value or higher interest can justify the notion that these fundamental guarantees of individual liberty in a State governed by the rule of law cannot or should not apply to the detention of asylum-seekers.",

In that regard, with reference to the United Nations, Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \u2013 which prohibits arbitrary arrest or detention and applies to all cases of deprivation of liberty, including in the context of immigration controls \u2013 has been interpreted by the Human Rights Committee\u2019s case-law to mean that detention must not simply be lawful, but must also not have been imposed on grounds of administrative expediency (see Hugo van Alphen v. the Netherlands, Communication no. 305/1988, CCPR/C/39/D/305/1988 (1990)). In addition, it must satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality. Lastly, the review of a detention by the courts must not be confined to assessing whether it complies with domestic law, but must also make it possible to determine, even in cases of illegal entry, whether factors particular to the individual (likelihood of absconding, lack of cooperation, and so on) justify his or her detention (see A. v. Australia, Communication no.\u00a0560/1993, CCPR/C/59/D/560/1993 (1997)). In its decision in Bakhtiyari v. Australia, the Committee confirms that a court review which does not allow the courts to re-examine the justification of the detention in substantive terms will not satisfy the requirements of Article 9 of the Covenant (see Bakhtiyari v.
