On the other hand, it cannot be accepted that the beating was performed by the officers in their quality of private individuals, since the circumstances of the case show that it was performed in connection with their official activity, in their quality of [police officers]. On the other hand, there is no indication (most notably, no such circumstances were established during the criminal proceedings [concerning the applicant\u2019s beating]) that the use of force was justified, within the meaning of [the provisions of the Ministry of the Interior Act].

However, the Court is not convinced that this delay was decisive and that, had the authorities pursued the investigation more diligently, the time left would have been insufficient to identify those responsible with a view to their appropriate punishment. The Court reiterates in this connection that in investigating allegations of illtreatment the authorities are under an obligation to act in a prompt manner (see paragraph 50 above).",

The authorities must have been alerted to the possibility that violence had been used against the applicant by 23 March 2005, when a doctor at the Sofia Investigation Service noted a bruise on his back. Thus, even without an express complaint from the applicant, a duty to investigate had already arisen at that early stage. This is so because Article 3 of the Convention requires an official investigation in cases where there are sufficiently clear indications that ill-treatment might have occurred (see Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Others v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 71156/01, \u00a7 97, 3 May 2007).",

Article 287 of the Code criminalises the use of coercion or other unlawful means with the aim of forcing an accused to confess, and provides for a punishment of up to ten years\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 35 above); accordingly, the limitation period for prosecution is much longer (see paragraph 36 above) and would have expired much later.",
