That previous judgment had established that the applicant company\u2019s application for a subsidy met the relevant criteria \u2013 a conclusion which was binding on the Fund. The latter\u2019s refusal of 10 December 2009 was based on the fact that the relevant time-limit for examining an application for a subsidy had expired, but it had become unable to carry out such examination through its own fault. Had it entered into a contract to provide the subsidy sought by the applicant company, instead of giving the decision of 18 August 2006 which had subsequently been quashed, the applicant company would have received the subsidy claimed. Thus, the non-payment of such a subsidy had inflicted on the latter damage. As to the amount of the potential subsidy, it had been established by an expert appointed by the Sofia Administrative Court and had been supported by contracts submitted by the applicant company and showing the cost of the intended works. Thus, the applicant company had fully substantiated its claim, in the amount indicated above (BGN 5,587,998 \u2013 see paragraph 11 above), and the Supreme Administrative Court awarded that sum.

One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, inter alia, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question (see Brum\u0103rescu v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no.\u00a028342/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999VII, and Driza v.\u00a0Albania, no. 33771/02, \u00a7\u00a063, ECHR 2007V (extracts)). Legal certainty presupposes respect for the principle of res judicata, that is the principle of the finality of judgments. This principle underlines that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ryabykh v.\u00a0Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2003IX; Ro\u015fca v. Moldova, no.\u00a06267/02, \u00a7 25, 22 March 2005; Giuran v. Romania, no. 24360/04, \u00a7 30, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). The relevant considerations to be taken into account in this connection include, in particular, the effect of the re-opening and any subsequent proceedings on the applicant\u2019s individual situation (see Lenskaya v. Russia, no. 28730/03, \u00a7\u00a033, 29 January 2009).",

As to the other cases concerning tort actions against the Fund and other specialised governmental agencies under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 24 above), their examination without the participation of the Minister of Finance as representative of the State does not mean that, in the specific circumstances of the present case \u2013 which, as already noted, concerns the disbursing of European Union funds \u2013 considering the Minister an affected party with the right to participate was arbitrary.",

As further discussed (see paragraph 47 above), there is no reason to consider that such quashing imposed an excessive individual burden on the applicant company. Seeing that, as established subsequently, it had relied on forged and null and void documents to support its application for a subsidy (see paragraph 21 above), the Court notes in addition that it could be questionable whether the company acted in good faith (see Danailov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 54).",
