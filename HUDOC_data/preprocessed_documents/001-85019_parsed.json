Regulation 93 of these Regulations provides that a person sentenced to life imprisonment may be granted remission of his sentence on the ground of good conduct and industry, not exceeding in total one-quarter of this sentence. Therefore, Mr Kyprianou continued, the sentence of life imprisonment has been determined at a period of twenty years, or fifteen if the convicted person demonstrates good conduct. Consequently, what Lord Parker said in the case of R v. Foy, on which counsel for the accused relied, does not apply. Mr Kyprianou also showed his concern, as Senior Counsel of the Republic, about the possible cases, such as the present one, where one person commits many murders but is only given one sentence of imprisonment for fifteen or twenty years.",

Foy (1962) 2\u00a0All\u00a0E.R.\u00a0246], life imprisonment means imprisonment for the remainder of the time for which the applicant is alive. Accordingly, and since a sentence of life imprisonment has been imposed on the accused, no other such sentence can follow. Mr Clerides suggests, however, that the court must issue this order, for he is also basing himself on the Regulations of 1987 and is concerned that, since these Regulations are in force, the accused may possibly be released in fifteen years and thus is not facing the danger of serving another prison sentence of fifteen or twenty\u00a0years, if the second sentence follows the first one.",

The Criminal Code indeed provides that the sentence of life imprisonment is mandatory and the only sentence following conviction for premeditated murder. In our judgment, the sentence \u2018imprisonment for life\u2019 means exactly what is stated by the simple Greek words, that is, imprisonment for the remainder of the biological existence of the convicted person. This interpretation was also given by the Court of Appeal of  in the case of R v. Foy ... As we have already stated, section 203(2) of the Criminal Code is the only provision prescribing the sentence of life imprisonment as mandatory, and this in the light of the provisions of Article 53 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution. The Regulations of 1987 were drawn up on the basis of the Prison (Discipline) Law (Cap. 286), which still applies on the basis of the provisions of the Constitution even though it was enacted just when  became an English colony. The provisions of this law, however, have to be applied in such a way that they comply with the express provisions of the Constitution. We wonder whether these Regulations are not unconstitutional and whether the interpretation of the term \u2018imprisonment for life\u2019, which is encountered in the Constitution and the Criminal Code, so as to mean \u2018twenty years\u2019, is arbitrary. We say \u2018we wonder\u2019 since such an issue has not been raised before us and thus we have no right in this procedure to convey an opinion on this. Another observation that can be made, however, is the following: it appears that the drafters of the Regulations, even if they are valid, did not notice the special provision of section 11 of the above Law (Cap. 286) which concerns life prisoners and provides that they may be released on licence by a decision of the \u2018Governor\u2019, which may be revoked. The life sentence is specifically provided for in the above Law to last for life, along the lines of the English legal system. This is why Lord Parker stated what we quoted above. Another issue that is raised, even for the purposes of academic debate, is to what extent a law or regulation can provide for the remission, suspension or commutation of a convicted person\u2019s sentence in view of the express provision of Article 53 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution which bestows this privilege on the President of the Republic with the concurrence of the Attorney-General.",

It is therefore up to the competent authorities, when and if the matter is raised at the appropriate time, to take into account what we have mentioned above in the form of legal observations. We have already imposed on the accused the sentence that the law envisages, that is, life imprisonment, and we have nothing else to add.\u201d",

The constitutionality of this provision of the law was examined in the case of Politis v. Republic (1987) 2 C.L.R. 116 and was held to be correct in the light of the provisions of Articles 7 \u00a7 2 and 12 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution. The sentence of life imprisonment is not equated by the legislature with a prison sentence for any period of time, neither where it is imposed as a mandatory punitive measure on the basis of section 203(2) nor as a discretionary measure under section 29 of the Criminal Code, Cap. 154. This would anyhow be contrary to the provisions of these two sections of the Criminal Code since life imprisonment is mandatory for the crime of premeditated murder whereas for the purposes of section\u00a029, where life imprisonment is a discretionary measure, the courts have the discretion to impose a sentence of a shorter period. A prison sentence for a period shorter than life imprisonment may comprise a sentence longer than imprisonment for twenty years with which life imprisonment is equated on the basis of Regulation 2 of the Prison Regulations. In the case of Georghios Aristidou v. Republic (1967) 2\u00a0C.L.R. 43 the Court of Appeal imposed a sentence of imprisonment of twenty-five years following the commutation of the appellant\u2019s conviction for premeditated murder to manslaughter.",

Besides, the granting of power to the Director of Prisons to remit the sentence because of good conduct and industry, under the provisions of Regulation 93, is contrary to the principle of the separation of powers, which precludes the involvement of an executive or administrative organ in the determination of the punishment of an offender. The only authority on whom power is conferred by the Constitution to remit, suspend or commute a prison sentence is the President of the Republic, acting with the concurrence of the Attorney General. The examination of the power to make secondary legislation conferred by sections 4 and 9 of Cap. 286 is not directly required in this case, since neither of the two provisions concerns the serving of a sentence of life imprisonment. The serving of life imprisonment is regulated specifically by the provisions of section 11 of Cap. 286, from which it emerges that life imprisonment means imprisonment for the remainder of the life of the convicted person, subject to the right granted to the President of the Republic to suspend the sentence for such period of time as may be fixed on the release of the convicted person on licence. Section 11 of Cap. 286 is in harmony with the Constitution and has maintained its force after the proclamation of the Republic inasmuch as it is consistent with the powers conferred on the President of the Republic by Article 53 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution.\u201d",

In accordance with the separation of powers, the regulating by law of the matter could include, in the case of the imposition by the courts of the sentence of life imprisonment, empowering the same court to fix a minimum term for the sentence which would be served obligatorily before examination of the possibility of the conditional release of the prisoner. I am of the opinion that this minimum term of the sentence should not exceed twenty to twenty-five years. Within the framework of the proposed regulation a committee may be set up with an advisory role which, on the basis of enacted criteria and in accordance with the rehabilitation progress of each prisoner serving a life sentence and the particular circumstances of each case, could recommend conditional release.",

Any prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment after the above Regulations came into force would, in practice, have had a period of five years automatically deducted from the time to be served in prison by way of remission pursuant to Regulation 93. Thereafter, days of remission could be deducted from this five-year period as a consequence of misconduct by the prisoner. It was understood by the Republic\u2019s executive and administrative authorities, including the Prison Service, that a life prisoner\u2019s misconduct could not result in him being detained beyond the twenty-year point. In fact, because of the very limited number of life prisoners in  and the dates of their respective convictions, no life prisoner had ever reached the point in his sentence when these provisions were applied directly so as to lead to his release. The release of the nine life prisoners in 1993 had been pursuant to Article 53 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution in the light of how the Regulations would have operated in their cases.",

Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Hadjisavvas, in which the constitutionality of Regulation 93 had been raised as a collateral issue to Mr Hadjisavvas\u2019s habeas corpus application, was only operative so as to determine the ongoing legality of his detention. It also followed from Article 144 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution that the above judgment did not operate so as to render Regulation 93 unconstitutional and invalid as against persons other than the parties to that case. In other words, it did not result in Regulation 93 being rendered invalid vis-\u00e0-vis other individuals.",

Nonetheless, the judgment could not be understood as having retrospective effect such as to impugn the validity of Regulation 93 as it had been applied to other individuals affected by that Regulation. Therefore, the fact that Regulation 93 was declared unconstitutional and ultra vires by the Supreme Court in 1992 did not have retrospective effect such as to render the Regulation void ab initio for all purposes. It did not, for example, render unlawful any action taken pursuant to Regulation 93 between the date of its enactment and the judgment in Hadjisavvas. Accordingly, at the time of the applicant\u2019s offence in July 1987 or at the time he was sentenced in March 1989, Regulation 93 could not have been void or without legal effect in respect of the applicant.

In most other Council of Europe member States life imprisonment does not entail imprisonment for the rest of the natural life of the convicted person. At the time of the Commissioner\u2019s first visit there were discussions in the government about the possibility of terminating life imprisonment subject to certain conditions. A solution to this question has yet to be found, though. The Deputy Director of the Central Prison spoke of the difficulties in dealing with those currently serving life sentence, fourteen men at the time of the Office\u2019s visit, both in terms of the prisoners\u2019 morale, and security issues. The usual incentives for encouraging good behaviour in prisoners were inevitably of no use in relation to those serving life sentences, and this posed security problems both for the warders and for the other prisoners.\u201d",

If a sentence of life imprisonment was reducible de jure, the mere fact that the prospects of early release were limited or that the decision about whether to grant early release depended on the discretion of the executive, even if that discretion was not subject to the review of the domestic courts, did not violate Article\u00a03, provided that de facto there was a realistic possibility of that discretion being exercised in the future. A life prisoner would have to show either that early release was a legal impossibility or that there was no realistic prospect of early release in practice. In this connection, the Government relied on the Court\u2019s decision in Einhorn v. France ((dec.), no.\u00a071555/01, ECHR 2001-XI) and argued that there were clear parallels between the situation in Cyprus and that in .",

With all the above in mind and before the present application had been lodged, the Ministry of Justice and Public Order had initiated a review of the procedures in Cyprus with a view to improving the rights of life prisoners. The Government noted that the proposals for legislative reform would be put forward at some time during 2007. They submitted a draft bill that had been prepared for the purposes of amending section 14 of the Prison Law. The proposals for amendment involved, inter alia, the fixing of a minimum period to be served to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence before a prisoner could be considered eligible for parole on licence under section 14 of the Prison Law and the establishment of an independent parole board with responsibility for assessing the risk to the public once the relevant part of the sentence had been served and with the power to direct a prisoner\u2019s release on licence where the evidence indicated an acceptable level of risk. The provisions of the bill set out in detail the procedure to be followed by the board and the rights of prisoners in this matter.

This was particularly so given that, in sentencing the applicant, the Limassol Assize Court had adopted the earlier judgment of the Nicosia Assize Court in the case of The Republic of Cyprus v. Yiouroukkis, casting doubts on the compatibility of the Regulations both with the Constitution and section 11 of the Prison Discipline Law. The Limassol Assize Court had rejected the possibility of imposing three consecutive terms and had concluded that imprisonment for life meant imprisonment for the remainder of the accused\u2019s life. The applicant had also been present at the sentencing hearing.

Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 162, Series A no. 25).",

An analysis of the Court\u2019s case-law on the subject discloses that where national law affords the possibility of review of a life sentence with a view to its commutation, remission, termination or the conditional release of the prisoner, this will be sufficient to satisfy Article 3. The Court has held, for instance, in a number of cases that, where detention was subject to review for the purposes of parole after the expiry of the minimum term for serving the life sentence, it could not be said that the life prisoners in question had been deprived of any hope of release (see, for example, Stanford, cited above; Hill v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 19365/02, 18 March 2003; and Wynne, cited above). The Court has found that this is the case even in the absence of a minimum term of unconditional imprisonment and even when the possibility of parole for prisoners serving a life sentence is limited (see, for example, Einhorn, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 27-28). It follows that a life sentence does not become \u201cirreducible\u201d by the mere fact that in practice it may be served in full. It is enough for the purposes of Article 3 that a life sentence is de jure and de facto reducible.",

Norway, no. 14610/89, Commission decision of 9 July 1991, DR\u00a071, p. 168), it is clear from the relevant case-law that the existence of a system providing for consideration of the possibility of release is a factor to be taken into account when assessing the compatibility of a particular life sentence with Article 3. In this context, however, it should be observed that a State\u2019s choice of a specific criminal-justice system, including sentence review and release arrangements, is in principle outside the scope of the supervision the Court carries out at European level, provided that the system chosen does not contravene the principles set forth in the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Achour v.

Furthermore, it observes that Cypriot law does not provide for a minimum term for serving a life sentence or for the possibility of its remission on the basis of good conduct and industry. However, the adjustment of such a sentence is possible at any stage irrespective of the time served in prison. In particular, under Article 53 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution as it has been applied since 1963, the President of the Republic, on the recommendation of the Attorney-General, may suspend, remit or commute any sentence passed by a court (see paragraphs 36-37 above). The President can therefore at any point in time commute a life sentence to another one of a shorter duration and then remit it, affording the possibility of immediate release. Moreover, section 14 of the Prison Law of 1996 provides for the conditional release of prisoners, including life prisoners (see paragraph 59 above). In line with this provision, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the President, with the agreement of the Attorney-General, can order by decree the conditional release of a prisoner at any time.",

Furthermore, as acknowledged by the Government, there are certain shortcomings in the current procedure (see paragraph 91 above). Notwithstanding, the Court does not find that life sentences in Cyprus are irreducible with no possibility of release; on the contrary, it is clear that in Cyprus such sentences are both de jure and de facto reducible. In this connection, the Court notes that from the parties\u2019 submissions it transpires that life prisoners have been released under Article 53 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution. In particular, nine life prisoners were released in 1993 and another two in 1997 and 2005 respectively (see paragraphs 52 and 90 above and paragraph 158 below). All of these prisoners, apart from one, had been serving mandatory life sentences. In addition, a life prisoner can benefit from the relevant provisions at any time without having to serve a minimum period of imprisonment. Consequently, it cannot be inferred that the applicant has no possibility of release and he has not adduced evidence to warrant such an inference.",

Bearing in mind the chronology of events and, in particular, the lapse of time between them, it cannot be said that the applicant could justifiably harbour genuine expectations that he would be released in November 2002. In this connection, the Court notes that apart from the clear sentence passed by the  in 1989 the relevant changes in the domestic law happened within a period of approximately four years, that is, between 1992 and 1996, thus about six years before the release date given by the prison authorities to the applicant came around.

The causal link with the original sentence had not therefore been broken. In this connection, they pointed out that the applicant\u2019s sentence, being a mandatory life sentence, had not been imposed by reference to considerations pertaining to the dangerousness of the offender, which were amenable to change over time; the sentence was not divided up into a punitive element, that is, a punitive \u201ctariff\u201d phase of detention, and a subsequent element based on the risk presented by the prisoner, that is, an ensuing phase of detention on the grounds of public protection.",

This was irrespective of the fact that a life prisoner might, in practice, be released under the Constitution or the Prison Law of 1996. Likewise, in the case of Hadjisavvas, the Supreme Court had held that the legislature did not equate the sentence of life imprisonment to imprisonment for any time-span, either where this was imposed as a mandatory measure of punishment under section 203(2) of the Criminal Code, or where it was imposed as a discretionary measure under section 23 of the Code.",

This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see, inter alia, Stafford, cited above, and Amuur v. France, 25\u00a0June 1996, \u00a7 50, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III). In this respect, the Court\u2019s case-law indicates that it may be necessary to look beyond the appearances and the language used and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium, 24 June 1982, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 50). In addition, any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see, among many other authorities, Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, \u00a7\u00a7 39 and 45, Series A no. 33, and Amuur, cited above, \u00a7 50).",

Furthermore, the word \u201cafter\u201d in sub-paragraph (a) does not simply mean that the detention must follow the \u201cconviction\u201d in point of time: in addition, the \u201cdetention\u201d must result from, \u201cfollow and depend upon\u201d or occur \u201cby virtue of\u201d the \u201cconviction\u201d.

That court had considered that \u201cimprisonment for life meant imprisonment for the remainder of the accused\u2019s life\u201d. Under the Constitution subordinate legislation could not alter that position. No appeal had been brought against this sentence in 1989.

A change in law which required a prisoner to serve a greater part of his original sentence than he would have had to serve at the time he committed the offence did not constitute a violation of Article 7. Judged from the prisoner\u2019s perspective, the position was no doubt harsher.

It would then also be necessary to consider whether the maximum penalty prescribed by the regulations was fifteen years or twenty years. If the latter was the case then the applicant would not have been entitled to release pursuant to the requirements of Article 7 until July 2007. It had been clear under the Regulations that the maximum period a life prisoner could be required to serve was twenty years and the earliest date of release was after serving fifteen years of his sentence. Although it was administrative practice to deduct the five years at the outset of the sentence, so as to identify the earliest possible date of release, this practice was not required by the Regulations or by the enabling legislation. An administrative practice of such nature could not in the Government\u2019s view constitute a substantive restriction on the maximum length of the sentence imposed by the court.

An individual must know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation of it what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable and what penalty will be imposed for the act committed and/or omission (see, among other authorities, Cantoni, cited above, \u00a7 29). Furthermore, a law may still satisfy the requirement of \u201cforeseeability\u201d where the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, among other authorities, ibid., \u00a7 35, and Achour, cited above, \u00a7 54).",

Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, mutatis mutandis, The Sunday Times (no. 1), \u00a7 49, and Kokkinakis, \u00a7 40, both cited above). The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain (see, mutatis mutandis, Cantoni, cited above). Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, \u201cprovided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen\u201d (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 36, and Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

To render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective, the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 307A, and Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 317-B). The wording of Article 7 \u00a7 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d. Other factors that may be taken into account as relevant in this connection are the nature and purpose of the measure in question; its characterisation under national law; the procedures involved in the making and implementation of the measure; and its severity (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 28, and Jamil, cited above, \u00a7 31). To this end, both the Commission and the Court in their case-law have drawn a distinction between a measure that constitutes in substance a \u201cpenalty\u201d and a measure that concerns the \u201cexecution\u201d or \u201cenforcement\u201d of the \u201cpenalty\u201d. In consequence, where the nature and purpose of a measure relates to the remission of a sentence or a change in a regime for early release, this does not form part of the \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of Article 7 (see, inter alia, Hogben, cited above; Hosein v. the United Kingdom, no. 26293/95, Commission decision of 28 February 1996, unreported; Grava, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051; and Uttley, cited above).

The prison authorities were applying the Prison Regulations, made on the basis of the Prison Discipline Law (Cap. 286), under which all prisoners, including life prisoners, were eligible for remission of their sentence on the grounds of good conduct and industry. For these purposes, Regulation 2 defined life imprisonment as meaning imprisonment for twenty years (see paragraph 42 above). As admitted by the Government, this was understood at the time by the executive and the administrative authorities, including the prison service, as imposing a maximum period of twenty years to be served by any person who had been sentenced to life imprisonment (see paragraph 65 above). The prison authorities were therefore assessing the remission of the life sentences of prisoners on the basis of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. This also transpires from the letter sent by the then Attorney-General of the Republic to the President at that time (see paragraph 53 above).",

It accordingly sentenced the applicant to \u201clife imprisonment\u201d for the remainder of his life. In spite of this, when the applicant was admitted to prison to serve his sentence, he was given a written notice by the prison authorities with a conditional release date, the remission of his life sentence having been assessed on the basis that it amounted to imprisonment for a term of twenty years. It was not until 9 October 1992 in the case of Hadjisavvas v. the Republic of Cyprus (see paragraphs 19 and 50 above) that the Regulations were declared unconstitutional and ultra vires by the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 50-51 above). They were eventually repealed on 3 May 1996.",

The same considerations did not apply to the applicant\u2019s case. Therefore, the Government considered that by requiring the applicant to serve the term of life imprisonment (unconstrained by any impact of the Regulations), thereby treating him differently from the other nine life prisoners, they had plainly pursued the legitimate penal aim of requiring the applicant to serve the full sentence imposed by the Criminal Code and the domestic courts. In this connection, the Government pointed out that the life prisoner, Mr Yiouroukkis, had been treated in exactly the same way and for exactly the same reasons as the applicant.

Greece [GC], no.\u00a034369/97, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2000-IV). A measure which in itself is in conformity with the requirements of the Article enshrining the right or freedom in question may however infringe this Article when read in conjunction with Article 14 for the reason that it is of a discriminatory nature (see, for example, Case \u201crelating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium\u201d v.

In other words, the notion of discrimination includes in general cases where a person or group is treated, without proper justification, less favourably than another, even though the more favourable treatment is not called for by the Convention (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, \u00a7\u00a082, Series A no. 94). Article 14 does not prohibit distinctions in treatment which are founded on an objective assessment of essentially different factual circumstances and which, being based on the public interest, strike a fair balance between the protection of the interests of the community and respect for the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the Convention (see, among other authorities, G.M.B. and K.M. v. Switzerland (dec.), no.\u00a036797/97, 27 September 2001). The Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a difference in treatment (see Gaygusuz v.

The Court observed that, after the expiry of the tariff, continued detention depended on elements of dangerousness and risk associated with the objectives of the original sentence for murder. In the Court\u2019s view, since these elements might change with the course of time, new issues of lawfulness arose which required determination by a body satisfying the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, that is, an independent body with power to order release and following a procedure containing the necessary judicial safeguards, including, for example, the possibility of an oral hearing (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 87-90).",

Nevertheless, even in the absence of a tariff system, it appears to me that the Court\u2019s reasoning in the Stafford case may not be without relevance to a system such as exists in  where there is an express power of conditional release which is applicable even in the case of a mandatory life prisoner. The question whether conditional release should be granted in any individual case must, in my view, principally depend on an assessment of whether the term of imprisonment already served satisfies the necessary element of punishment for the particular offence and, if so, whether the life prisoner poses a continuing danger to society. As the Stafford judgment makes clear, the determination of both questions should in principle be in the hands of an independent body, following procedures containing the necessary judicial safeguards, and not of an executive authority.",

Moreover, section\u00a014 of the Prison Law of 3 May 1996 (as amended by Law no.\u00a012(I)/97) extended the President\u2019s constitutional powers to cover conditional release. Hence, although the prospect of release for prisoners serving life sentences does exist in theory, it is in practice extremely limited. It is true that the mere fact that the prospect of release is limited is not sufficient in itself for a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see Einhorn v. France (dec.), no. 71555/01, \u00a7\u00a7 27-28, ECHR 2001-XI). However, the prospect of release, even if limited, must exist de facto in concrete terms, particularly so as not to aggravate the uncertainty and distress inherent in a life sentence.

Nor is this the President\u2019s practice. In addition, there is no published procedure or criteria governing the operation of these provisions. Consequently, a life prisoner is not aware of the criteria applied or of the reasons for the refusal of his application.

The European Prison Rules adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 11\u00a0January 2006 (Recommendation Rec(2006)2), reflecting the existing European consensus in this field, also refer to the question of release of sentenced prisoners: \u201cIn the case of those prisoners with longer sentences in particular, steps shall be taken to ensure a gradual return to life in free society\u201d (107.2).

Although life imprisonment is provided for by law in most countries, it does not necessarily imply imprisonment for the remainder of the convicted person\u2019s life. Most legal systems provide for the possibility of reviewing life sentences and of granting release after a certain number of years of imprisonment. It is regrettable in this connection that the judgment contains no reference to comparative law. For example, as the parliamentary debates in the United Kingdom concerning the bill to abolish the death penalty in 1964 clearly illustrate, as a general rule \u201cexperience shows that nine years, ten years, or thereabouts is the maximum period of confinement that normal human beings can undergo without their personality decaying, their will going, and their becoming progressively less able to re-enter society and look after themselves and become useful citizens\u201d. The Court often reiterates, in relation to prisoners, that suffering must not go beyond that inevitably associated with the legitimate requirements of the sentence (see Mouisel v. France, no. 67263/01, \u00a7 48, ECHR 2002-IX). However, once it is accepted that the \u201clegitimate requirements of the sentence\u201d entail reintegration, questions may be asked as to whether a term of imprisonment that jeopardises that aim is not in itself capable of constituting inhuman and degrading treatment.",

The distinction between the two sexes in relation to judges is expressly acknowledged in the Rules of Court, since Rule 25 \u00a7 2 requires the Court\u2019s composition to be gender balanced. It is also a matter of concern to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which advocates the presence of women on all lists of candidates for posts as judges of the Court. This has prompted the Committee of Ministers to request an advisory opinion. So the opinion on the sex of candidates for posts as judges will be given by judges who are presented to the public as sexually neutral. Any comment would, to my mind, be superfluous.
