The Government acknowledged a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on account of the excessive length of the first set of criminal proceedings against the applicant and a violation of Article 13 on account of the lack of an effective remedy securing sufficient redress for a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1. They offered payment to the applicant in the sum of 9,180 Polish z\u0142otys. The Government further undertook to adopt a range of general measures in respect of other persons who were victims of similar violations or might be affected by similar violations in the future. The sum referred to above is to cover any pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage as well as costs and expenses, and is to be paid free of any taxes that may be applicable. It would be payable within three months from the date of notification of the decision taken by the Court pursuant to Article 37 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In the event of failure to pay this sum within the said three-month period, the Government undertook to pay simple interest on it, from expiry of that period until settlement, at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points. In addition, the Government made a declaration as to general measures to be adopted in the implementation of the Rutkowski and Others v. Poland pilot judgment (no.\u00a072287/10 and 2 others, 7 July 2015 \u2013 see Za\u0142uska and Rogalska v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), nos. 53491/10 and 72286/10, \u00a7\u00a7 23-25, 20 June 2017).
