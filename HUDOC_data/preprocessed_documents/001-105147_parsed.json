France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999V). Considering the subsidiary role of the Convention machinery, Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to use remedies which relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 does not require that recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v.\u00a0, 18 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52, Reports 1996-VI, and Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 75).",

It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints, and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Soldatenko v. Ukraine, no. 2440/07, \u00a7\u00a048, 23 October 2008). However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been made use of or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement. In this regard the Court notes that it has previously held on multiple occasions that the existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which is not obviously futile is not a valid reason for failing to exhaust domestic remedies (see, for example, Sejdovic v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7\u00a045, ECHR 2006II; Milo\u0161evi\u0107 v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands (dec.), no. 77631/01, 19 March 2002; and Pellegriti v.\u00a0Italy (dec.), no.\u00a077363/01, 26 May 2005).",

In such circumstances it can be said that the burden of proof shifts once again, so that it becomes incumbent on the respondent Government to show what they have done in response to the scale and seriousness of the matters complained of (see Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7\u00a076).",

It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others v.

The Government failed to specify what actions \u2013 and by whom \u2013 ought to have been the subject of a private prosecution.

While referring to the relevant time spent in the punishment cell in Gr\u012bvas prison the applicant mentioned that he \u201cwas lying on the floor with a bleeding face\u201d (see paragraph 30 above), however, he has failed to establish any causal link between his allegations concerning his treatment and the conditions in that cell and the \u201cbleeding\u201d.

The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s reference to a \u201cwell-established practice\u201d of not investigating complaints about violence against prisoners is not sufficiently supported by any real-life examples, from his own experience or elsewhere. With regard to the applicant\u2019s argument that his lack of legal qualifications and lack of resources to obtain legal representation constituted an impediment to appealing against the reply from 22 January 2001, the Court observes that the Law on the Prosecutor\u2019s Office does not require an appeal to be lodged in any particular form. Neither is it required to contain any legally substantiated arguments. It would have been sufficient for the applicant to merely submit to a hierarchically superior prosecutor his account of the events of September 2000 and to explain his disagreement with the reply of 22 January 2001. Furthermore, no fee is payable for lodging a hierarchical appeal. Thus, while the Court recognises that adequate legal substantiation would have given additional weight to the applicant\u2019s appeal, his purported inability to secure legal representation does not constitute an insurmountable obstacle to at least attempting to lodge a hierarchical appeal. Lastly, taking into account the fact that no hierarchical appeal was ever lodged, the applicant\u2019s argument concerning the prosecutor\u2019s purported inability to award compensation is to be considered \u201cmere doubts\u201d. The Court is thus unable to examine properly the effectiveness of a hierarchical appeal in the absence of any attempt on the part of the applicant to avail himself of this remedy.",

Furthermore, the Court notes that the CPT has identified significant shortcomings in the way Latvian prisons, at the relevant time and also subsequently, treated prisoners\u2019 complaints to national authorities (see paragraph 40 above). The Government have not identified any guarantees in domestic law or practice which would mandate any different treatment of prisoners\u2019 correspondence with the Court.

Taking that into account, the Court considers that the respondent State has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 34 of the Convention.

The Court emphasises that in certain situations the destruction of documents pertinent to a case pending in Strasbourg could not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of applicants\u2019 allegations but also could be seen as the respondent State\u2019s failure to comply with its obligations under Article 38 of the Convention. The fact that the documents were destroyed very soon after the application was communicated to the Government raises serious concerns. However, in view of the finding of a violation of Article 34, the Court does not consider it necessary to rule further on this question in the present case.",
