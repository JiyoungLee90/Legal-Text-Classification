In the context of the right to marry it could mean that the authorities, in exercising their power in this area, could monitor the wedding ceremony and limit, for instance, the number of participants. However, they should maintain a fair balance between the demands of security in prison and the prisoner\u2019s right to marry. Their discretion should be limited to, and their decisions based on, concrete facts, not on prejudice. A refusal should be restricted to situations where the marriage ceremony would jeopardise the prison security \u2013 and not be merely difficult to organise. Moreover, rules regulating the authorities\u2019 discretion should be laid down in the national law. In particular, the law ought to list specific circumstances in which the authorities should not give leave to marry \u2013 for example, if it would affect the process of rehabilitation. In this context, it must be stressed that the issues involved were of\u00a0a\u00a0sensitive nature; thus, an unjustified refusal to grant leave to marry could be regarded as additional or disciplinary punishment.",
