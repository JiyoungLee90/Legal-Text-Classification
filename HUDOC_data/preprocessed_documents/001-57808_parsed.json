It suffices that when making these inquiries he belongs to the same category of judicial officers, namely officers whose function it is to prepare the case for trial by actively conducting an inquisitorial inquiry. By the same token the extent of the inquiries made is also immaterial: what is at issue is a functional lack of impartiality.",

Nevertheless, as I stated in paragraphs 3.4 and 3.5 of my dissenting opinion in the Borgers v.  case (judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 214-B, pp. 45-46), for a final conclusion a second test is required. Indeed, determining whether fears as to impartiality are \"objectively justified\" implies also a weighing of interests, since what is at stake is not only the confidence which the courts must inspire, but also the public interest in having a rational and smoothly operating judicial system. Consequently, it remains to be seen whether, in cases like the present one, the latter interests should prevail.",

Many Contracting States have a District Court system which is essentially similar to the Austrian one. Its main features are a close network of often small courts where both civil and criminal cases of lesser importance are dealt with locally (i.e. where those concerned are domiciled), in proceedings characterised by a minimum of formalities. This makes it possible for those who so wish to defend themselves and to settle cases within a short time and with a minimum of costs and expenses. Extension of the De Cubber doctrine to criminal proceedings before District Courts would undoubtedly upset this valuable system, if only because it may be supposed that the situation will not infrequently be like that described by the Government which alleged that \"in Austria\u2019s rural areas many District Courts have only one judge or one judge may be in charge of several district courts\". To require in such situations that a case not be tried by a judge who has made preliminary inquiries would result in the trial having to be held before another District Court to which the accused would have to travel. Seeing also that a professional judge who has already had to deal with a case at an earlier stage of the proceedings must be deemed to be able to put this out of his mind when sitting as a trial judge (this being the rationale of paragraphs 49 and 50 of the above-mentioned Hauschildt judgment of 24 May 1989), I feel that to oblige Contracting States to change the District Court system by extending the De Cubber doctrine would amount to setting too much store by appearances.",
