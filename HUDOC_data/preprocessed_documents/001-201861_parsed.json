Moreover, the expert\u2019s reports confirmed that the metal fragments found at the scene of the incident near the applicant\u2019s house were splinters from an exploded aerial missile (see paragraphs 29 and 39 above), a type of weapon that would also presumably be held in the exclusive possession of the State. It is furthermore clear from the adduced documents that the domestic investigation established military involvement in the crime and requested that the investigation be carried out by military investigators (see paragraphs 30 and 53 above). Finally, the Government in their initial submission before the Court stated that the \u201ccrime had been committed by military pilots\u201d (see paragraph 55 above).

The Court finds that their failure to act for several weeks undermined the effectiveness of the investigation. Once underway, the investigation was plagued with inexplicable delays and shortcomings in respect of the most trivial steps. In particular, evidence which was directly relevant to the attack in question \u2013 such as records of orders given and received, records of combat air missions, records of military actions, combat orders, reports on executed combat missions, photographs and tape recordings \u2013 was not requested and obtained shortly after the opening of the criminal case in the beginning of 2005 but requested only three years later, in March 2009, when the relevant evidence had already been destroyed owing to the expiration of the retention period (see paragraphs 45 and 47 above). Furthermore, the critical evidence that would potentially have allowed for the identification of the helicopter and its pilot was lost by the investigators (see paragraphs 38, 39, 42 and 44 above).",
