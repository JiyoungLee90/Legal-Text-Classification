For example, no explanation was provided as to why the investigating judge only delivered a decision on the admissibility of the appeal fourteen days after it had been lodged, and nor was any explanation provided for the fact that the public prosecutor only submitted observations in that regard on 27 April 2015. In addition, no explanation was provided as regards the period of fifty-one days which elapsed between the file being received by the Lisbon Court of Appeal and the decision being delivered, which the Government considered to have exceeded the thirty-day time-limit provided by Article 219 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The Court is concerned about the existence in domestic legal orders of legal provisions establishing non-binding time-limits in appeal proceedings where an individual\u2019s personal liberty is at stake. It considers that such provisions are incompatible with States\u2019 obligations under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.
