The court considered that, in the presence of well-founded doubts about the actual size of the land owned by S.F., the KCA had acted lawfully and diligently by suspending the restoration of the property rights and initiating the reopening of the proceedings. The fact that the courts dealing with the reopened proceedings had found that S.F. had owned less land than initially determined (48.40\u00a0hectares and 47.91 hectares, as opposed to the initial estimate of 68.26 hectares) showed that the suspension had had a proper basis.

In addition, the Supreme Administrative Court distinguished between the KCA\u2019s competence and that of the Ministry of Finance: while the KCA was responsible for the restoration of property rights, it was the Ministry of Finance which had the authority to cancel the applicant\u2019s debt and issue the bank with a certificate confirming such cancellation. The KCA\u2019s request of the Ministry of Finance to suspend the cancellation of the applicant\u2019s debt (see paragraph 11 above) had not been legally binding on the Ministry, and had had no legal effect on the cancellation of the debt. The court further held that the suspension of restoration of the applicant\u2019s property rights had been ordered not by the KCA but by the ruling of the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court of 21\u00a0March 2002, and the ruling had been revoked by that same court only on 26 October 2004 (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above).

The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. To be effective, a remedy must be capable of directly redressing the impugned state of affairs and must offer reasonable prospects of success (see Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09, 45886/07 and 32431/08, \u00a7 222, ECHR 2014 (extracts), and the cases cited therein). It also reiterates that if there are a number of domestic remedies which an individual can pursue, that person is entitled to choose a remedy which addresses his or her essential grievance. In other words, when a remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see O\u2019Keeffe v.

While the Contracting States have a wide discretion in regulating the restitution process (see Pauk\u0161tis v. Lithuania, no.\u00a017467/07, \u00a7 74, 24 November 2015, and the cases cited therein), the Court observes that the domestic law in force at the material time provided that the cancellation of debts to the State was one of the ways to restore property rights (see paragraph 31 above), and it was not disputed at any stage of the domestic proceedings that the applicant had fulfilled the relevant criteria to have her debt cancelled as compensation for property rights (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above).

The Court underlines that when the applicant obtained from A.E. the right to have her property rights restored, she had no reason to doubt that the Kaunas District Court\u2019s ruling of 23\u00a0May 2001 was accurate and would remain final. The Court has previously held that the principle of good governance requires that any errors made by State authorities should not be remedied at the expense of individuals who have acquired property rights in good faith (see, among other authorities, Pincov\u00e1 and Pinc v.\u00a0the\u00a0Czech Republic, no.\u00a036548/97, \u00a7\u00a058, ECHR 2002VIII; Radchikov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 65582/01, \u00a7 50, 24\u00a0May 2007; Gashi v.

The bank did not require the applicant to repay the loan, but continued calculating interest, which she paid until September 2002. After the applicant stopped paying interest, it appears that the bank did not contact her about the unpaid interest and the pending late payment fines until January 2005, after her debt had already been cancelled (see paragraphs 17-18 above). While the domestic courts found the payment of interest justified, they did not examine whether the applicant\u2019s legal obligations during the period in question had been clarified to her by either the bank or the State authorities involved in the debt cancellation process (see paragraphs 23-24 above).",

Poland, no.\u00a010373/05, \u00a7 69, 15 September 2009). It also considers that the length of the delay in cancelling the applicant\u2019s debt (three years and almost two months) in the circumstances of the present case cannot be considered excessive. That period included several different sets of court proceedings (an application to reopen the civil proceedings, an application to suspend the KCA\u2019s decisions, an examination of the merits in the reopened proceedings, and revocation of the order suspending the KCA\u2019s decisions), as well as the exchange of information between the KCA, the prosecutor and the Ministry of Finance. There do not appear to have been any significant periods of inactivity on the part of the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Romankevi\u010d v. Lithuania, no. 25747/07, \u00a7\u00a7 43-44, 2\u00a0December 2014). The Court also notes that the applicant was included in all the relevant court proceedings as a third party and exercised her procedural rights (see Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a068).",

While her expenses during the period of delay were not insignificant, eventually more than ninety percent of the total value of her debt was cancelled (see paragraph 57 above). All the expenses which the applicant sustained in relation to the two loans (consisting of the parts of the loans which she had repaid, the sum which she paid to A.E., and the interest, late payment fines and legal expenses) together amounted to less than half of the total value of the loans. Moreover, during the period when the debt cancellation was delayed, the applicant retained the use of the apartment which she had acquired with the help of those loans, that is she continued to enjoy the benefits derived from the loans (compare with Bogdel v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 41248/06, \u00a7 67, 26 November 2013, and contrast with JGK\u00a0Statyba Ltd and Guselnikovas v. Lithuania, no. 3330/12, \u00a7\u00a7 143-144, 5\u00a0November 2013). In this connection, the Court also notes that the applicant was entitled to the cancellation of her debt, not because she or her ancestors had had property nationalised by the Soviet regime, but because she had bought the right to restoration from a third party, and at the time when she received the two loans, given to her by the State under preferential conditions (see paragraph 6 above), she could not have reasonably expected that her debt under those loan agreements would subsequently be cancelled. Accordingly, the Court considers that the delay in the cancellation of the applicant\u2019s debt and her losses resulting from that delay did not disproportionately affect the benefits which she derived from the two loans and the eventual cancellation of her outstanding debt.",
