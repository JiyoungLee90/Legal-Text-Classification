Ukraine, nos. 23759/03 and 37943/06, \u00a7 51, 14 October 2010). The principle of lawfulness also presupposes that the applicable provisions of domestic law be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7 109, ECHR 2000-I). The Court has limited power, however, to review compliance with domestic law (ibid, \u00a7 108).",

However, Article\u00a0100a (4) provides that the court shall also issue a confiscation order in proceedings regulated by law when, for factual or legal obstacles, it is not possible for criminal proceedings to be conducted against the offender. In this regard, the Court recalls that the first-instance court acquitted Sh.A. of charges of forgery of a document concerning the vehicle\u2019s chassis number and furthermore rejected an indictment brought by the public prosecutor against a certain I.S. (see paragraph 8 above). Furthermore, the Court notes that the Government submitted examples of case-law, both pre- and post-dating the final decision in the applicant\u2019s case, which demonstrated that the same domestic court had consistently upheld confiscation orders, even in situations where there had been no \u201coffenders\u201d (as there had been no final convictions). In view of this and having in mind its limited power to review compliance with domestic law, the Court accepts that the interpretation of Article 100-a (2) by the domestic courts was sufficiently foreseeable. The impugned interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights is thus \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

In addition, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aims sought to be realised. In other words, the Court must determine whether a fair balance was struck between the demands of the general interest and the interest of the individuals concerned. As regards the balance between that aim and the applicant\u2019s rights, the Court reiterates that, where possessions that have been used unlawfully are confiscated, such a balance depends on many factors, which include the owner\u2019s behaviour (see Waldemar Nowakowski v. Poland, no. 55167/11, \u00a7 50, 24 July 2012). The requisite balance will not be found if the person or persons concerned have had to bear an individual and excessive burden (see Andonoski, cited above, \u00a7 31 and Waldemar Nowakowski, cited above, \u00a7 47).",

The applicant was not accused in those proceedings. Furthermore, it was established by the domestic courts that the applicant had not been aware that the vehicle had been used to commit an offence (see paragraph 15 above).",

In the Court\u2019s view, this element in the instant case renders it similar to the cases in which the confiscation measure applied to goods whose importation was prohibited (see AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 24 October 1986, Series A no. 108, concerning a ban on import of gold coins; Bosphorus Hava Yollar\u0131 Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v. Ireland [GC], no. 45036/98, ECHR 2005VI, concerning the impounding of a Yugoslav aircraft falling under a sanctions regime). In this respect, the domestic courts established (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above) that the vehicle had to be confiscated in the interest of the general safety. Furthermore, on appeal the applicant claimed that he had not known that the vehicle had been used to commit a crime. The appellate court explicitly considered this argument (see paragraph 15 above) and balanced the interest of the applicant against the mandatory ground of confiscation under Article\u00a0100-a (2) of the Criminal Code relating to the general safety of the public, namely the safety of the \u201croad users of the State\u201d.",

The Court notes that under the relevant domestic law (see paragraph 19 above), the buyer of an item with a legal defect could claim compensation from the seller. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the relevant domestic practice (see paragraph 20 above), the seller (Sh.A. in the present case) was liable for the legal defects even if he or she had not been aware of the legal defect at the time of the sale contract. Thus, the Court is satisfied that the civil claim in question was available to the applicant. The applicant did not explain his failure to lodge such a claim. Moreover, he did not argue that there were any impediments to him resorting to that avenue or any particulars (such as, for example, the death or impossibility to access the seller) which would have rendered it ineffective in the circumstances of the case. Consequently, the Court finds that in his capacity as a buyer who had acted in good faith, the applicant had a judicial remedy before a civil court of general jurisdiction to be indemnified for the damage suffered as a result of the confiscation of the vehicle (see, mutatis mutandis, C.M. v. France (dec.), no. 28078/95, 26\u00a0June 2001).",
