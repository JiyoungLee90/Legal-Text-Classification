The case originated in an application (no. 32396/96) against Hungary lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Lajos Magyar (“the applicant”), on 9 August 1993.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Dr L. Höltzl, Deputy State-Secretary, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the court proceedings concerning the expropriation of his house had been unreasonably long in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 13 January 2000 the Court declared the application partly admissible.
In March 1988 the Budapest 5th District Council, by a decision upheld by the Budapest Metropolitan Council in June 1988, expropriated the applicant’s house. He was granted a flat in exchange and 1,110,000 Hungarian forints as indemnity.
On 1 August 1988 he brought before the Pest Central District Court an action against the Metropolitan Council, challenging the expropriation as such. On 10 August 1988 the District Court suspended the proceedings pending termination of the administrative proceedings concerning enforcement of the expropriation decision, the applicant’s eviction and implementation of the indemnification scheme. The Government stated that these proceedings had later been discontinued since the applicant had not pursued the action.
In September 1989 the applicant brought a further action before the District Court, this time claiming additional indemnity for the expropriated property (“the 1989 action”). On 8 November 1989 the District Court held a hearing and appointed a real-estate expert. On 14 February 1991 the expert presented his opinion as to the value of the property.
Meanwhile, in 1990 the applicant had brought a third action (“the 1990 action”) before the District Court against the Budapest 17th District Council and other defendants seeking judicial review of the expropriation proceedings and compensation for damage.
On 5 March 1991 the District Court held a joint hearing concerning both the 1989 and the 1990 actions, at which the proceedings concerning the former were suspended pending the outcome of the proceedings concerning the latter. On that occasion the applicant extended his 1990 action to include the Budapest Mayor’s Office as defendant. The next hearing in the case was scheduled for 7 May 1991.
On 9 August 1991 the District Court separated the claim for compensation for damage (“the official liability action”) from the remainder of the 1990 action, with a view to transferring the official liability action to the Budapest Regional Court for jurisdictional reasons. The applicant unsuccessfully appealed against the transfer. Owing to confusion between the various documents, the case-file of the official liability action was forwarded to the Regional Court only on 1 March 1995, following a complaint from the applicant.
On 19 December 1995, and 23 April and 17 September 1996 the Regional Court held hearings and, on the latter date, dismissed the official liability action, first examining the merits before deciding that it was time-barred under the relevant provisions of the Civil Code.
The applicant’s appeal against this decision was filed with the Supreme Court on 3 December 1996. 
On 29 May 1997 the Supreme Court held a hearing and suspended the proceedings which have been pending ever since.
As regards the remainder of the applicant’s 1990 action, on 9 August 1991 the District Court discontinued the proceedings, holding that the action in this respect had been lodged out of time. On 8 October 1991 the Regional Court finally dismissed an appeal by the applicant against the discontinuation order.
On 21 March 1994 the Supreme Court rejected his petition for review as it had been lodged after expiry of the 60-day statutory limit, counting from the date of service of the final decision, laid down in Article 272 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
On 9 May 1996 the District Court rejected his request for the re-opening of the case. That decision was upheld by the Regional Court on 9 October 1996.
Meanwhile, on 8 January 1995 the applicant had requested the District Court to resume the proceedings concerning the suspended 1989 action. On 12 September 1996 the District Court held a hearing and again suspended the proceedings pending the decision as to whether to re-open the 1990 action. Subsequent to the Regional Court’s above-mentioned decision of 9 October 1996, on 12 December 1996 the proceedings were resumed.
On 22 May 1998 the District Court decided to discontinue the proceedings, holding that the 1989 action had originally been lodged out of time. The applicant appealed to the Regional Court.
On 6 June 2000 the Regional Court upheld the first-instance decision.
On 30 August 2000 the applicant’s petition for review was forwarded to the Supreme Court before which the proceedings are still pending.
