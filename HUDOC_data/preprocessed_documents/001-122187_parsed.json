According to the Court\u2019s case-law, there are two tests for assessing whether a tribunal is impartial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. The first test (subjective) consists in seeking to determine the personal conviction of a particular judge in a given case. The personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary. As to the second test (objective), it means determining whether, quite apart from the personal conduct of a judge, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his/her impartiality (see, for example, Gautrin and Others v. France, 20\u00a0May 1998, \u00a7 58, Reports 1998III, and Padovani v. Italy, 26 February 1993, \u00a7 26, Series A no. 257B).",

However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test) (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2005XIII). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge\u2019s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III).",
