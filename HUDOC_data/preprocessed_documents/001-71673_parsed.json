Shortly afterwards, OZ called the applicant and asked him to buy heroin for her. She complained that she badly needed drugs as she was suffering from withdrawal symptoms. Frightened that she might commit suicide, the applicant agreed and arranged to meet her near the block of flats where SZ lived. They met later in the evening. He received 200 roubles (RUR) from OZ and went to SZ\u2019s flat, where SZ sold him one sachet of heroin at a cost of RUR 300. Since the amount of heroin bought from SZ was insufficient even for his own needs, he decided not to share it with OZ. The applicant further submitted to the court that he had subsequently given OZ a soporific, telling her that the narcotic was of bad quality and that he would repay her money later. As he left, he saw people approaching who were, as he subsequently learned, police officers. He escaped from them, throwing the drugs away. Later that night he returned and found the drugs. The next day, with the drugs still in his possession, he went to work, where he was arrested by the police. They found the drugs in his possession and seized them.",

In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is therefore primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see Schenk v. Switzerland, judgment of 12 July 1988, Series A no. 140, p.\u00a029, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, and, for a more recent example in a different context, Teixeira de Castro v.

As regards the amount of heroin \u2013 0.008 grams \u2013 which the applicant was found to have procured for OZ at her request, the Presidium of the Moscow City Court held that the applicant had acted as an accomplice to OZ, who had purchased heroin for her personal consumption.

It observes that OZ acted on police instructions. She agreed to take part in the \u201ctest purchase\u201d of drugs in order to expose drug trafficking by the applicant, and asked him to procure drugs for her. There is no evidence to suggest that before the intervention by OZ the police had reason to suspect that the applicant was a drug dealer. A mere claim at the trial by the police to the effect that they possessed information concerning the applicant\u2019s involvement in drugdealing, a statement which does not seem to have been scrutinised by the court, cannot be taken into account. The police had not confined themselves to investigating the applicant\u2019s criminal activity in an essentially passive manner. There is nothing to suggest that the offence would have been committed had it not been for the above intervention of OZ. The Court therefore concludes that the police incited the offence of procuring drugs at OZ\u2019s request. The applicant\u2019s conviction for joint participation in the procurement and storage of heroin, in so far as his procuring the narcotics for OZ is concerned, was based mainly on evidence obtained as a result of the police operation, including the statements by OZ and police officers EF and MB. Thus, the police\u2019s intervention and the use of the resultant evidence in the ensuing criminal proceedings against the applicant irremediably undermined the fairness of the trial.",
