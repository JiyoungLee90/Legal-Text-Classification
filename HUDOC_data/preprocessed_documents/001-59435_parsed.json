In this respect, it is to be recalled that a delay in the criminal proceedings caused by a lawyers\u2019 strike cannot be attributed to the State, whereas the period of time elapsed between the end of the strike and the new hearing is to be imputed to the conduct of the authorities (see the Portington v. Greece judgment of 23\u00a0September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2633, \u00a7\u00a033). In the present case the following hearing was fixed at 11\u00a0April 1996, which is more than ten months after the end of the strike. Even if the Court is not unaware of the complications which strikes may cause by overloading the list of cases to be heard by courts (see, mutatis mutandis, the Papageorgiou v. Greece judgment of 22 October 1997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 2291, \u00a7 48), it considers that this delay is excessive and must be imputed, at least in part, to the State authorities. ",
