The case originated in an application (no. 34942/05) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Igor Aleksandrovich Kolkutin (“the applicant”), on 1 September 2005.
The applicant was represented by Ms S. Davydova, a lawyer practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 2 July 2009 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Chita.
On 2 September 2004 the applicant was arrested on the charges of fraud and forgery of official documents. On 4 September 2004 the Tsentralnyy District Court of Chita authorised the applicant’s pre-trial detention. The court reasoned as follows:
“The evidence collected ... incriminated [the applicant] ... in a serious crime which entails a custodial sentence exceeding ten years. ... The court takes note of the [applicant’s] character. However, ... it considers that, if at large, [the applicant] might put pressure on victims and witnesses or otherwise interfere with administration of justice or continue criminal activities, Accordingly, ... the court considers it necessary to remand [the applicant] in custody.”
.  On 11 November 2004 the Chita Regional Court upheld the decision of 2 September 2004 on appeal.
.  The applicant remained in custody pending investigation and trial. The court extended his pre-trial detention on several occasions reiterating, in substance, the reasoning employed by the District Court on 2 September 2004.
.  On 4 June 2007 the District Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment.
