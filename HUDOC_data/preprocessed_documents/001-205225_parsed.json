In particular, Article 37 of the CAO prescribed a two-month prescription period after the discovery of the offence within which an administrative penalty could be imposed on the offender. In his case, the Customs Oversight Department of the Revenue Committee had conducted a review and produced a statement on 30 July 2008 which had revealed all the errors contained in the customs declaration of 30 October 2006. The decision of 27 October 2008 to impose a fine had been based on the breaches disclosed in that statement, therefore the offence had been fully identified by the statement and nothing had prevented the relevant authority from carrying out further checks, if necessary, and imposing a fine within two months of the date of that statement. The fine, however, had been imposed only on 27 October 2008. Contrary to the Government\u2019s assertions, Article 37 of the CAO did not specify the moment when an offence was considered to have been discovered, because this issue depended on the particular circumstances of each case, and that Article could not contain an exhaustive list of such situations. The Government were also mistaken in claiming that any act was first to be formally characterised as an offence before triggering the running of the two-month prescription period. In particular, Article 37 of the CAO used the term \u201cdiscovered\u201d, and it was the date of discovery of the offence which was crucial, and not the date of initiation of the administrative proceedings. Moreover, the formal characterisation of any act as an offence was made only by the decision to impose an administrative penalty taken at the close of the administrative proceedings and not at the moment when such proceedings were initiated. The administrative body, following such administrative proceedings, might as well have concluded that no offence had been committed. In sum, the interference with his possessions had been unlawful and arbitrary, while the rule prescribed by Article 37 of the CAO and the relevant domestic decisions were not foreseeable as it was not clear to him that a fine could be imposed on him after the expiry of the two-months prescription period.",

In that decision the Court of Cassation had interpreted and applied the legal norm applicable to his case, namely Article 37 of the CAO, and determined the point in the proceedings to be regarded as the date of discovery of the offence. The two cases had been identical since in both of them a breach of customs regulations had been drawn up. However, in that case the offence had been considered discovered on the date when the authorities had revealed the breach for the very first time, that is to say when they had prepared the customs-inspection report. Hence, the date of discovery of the offence had been the date when the offence had been recorded for the first time by the authorities, regardless of the type of document, which in his case had been the statement of 30 July 2008. The Government\u2019s position that this statement had been only an informative document and therefore could not be considered as the date of discovery of the offence contradicted the above decision of the Court of Cassation.",

This had been an established practice applied by the Revenue Committee in cases concerning breaches of customs regulations. Moreover, for the two-month prescription period set out in that Article to start running, any act had first to be characterised as an offence. Thus, a number of errors had been identified by the tax inspectors in their statement of 30 July 2008 but not all of them had been considered to amount to an offence under domestic law. The findings in question had been merely the opinion of the officers who had conducted the review and who had not been authorised to give a legal assessment to those acts. This had been possible only after a further thorough examination and analysis. Eventually, only the inaccurate declaration of the value of the imported equipment had been considered to be in breach of customs regulations. Hence, the statement of 30 July 2008 had been only an informative paper and could not be considered as the date on which the offence committed by the applicant had been discovered within the meaning of Article 37 of the CAO. It was for the domestic courts to dissipate any doubts about interpretation of domestic law and, in the present case, the Administrative Court had reached a similar conclusion by holding that the two-month prescription period set out in Article 37 of the CAO had started running from when the record of an administrative offence had been drawn up by the relevant official.

While finding that the offence in the applicant\u2019s case had been discovered on the date when the relevant official had drawn up the record of a breach of customs regulations, the Administrative Court failed to provide any explanation or reasoning whatsoever for its decision (see paragraph 15 above). It entirely ignored the fact that, prior to that date, a customs inspection had been carried out which had revealed the factual elements of the act committed by the applicant, including all the applicant\u2019s submissions in that regard, despite the fact that, as already noted above, the results of a customs check had been previously found by the Court of Cassation to constitute the date of discovery of a customs breach within the meaning of Article 37 of the CAO.

Firstly, they argued that the applicant was not entitled to the estimated value of his flats but to the price of their actual sale at public auctions. Secondly, the third flat had been owned by the applicant jointly with his family members and, therefore, the applicant could only claim the amount of his share in that flat.",

In particular, two flats belonging to him, a share in a third flat and part of his salary were seized for the purpose of payment of the imposed fine. As regards the amount to be awarded for the confiscated flats, the Court disagrees with the Government and considers that the applicant must be awarded compensation for his actual loss, as reflected in the valuations of those flats conducted upon the bailiff\u2019s orders, and not the amount which the authorities managed to obtain through the forcible sale of those flats through public auctions. As regards the Government\u2019s argument concerning the third flat, the Court agrees that the applicant must be awarded a sum equivalent to his share in that flat. Thus, having regard to all the material in its possession, the Court awards the applicant EUR 20,800 in respect of pecuniary damage.",
