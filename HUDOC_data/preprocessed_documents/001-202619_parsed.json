The judicial authorities also considered that, in view of the complexity of the case, which involved numerous defendants, multiple charges and a number of witness statements, including the testimony of a \u201ccrown witness\u201d, the applicant\u2019s detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings.",

In this respect, the Court reiterates that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending (see G\u00f3rski v. Poland, no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7\u00a057, 4\u00a0October 2005). However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see for instance Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-81, 26\u00a0July 2001; and Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02, \u00a7\u00a049, 4\u00a0May 2006).",

In the Court\u2019s view, the fact that the case concerned a member of such a criminal group should be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 (see B\u0105k v. Poland, no. 7870/04, \u00a7\u00a057, 16\u00a0January 2007). In this regard, the Court reiterates its caselaw according to which, in cases concerning organised crime, a relatively longer period of detention on remand could be justified given the particular difficulties in dealing with those cases in the trial courts (see Celejewski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, \u00a7\u00a036, 4 August 2006). However, it does not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure. Firstly, with the passage of time, the initial grounds for pre-trial detention become less and less relevant and the domestic courts should rely on other \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d grounds to justify the continued deprivation of liberty (see, among many other authorities, I.A. v. France, judgment of 23\u00a0September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, p. 2979, \u00a7\u00a0102; and Labita v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 153, ECHR 2000IV). Secondly, even if, due to the particular circumstances of the case, detention on remand is extended beyond the period generally accepted under the Court\u2019s case-law, particularly strong reasons would be required to justify this (see Pasi\u0144ski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 6356/04, \u00a7 44, 20 June 2006).",

It was noted that the applicant had attempted to contact and influence witnesses. Moreover, he had undertaken preparations in order to murder a witness in another case (see paragraph 11 above). The Court accepts that the risk of collusion flowing from the nature of the applicant\u2019s criminal activities existed initially. Nevertheless, with the passage of time, the grounds invoked to justify detention on remand should have been carefully reassessed in the circumstances of the case at later stages of the proceedings. In this respect the Court notes that in their decisions extending the applicant\u2019s detention the domestic courts often repeated the wording of the decisions previously given (see, in particular, paragraph 13 above).",
