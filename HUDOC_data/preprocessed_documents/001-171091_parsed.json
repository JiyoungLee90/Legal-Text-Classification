The Government have presented no arguments or evidence to enable the Court to reach a different conclusion in the cases at hand. In the light of the violation found in respect of the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 3 of the Convention, thus confirming its \u201carguable\u201d nature, the Court concludes that the complaint under Article 13 is admissible.
