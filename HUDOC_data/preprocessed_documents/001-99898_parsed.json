Firstly, the confession contained the applicant's hand-written note that he had given it without any pressure on the part of the police. Secondly, according to the expert report of 18 September 2000, no injuries on the applicant's body had been recorded. Furthermore, at the time of the applicant's admission to remand centre SI-1/2 on 11 September 2000, the facility doctor had noted \u201cacute chronic otitis\u201d but had not recorded any abrasions. The Government claimed that the authorities had questioned the head of remand centre SI-1/2 and the forensic expert who had examined the applicant on 14 September 2000. The former had claimed that during his detention the applicant had only applied to the remand centre medical unit in connection with influenza and had received the relevant treatment. The latter confirmed that the applicant had not had any bodily injuries. The Government further submitted that, according to the statement by officer A.M., of remand centre SI-1/2 (see paragraph 86 above), the applicant had not had any injuries during his detention there. Moreover, the applicant and his lawyer had never appealed to a prosecutor or a court against the refusal to initiate a criminal investigation into their allegations. In any event, the domestic authorities had investigated the applicant's allegations during an inquiry and in the criminal proceedings against him and had dismissed them as unfounded. The Government invited the Court to reject the applicant's complaint as unfounded and also for failure to exhaust the domestic remedies.",

He pointed out that the Government had not contested the summary of facts prepared by the Court's Registry on the basis of his original submissions and that they had merely asserted that his allegations were unsubstantiated and had not been corroborated by medical reports. The applicant maintained that he had not had any health-related complaints since he had come to Bashkortostan in 1997 or before his interrogation in September\u00a02000, as was confirmed by a certificate from the local hospital. As a consequence of the beatings, he suffered from pain in the kidney area and collar bone, and deafness of the left ear. As he had been taken into police custody in good health, the State was required to provide a plausible explanation of how the injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arose under Article 3. The applicant further submitted that the medical documents drawn up after he had been tortured, such as the expert report of 14-18 September 2000, had not reflected the truth about his physical condition at that time and that the subsequent medical examination had not indicated the causes of his otitis. The applicant referred to statements by I.R. and V.Z. and to his lawyer's letter of 14 September 2000, which corroborated his version of events and on which the Government had failed to comment. Relying on the Court's judgment in Afanasyev v. Ukraine (no. 38722/02, \u00a7\u00a7 62-63, 5 April 2005), the applicant argued that the medical evidence confirming the after-effects of the beatings, such as the deafness in the left ear and the otitis; statements by witnesses, such as his cellmates and lawyer; his own detailed and consistent account of events (the fact that he had described in minute detail the ill-treatment he was subjected to, the layout of the rooms, doors, furniture, ranks and names of the police officers); and the authorities' failure to explain the origin of his injuries, had, cumulatively, proven that he had been ill-treated by the police during his detention on 8-9 September 2000. Finally, he noted that he had consistently denied his involvement in the murder (during the interviews on 3 August and 5\u00a0September and the meetings with his lawyer on 6 and 7\u00a0September) and that it was hard to imagine that he would have suddenly decided to confess on 9 September when his counsel had been absent.",

No specific questions had been put to the police officers. As to the medical report of 18 September 2000, the applicant disagreed with its conclusions and saw as the only possible explanation of it the doctor's bias or pressure from the police officers not to record the actual injuries. The prosecutor had not taken any steps to establish the truth: thus, he had not interrogated possible witnesses about the applicant's state of health at the material time. In any event, the investigation had not been impartial because Kh.A., who had been at the same time responsible for the investigation of the murder, had been aware of the beatings, and had been an official of the prosecutor's office.",

The courts at two instances did not refuse to entertain his complaints for failure to comply with any formal requirements. They took cognisance of the merits of those complaints by interviewing the applicant and the police officers and examining the inquiry materials and upheld the conclusions of the prosecutor (see Vladimir Fedorov v. Russia, no. 19223/04, \u00a7 47, 30 July 2009). The Government did not argue that in pursuing this avenue of judicial review, the applicant had removed from the courts the option of examining the relevant issues (compare Akulinin and Babich v. Russia, no.\u00a05742/02, \u00a7 32, 2 October 2008). In those circumstances, where the courts have already embarked on the analysis of the applicant's complaints, the Court does not find it unreasonable that the applicant did not lodge the same complaints with the same courts (see Vladimir Fedorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a049). Bearing this in mind, the Court considers that it has not been established with sufficient certainty that the remedy advanced by the Government could have been effective in the particular circumstances of the present case (see Vladimir Fedorov and Akulinin and Babich, both cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 49 and 32, respectively).",

Nor did the Government specify any good cause for restriction on his right to benefit from the assistance of his lawyer. The applicant further submitted that no satisfactory procedures had been available at the trial to check that his confession had not been given under duress. The trial and appeal courts had grounded their findings on the medical report of \n14-18\u00a0September 2000 and the prosecutor's decision of 24 September 2000, but they had had no evidence of his involvement in the crime other than his confession.",

In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure respect for the right of an accused not to incriminate himself (see Jalloh v.

The Court has already discussed the circumstances in which the confession was obtained and considers that they were such as to cast doubts on its reliability. It also transpires that although the trial and appeal courts dealt with the applicant's submissions concerning duress, the relevant court decisions contain no ruling on the issue of legal assistance, despite the fact that the applicant consistently raised this matter at both levels of jurisdiction (see paragraphs 58 and 67-69 above). Hence, the Court is not satisfied that the applicant's grievance received an appropriate response from the national courts and considers that fair procedures for making an assessment of the issue of legal assistance proved non-existent in the present case.",
