Thus, Article 6 \u2013 especially paragraph 3 \u2013 may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions (see Imbrioscia v.

The manner in which Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) is to be applied during the preliminary investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings involved and on the circumstances of the case. The moment from which Article 6 applies in \u201ccriminal\u201d matters also depends on the circumstances of the case, as the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial prompts the Court to prefer a \u201csubstantive\u201d, rather than a \u201cformal\u201d, conception of the \u201ccharge\u201d contemplated by Article 6 \u00a7 1.

France, no. 29731/96, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2001-II). Furthermore, Article 6 may also be relevant before a case is sent for trial and in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with it (see Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 36; and \u00d6calan v.

The manner in which Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) are applied during the investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings and the facts of the case. Article 6 will normally require that the accused already be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer at the initial stages of police interrogation. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (Salduz v.

The existence of such a suspicion is confirmed by the fact that the investigator took further steps to check the credibility of the applicant\u2019s self-incriminating statements and conducted investigative procedures, such as an on-site reconstruction of the crime, which are usually conducted with suspects. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the applicant\u2019s position was significantly affected as soon as the suspicion against him was seriously investigated and the prosecution case compiled (see X v. the United Kingdom, no. 728/74, Commission decision of 11 May 1978, Decisions and Reports (DR) 14, p. 27).

Furthermore, the Court notes that Ukrainian legislation provides for obligatory legal representation of persons who could expect life imprisonment if convicted.

Although the applicant failed to substantiate any physical coercion by the investigators, the fact that another person within the same proceedings also confessed to the murder of Mrs K. and retracted his statement, alleging coercion by the same investigator, could raise reasonable doubts as to the practices of the investigator in the present case. In addition, the applicant, having been warned about criminal liability for refusal to testify and at the same time having been informed about his right not to testify against himself, could have been confused, as he alleged, about his liability for refusal to testify, especially in the absence of legal advice during that interview. It should be further noted that although the applicant had retracted his testimonies during the court hearings the domestic authorities based his conviction for the murder of Mrs K. to a decisive extent, if not solely, on these self-incriminating statements. The statements did not in fact contain any information which was not already known to the investigators (in contrast to the case of the kidnapping and murder of S., in which the applicant showed the police where the corpse had been hidden) and had been received in unclear circumstances and in clear violation of the applicant\u2019s right to defence.",
