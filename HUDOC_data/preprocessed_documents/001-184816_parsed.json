It considered that the applicant had been properly summoned to the appeal hearing because the requirements for service by public notification, as set out in Article 40 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, had been met. The summons to attend the hearing before the District Court had been served on the applicant\u2019s previous address in Germany and he had lodged the appeal in question. As regards his interest in having the District Court\u2019s judgment reviewed, it had been his responsibility to ensure that it was possible for the summons to appear at the appeal hearing to be served in Germany. As a result of his move to Spain it had not been possible to serve the summons at his previous address in Hamburg. It had thus been acceptable for the summons to be served by public notification. There had been neither an obligation to undertake an attempt to serve the summons at the applicant\u2019s new address abroad prior to serving it via public notification nor one to notify him at that address that the summons had been served by public notification. The applicant had also not specifically authorised (under the first sentence of Article 145a \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) his lawyer to receive summonses (see paragraph 19 below). Moreover, the applicant had not convincingly shown that he had been prevented through no fault of his own from appearing at the appeal hearing, as required by Article 44 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 19 below), because the applicant\u2019s lawyer had not provided an affidavit to support his claim that he had advised the applicant, on 12 May 2009, that the latter did not need to attend the hearing because he had not been summoned. As his appearance in person had been ordered (see paragraph 8 above), it had not been possible to carry out the appeal hearing in his absence.",

They disputed that the applicant and his lawyer had actually concluded the fee agreement of 12 March 2009 concerning the proceedings before the domestic courts which the applicant had submitted. In its judgment of 2 March 2009 the District Court had allowed the applicant to pay his fine in instalments in the light of his economic situation (see paragraph 6 above). Before that court the applicant had asked that his lawyer be admitted despite his still being a law student because he did not have enough money to pay for a lawyer. Under these circumstances, it does not appear credible that the applicant had agreed to pay an hourly rate of EUR 120. In any event, such an hourly rate was excessive for legal representation by a law student, as were the sixty-eight working hours claimed. Submitting that the amount of statutory reimbursement for the proceedings before the Court of Appeal would have been EUR 636.65 and EUR 490.28 for those before the Federal Constitutional Court, they argued that the applicant\u2019s lawyer could realistically have claimed half of these amounts as he had not been a qualified attorney but only a law student at that time. While Mr Arif had qualified as an attorney in the meantime, the costs and expenses claimed for the proceedings before the Court were excessive. They argued that a sum of EUR 600.71 would correspond to the amount of statutory reimbursement and thus be adequate.",
