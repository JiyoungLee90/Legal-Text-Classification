The cell had very limited access to daylight since the window was covered with three layers of metal netting. It was not properly heated or ventilated. The applicant and other detainees had to bring their own clothing and bed linen and to repair and furnish the cell. Moreover, the State allocated approximately EUR\u00a00.28 per day for purchasing food for each detainee (representing 35-40% of the sum required for food, as estimated by the authorities), and the food was inedible. Water and electricity were only provided on a schedule and were unavailable for certain periods, including during the entire night. Detainees had to refrain from using the toilet during such periods in order to limit the smell. On bath day there was virtually no running water in the cell throughout the day.
