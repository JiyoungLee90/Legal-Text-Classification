Around noon, a large crowd had gathered on Medine boulevard because of the demonstrations ... We had to close the workshop. There were about 50-60 demonstrators and 5-6 police officers, wearing camouflage clothing and balaclavas. As we were locking up the workshop, I saw that masked policemen, with one knee on the ground (yere diz \u00e7\u00f6kerek), were firing guns unremittingly towards the demonstrators. Tar\u0131k Ataykaya was with us. He did not take part in the demonstrations. After leaving the workshop Tar\u0131k Ataykaya went back there because the demonstrators were heading towards us. [At that moment], Tar\u0131k Ataykaya, hit by a bullet fired by one of the policemen, fell to the ground, which means that he was shot by police gunfire. Supporting him, we took him to an empty space near a building and called an ambulance. Tar\u0131k Ataykaya had been struck on the head and small pieces of his brain had come out. We took Tar\u0131k Ataykaya to hospital with a pick-up truck as there was no sign of the ambulance. As the policemen were masked, I am unable to identify them.\u201d",

In particular, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the aims set out in sub-paragraphs 2 (a), (b) and (c) of Article 2. Furthermore, in keeping with the importance of this provision in a democratic society, the Court must, in making its assessment, subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of the agents of the State who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances, including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (see Giuliani and Gaggio v.

First of all, it is not disputed that the applicant\u2019s son, Tar\u0131k Ataykaya, was killed on 29 March 2006 by a tear-gas grenade fired by the security forces. Nor is it disputed that he was part of a group of violent demonstrators and found himself by chance between the demonstrators and the police. The Court would further observe that Tar\u0131k Ataykaya was killed by a member of the security forces who was masked at the time of the incident. It has thus been established \u201cbeyond any reasonable doubt\u201d that a member of the security forces fired a tear-gas grenade towards Tar\u0131k Ataykaya, injuring him in the head and causing his death. It follows that the burden of proof is on the authorities, which have a duty to show that the use of lethal force in question was made absolutely necessary by the situation and that it was not excessive or unjustified within the meaning of Article\u00a02 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Bekta\u015f and \u00d6zalp v. Turkey, no.\u00a010036/03, \u00a7\u00a057, 20 April 2010). Against this background, the Court must examine in the present case not only whether the use of potentially lethal force against the applicant\u2019s son was legitimate but also whether the operation was regulated and organised in such a way as to minimise to the greatest extent possible any risk to his life (see Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], no. 50385/99, \u00a7\u00a060, ECHR 2004XI). It must also verify that the authorities did not act negligently in their choice of measures (see Nachova and Others v.

Nor were they able to establish with certainty the number of security force members who had been authorised to use the type of weapon in question at the time of the incident. Initially, in a letter of June 2006, the Diyarbak\u0131r police headquarters informed the public prosecutor\u2019s office that three police officers had used the weapons in question (see paragraph 14 above). Subsequently, in a letter of 10 April 2007, the public prosecutor\u2019s office was informed that twelve other members of the special forces and eleven other members of the rapid intervention force, making a total of twenty-three police officers from the Anti-Terrorist Branch, had also been authorised to use such weapons at the time of the incident (see paragraph 18 above). However, there is no evidence in the case file that the identities of all these officers were notified to the appropriate public prosecutor\u2019s office, which confined itself, moreover, to interviewing only a few of the police officers (see paragraphs 20 and 26 above). Similarly, according to the information in the file, as regards the public prosecutor\u2019s request concerning the places where the officers were stationed, the reply of the police authorities was imprecise, providing vague information and simply indicating that the officers had been posted to different areas at the time of the incident (see paragraph 17 above). In the Court\u2019s view, that lack of cooperation by the police authorities with the public prosecutor\u2019s office responsible for the investigation is all the more inexplicable as the latter\u2019s sole purpose was to obtain official information from a State department.",

On account of that practice, the eyewitnesses were not able to identify the officer who fired at Tar\u0131k Ataykaya (see paragraphs\u00a022-24 above) and it was not possible to interview, as suspects or witnesses, all the officers who had used grenade launchers that day.",

In this connection it would refer to its previous finding, under Article 3 of the Convention, to the effect that any inability to determine the identity of members of the security forces, when they are alleged to have committed acts that are incompatible with the Convention, breaches that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Krastanov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a050222/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a059 and 60, 30 September 2004, and Rashid v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a047905/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a063-65, 18 January 2007). Similarly, the Court has already stated that where the competent national authorities deploy masked police officers to maintain law and order or to make an arrest, those officers should be required to visibly display some distinctive insignia \u2013 for example a warrant number \u2013 thus, while ensuring their anonymity, enabling their identification and questioning in the event of challenges to the manner in which the operation was conducted (see Hristovi v.

Russia, no. 7178/03, \u00a7 91, ECHR 2008). In addition, it is troubling that no information on the incident which caused Tar\u0131k Ataykaya\u2019s death was mentioned in the records of the security forces (see paragraph 29 above).",

The public prosecutor admittedly attempted on a number of occasions to identify the members of the security forces who had had recourse to tear-gas grenades (paragraph 13 above). Those attempts were not, however, followed up, or they were only partly successful and after an unacceptable delay. Moreover, the public prosecutor\u2019s officer proceeded only belatedly to hear evidence from the complainant, from a few police officers whose identities had been disclosed and from eyewitnesses. For example, B.A., one of the police officers who had used tear-gas grenades, was not interviewed until 14\u00a0February 2007 \u2013 more than ten months after the incident (see paragraph 20 above). Two other police officers were not interviewed until about two years after the event (see paragraph 26 above). In this connection, the Court would reiterate its findings in Bekta\u015f and \u00d6zalp (cited above, \u00a7\u00a065 \u2013 police officers questioned seven days after the incident), and in Ramsahai and Others ([GC], no.\u00a052391/99, \u00a7 330, ECHR 2007-II \u2013 police officers questioned three days after the incident), to the effect that such delays not only create an appearance of collusion between the investigative authorities and the police, they could also lead the victim\u2019s family \u2013 and the public in general \u2013 to believe that the members of the security forces are not accountable for their acts to the judicial authorities. In the present case, although there is no evidence that they colluded with each other or with their colleagues in the Mardin police force, the mere fact that appropriate steps were not taken to reduce the risk of such collusion amounts to a significant shortcoming in the adequacy of the investigation (see Ramsahai and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0330).",

The Court has already had occasion to observe that \u201cfiring a tear-gas grenade along a direct, flat trajectory by means of a launcher cannot be regarded as an appropriate police action as it could potentially cause serious, or indeed fatal injuries, whereas a high-angle shot would generally constitute the appropriate approach, since it prevents people from being injured or killed in the event of an impact\u201d (see Abdullah Ya\u015fa and Others, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

It found that at the relevant time Turkish law contained no specific provisions regulating the use of such equipment during demonstrations or any instructions in that connection. Given that during the events in Diyarbak\u0131r between 28 and 31 March 2006 two individuals, one of whom was Tar\u0131k Ataykaya, were killed by tear-gas grenades, it may be concluded that the police officers were able to act with considerable autonomy and take ill-considered initiatives, as would probably not have been the case if they had been given appropriate training and instructions. In the Court\u2019s view, such a situation is not sufficient to provide the level of protection \u201cby law\u201d of the right to life that is required in present-day democratic societies in Europe (see, mutatis mutandis, Makaratzis, cited above, \u00a7 62, and Abdullah Ya\u015fa and Others, cited above, \u00a7 49).",

The same is true for the preparation and supervision of the operation; the Government have not adduced any evidence to suggest that the security forces deployed the requisite vigilance to ensure that any risk to life was reduced to a minimum. In addition, the Court takes the view that, as far as their positive obligation under the first sentence of Article 2 \u00a7 1 to put in place an appropriate legislative and administrative framework was concerned, the Turkish authorities had not done all that could be reasonably expected of them, first, to afford to citizens the requisite level of protection, particularly where \u2013as in the present case \u2013potentially lethal force was to be used, and, secondly, to avoid any real and immediate risk to life which might arise in the context of police operations dealing with violent demonstrations (see, mutatis mutandis, Makaratzis, cited above, \u00a7 71).",

If, on the other hand, national law does not allow \u2013 or allows only partial \u2013 reparation to be made for the consequences of the breach, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate. It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a violation of the Convention or its Protocols imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not only to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction, but also to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order (see Del Rio Prada v. Spain [GC], no.\u00a042750/09, \u00a7 137, ECHR 2013; Maestri v. Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, \u00a7\u00a047, ECHR 2004I; Assanidz\u00e9 v.

Consequently, the Court emphasises the need to strengthen those guarantees, without delay, in order to minimise the risks of death and injury related to the use of tear-gas grenades (see, to that effect, Abdullah Ya\u015fa, cited above, \u00a7 61). It would point out, in that connection, that there is a risk that the inappropriate use of such potentially lethal weapons during demonstrations, for as long as the Turkish system fails to comply with the Convention requirements, may lead to other violations of a similar nature to those observed in the present case.",
