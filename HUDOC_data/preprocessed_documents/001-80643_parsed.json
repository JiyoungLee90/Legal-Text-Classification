Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty. It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty and set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the true facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention (see Labita v.

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v.\u00a0Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005).

It must be examined with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding and re-offending or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, \u00a7 431; and Panchenko, cited above, \u00a7 106).

At no point in the proceedings in the present case did the domestic courts explain in their decisions why alternatives to the deprivation of liberty would not have ensured that the trial could follow its proper course.

They took no notice of the arguments in favour of the applicant's release pending trial, such as his family situation. It is of particular concern to the Court that the Russian authorities persistently used a stereotyped summary formula to justify extension of detention: the prosecutors reproduced the same formula in all their decisions. The Court also does not lose sight of the fact that the Moscow City Court's decisions of 12 July, 2 August and 28 November 2002 and the Supreme Court's decision of 9 October 2002 gave no grounds whatsoever for the applicant's continued detention. The courts only noted that the applicant should remain in custody. It is even more striking that by that time the applicant had already spent more than a year in custody, the investigation had been completed and the case had been referred for trial.",

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to the detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v.\u00a0France, judgment of 23\u00a0November 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273-B, \u00a7\u00a028, and Toth v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 12\u00a0December 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224, \u00a7 84). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee; while one year per instance may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 \u00a7 1 cases, Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR\u00a02003-IV). In that context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4\u00a0October 2001).",
