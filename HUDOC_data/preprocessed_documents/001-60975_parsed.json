The law does not itself provide any rights while it is not applied to a concrete person in respect of a specific property item.

The Constitutional Court held that since the 1940s many private persons had bought, in accordance with the legislation applicable at the material time, various property items which had been previously nationalised. The denial of these factual and legal aspects was impossible, and the domestic legislation on restitution of property rights duly took into account not only the interests of the former owners, but also the interests of private persons who had occupied or purchased the property under lawful contracts.

However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants - proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious - without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6. A delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances. But the delay may not be such as to impair the essence of the right protected under Article 6 \n\u00a7 1 (see Hornsby v. Greece, no. 18357/91, 19 March 1997, \u00a7 40, ECHR 1997-II; also see, as a recent authority, the Burdov v. Russia judgment, no. 59498/00, 7 May 2002, \u00a7\u00a7 34-35). ",

The Court disagrees with this view. It is clear from the judgment of 3 April 1996 that the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court did not deny the applicant the merit of her claims in regard to the plot under the domestic legislation on restitution of property rights; in the impugned judgment the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court only required the authorities to take appropriate measures to choose the form of compensation to be afforded to the applicant.
