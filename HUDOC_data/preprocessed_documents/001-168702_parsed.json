Bulgaria (dec.), no. 55861/00, 9 May 2006, with further references). As regards the remedy under Article 5 \u00a7 4, it must be made available during a person\u2019s detention with a view to that person obtaining a speedy judicial review of the lawfulness of his or her detention capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release (see Kadem v.

However, if proceedings for judicial review of the lawfulness of a person\u2019s detention take place after his or her release, taken in isolation they are usually not capable of providing sufficient redress because all they can achieve is an ex post facto judicial declaration that the detention was unlawful (see Dzhabarov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 6095/11, 74091/11 and 75583/11, \u00a7 58, 31 March 2016). Likewise, if taken in isolation, a remedy of purely compensatory nature under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a05 cannot secure the applicant\u2019s release if his or her confinement is unlawful, as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Aden Ahmed v.
