It noted at the outset that the applicant had been authorised to take part in events outside his city of residence on twelve occasions during the 2000/01 academic year, but that his request for authorisation concerning the programme of 31 March 2001 had been refused in view of the opinion of the course director, who considered that the topic of the programme was not directly linked to the applicant\u2019s specialist field. As to the applicant\u2019s participation in the broadcast of 14 April 2001, the commission noted that the dean of the faculty had authorised the applicant to attend an academic gathering to be held from 11 to 13 April 2001 in Istanbul, and that this authorisation had not covered 14 April 2001. The commission considered in that regard that not even research professors should take part in programmes of this type without supervision or authorisation, and that universities had to uphold academic ethics. It went on to find that the applicant\u2019s participation in two television programmes in Istanbul on 31 March and 14 April 2001, without authorisation from his university, amounted to leaving his city of residence without authorisation, an offence punishable under regulation 8(g) of the disciplinary regulations for managers, lecturers and officials in higher education institutions (\u201cthe disciplinary regulations\u201d). It therefore proposed, by way of a penalty, that the applicant\u2019s salary be reduced by one-eighth, under regulation 4(d) of the above-mentioned regulations.",

He also argued that regulation 8(g) of the disciplinary regulations was liable to be wrongfully applied by managers and that the perimeter of a city no longer had the same significance in view of modern means of transport and communication. Lastly, he argued that the programme of 14 April 2001 had been a follow-up to the conference of 11 to 13 April 2001, which he had been authorised to attend, and that the people invited to appear on the programme had been participants in the conference.",

He requested authorisation from his supervisors to participate in the programme of 31 March 2001, and the dean of the faculty refused his request after receiving the opinion of the director of the translation course, according to which the subject of the programme did not correspond to the applicant\u2019s specialist field (see paragraphs 8, 9 and 12 above). The Court notes that, with regard to his participation in the programme of 14 April 2001, the applicant alleged that the programme in question had been a follow-up to an academic gathering held in Istanbul from 11 to 13 April 2001, which he had attended with his supervisors\u2019 approval (see paragraph 19 above). It also notes that the report of the commission in charge of the disciplinary inquiry concerning the applicant, in addressing the issue of the refusal of the applicant\u2019s request for authorisation regarding the broadcast of 31 March 2001, referred to the opinion of the course director and also stressed the need to supervise the participation of research lecturers in programmes of that type (see paragraph 15 above).",

It is clear from the decisions of the university authorities that the sanction imposed arose essentially from the original refusal by the dean of the faculty of the applicant\u2019s request for authorisation to take part in the programme of 31 March 2001. The request which the applicant submitted to his supervisors did not concern authorisation to leave his city of residence, but rather authorisation to take part in the television programme, which was taking place in a different city. Furthermore, the authorities considered the applicant\u2019s request for authorisation from the angle of his participation in the broadcast in question rather than the angle of his leaving his city of residence. The Court notes in that connection that the applicant\u2019s request for authorisation to participate in the programme of 31 March 2001 was refused because his supervisors considered his participation to be inappropriate. It also observes that, in the context of the disciplinary inquiry against the applicant, the authorities appear to have considered whether his participation in the broadcasts of 31\u00a0March and 14 April 2001 had been appropriate.",

Furthermore, no reason was given for the decision to impose a penalty beyond a mere reference to the relevant statutory provision. The Court notes in that regard that the decision taken by the dean of the faculty on 30 March 2001 refusing the applicant permission to take part in the programme of 31 March 2001 did not give any reasons (see paragraph 9 above), and that the dean\u2019s letter to the applicant dated 9 April 2001 merely cited, as a reason for the refusal, the doubts expressed by the director of the translation course as to whether the applicant was sufficiently familiar with the subject of the programme (see paragraph 12 above). It also notes that the dean\u2019s decision of 2 July 2001 imposing a disciplinary sanction on the applicant for leaving the perimeter of his city of residence without authorisation was based solely on regulation 8(g) of the disciplinary regulations and gave no further details as to the reasons for the sanction (see paragraph 16 above). In these decisions, it was not claimed, for instance, that the applicant\u2019s unauthorised departure had disrupted the continuity of the public service in the university, or that he had neglected his duties in order to take part in the television programme in question; likewise, it was not alleged that, in taking part in the programme, he had acted or spoken in a manner detrimental to the university\u2019s reputation. The Court reiterates in that regard that the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21\u00a0February 1975, \u00a7\u00a034, Series A no. 18; Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 50, Reports 1996III; and Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR\u00a01999II). The rule of law implies,\u00a0inter alia, that there must be a measure of legal protection in domestic law against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see, among other authorities,\u00a0Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 28; Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, \u00a7 67, Series A no.\u00a082; and Kar\u00e1csony and Others v.
