The decision authorised the applicant\u2019s detention from 24 September to 24 December 2003, of which the period from 24 to 25 September 2003 was thus authorised retrospectively. The Court has already held in a number of cases that any ex post facto authorisation of detention is incompatible with the \u201cright to security of person\u201d as it is necessarily tainted with arbitrariness (see, for example, Khudoyorov v.

They paid no regard to the arguments in favour of the applicant\u2019s release pending trial. It is also of particular concern to the Court that the Russian authorities persistently used a stereotyped summary formula to justify extending his detention. The Court also notes that the domestic authorities, using the same formula, simultaneously extended the detention of the applicant and his co-defendants. In the Court\u2019s view, this approach is incompatible, in itself, with the guarantees enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in so far as it permits the continued detention of a group of persons without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention or of compliance with the \u201creasonable-time\u201d requirement in respect of each individual member of the group (see Dolgova v. Russia, no. 11886/05, \u00a7 49, 2 March 2006). The Court also finds it striking that during certain periods the applicant was detained without any formal decision authorising his detention (see, for example, paragraphs 13, 21 and 71 above).",

They thus failed to justify the applicant\u2019s continued detention for almost three years and ten months and by 24 December 2003 the length of his detention had already ceased to be reasonable (see Rokhlina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069).",

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v.\u00a0France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7\u00a028, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273-B, , and Toth v.\u00a0Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee and Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR\u00a02003-IV). In that context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4\u00a0October 2001).",

Russia, no.\u00a045100/98, \u00a7\u00a0133, 8 February 2005, and Kalashnikov\u00a0v. Russia, no.\u00a047095/99, \u00a7\u00a0132, ECHR 2002VI).",

In this connection, the Court notes that according to a summary table of court hearings presented by the Government, the applicant\u2019s lawyer successfully asked for an adjournment of one hearing in 2003 and failed to attend two hearings in 2004, thus causing an aggregated delay of two months (see paragraphs 33 and 35 above). The Government did not indicate any other period when the proceedings were stayed or any other hearing which was adjourned due to the applicant\u2019s or his representative\u2019s conduct. Having regard to the overall length of the proceedings, the Court therefore considers the delay caused by the applicant to be negligible.",

The Court observes that an aggregated delay of approximately sixteen months was caused by the referral of the case for additional investigation on four occasions, and by the prosecution authorities\u2019 repeated failure to comply with the trial court\u2019s orders and to correct procedural defects and a change in the composition of the bench (see paragraphs 14-15, 16-21, 22, 23-25 above). In this respect, the Court reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v.  (No. 2), no. 72159/01, \u00a7 57, 4 March 2004). Another delay of over three months was caused by the judge\u2019s illness and his involvement in other unrelated proceedings.",

The Court reiterates that the delay occasioned by their failure to attend at least thirty hearings and the Supreme Court\u2019s failure to discipline them is attributable to the State (see Ku\u015bmierek v. , no. 10675/02, \u00a7 65, 21\u00a0September 2004, and Sidorenko v. Russia, no. 4459/03, \u00a7 34, 8 March 2007). The Court is mindful of the Government\u2019s argument that the domestic authorities undertook \u201ccertain steps\u201d to expedite the proceedings. However, the Government did not explain what steps had been taken. Furthermore, without accepting the veracity of the Government\u2019s argument, the Court observes that even if such measures had, in fact, been applied, their effectiveness would appear to be open to doubt as counsel, witnesses and victims failed to attend hearings throughout the entire period the trial proceedings were pending.",
