This will act as a very strong disincentive for those who might otherwise be minded to engage in ill-treatment. In this context, the CPT has to stress that its delegation still received allegations from detained persons that complaints to the relevant prosecutor or judge occasioned hardly any reaction, or even a negative one. It was clear from certain meetings with the competent bodies that, in many cases, the attitude and professional conscience of such instances often left something to be desired. The CPT recommends that judges and prosecutors be made aware of the importance of actively pursuing their key role in preventing ill-treatment.",

All the conceptual and organisational shortcomings highlighted by the CPT at the time had been faithfully reproduced: cells without access to natural light, artificial lighting of low intensity and permanently switched on, inadequate ventilation and furnishings consisting exclusively of platforms without mattresses (although certain prisoners did have their own blankets).

The Government did not deny that humidity in the cells could contribute to deterioration in the applicant's bronchitis. Moreover, the applicant was not given daily medical care since, as appears also from the Government's observations, there were no medical personnel at the GDFOC detention centre and an ambulance was called in more serious cases. In this respect, the Court notes the answer given to the applicant in response to his request for a transfer to a centre staffed with medical personnel (see paragraph 30 above). He was promised medical assistance whenever he needed it, despite his express claim that he already needed such assistance. As a result, the applicant was in a vicious circle where he could not get assistance until he \u201creally needed\u201d it, while at the same time he could not prove such a medical need in the absence of qualified medical opinion to confirm his fears.

The conflict he had with the company's administration (see paragraph 7 above) gives further reasons to doubt his motives. However, rather than verifying this information, which was easily obtainable from the law enforcement authorities, particularly given the large number of prosecutors assigned to the case, the prosecutor arrested the applicant partly on the basis of his alleged kidnapping of G.N. This lends support to the applicant's claim that the investigating authorities did not genuinely verify the facts in order to determine the existence of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed a crime, but rather pursued his arrest, allegedly for private interests. In this regard, the Court can but note that a subdivision of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which was the authority which had initiated the investigation into the applicant's case, asked for and obtained the withdrawal of the applicant's company's licence on the ground of his participation in illegal activities before any court had established his guilt (see paragraph 13 above) and just after the Buiucani District Court had found the grounds advanced for his detention in a detention centre unconvincing (see paragraph 11 above).",

The Court did not have submitted to it any other evidence supporting a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed a crime. On the contrary, the second arrest was based on an alleged crime which had been committed during a period ending in September 2005 (see paragraph 15 above). Had the applicant indeed committed the crime and had he wanted to pressure the victim or witnesses or destroy evidence, he would have had plenty of time to do so before December 2005, and no evidence was submitted to the Court of any such actions on the part of the applicant. There was, therefore, no urgency for an arrest in order to stop an ongoing criminal activity and the 24 investigators assigned to the case could have used any extra time to verify whether the complaints were prima facie well-founded. Instead of such verification, the applicant was arrested on the day when the investigation was initiated (see paragraph 15 above).",
