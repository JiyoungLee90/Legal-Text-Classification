More than six dozen companies had been involved in the scheme under investigation, which had been set up for the purposes of tax evasion and money laundering on a large scale. Individuals involved in that scheme had been drawing up taxable business documents for transactions that had not actually taken place, without paying taxes, and had been receiving payments in respect of such transactions. In order to change ownership of those funds and to receive them, fictitious agreements, including loans, had been concluded. The scheme had been operated by three inter-related criminal groups comprising twenty-five individuals. On the basis of judicial warrants, nineteen searches had been carried out (two with the assistance of a special police anti-terrorism unit called Omega, owing to the potential dangerousness of those criminal groups) and, as a result, accounting documents, digital passwords and the stamps of more than two hundred fictitious companies had been seized.

As indicated previously, those officers were colleagues of the officers under investigation for corruption-related offences against whom the first applicant had testified (see paragraph 107 above). In the Court\u2019s view, there must be safeguards in place in order to avoid any possible abuse in such circumstances and to ensure the effective protection of persons\u2019 rights under Article 8 of the Convention. Such safeguards might include the adoption of regulatory measures which both confine the use of special forces to situations where ordinary police intervention cannot be regarded as safe and sufficient and prescribe additional guarantees (see and compare Ku\u010dera v.\u00a0Slovakia, no.\u00a048666/99, \u00a7 122, 17 July 2007).",

The President of the relevant court did not address the first applicant\u2019s concerns in that regard although he specifically raised them (see paragraphs\u00a037-38 above).

Although they did require further information from those authorities, there is little information available about any assessment carried out upon receipt of that information by the prosecutors themselves. In their replies to the applicants, the prosecutors largely relied on the conclusions provided by those very authorities, whose actions they were supposed to review, and found that the assistance of the special police unit had been justified (see paragraphs 43 and 48 above) and that the Omega officers had acted in accordance with internal regulations and \u201ctaking into account the circumstances\u201d (see paragraph 49 above). No further reasons, such as those indicated by the Government before the Court, were disclosed to the applicants. In the absence of reasons answering specific allegations made by the applicants and any further information, the Court can only conclude that the prosecutorial review of the special police unit\u2019s assistance did not ensure effective protection in the present case.",

The parties offered no comment as regards legal grounds for such a decision to be made. The Court considers that a mere reference to general provisions regulating coordination between various State authorities (see paragraphs 46 and 66 above) or to the internal regulations of the Omega anti-terrorism unit to the extent that it provides assistance to law-enforcement authorities in difficulties (see paragraph 49 above) does not suffice to establish a legal framework capable of offering adequate and effective safeguards against abuse and arbitrariness.",

In addition, the involvement of special police units may be considered necessary in certain circumstances. However, having regard to the severity of the interference with the right to respect for private life of persons affected by such measures, adequate and effective safeguards against abuse must be put in place. Given the particular circumstances of this case\u00a0(see paragraphs 114-17 above), the Court finds that the available safeguards, as applied in the present case, failed to ensure effective protection of the applicants\u2019 right to have respect for their private life. Therefore, the interference with the applicants\u2019 right to have respect for their private life cannot be regarded as proportionate to the aim pursued.",
