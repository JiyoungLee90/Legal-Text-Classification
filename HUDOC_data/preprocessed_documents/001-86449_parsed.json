Elements taken into consideration in this regard are the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure have been effected, whether they have been carried out pursuant to a warrant issued by a judge or a judicial officer \u2013 or subjected to afterthefact judicial scrutiny \u2013, whether the warrant was based on reasonable suspicion and whether its scope was reasonably limited. The Court must also review the manner in which the search has been executed, and \u2013 where a lawyer\u2019s office is concerned \u2013 whether it has been carried out in the presence of an independent observer to ensure that material subject to legal professional privilege is not removed. The Court must finally take into account the extent of the possible repercussions on the work and the reputation of the persons affected by the search (see Camenzind v. Switzerland, judgment of 16 December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII, pp. 289394, \u00a7 45; Buck v.\u00a0, no. 41604/98, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2005IV; Smirnov v. , no.\u00a071362/01, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2007...; and Wieser and Bicos Beteiligungen GmbH, cited above, \u00a7 57).",

Indeed, in the instant case the search was effected under a warrant issued by the Sofia District Court (see paragraph 15 above). The Court does not consider that the fact that the warrant was obtained in an ex parte procedure was problematic in itself (see Tamosius, cited above). However, the mere fact that an application for a warrant has been subject to judicial scrutiny will not in itself necessarily amount to a sufficient safeguard against abuse. The Court must rather examine the particular circumstances and evaluate whether the legal framework and the limits on the powers exercised were an adequate protection against arbitrary interference by the authorities (see Cronin v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 15848/03, 6 January 2004).",

It is true that the application for a warrant made no mention of any specific facts. However, the judge to whom the application was made was able review the evidence gathered up to that point, and in her decision made an express reference to Mr R.S.\u2019s statement (see paragraph 15 above).

Moreover, in issuing the warrant the judge did not touch at all upon the issue of whether privileged material was to be removed. According to the Court\u2019s caselaw, search warrants have to be drafted, as far as practicable, in a manner calculated to keep their impact within reasonable bounds (see Van Rossem v. , no. 41872/98, \u00a7 45, 9 December 2004). This is all the more important in cases where the premises searched are the office of a lawyer, which as a rule contains material which is subject to legal professional privilege (see Niemietz, cited above, p. 3536, \u00a7 37). The Court therefore finds that, in the circumstances, the warrant was drawn in overly broad terms and was thus not capable of minimising the interference with the applicant\u2019s Article 8 rights and his professional secrecy. The Court is well aware that elaborate reasoning may prove hard to achieve in urgent situations. However, by the time the police applied for a search warrant they had already sealed the applicant\u2019s office (see paragraph 11 above), thus obviating the risk of spoliation of evidence. The Court does not therefore consider that in the instant case a more thorough discussion of these matters would have been too onerous, especially considering that section 18(1) of the 1991 Bar Act was intended to provide a safeguard in this regard (see paragraph 25 above).",

While there is nothing in the facts to suggest that papers covered by legal professional privilege were touched upon during the search, it should be noted that the police removed the applicant\u2019s entire computer, including its peripherals, as well as all floppy disks which they found in his office (see paragraph 16 above). Seeing that the computer was evidently being used by the applicant for his work, it is natural to suppose that its hard drive, as well as the floppy disks, contained material which was covered by legal professional privilege. It is true that later the expert used keywords to sift through the data they contained, which somewhat limited the intrusion. However, this happened several days after the search, after the computer and the floppy disks had been indiscriminately removed from the applicant\u2019s office (see paragraph 17 above), whereas no safeguards existed to ensure that during the intervening period the entire contents of the hard drive and the floppy disks were not inspected or copied. This leads the Court to conclude that the search impinged on the applicant\u2019s professional secrecy to an extent that was disproportionate in the circumstances (see Niemietz, pp. 3536, \u00a7 37; Smirnov, \u00a7 48; and Wieser and Bicos Beteiligungen GmbH, \u00a7\u00a7 63 and 65 in limine, all cited above). It should also be noted that the computer, including all its peripheral devices, was kept by the authorities for more than two months: it was seized on 30 November 2000, checked by an expert before 15 December 2000, and then kept until the proceedings were stayed on 5\u00a0February 2001 (see paragraphs 16, 17 and 19 above). In the Court\u2019s view, this must have had a negative impact on the applicant\u2019s work, whereas it is hard to conceive how keeping the computer after 15 December 2000 was conducive to the investigation\u2019s goals.",

This may be considered problematic, as this lack of legal qualification made it highly unlikely that these observers were truly capable of identifying, independently of the investigation team, which materials were covered by legal professional privilege, with the result that they did not provide an effective safeguard against excessive intrusion by the police into the applicant\u2019s professional secrecy (see, as examples to the contrary, Tamosius; and Wieser and Bicos Beteiligungen GmbH, \u00a7\u00a7 60 (d) and 62, both cited above).

However, such disturbances are not necessarily indicative of tapping and cannot of themselves warrant a conclusion that covert monitoring has taken place. It is true that when the applicant later enquired of the chairman of the Sofia City Court whether tapping warrants had been issued against him, the latter refused to give him that information (see paragraph 20 above). It is also true that Bulgarian law, as construed by the Supreme Administrative Court, expressly prohibits the disclosure of information as to whether a person has been subjected to secret surveillance or whether warrants have been issued for this purpose, with the result that unless they are subsequently prosecuted on the basis of the material gathered through covert surveillance, or unless there has been a leak of information, the persons concerned cannot find out whether they have ever been monitored (see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, \u00a7 91). However, in view of the overall situation obtaining in the present case, the categorical denial by the Government that covert surveillance has taken place, and the lack of any documents relating to surveillance measures in the investigation case file (see paragraphs 12 and 46 above), the Court does not find it established that there has been an interference with the applicant\u2019s rights to respect for his private life and correspondence in relation to his mobile telephone.",

The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must go beyond the inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment (see Kud\u0142a v.  [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7 92, ECHR 2000XI; and Jalloh v.  [GC], no.\u00a054810/00, \u00a7 68 in fine, ECHR 2006IX).

On this point, the Court notes that the applicant arrived at the police station at about 2 p.m. on 29\u00a0November 2000. Shortly after that he was taken to a room where several other persons were awaiting questioning, and was made aware that he was not free to leave the premises. He was interviewed as a witness between 6.30\u00a0p.m. and 7 p.m. and then allowed to leave (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). Under the Convention organs\u2019 caselaw, the determination whether there has been a deprivation of liberty starts with the specific situation of the individual concerned. Account must be taken of a whole range of factors arising in a particular case such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see, among many other authorities, Guenat v. Switzerland, no. 24722/94, Commission decision of 10 April 1995, Decisions and Reports (DR) 81A, p. 130, at p. 134; and, more recently, I.I. v. Bulgaria, no. 44082/98, \u00a7 86, 9 June 2005). Furthermore, Article 5 \u00a7 1 applies to deprivations of liberty of even a very short duration (see X v. Austria, no. 8278/78, Commission decision of 13\u00a0December 1979, DR 18, p. 154, at p. 156; and Guenat, cited above). However, the Court does not need to resolve this issue in the present case, as even assuming that the applicant was deprived of his liberty, and that Article 5 was thus applicable, it is satisfied that this deprivation of liberty was justified under paragraph 1 (b) of this provision.",

The Convention organs have held that this obligation, while not necessarily antecedent in all cases, should not be given a wide interpretation. It has to be specific and concrete, and the arrest and detention must be truly necessary for the purpose of ensuring its fulfilment. Moreover, in assessing whether the deprivation of liberty is justified, a fair balance has to be drawn between the significance in a democratic society of securing the fulfilment of the obligation in issue and the importance of the right to liberty. The relevant factors in drawing this balance are the nature and the purpose of the obligation, the detained person, the specific circumstances which led to his or her detention, and the length of the detention (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 28, \u00a7 69 in limine; McVeigh and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 8022/77, 8025/77 and 8027/77, Commission\u2019s report of 18 March 1981, DR 25, pp. 3743, \u00a7\u00a7 16896; Vasileva v. , no.\u00a052792/99, \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 37, 25 September 2003; and Epple v. , no.\u00a077909/01, \u00a7 37, 24 March 2005).",

It is a normal feature of law enforcement for the authorities to be able to ensure the attendance of witnesses in criminal investigations. It is true that the applicant came to the police station voluntarily.
