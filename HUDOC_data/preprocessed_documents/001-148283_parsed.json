In particular, in cell no. 5/I, the applicant had had 3.63\u00a0square metres of personal space for only three days (from 5 to 7\u00a0August 2010) and thereafter, until 2 September 2010, he had had 4.35, 4.47 and 4.86 square metres of personal space.

However, in the Government\u2019s view, any lack of personal space had been compensated for by other facilities in Bjelovar Prison. Thus, all of the cells in which the applicant had been held had had access to daylight and fresh air, as well as heating and ventilation. The cells had been regularly maintained and renovated, and the applicant had been given sufficient freedom of movement and the opportunity to take part in various sport and recreational activities. As regards his complaints about the medical care, the Government pointed out that the applicant had failed to substantiate his allegations in any respect. They also stressed that he had been examined eight times by a dentist and six times by a prison doctor and that he had never complained about any health issues.
