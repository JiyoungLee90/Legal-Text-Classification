The case originated in an application (no. 77512/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Feliks Vidovič (“the applicant”), on 2 November 2000.
The applicant was represented by the Verstovšek lawyers. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, State Attorney-General.
The applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts to which he was a party was excessive. In substance, he also complained about the lack of an effective domestic remedy in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings (Article 13 of the Convention).
On 28 July 2003 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Polzela.
On 16 March 1995 the applicant was injured in an accident at work. The applicant’s employer had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZT.
On 22 December 1995 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZT in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 3,120,147 tolars (approximately 13,000 euros) for the injuries sustained.
At an undetermined time in 1997, the case was transferred to a new judge because the judge, presiding the case, was appointed to a higher court. The new judge was also appointed to a higher court and the case was again transferred to a new judge.
Between 7 May 1996 and 20 January 1999 he made six requests that a date be set for a hearing.
Between 5 February 1997 and 10 February 1999 the applicant lodged seven preliminary written submissions and/or adduced evidence.
Of the three hearings held between 17 September 1997 and 22 March 1999 none was adjourned at the request of the applicant.
During the proceedings the court appointed a safety-at-work expert.
The judgment, upholding the applicant’s claim in part, was served on the applicant on 24 May 1999.
On 4 June 1999 the applicant appealed to the  (Višje sodišče v Celju) and requested that the first-instance court corrected the judgment. ZT cross-appealed.
On 28 September 1999 the first-instance court corrected the judgment.
On 13 April 2000 the second-instance court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and allowed the ZT’s appeal in part.
The judgment was served on the applicant on 10 July 2000.
