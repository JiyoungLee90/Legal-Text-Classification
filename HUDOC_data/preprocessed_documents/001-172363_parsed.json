Greece, no.\u00a030303/07, 4 June 2009; Vafiadis, cited above; Shuvaev, cited above; Tabesh v. Greece, no. 8256/07, 26 November 2009; Efremidi v. Greece, no.\u00a033225/08, 21 June 2011; Aslanis, cited above; Adamantidis, cited above; and Kavouris and Others, cited above). Apart from the specific deficiencies concerning the applicants\u2019\u00a0detention in each of the above cases, particularly overcrowding, lack of outdoor space for walking, poor sanitary conditions and the poor quality of the food, the Court based its finding of a violation of Article 3 on the nature of the police stations per se, which are places designed to accommodate people for a short time. Imprisonment for between one and three months was thus considered contrary to Article 3 (Siasios and Others, \u00a7 32; Vafiadis, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36; Shuvaev, \u00a7 39; Tabesh, \u00a7 43; Efremidi, \u00a7 41; Aslanis \u00a7\u00a039; Adamantidis \u00a7 33; and Kavouris and Others, \u00a7\u00a038, all cited above). The Court also notes that three of those cases referred to the conditions of detention at Thessaloniki General Police Headquarters, the police station in which the applicants in the present case were detained (see Vafiadis, \u00a7\u00a7 32-39; Shuvaev, \u00a7\u00a7 30-41; and Ibram\u00a7\u00a7 27-36, all cited above). Additionally, the Court has found many violations of Article 3 on account of the conditions of detention at the Thessaloniki Aliens Division (see, among others, Tabesh v. Greece, no. 8256/07, \u00a7\u00a7 34-44, 26 November 2009).",
