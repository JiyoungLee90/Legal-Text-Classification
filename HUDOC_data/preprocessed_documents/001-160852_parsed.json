It further considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. In the court\u2019s view the risk that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings resulted from the fact that he had been charged with membership in an organised criminal group.

In this respect, the Court reiterates that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending (see G\u00f3rski v. Poland, no. 28904/02, \u00a7\u00a057, 4\u00a0October 2005). The Court also acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider that such an initial risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26 July 2001).",

In the Court\u2019s view, the fact that the case concerned a\u00a0member of such a criminal group should be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 (see B\u0105k v. Poland, no.\u00a07870/04, \u00a7\u00a057, 16 January 2007). In this regard, the Court considers that the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the alleged criminal activities of the applicant may be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention (see Drabek v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a05270/04, \u00a7\u00a049, 20\u00a0June 2006). The Court reiterates its caselaw according to which in cases concerning organised crime a relatively longer period of detention on remand could be justified given the particular difficulties in dealing with those cases by the trial courts (see Celejewski v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, \u00a7 36). However, it does not give the authorities unlimited power to prolong this preventive measure (see Pasi\u0144ski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a06356/04, \u00a7 44, 20 June 2006). Firstly, with the passage of time, the initial grounds for pre-trial detention become less and less relevant and the domestic courts should rely on other \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d grounds to justify the deprivation of liberty (see, among many other authorities, I.A.\u00a0v.\u00a0France, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, p. 2979, \u00a7 102; Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a0153, ECHR 2000IV). Secondly, even if due to the particular circumstances of the case, detention on remand is extended beyond the period generally accepted under the Court\u2019s case-law, particularly strong reasons would be required to justify this. The Court notes in this respect that in the first set of proceedings the domestic courts on two occasions relied on the fact that the applicant had been charged among other things with witness tampering by means of violence (see paragraphs 8 and 25 above); it considers however that this ground should have been carefully reassessed in the circumstances of the case at later stages of the proceedings.",

The Court takes into account the particular difficulty in dealing with cases concerning organised criminal groups and the fact that in the second set of proceedings the authorities decided to alter the preventive measure and release the applicant on bail after two years of detention. However, the applicant\u2019s detention on remand in connection with the first set of proceedings reached three years and almost six months. Thus, with the passage of time the grounds relied on by the authorities cannot be considered as \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d justification for holding the applicant in detention for such a long period. In these circumstances it is not necessary to examine whether the proceedings were conducted with special diligence.",
