In order to correct the decision of 7 October 1982, the courts re-examined the contents of the casefile concerning that decision (see paragraphs 10 and 15 above), obtained and considered new evidence (see paragraph 12 above) and determined which portions of the property belonged to the estate (see paragraph 17 above). The determination of the applicant\u2019s motion of 22\u00a0March 1993 had direct consequences for the applicant in that her legal standing as regards the property was clarified and her title to the correct share in the property was confirmed.",

The applicant\u2019s objections to the duty to substantiate her case, the lack of an adequate possibility to present the case and the lack of a public hearing appear to fall within the ambit of this provision.
