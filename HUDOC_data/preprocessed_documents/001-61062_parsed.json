As is noted above (see paragraphs 91-93 above), the use of capital punishment in Ukraine was the subject of strong and repeated criticism in Resolutions of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, in which it was recorded that between 9 November 1995 and 11\u00a0March 1997 a total of 212 executions had been carried out in the State. However, on the latter date a de facto moratorium on executions was declared by the President of Ukraine; on 29 December 1999 the Constitutional Court held the provisions of the Criminal Code governing the use of the death penalty to be unconstitutional; and on 22 February 2000 the death penalty was abolished by law and replaced by a sentence of life imprisonment (see paragraph 16 above). The applicant was sentenced to death in April 1997, after the moratorium had come into effect. The Court accepts that, until the formal abolition of the death penalty and the commutation of his sentence, the applicant must have been in a state of some uncertainty, fear and anxiety as to his future. However, it considers that the risk that the sentence would be carried out, and the accompanying feelings of fear and anxiety on the part of those sentenced to death, must have diminished as time went on and as the de facto moratorium continued in force.",

The window in the cells which he had successively occupied had been covered, the strong electric lamp being switched on all the time (see paragraph 28 above). The cell had had no water tap. The area of the cell in which he had been detained alone in Zaporozhie Prison no. 2 had been, according to the applicant, at least half of the size of the cell in Zaporozhie Prison no. 1 in which he was detained on the day of the Court Delegates' visit (see paragraph 20 above). In his written observations, he said that his cell had been 3 square metres (see paragraph 114 above). The Court notes that the applicant's testimony was in contradiction with the Government who said in their written observations that the size of the cell was 7.1 square metres (see paragraph 114 above), but also with the governor of Zaporozhie Prison no. 2 who said that the prison had four death row double cells which were the same size (see paragraph 47 above). Taking into account that the Delegates were allowed to visit only two empty cells in this prison which were allegedly intended for death row inmates (see paragraphs 47, 54 and 56 above), the Court considers the applicant's evidence reliable and finds that the single cells in which he was held in Zaporozhie Prison no.\u00a02 were much smaller than the cell he occupied in Zaporozhie Prison no. 1.",

That statement was confirmed by the prison governor who confirmed that in July 1999 the applicant criticised the length of the visits by his relatives, alleging that they should have lasted between one and two hours, but that the prison administration had been unable to grant him longer meetings, having regard to the large number of prisoners held in the prison (see paragraph 45 above).

While it cannot establish with complete clarity the conditions of detention to which the applicant was subjected prior to the Court Delegates' visit, certain facts are beyond dispute and clearly established. The Court views with particular concern that, until at earliest May 1998, the applicant, in common with other prisoners detained in the prison under a death sentence, was locked up for 24 hours a day in cells which offered only a very restricted living space, that the windows of the cells were covered with the consequence that there was no access to natural light, that there was no provision for any outdoor exercise and that there was little or no opportunity for activities to occupy himself or for human contact. In common with the observations of the CPT concerning the subjection of death row prisoners in Ukraine to similar conditions, the Court considers that the detention of the applicant in deleterious conditions of this kind amounted to degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The Court further finds that the applicant's situation was aggravated by the fact that he was throughout this period subject to a death sentence, although, as noted in paragraphs 16 and 126 above, a moratorium was already in effect at the time of the applicant's conviction and sentence.",

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law. In particular, its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Ilhan v.
