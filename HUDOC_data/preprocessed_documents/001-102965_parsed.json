However, choices to publish private material raised issues that were not simply about presentation and editing. Accordingly, the public interest in disclosure had to be balanced against the right of the individual to respect for their private life: those decisions were open to review by the court. The tests to be applied were familiar and were set down in Convention jurisprudence. The rights guaranteed by Articles 8 and 10 had to be balanced against each other, any restriction of those rights had to be subjected to very close scrutiny and neither Article 8 nor Article 10 had any pre-eminence over each other (as confirmed by Resolution 1165 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (\u201cPACE\u201d), 1998).",

In this respect, the relevant factors were, on the one hand, the duty on the press to impart information and ideas of public interest which the public has a right to receive (Jersild v. Denmark, cited above) and the need to leave it to journalists to decide what material had to be reproduced to ensure credibility (Fressoz and Roire v. France cited above) and, on the other hand, the degree of privacy to which Ms Campbell was entitled as regards the details of her therapy under the law of confidence. However, the right of the public to receive information about the details of her treatment was of a much lower order than its undoubted right to know that she was misleading the public when she said that she did not take drugs since the former concerned an intimate aspect of her private life (Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1981, \u00a7 52, Series A no. 45).

The fact that she was a \u201ccelebrity\u201d was not enough to deprive her of her right to privacy. A margin of appreciation had be accorded to a journalist but viewing details of treatment for drug addiction merely \u201cas background was to undervalue the importance that was to be attached to the need, if Ms Campbell was to be protected, to keep these details private\u201d. It was hard to see any compelling need for the public to know the name of the organisation that she was attending for therapy or the details of that therapy.

Ms Campbell could not have complained if the photographs had been taken to show a scene in a street by a passer-by and later published simply as street scenes. However, the photographs invaded Ms Campbell's privacy because they were taken deliberately, in secret, with a view to their publication in conjunction with the article and they focussed on the doorway of the building of her NA meeting and they revealed clearly her face. The argument that the publication of the photograph added credibility to the story had little weight, since the reader only had the editor's word as to the truth of Ms Campbell's attendance at a NA meeting.

This sort of story, especially if it has photographs attached, is just the sort of thing that fills, sells and enhances the reputation of the newspaper which gets it first. One reason why press freedom is so important is that we need newspapers to sell in order to ensure that we still have newspapers at all. It may be said that newspapers should be allowed considerable latitude in their intrusions into private grief so that they can maintain circulation and the rest of us can then continue to enjoy the variety of newspapers and other mass media which are available in this country.

She underlined the importance of, as well as the sensitivities and difficulties surrounding, treatment for addiction and, notably, of the vital therapy to address an underlying dependence on drugs. Moreover, the Court's jurisprudence had always accepted that information about a person's health and treatment for ill-health was both private and confidential (Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, \u00a7 95, Reports 1997I). While the disclosed information may not have been in the same category as clinical medical records, it amounted to the same information which would be recorded by a doctor in such records namely, the presenting problem of addiction to illegal drugs, the diagnosis and the prescription of therapy. Baroness Hale therefore began her analysis from the fact - which was common ground - that all information about Ms Campbell's addiction and attendance at NA disclosed in the article was both private and confidential because it related to an important aspect of her physical and mental health and the treatment she was receiving for it.

However, Baroness Hale found it difficult to see the contribution made by \u201cpouring over the intimate details of a fashion model's private life\u201d. It was true that the editor had chosen to run a sympathetic piece, listing Ms Campbell's faults and follies and setting them in the context of her addiction and her even more important efforts to overcome addiction and such publications might well have a beneficial educational effect. However, such pieces were normally run with the co-operation of those involved and Ms Campbell had refused to be involved with the story.

The first was that the success fee was necessarily disproportionate as it was more than (and up to twice as much as) the amount which, under the ordinary assessment rules, would be considered reasonable and proportionate. This was a flawed point as it confused two different concepts of proportionality. The CPR on costs were concerned with whether expenditure on litigation was proportionate to the amount at stake, the interests of the parties, complexity of the issues and so forth. However, Article 10 was concerned with whether a rule, which required unsuccessful defendants, not only to pay the reasonable and proportionate costs of their adversary in the litigation, but also to contribute to the funding of other litigation through the payment of success fees, was a proportionate measure, having regard to the effect on Article 10 rights. The applicant did not \u201creally deny that in principle it is open to the legislature to choose to fund access to justice in this way.\u201d",

However, it was desirable to have a general rule to enable the scheme to work in a practical and effective way and that concentration on the individual case and the particularities of Ms Campbell's circumstances would undermine that scheme. It was for this reason that the Court in James and Others v the United Kingdom (21\u00a0February 1986, Series A no. 98) considered that Parliament was entitled to pursue a social policy of allowing long leaseholders of low-rated houses to acquire their freeholds at concessionary rates, notwithstanding that the scheme also applied to some rich tenants who needed no such assistance. The success fee should not be disallowed simply on the ground that the applicant's liability would be inconsistent with its rights under Article 10. Thus, notwithstanding the need to examine the balance on the facts of the individual case, Lord Hoffman considered that the impracticality of requiring a means test and the small number of individuals who could be said to have sufficient resources to provide them with access to legal services entitled Parliament to lay down a general rule that CFAs were open to everyone. Success fees, as such, could not be disallowed simply on the ground that the present applicant's liability would be inconsistent with its rights under Article 10: the scheme was a choice open to the legislature and there was no need for any exclusion of cases such as the present one from the scope of CFAs or to disallow success fees because the existing scheme was compatible.",

On the other hand, in defamation cases the reasons for seeking a compromise were much weaker: there was a small number of claims and payment of relatively large sums of costs; some publishers might be strong enough to absorb or insure against this but it had a serious effect upon their financial position; and publishers did not have the same negotiating strength as the liability insurers because there were few assessments to be contested and disputing them involved considerable additional costs.",

The effect of this was, of course, that the applicant faced a greatly increased bill of costs: however, the applicant lost this issue in the second appeal to the House of Lords.

A public figure is entitled to a private life. The individual, however, should recognise that because of his public position he must expect and accept that his or her actions will be more closely scrutinised by the media. Even trivial facts relating to a public figure can be of great interest to readers and other observers of the media. Conduct which in the case of a private individual would not be the appropriate subject of comment can be the proper subject of comment in the case of a public figure. The public figure may hold a position where higher standards of conduct can be rightly expected by the public. The public figure may be a role model whose conduct could well be emulated by others. He may set the fashion. The higher the profile of the individual concerned the more likely that this will be the position. Whether you have courted publicity or not you may be a legitimate subject of public attention. If you have courted public attention then you have less ground to object to the intrusion which follows. In many of these situations it would be overstating the position to say that there is a public interest in the information being published. It would be more accurate to say that the public have an understandable and so a legitimate interest in being told the information. If this is the situation then it can be appropriately taken into account by a court when deciding on which side of the line a case falls. The courts must not ignore the fact that if newspapers do not publish information which the public are interested in, there will be fewer newspapers published, which will not be in the public interest. The same is true in relation to other parts of the media. On the difficult issue of finding the right balance, useful guidance of a general nature is provided by the Council of Europe Resolution 1165 of 1998.",

It is rare these days for such a litigant to be able to secure the services of leading counsel unless the size of the likely award of compensation justifies such an outlay, and defamation litigation does not open the door to awards on that scale today. Similarly, if the introduction of this novel cost-capping regime means that a claimant's lawyers may be reluctant to accept instructions on a CFA basis unless they assess the chances of success as significantly greater than evens (so that the size of the success fee will be to that extent reduced), this in my judgment will be a small price to pay in contrast to the price that is potentially to be paid if the present state of affairs is allowed to continue.\u201d",

Media organisations claimed that CFAs inhibited the right to freedom of expression and encouraged unmeritorious claims.

This resulted in the \u201cransom\u201d or \u201cchilling effect\u201d that forced the media to settle claims they might otherwise fight due to excessive costs. The media also expressed concerns there was no true ATE insurance market (because the very small number of cases did not ensure a competitive market), and about the failure of the costs judges to effectively control CFA costs in defamation proceedings. While the focus of the Consultation Paper had been defamation proceedings, the same problems applied in other publication cases.",

As to the first argument, the recoverability provisions are of universal application. They are just as likely to be used by a large company against an SME as vice versa. As to the second argument ... some business disputes are evenly balanced. It is perfectly reasonable for the companies on both sides to decide to fight. It is quite wrong for one or other party to be pressurised into settling by a gross imbalance in the costs liabilities of the parties. If party A has a CFA... and party B does not, party A may be litigating at virtually no costs risk, whereas party B may face liability for quadruple costs if it loses.",

In other words they generally conduct winning cases on CFAs, they reject or drop at an early stage less promising cases and thus generate extremely healthy profits. Obviously the financial records of individual solicitors firms and barristers are confidential. Moreover, even if one such set of accounts were made public, that would tell us nothing about all the others. Nevertheless, the one point that can be made about the CFA regime is that it presents the opportunity to cherry pick. If lawyers succumb to that temptation, they will greatly increase their own earnings and they will do so in a manner which is entirely lawful.",

The narrow point at issue between them and, consequently, in the present case was the application of those principles to the facts of the case. The majority considered, for relevant and sufficient reasons given, that details of Ms Campbell's treatment went beyond justified publication. The Government underlined that there was a clear qualitative distinction to be made between the facts that Ms Campbell was a drug addict and in treatment and the publication of details of the treatment she was receiving. The non-medical therapy clearly constituted treatment close to the core of Article 8 of the Convention: the treatment was continuing, publication of those details risked affecting her willingness or ability to continue and the publication of these additional details had no public interest. Moreover, the same reasoning applied as regards the decision by the majority of the House of Lords as regards the photographs: the decision on photographs flowed from their decision that information about the treatment details of Ms Campbell was private and that there was no public interest in its publication.",

Whilst it is true that the methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably and that it is therefore not for this Court, nor for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted (Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 298), editorial discretion is not unbounded. The press must not overstep the bounds set for, among other things, \u201cthe protection of the reputation of ... others\u201d, including the requirements of acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and of providing \u201creliable and precise\u201d information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2004XI with further references contained therein). Nevertheless it is incumbent on it to impart information and ideas on matters of public interest (De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24 February 1997, \u00a7 37, Reports 1997I).

In such conditions freedom of expression calls for a narrower interpretation (see, mutatis mutandis, Campmany y Diez de Revenga and Lopez Galiacho Perona v.

In particular, they underlined in some detail the particular role of the press in a democratic society and, more especially, the importance of publishing matters of public interest. In addition, and contrary to the applicant's submission, each member of the majority specifically underlined the protection to be accorded to journalists as regards the techniques of reporting they adopt and as regards decisions taken about the content of published material to ensure credibility, as well as journalists' duties and responsibilities to act in good faith and on an accurate factual basis to provide \u201creliable and precise\u201d information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (citing, in particular, Jersild v.

Given her prior public denials of drug use, the core facts of her drug addiction and the fact that she was in treatment were legitimately a matter of public interest and capable of being published. Ms Campbell accepted this before the domestic courts, as did the parties before this Court. In making this undisputed qualitative distinction between, on the one hand, private information which Ms Campbell had already made public and which was therefore legitimately the subject of a public debate and, on the other, the additional information which she had not made public, the Court considers that all three domestic courts which examined the case reflected the same distinction underlined by this Court in the above-cited Von Hannover case decided some days after the present judgment of the House of Lords.",

The photographs had been taken covertly with a long range lens outside her place of treatment for drug addiction and would have been clearly distressing for a person of ordinary sensitivity in her position and faced with the same publicity; the photographs had been taken deliberately with a view to inclusion in the article and were accompanied with captions which made it clear she was coming from her NA meeting thereby connecting those photographs to the private information in the articles; and those photographs allowed the location of her NA meetings to be identified.

The domestic consultation process confirmed that access to justice for impecunious clients had not increased. The impression of many media groups was that certain solicitors conducted weak cases on an ordinary retainer and strong cases on CFAs. Since, in addition, the media rarely win publication cases, a success fee was therefore a windfall profit for lawyers and a punitive award against the media.

The House of Lords failed to determine whether success fees (including for wealthy claimants) were necessary to contribute to access to litigation by impecunious litigants and, indeed, these were not factors which a judge assessing costs could take into account. The CFA system should therefore be amended to exclude wealthy claimants and means testing was possible to achieve this since the same financial eligibility for legal representation in criminal cases had been usefully employed in Magistrates Courts, which courts tried approximately 95% of criminal cases.",

This was achieved through a fundamental re-balancing of the means of access to justice by resort to private sector funding (and hence funded indirectly by the public as a whole) rather than by the use of public (legal-aid) funds. It was intended to balance the rights of all litigants (claimants, defendants and successful or not), as well as the interests of lawyers who were expected to provide their services to the widest range of persons possible on a CFA. This allowed the State to re-allocate legal-aid resources by removing, for example, through the 1999 Act personal injuries claims from the legal-aid system, given the effectiveness of CFAs.",

As to whether entitlement to the CFA system should be means tested, the Government relied on Lord Hoffman's judgment in the second appeal and maintained that this was precisely the type of social and economic decision to which the margin of appreciation applied. There were no clear objective criteria by which one could regulate access to the CFA/recoverable success fee scheme according to the financial status of a claimant and, indeed, any attempt to draw such a line would undermine the objective of promoting wide access to legal services and would risk those falling just the wrong side of the line being significantly disadvantaged.

Claimants with CFAs incurred substantially higher legal costs than defendants who had no CFA because of the lack of incentive of a client with a CFA to control the costs of legal work done on its behalf. In addition, the study estimated that, even in non-CFA cases, costs in the UK were 4 times higher than in the next most costly jurisdiction, . Ireland was, in turn, almost ten times more expensive than , the third most expensive jurisdiction. If the figure for average costs across the jurisdictions is calculated without including the figures from England and Wales and Ireland, England and  is seen to be around 140 times more costly than the average.

They referred to the reasoning of Lord Hoffman who had similarly responded to the applicant's argument based on the facts of its case namely, that Ms Campbell was wealthy so that a CFA/recoverable success fee was not necessary to ensure her access to court. Lord Hoffman found that the general policy objectives underlying the CFA/recoverable success fees scheme meant that the scheme could not be disallowed solely on the ground that liability of an individual applicant would be inconsistent with its rights under Article 10 of the Convention (relying on the above-cited James v. the United Kingdom case).

If that recommendation were to be adopted, a further two recommendations (specifically concerning defamation and privacy actions) were made to ensure the objective of ensuring access to justice for claimants of slender means: increasing the general level of damages in defamation and breach of privacy cases by 10% and introducing a regime of qualified one-way costs shifting, so that the amount of costs an unsuccessful claimant might be ordered to pay was a reasonable amount, reflective of the means of the parties and their conduct in the proceedings.",

In addition, while those provisions addressed the reasonableness of base costs given matters such as the amount at stake, the interests of the parties and the complexity of the issues, Lord Hope underlined that the separate control of the reasonableness of success fees essentially concerned the review of the percentage uplift on the basis of the risk undertaken in the case and that, in an evenly balanced case such as the present, success fees were inevitably 100% (see also Designer's Guild Limited, cited at paragraph 97 above). Such safeguard provisions could not, therefore, as Lord Hoffman confirmed, address the applicant's rejection in principle of recoverable success fees calculated as a percentage of reasonable base costs.

It is true that the applicant, in the end, reached a settlement of the costs of both appeals paying the total sum of GBP 500,000.00 (base costs and success fees). However, given the findings of the House of Lords and of the Judicial Taxing Officers in the second appeal (paragraphs 70 and 80, respectively) as well as in the similar above-cited case of Designer's Guild Limited, success fees were clearly recoverable against the applicant and, further, at the rates of 95% and 100% in the first appeal and 95% for the solicitors' costs in the second appeal. Accordingly, even if it is not possible to quantify with certainty the precise amounts paid by the applicant which can be attributed to success fees, it is evident that the negotiated costs settlements reflected the obligation on the applicant to discharge substantial success fees.",

The test implied in that opinion is the wrong one. From the point of view of journalistic discretion in the presentation of a legitimate story, it is the restriction on freedom of expression that must be justified by reference to 'necessity' and not the publication as such. Secondly, insofar as the relevant principles are concerned, they have not been correctly applied on all counts. I agree that the \u201cpublic interest\u201d test was correctly applied when the majority found that the publication of the original story was in the public interest.

This approach is inconsistent with the 'strict scrutiny' that is usually found in this Court's case law in balancing Article 8 and Article 10 rights where the Court regularly makes its own independent assessment of the facts involved and of the application of the relevant principles to those facts and it frequently substitutes its own views for those of the domestic courts. It has been the consistent approach of this Court that it is not enough, in itself, that the domestic courts consider the relevant principles; they must also be applied correctly (in this regard, see, for example, Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, ECHR 1999I; Von Hannover v. , no. 59320/00, ECHR 2004VI; Biriuk v. , no. 23373/03, 25 November 2008; Petrenco v. , no. 20928/05, 30 March 2010; Flinkkil\u00e4 and Others v. , no. 25576/04, 6 April 2010; and Mariapori v. , no. 37751/07, 6 July 2010). In these and many other cases, the Court has made its own assessment and reversed the findings of the domestic courts without suggesting that the domestic courts had considered irrelevant principles or applied improper criteria in the overall assessment made. I do not see why a different approach should be adopted in this case.",

The additional information and the photographs were no more than a continuation of the original legitimate story. I agree with the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal and the views of Lord Nicholls and Lord Hoffman JJ of the House of Lords that this addition did not reveal anything fundamentally significant to the story but served mostly \u201cto add colour and conviction\u201d to it. In my view, the publication of the supplementary materials fell well within the journalistic margin of the press in deciding the way in which a legitimate story is presented (see, for example, Fressoz and Roire v. France, cited above, at \u00a7 54). Thus, even accepting that the publication of the additional information and pictures was a further incursion into Ms C's private life, it was only to a relatively minor degree in the overall context of the story as a whole. It cannot be considered as sufficient and serious enough to justify the restriction on freedom of expression under Article 10.",
