Moreover, the undue duration of the proceedings could play a role in that the defendant was subjected to a greater burden as a result. In a further step the criminal courts, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, then had to determine which part of the penalty was to be considered as having already been served in order to compensate the defendant for the delay caused by the State authorities and courts contrary to the rule of law. Both the penalty and the part of it which had to be considered as served had to be taken up in the operative part of the judgment.",

The applicant, however, had already been compensated for that delay by having had three months of the prison sentence declared as served. The court had thereby reduced the applicant\u2019s sentence in an express and measurable manner. The fact that the applicant had been given a prison sentence suspended on probation had not changed the fact that sufficient redress had been granted. In the event that the suspension of the sentence had been revoked, the applicant would have had to serve only five months instead of eight. Therefore, the mental strain of the sentence had been less severe. In addition, a condition of a suspended sentence was that compensation by means of a reduced sentence would only take effect if the suspension was revoked. In that regard, the consequences of the \u201cnew\u201d execution approach had been the same as those of the previous mitigation approach. As pointed out by the Federal Court of Justice in its judgment (see paragraph 33 above), under both approaches compensation would only be actually awarded if the suspension was revoked and the prison sentence then had to be executed. Furthermore, in determining the sentence the Regional Court had not only expressly reduced the sentence but had also taken into account, in the applicant\u2019s favour, the lengthy overall duration of the proceedings and the time that had elapsed since the criminal act. According to the Government, this had resulted in a quite lenient prison sentence of only eight months. Having regard to the above, the Government concluded that the applicant had already been compensated for the excessive length of the proceedings and could no longer claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.",

Since he had committed no further offences during the probation period and consequently the suspension of his sentence had not been revoked, there had been no measurable reduction of his sentence and no compensation had been awarded in any other way. Moreover, as the Regional Court had applied the \u201cexecution approach\u201d and had therefore not reduced his sentence, he had lost his status as a civil servant as he had been given a (suspended) prison sentence of more than six months, even though he would have had to serve only five months had the suspension of his sentence been revoked. In sum, he had not received any redress for the violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and could still claim to be a victim.",

Therefore, anyone whom a criminal court trusted to act in conformity with the law in the future and, accordingly, whose sentence it thus suspended on probation, would be afforded worse treatment than a person for whom the criminal court had not assumed this to be the case. Moreover, as a consequence of the introduction of the execution solution, ancillary consequences of a criminal conviction, for example the loss of the status of civil servant, were based on the non-reduced prison sentence.",

In cases concerning a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 due to the excessive length of criminal proceedings, the Court has repeatedly found that redress could notably be granted by adequately reducing the prison sentence of the person found guilty of an offence in an express and measurable manner or by discontinuing the criminal proceedings on account of their excessive length (see Ommer v. Germany (no. 1), no. 10597/03, \u00a7 68, 13 November 2008, with further references; \u0160\u010densnovi\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 62663/13, \u00a7\u00a092, 10 July 2018; and Malkov v. Estonia, no. 31407/07, \u00a7 40, 4 February 2010). The Court has further accepted in other length-of-proceedings cases that monetary compensation can constitute redress for excessively lengthy proceedings and that the party concerned can then no longer claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention (see Scordino, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0181).",

Therefore, it cannot be said that the Regional Court expressly acknowledged a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in that part of the judgment. Moreover, the reduction of the sentence alleged by the Government is not measureable as the duration of the proceedings was one of many aspects taken into account by the Regional Court when determining the sentence.",

It is thus conditional as the applicant would profit from the reduction of the prison sentence only in case he recommitted a criminal offence within the probation period. In the Court\u2019s view this form of compensation is, nevertheless, not theoretical, but mitigates the threat of imprisonment, which is inherent in a conditional prison sentence, reducing it from eight to five months, and thus in an express and measurable manner. For this finding it is immaterial that this reduction did not affect the ancillary consequences of the conditional prison sentence.",
