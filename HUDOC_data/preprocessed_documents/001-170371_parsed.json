A claim under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act would have been bound to fail, as under the prevailing case-law of the Bulgarian courts, including the Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s 2005 interpretative decision (cited in paragraph 36 above), the actions of the police in a criminal case were not \u201cadministrative\u201d within the meaning of that provision.

The existence of an adverse ruling in a somewhat similar case (see paragraph 41 above) does not mean that the applicants should not have attempted such proceedings. Doubts about the prospects of a remedy which appears to offer a reasonable possibility of redress are not a sufficient reason to eschew it (see, among other authorities, Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v.

One such situation is when the domestic courts have given conflicting rulings (see Whiteside v. the United Kingdom, no. 20357/92, Commission decision of 7 March 1994, Decisions and Reports 76-A, p. 80), as opposed to a consistent line of adverse precedents (see, among other authorities, Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v.

The applications by the prosecuting authorities chiefly referred to information from the French authorities that the first applicant had links with a Turkish national suspected of trafficking in forged Bulgarian identity documents, and also referred to intelligence obtained via a wiretap of that person\u2019s mobile telephone (see paragraphs 7, 8 and 10 above). Contrary to the applicants\u2019 arguments, the use of wiretap information does not in itself cast doubt on the existence of a reasonable suspicion. It is true that in Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a085-86) the Court found, inter alia, that Bulgarian law, as it stood in 2007, did not contain enough safeguards that the authorities deploying covert surveillance measures, such as wiretaps, would faithfully reproduce the original data in the written record, or lay down proper procedures for preserving the integrity of such data. But, in the wake of that judgment, in 2008 the statute governing covert surveillance was amended in 2008 to bring it into line with the requirements of the Convention (see Lenev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 41452/07, \u00a7 80, 4 December 2012). The Court\u2019s findings in Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above) are therefore of no relevance for the wiretap in this case, which was put in place in 2014. Moreover, the wiretap information was only part of the material used to justify the need for the searches (contrast,\u00a0mutatis mutandis, C.G. and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 1365/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a014 and 47-48, 24 April 2008).",

Although limiting the searches to specific premises, they did not describe in detail the items which could be searched for and seized, but instead referred in more general terms to the type of items \u201crelating to the forging of identity documents and others, relevant to the case\u201d (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above), that is, objects which might be used to perform the activities which were the subject of the offence under investigation. The specificity of the items subject to seizure varies from case to case depending on the nature of the offence being investigated (see Sher and Others v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a05201/11, \u00a7 174, ECHR 2015 (extracts)). In this case, the prosecuting authorities and the police, which had to act quickly after the arrest of the first applicant\u2019s alleged accomplice in France (see paragraph 9 above), could not have known in advance what specific items could furnish proof of the forging of identity documents of which the first applicant was a suspect. Although it might have been feasible to frame the warrants in more precise terms, it was sufficient, in the circumstances, that their scope was limited by reference to the nature of the alleged offence, thus circumscribing sufficiently the discretion of the officers who carried out the searches, who only seized items which could be seen as potentially connected with the alleged offence (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above).",

The police were only able to go through the account because the first applicant gave them his password and invited them to do so (see paragraph 18 above).

The notion of an effective remedy in this context does not entail the imposing of sanctions on the officials who carried out the searches (see Peev, \u00a7 70, and Golovan, \u00a7 72, both cited above). It must rather be seen whether the applicants had access to a procedure enabling them to contest the lawfulness of the searches and seizures and obtain appropriate redress if they were unlawfully ordered or executed.",

In Gutsanovi (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 234-35), Govedarski (cited above, \u00a7 94), Stoyanov and Others v. Bulgaria (no.\u00a055388/10, \u00a7 152, 31 March 2016) and Popovi v. Bulgaria (no.\u00a039651/11, \u00a7 122, 9 June 2016), the Court found the same with respect to the Code of Criminal Procedure of 2005. Although the Government appear to be considering steps to fill this gap (see paragraphs 47 and 73 above), it continues to exist. The February 2014 judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court that the police may be liable under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act with respect to heavy-handedness in searches (see paragraph 37 above) only partly fills it, as in such proceedings it is not possible to challenge a search as such, or the way in which it has been ordered or authorised. For their part, the civil courts appear reluctant to review the lawfulness of decisions by the prosecuting authorities and criminal courts to order and authorise searches and seizures in criminal proceedings (compare with Saint-Paul Luxembourg S.A., cited above, \u00a7 31). They have only imposed liability in damages for the unduly prolonged retention of seized items (see paragraphs 44-46 above).",

While the Court has never treated this as a stand-alone requirement but as one of the factors to be taken into consideration when deciding on the proportionality of the interference, it has still given it particular weight. According to the Court, a search warrant must be accompanied by certain limitations, in order to guarantee that the interference which it authorises is not potentially unlimited. The Court has held in this respect that the warrant itself must specify the items being searched for and that this cannot be supplemented by a description of those items in the application for a warrant made by the investigating or prosecuting authorities, unless that application is enclosed with the warrant when it is presented to the person whose premises are to be searched (see Van Rossem v. Belgium, no. 41872/98, \u00a7 47).",

It is only where the person affected is informed of the items being searched for that he or she is able to check whether the search is being lawfully carried out and to react if it is not. For this reason, a subsequent review of the lawfulness of the search is also an element that the Court will take into account in assessing the lawfulness of the search warrant. A warrant that is too broad in scope can nonetheless be considered valid if there are other sufficient safeguards, including a procedure after the search in which the persons concerned can challenge it (see Robathin v. Austria, no. 30457/06, \u00a7\u00a7 47 in fine and 48).",

If the case is a large-scale and complex terror investigation, with a significant number of uncertainties, a wide description could well be sufficient (ibid.). However, in a financial fraud investigation, a search warrant granted \u201cin order to investigate and seize any documents that might assist in the investigation\u201d has been found by the Court to be insufficiently precise, as it imposed no limitation of any sort on the police officers carrying out the search (see Van Rossem, cited above).",

It referred solely to the crime that was being investigated, namely forgery of identity documents, and did not mention any specific items to be searched for (see paragraphs 10 and 11 of the judgment). The sufficiency of the description certainly has to be judged in the light of the information available to the authorities at the time they obtain the warrant and in the present case it was clear that at the time when the search warrant was requested and granted, the authorities did have quite specific information. The prosecuting authorities and the police were looking for technical equipment and storage devices \u2013 computers, hard drives, video cameras, flash memory drives \u2013 which could prove that the first applicant, a professional photographer, was forging Bulgarian identity documents. However, this information was not reflected in the search warrant or any other document communicated to the applicants during the search of their home. Furthermore, the search warrant did not refer to proceeds of the alleged crime. Nevertheless, the police also seized cash (see paragraph 15 of the judgment). This fact clearly demonstrates, in our view, that the search warrant was not sufficiently specific and limited in scope.",

Such a procedural requirement seems neither excessively burdensome nor unreasonable, and it certainly allows a meaningful and effective subsequent review to be made. Combined with the fact that no subsequent review of the lawfulness of the search (see paragraphs 85 and 86 of the judgment), capable of protecting the applicants against any abuse or arbitrariness, was possible under the national law, the failure to specify the scope of the search warrant leads us to the conclusion that there was a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.",
