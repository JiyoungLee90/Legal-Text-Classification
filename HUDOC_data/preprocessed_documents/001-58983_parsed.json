The orders for the removal of the appeals from the list had therefore been proportionate to the aim pursued by the decree of 20 July 1989 (see paragraph 35 above), namely the introduction of an administrative and regulatory measure intended to remind the parties that appeals to the Court of Cassation were an extraordinary remedy and to guarantee beneficiaries of enforceable court decisions the full effectiveness of the prerogatives afforded them by the court below. The decisions for removal of the appeals from the list had been taken after an adversarial hearing in public that had allowed an effective and concrete examination of the alleged manifestly unreasonable consequences. Those consequences had to be examined with regard to compliance with the impugned judgment and not to the decision to remove the appeal from the list. It was not enough to assert that compliance with the impugned judgment would produce adverse consequences: a fragile financial position had to be established by adducing the relevant evidence necessary for proper argument to be heard. Thus, the Court of Cassation had taken into consideration in previous cases such matters as an appellant's advanced age and insufficient means, his or her failing health, and personal, family or job-related problems that were particularly acute.",

France decision cited above). In that connection, the Commission considered that the procedure provided for in Article 1009-1 was aimed at securing the proper administration of justice, noting: \u201c[it] is designed to ensure compliance with the principle that an appeal to the Court of Cassation, which is confined to an appeal on points of law, is an extraordinary procedure in civil proceedings, which, as a matter of principle, has no suspensive effect. Moreover, the rule is not applied automatically: on an application for striking out, the President of the Court of Cassation makes a ruling after hearing argument for both sides and will order the appeal to be struck out only if the consequences of such a measure do not appear to him or her to be manifestly extreme. The Commission notes finally that the sole effect of an order striking out an appeal is to stay the proceedings until judgment is executed\u201d (see M. v.  cited above).",

It notes, however, that execution in the present cases is unusual in that a peculiar feature of the decision whether to order the removal of the appeal from the Court of Cassation's list in the light of the aims pursued by Article 1009-1 is that it is the respondent to the appeal who is entitled to make the application, with the danger which that entails of justice being subject to a degree of \u201cprivatisation\u201d.",

However, it finds that the applicants were heavily in debt and that there was no doubt that their financial situation was precarious at the time the applications for removal of the appeals from the list were made. The fact that Mr Annoni di Gussola was in receipt of minimum welfare benefit throughout the relevant period indisputably prevented him from being able to begin to comply with the court of appeal's order. Likewise, Ms Desbordes' and Mr Omer's initial lack of means and their subsequently insufficient means at that time indicated that they were in the same position. Admittedly, the Government are right to consider that the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies would in theory have been satisfied only once the appeal had lapsed for want of prosecution and that the same rule applied to standing as a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. The Court observes, however, that the applicants' complaint is precisely that it was impossible for them to have their appeal to the Court of Cassation determined, since no compliance with the impugned decisions could reasonably be envisaged. The disproportion between the respective financial circumstances of the applicants and the sums due under the decisions appealed against is clear and the Court does not share the Government's opinion that it did not reach the levels found by the Commission in the cases of Ferville and Marc Venot cited above.",

Whilst the Convention sets forth what are essentially civil and political rights, many of them have implications of a social or economic nature. The Court therefore considers ... that the mere fact that an interpretation of the Convention may extend into the sphere of social and economic rights should not be a decisive factor against such an interpretation; there is no watertight division separating that sphere from the field covered by the Convention\u201d (see the Airey v. Ireland judgment of 9\u00a0October 1979, Series A no. 32, pp. 14-15, \u00a7 26).

However, it is clear that those financial circumstances were not taken into consideration when the issue of \u201cmanifestly unreasonable consequences\u201d entailed by compliance with the judgments of the courts of appeal was examined. The Court notes that the orders for removal of the appeals from the lists do not contain reasons and are identical in both cases. They do not enable the Court to satisfy itself that the applicants' circumstances were effectively examined in practice. The Court is of the opinion that the precarious financial circumstances of the applicants could have created a sort of rebuttable presumption of the existence of \u201cmanifestly unreasonable consequences\u201d, as indeed has been the Court of Cassation's approach in its recent case-law on the subject (see paragraph 36 above). At the very least, the President's refusal to accede to the requests for the appeals to remain in the Court of Cassation's list should have been reasoned and been preceded by a careful and thorough examination of the applicants' circumstances. In that connection, the Court notes that the new wording of Article 1009-1 (see paragraph 35 above) provides that the decision whether to order the removal of an appeal from the list shall be taken following observations from the parties, and not just an opinion. This amendment seems to require that greater attention should be paid to the parties' interests.",

The Court sees that provision as reflecting an intention to avoid appeals whose outcome is likely to be unfavourable to the respondent's interests being paralysed. In that connection, it notes that the disagreement between the courts of first instance and appeal in the case of Ms Desbordes and Mr Omer pointed to the existence of an issue on a point of law which could have offered prospects of success.
