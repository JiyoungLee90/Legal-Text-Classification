In determining whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, regard must also be had to whether the rights of the defence have been respected and whether the applicant was given the opportunity to challenge the authenticity of the evidence and to oppose its use. In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. As a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce. Similarly, Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses, in the \u201cautonomous\u201d sense given to that word in the Convention system. In the context of taking evidence, the Court has paid particular attention to compliance with the principle of equality of arms, which is one of the fundamental aspects of a fair hearing and which implies that the applicant must be \u201cafforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent\u201d. Therefore, even though it is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to call a witness, there might be exceptional circumstances which could prompt the Court to conclude that the failure to do so was incompatible with Article 6. When a request by a defendant to examine witnesses is not vexatious, is sufficiently reasoned, is relevant to the subject matter of the accusation and could arguably have strengthened the position of the defence or even led to his acquittal, the domestic authorities must provide relevant reasons for dismissing such a request. If they fail to do so, the Court may conclude that the overall fairness of the proceedings has been undermined (see, among other authorities, Mushegh Saghatelyan v. Armenia, no.\u00a023086/08, \n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a0202-204, 20 September 2018, and Murtazaliyeva v. Russia [GC], no.\u00a036658/05, \u00a7\u00a7 139-159, 18 December 2018).",

It held that in the dispute over the key facts underlying the charges where the only witnesses for the prosecution were the police officers who had played an active role in the contested events, it was indispensable for the courts to use every reasonable opportunity to check their incriminating statements (see Kasparov and Others v. Russia, no. 21613/07, \u00a7 64, 3 October 2013; Navalnyy and Yashin v. Russia, no. 76204/11, \u00a7 83, 4 December 2014; and Frumkin v. Russia, no. 74568/12, \u00a7 165, ECHR 2016 (extracts)). A similar situation was examined by the Court in a case against Armenia, in which a violation of Article 6 was found and which, moreover, concerned the same events as in the present case (see Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0200-211).",

The criminal case against the applicant, who was, like the applicant in the above case, facing charges for certain acts allegedly committed in connection with the assembly at Freedom Square, was built entirely on the testimony of two police officers who had been, as the domestic courts found, actively involved in the contested events and whose statements, moreover, appear to have contained inconsistencies. The applicant\u2019s requests to admit a video recording and to call witnesses, which were sufficiently substantiated and of relevance to the charges against him, were not even examined by the trial court, in violation of the domestic procedure, as later confirmed by the appeal court (see paragraphs 19 and 24 above). It is true that the appeal court then examined those requests and even admitted the video recording in question for examination. However, it is questionable whether this rectified the flaws in the first-instance proceedings. Firstly, as regards the request to admit the video recording, it appears that the appeal court a priori viewed the failure of the trial to rule on that request as a purely procedural flaw not affecting in any way the merits of the trial court\u2019s findings (see paragraph 24 above). It therefore appears that the appeal court\u2019s review of that flaw was of a purely formalistic nature and it does not appear that due consideration was given to that evidence. Secondly, as regards the request to call witnesses, that request was dismissed by the appeal court without sufficient and convincing reasoning, especially in view of the fact that one of the witnesses whom the applicant sought to call was allegedly able to testify regarding not only the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s transfer from one police station to another but also those concerning his \u201cbringing-in\u201d to Kentron police station, which was of direct relevance to the charge against him (see paragraphs 18 and 23 above).",

Their unreserved endorsement of the police version of events, failure to address properly the applicant\u2019s submissions and refusal to examine the defence witnesses without proper regard to the relevance of their statements can be said to have led to a limitation of the defence rights incompatible with the guarantees of a fair hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, Mushegh\u00a0Saghatelyan, \u00a7 210).",
