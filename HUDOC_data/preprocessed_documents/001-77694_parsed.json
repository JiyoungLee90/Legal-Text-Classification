Furthermore, the danger of the applicant\u2019s absconding persisted in view of the lifelong prison sentence he faced. The objective of his detention on remand could accordingly not be accomplished by alternative, less radical, preventive measures. Although the applicant had been detained since as far back as 8\u00a0January 1994, his further detention remained proportionate having regard to the importance of the case, the character and seriousness of the offences and the particular public interest in the prosecution of these offences. Referring to the principle of proportionality, the court underlined that a detainee\u2019s right to liberty could outweigh the public interest in the prosecution as time passed, if there was, for instance, an imminent risk of irreparable damage to his health. In the present case, however, nothing suggested that the applicant\u2019s life or health were at risk.

The court alluded to the historical background of the case, in particular to the tensions between the United States and Libya which had arisen following terrorist attacks in 1985. In January 1986 the United States government had imposed a trade embargo on Libya and had ordered the freezing of all Libyan State assets in  banks. These measures had led to military intervention and to the planning by Libyan nationals of terrorist attacks on United States facilities in Germany. The court further pointed out that the applicant\u2019s crimes were punishable by imprisonment for up to fifteen years and sentenced him to fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment. When determining the sentence, the court took into account, among other things, the fact that the applicant\u2019s detention on remand and the proceedings had lasted an unusually long time. It further determined that since 8 January 1994 the applicant had been detained in Lebanon with a view to extradition in connection with the present case. This period of detention was to be deducted from his prison sentence at a ratio of 1:3 until 30 April 1994 and at a ratio of 1:2 from 1 May 1994. The court moreover ordered the applicant\u2019s continued detention. The judgment, which ran to 380 pages, was served on the applicant\u2019s lawyer on 10 January 2003.",

Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, \u00a7 44, ECHR 1999-VI). However, as the Convention leaves to each Contracting State, in the first place, the task of securing the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms it enshrines (see Cordier v. Germany (dec.), no. 71741/01, 19 January 2006), this general rule is subject to an exception when the national authorities have acknowledged either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see Eckle v. Germany, 15 July 1982, \u00a7 66, Series A no. 51; Jansen v. Germany (dec.), no. 44186/98, 12 October 2000; and Beck v. Norway, no. 26390/95, \u00a7 27, 26 June 2001). In cases concerning the failure to observe the reasonable-time requirement guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the national authorities can afford adequate redress in particular by reducing the applicant\u2019s sentence in an express and measurable manner (see Eckle, cited above, \u00a7 66, and Beck, cited above, \u00a7 27). The Court has held that such a reduction of the sentence is also capable of affording adequate redress for a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in cases in which the national authorities had failed to hear within a reasonable time the case of an applicant held in detention on remand (see Dzelili v. Germany, no.\u00a065745/01, \u00a7 83, 10 November 2005).",

Furthermore, the Court is not satisfied that the applicant was afforded adequate redress for the alleged violation because the Regional Court failed to specify to what extent the applicant\u2019s sentence had been reduced on account of the length of his detention on remand (see Dzelili, cited above, \u00a7 85).",

The re-examination of a case may, however, be appropriate where new facts have emerged which could furnish a separate basis for a fresh decision. In cases of continued detention for instance, the prolongation of the detention in itself may under certain circumstances justify a re-examination of the question of release (see Lynas v. Switzerland, no. 7317/75, Commission decision of 6 October 1976, Decisions and Reports 6, p. 141, at p. 167).",

However, in the context of the issues arising in the present case, the Court considers that the specific nature of these offences and, in particular, the difficulties intrinsic to the investigation of offences committed by criminal associations acting on a global scale call for special consideration. It will bear this context in mind when assessing the reasonableness of the length of the applicant\u2019s continued detention, in particular the grounds for his detention and the conduct of the proceedings in the light of the complexity of the case.",

He had neither a fixed dwelling nor social ties in Germany which might have prevented him from absconding if released. Accordingly, the Court is satisfied that a substantial risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding persisted throughout his detention and accepts the domestic courts\u2019 finding that no other measures to secure his presence would have been appropriate.
