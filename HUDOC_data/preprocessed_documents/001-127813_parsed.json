Nevertheless, the applicant\u2019s arrest had been documented only in the evening of 19 July 2005. Such an administrative delay in regularising the applicant\u2019s arrest could possibly give rise to disciplinary proceedings against the officers responsible for it, but could not qualify as a criminal offence. The District Prosecutor\u2019s Office also found that there was insufficient evidence that the applicant had been tortured. Finally, it noted that the visit of the police to the applicant\u2019s home qualified not as a search, but as an inspection of the crime scene, which had been conducted lawfully, since the applicant had given his consent to such an inspection.",

This delay could have been used by the officers to coordinate their statements and destroy evidence. Furthermore, it was only in November 2005 (nearly four months after the events complained about) that the applicant was granted the status of an injured party in connection with the investigation of his complaint of ill-treatment. The first attempt to reconstruct the events leading to the applicant\u2019s injuries was made only in January 2006 (some six months after the events complained about) and the first confrontation between the applicant and the police officers was held only in February 2006 (seven months after the events in question). Notwithstanding that there was sufficient evidence to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the police officers identified had committed a crime of violence, they were not summoned as defendants or even as suspects, but were always questioned only as witnesses. No procedure by which the applicant could have identified the other concerned officers, whose names he did not know, was ever set up.",

Corroborated by the medical and other evidence concerning physical injuries, this fact gives rise to a strong presumption that the police officers resorted to physical ill-treatment as a means of breaking the applicant\u2019s psychological resistance and using his vulnerable state to obtain self-incriminating statements. By way of an alternative version, the police officers provided several accounts, inconsistently describing the sequence of events leading to the applicant\u2019s injuries and the officers\u2019 individual roles in them (see paragraph 24 above). For instance, it is not apparent from these accounts why the applicant had engaged in self-injurious conduct after volunteering a confession or why the police officers had to restrain him by force to prevent him from leaving the police station, regard being had to their own submissions that the applicant had not been under arrest. The Government in their observations likewise fail to provide any plausible alternative explanation as to how the applicant\u2019s injuries have been inflicted.",

By means of this distinction, the Convention attaches a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 167, and Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 96). In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element to torture, as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Article 1 of which defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (see Akko\u00e7 v.\u00a0Turkey, nos. 22947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2000X and Aleksakhin, cited above, \u00a7 50). In the Selmouni judgment, cited above, the Court took the view that the increasingly high standard being required in the area of the protection of human rights correspondingly and inevitably required greater firmness in assessing breaches of the fundamental values of democratic societies (\u00a7 101). In the light of this approach, the Court held that certain acts which were classified in the past as \u201cinhuman and degrading treatment\u201d as opposed to \u201ctorture\u201d could be classified differently in future (ibid.).",

The Court may review whether national law has been observed for the purposes of this Convention provision; however, it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Oleksiy Mykhaylovych Zakharkin v. Ukraine, no. 1727/04, \u00a7 84, 24 June 2010). \u201cLawfulness\u201d of detention under domestic law is the primary, but not always the decisive element. The Court must, in addition, be satisfied that the detention, during the period under consideration, was compatible with the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which is to prevent persons from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary manner (see Yeloyev v. Ukraine, no. 17283/02, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, 6\u00a0November 2008, and Korneykova v. Ukraine, no. 39884/05, \u00a7 33, 19\u00a0January 2012).",

The Court further notes that this provision obliged the authorities to obtain a court authorisation or the owner\u2019s written consent as a precondition for inspecting residential premises, except in limited urgent cases where these requirements could be dispensed with (see the relevant provisions of Article 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960 in paragraph 42 above).

It also appears that the applicant was brought to his home for participating in its examination under close supervision of the same police officers, who were implicated by him in his ill-treatment, and that he remained handcuffed throughout the procedure (see paragraphs 9-10, 17, 75 and 83 above). It follows that the police officers obtained the applicant\u2019s authorisation to inspect his residence in a setting in which he lacked any procedural guarantees protecting his ability to express his true will. In these circumstances, the Court finds it credible that the applicant felt coerced to give the authorisation in issue. It follows that the disputed inspection was not carried out on the basis of the applicant\u2019s true consent and that therefore one of the conditions for the application of Article 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960 was manifestly not met.",
