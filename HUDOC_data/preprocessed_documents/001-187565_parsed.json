On 22\u00a0October 2004 the report, as amended by Mr Oran in line with the comments put forward by members of the Consultative Council at the meeting on 1 October 2004, was submitted to the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for Human Rights Affairs. The report first of all dealt with the concept and definition of and the historical background to the protection of minority and cultural rights in worldwide and in Turkey. It then went on to consider issues relating to the protection of minorities in Turkey, relying on the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne, national legislation and practice and the case-law of the higher courts. According to the report, there were two primary reasons for the problematical situation of minorities in Turkey: a theoretical reason tending to define the supra-identity in terms of \u201crace\u201d (\u0131rk) and religion as Turkish (T\u00fcrk) and not as T\u00fcrkiyeli (\u201ccoming from Turkey\u201d, \u201ccitizen of Turkey\u201d), which resulted in alienating the infra-identities of citizens who do not belong to the Turkish \u201crace\u201d or the Muslim religion; and an historical/political reason stemming from the paranoia (paranoya) inherited from the dismantling of the country in the recent past, a syndrome referred to in the report as \u201cthe S\u00e8vres syndrome\u201d.",

It consequently proposed rewriting the Constitution and the relevant legislation from a liberal, pluralist and democratic angle, including the participation of the organised fringes of society; guaranteeing the rights of persons laying claim to different identities and cultures to preserve and develop those identities on the basis of equal citizenship; making central and local administrations more transparent and democratic such as to ensure participation and oversight by the citizens; signing and unreservedly ratifying the international treaties laying down the universal standards of human rights, and in particular the Council of Europe\u2019s Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities; and, as regards international treaties, discontinuing the practice of entering reservations or interpretative declarations tending to negate infra-identities in Turkey.",

On 26 October 2004, for example, an MP speaking in the National Assembly used, with regard to the authors of the report in question, expressions such as \u201chired boffins\u201d (entel dev\u015firme), \u201cindividuals spitting their venomous saliva\u201d, \u201cpeople in the pay of foreigners\u201d, \u201cpersons who hate the words \u2018Turkish\u00a0nation\u2019\u201d, \u201ctraitors\u201d, \u201cthose who want to split up the Republic of Turkey\u201d, and \u201cenemy of the Turks\u201d. The Deputy Prime Minister spoke of a \u201cmarginal report by marginal people\u201d, claiming that the authors had drawn it up without informing the Government of its content. The Minister of Justice described the report as \u201csowing intellectual discord\u201d. The Deputy Chief-of-Staff also criticised the report, declaring that the unitary structure of the State was beyond question. Moreover, the Director of Human Rights at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office questioned the validity of the report by alleging that there had been no quorum when it had been adopted by the Assembly of the Consultative Council.",

As regards the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression, the Constitutional Court pointed out that the positive obligations in the sphere of freedom of expression required States, in particular, to establish an effective mechanism for the protection of writers and journalists in order to create an environment conducive to the involvement in public debate of all those concerned, so that they could voice their opinions and ideas without fear. The Constitutional Court further noted that the applicant had been working on minority rights for much of his career and that he was continuing to work on similar matters. It noted that as regards the judicial authorities\u2019 ineffective investigations into the death threats issued against the applicant on account of his work on minority rights, he had not benefited from an environment conducive to the safe pursuit of that work. Considering that the ineffective judicial investigations and proceedings had had a chilling effect on the applicant\u2019s exercise of his freedom of expression, the Constitutional Court found that in his case the authorities had failed in their positive obligations in relation to freedom of expression.",

Germany, no. 59320/00, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2004VI). The case-law of the Court accepts that a person\u2019s right to protection of reputation is covered by Article 8 of the Convention as part of the right to respect for private life (see Axel Springer AG v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7 83, 7 February 2012; Delfi AS v. Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, \u00a7 137, ECHR 2015; B\u00e9dat v.

The Court has already ruled that a person\u2019s reputation, even if that person is criticised in the context of a public debate, forms part of his or her personal identity and psychological integrity and therefore also falls within the scope of his or her private life (see Pfeifer v. Austria, no. , \u00a7 35, 15\u00a0November 2007, and Petrie v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a025322/12, \u00a7 39, 18\u00a0May 2017). The same considerations apply to a person\u2019s honour (see Sanchez Cardenas v. Norway, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 38, 4 October 2007, and A. v. Norway, no. , \u00a7 64, 9\u00a0April 2009). In order for Article 8 to come into play, however, an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7 83; Delfi AS, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0137; B\u00e9dat, cited above, \u00a7 72; and Med\u017elis Islamske Zajednice Br\u010dko and Others, cited above, \u00a7 76).",

Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart \u2013 in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities \u2013 information and ideas on all matters of public interest, including those relating to the administration of justice. Thus the national authorities\u2019 margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of democratic society in enabling the press to exercise its vital role of \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d (see, among many other authorities, Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.

Nevertheless, journalists must act in good faith in order to provide \u201caccurate and reliable\u201d information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no.\u00a029183/95, \u00a7 54, ECHR 1999-I; Radio France and Others v. France, no.\u00a053984/00, \u00a7 37, ECHR 2004-II; and July and Sarl Lib\u00e9ration v. France, no.\u00a020893/03, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2008). That having been said, journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Fressoz and Roire, cited above, \u00a7 45, and Mam\u00e8re v. France, no.\u00a012697/03, \u00a7 25, ECHR 2006-XIII).",

Latvia, no. 57829/00, \u00a7 45, 27 May 2004). Thus the task of imparting information necessarily includes duties and responsibilities, as well as limits which the press must impose on itself spontaneously. That is especially so where a media report attributes very serious actions to named persons, as such \u201callegations\u201d comprise the risk of exposing the latter to public contempt (see Falakao\u011flu and Sayg\u0131l\u0131 v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 11461/03, \u00a7 27, 19 December 2006).",

Austria ((no. 1), 23\u00a0May 1991, \u00a7 63, Series A no. 204), inter alia, it drew a distinction between facts and value judgments. The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof, and in that case a requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 of the Convention (see De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24 February 1997, \u00a7\u00a042, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I). However, in the case of a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement: otherwise, that value judgment may itself be excessive (see De Haes and Gijsels, cited above, \u00a7 47; Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 2), 1 July 1997, \u00a7 33, Reports 1997-IV; Brasilier v. France, no. 71343/01, \u00a7 36, 11 April 2006; and Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, \u00a7\u00a055, ECHR 2007IV). In order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment it is necessary to take account of the circumstances of the case and the general tone of the remarks (see Brasilier, cited above, \u00a7 37), bearing in mind that assertions about matters of public interest may, on that basis, constitute value judgments rather than statements of fact (see Paturel v.\u00a0France, no. 54968/00, \u00a7 37, 22 December 2005).",

Italy, cited above, \u00a7 40). In several of its judgments the Court has summarised the relevant criteria for balancing the right to respect for private life and the right to freedom of expression as follows: contribution to a public-interest debate, whether the person concerned is well-known, the subject of the report, the prior conduct of the person concerned, the content, form and consequences of the publication, as well as, if appropriate, the circumstances of the case (see Von Hannover (no. 2) [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108-113, and Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 89-95; see also Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s, cited above, \u00a7 93). If the two rights in question have been balanced in a manner consistent with the criteria established by the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others v.

The key factors in the Court\u2019s assessment were whether the statements had been made against a tense political or social background (see Zana v. Turkey, 25 November 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 57-60, Case Reports 1997-VII; Soulas and Others v. France, no. 15948/03, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39, 10 July 2008; and Balsyt\u0117-Lideikien\u0117 v. Lithuania, no. 72596/01, \u00a7 78, 4 November 2008); the question whether the statements, being correctly interpreted and assessed in their immediate or broader context, can be seen as a direct or indirect call to violence or as condoning violence, hatred or intolerance (see, among other authorities, \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem v. Turkey (no. 23144/93, ECHR 2000III) \u00a7 64; F\u00e9ret v.

Turkey ([GC], no. 23168/94, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a051-52, ECHR 1999-IV, and Vejdeland and Others v. Sweden, no. 1813/07, \u00a7 56, 9 February 2012). In all of the above cases, it was the interplay between the various factors rather than any one of them taken in isolation that determined the outcome of the case. The Court\u2019s approach to that type of case can thus be described as highly context-specific (see Perin\u00e7ek v.\u00a0Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, \u00a7\u00a0208, ECHR 2015 (extracts)).",

In that connection, it first of all notes that the articles had been published against the background of a heated public debate on the proposals put forward by the aforementioned report concerning effective protection for minority rights in Turkey. The Court acknowledges that this is a difficult subject liable to raise concerns in nationalist circles as to the unitary structure of the Turkish nation and State. The press statements and articles criticising the applicants were therefore published in the context of a reactionary campaign conducted by the said nationalist circles against the report and its main authors, that is to say the applicants. The latter had in fact exercised their freedom of expression by drafting that report, setting out their point of view on the status and place of minorities in a democratic society, without, however, using derogatory or insulting language in connection with those holding different views on the subject. The Court considered in that regard that in order to gauge the level of tension prevailing at that time, it is sufficient to recall, firstly, the incident at the press conference organised by the applicant \u0130brahim Kabo\u011flu, when F.Y., a member of a nationalist-leaning trade union, tore up a copy of the report laid in front of Mr Kabo\u011flu, thus breaking up the conference (see paragraph 11 above), and secondly, the death threats received by the applicants, which forced the authorities to grant them special police protection (see paragraph 14 above) and which, in the absence of an effective judicial reaction, led the Constitutional Court to find a violation of the applicant Bask\u0131n Oran\u2019s right to life and to freedom of expression (see paragraph 45 above).",

It observes that those courts, without ever explicitly characterising the articles \u2013 factual statements, value judgments or hate speech/incitement to violence \u2013 concluded that those articles had not directly targeted the applicants or comprised wanton attacks against them, that the applicants should tolerate the harsh criticism levelled at them on account, firstly, of their status, and secondly, of the criticism that they themselves had levelled in the report at their ideological adversaries, and that the articles fell within the scope of the legal provisions protecting their authors\u2019 freedom of expression (see paragraphs 17, 23, 33 and 39 above). The Court also notes that apart from the Ankara Regional Court, the domestic courts paid little or no attention to the threatening and violent expressions used in the impugned articles. In its 25 July 2006 judgment, the Ankara Regional Court held that the phrase \u201cthe price of the soil is blood, and if need be blood will be shed\u201d was a popular saying and was not a threat to the applicants, and that the statement \u201cthose who want to see the Turkish nation as a minority in this country will have us to contend with\u201d was only a criticism of the opinions expressed in the report (see paragraph 23 above). The Court cannot subscribe to those viewpoints for the above-mentioned reasons.",

Indeed, it holds that the judgments delivered by the domestic courts did not provide a satisfactory reply to the question whether freedom of the press could, in the circumstances of the instant case, justify the infringement of the applicants right to respect for their private lives by passages of articles liable to amount to hate speech and a call to violence, and therefore likely to expose the applicants to public condemnation (see Mater v.
