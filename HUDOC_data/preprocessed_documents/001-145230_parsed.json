While the Court has not previously formulated a comprehensive definition of what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute \u201carbitrariness\u201d for the purposes of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the notion of arbitrariness in the context of Article 5 varies to a certain extent depending on the type of detention involved. One general principle established in the case-law is that detention will be \u201carbitrary\u201d where, despite complying with the letter of national law, there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see Mooren v.

Notwithstanding that court order, the applicant was not released. Instead, an investigator from another police department arrested him on suspicion of involvement in another car theft and, relying on basically the same grounds as his counterpart had previously done, asked another court to remand the applicant in custody. On 1\u00a0April 2008 the Dedovichi District Court authorised his pre-trial detention. The cases concerning the two car thefts were joined in July 2008.",

The fact that a person is charged with conspiracy to commit an offence is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of such detention; his personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account (see Sizov v.

In such circumstances the Court has difficulty accepting the argument that there was a risk of interference with the administration of justice. Furthermore, such a risk was bound to gradually decrease as the witnesses were interviewed and the trial proceeded (compare Miszkurka v. Poland, no.\u00a039437/03, \u00a7 51, 4 May 2006). The Court is not therefore persuaded that, throughout the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention, compelling reasons existed for fearing that he might interfere with witnesses or otherwise hamper the examination of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh the applicant\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",
