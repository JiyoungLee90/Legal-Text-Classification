The application was made in connection with a civil case where the appellate court had initially rejected an amended claim by the claimant proposing payment of a higher amount of compensation than that offered in the initial claim (rejected by the first-instance court), based on a finding that changing the amount of the proposed compensation would amount to changing the subject matter of the claim at the appellate stage of the proceedings, which was prohibited by the rules of civil procedure. This led the claimant to initiate a separate set of proceedings, in which he offered a higher amount of compensation in exchange for the termination of the right of use. When those proceedings also reached the appellate stage, the Baku Court of Appeal decided to refer the matter to the Constitutional Court for interpretation. In its application, the Court of Appeal noted that \u201cthere existed no unified approach in the court practice as to whether the amount of compensation referred to in Article 228.2 of the Civil Code constituted part of the subject matter of the claim\u201d and that that situation \u201ccreated difficulties in examining such cases within a reasonable time and caused a breach of the principle of legal certainty\u201d.",

In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. While Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see Schenk v.\u00a0Switzerland, 12 July 1988, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, Series A no. 140, and Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.\u00a0Spain [GC], no.\u00a030544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999I).

Without requiring a detailed answer to every argument advanced by the complainant, this obligation to give reasons presupposes that parties to judicial proceedings can expect to receive a specific and explicit reply to the arguments which are decisive for the outcome of those proceedings (see Moreira Ferreira (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 84; Cihangir Y\u0131ld\u0131z v.

Indeed, as confirmed by the Government\u2019s submissions, the amount of compensation in cases concerning the termination of the right of use was to be determined by the domestic courts on a case-by-case basis, having due regard to the specificities of each case and to the principle of social justice, taking into account a number of relevant case-specific factors (see paragraph 32 above). The Court notes that this approach has also been expressly reiterated by the Constitutional Court, particularly in its decision of 12 July 2016, where it held that the amount of compensation did not form part of the subject matter of the claim (the subject matter simply being the request to terminate the right of use) and noted that the domestic courts were to determine that amount in each individual case even when no specific amounts had been indicated in the claim itself (see paragraph 25 above).",

Neither does the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law clarify this matter. Given that the amount of compensation did not itself form part of the subject matter of the claim, it has not been made clear to the Court to what extent the burden to prove the reasonableness of the compensation offered lay with the claimant and to what extent the domestic courts examining claims of this type could use their power to seek additional evidence or expert opinions of their own initiative, under, for example, Articles 77.3 or 97.1 of the CCP (see paragraph 21 above). However, in any event, given that the duty of the courts assessing an adequate amount of compensation was to ensure that a fair balance was struck between the owner\u2019s property right and the housing right of the person whose \u201cright of use\u201d of the owner\u2019s residential space was to be terminated (see the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision in the Agalarov case in paragraph 23 above), any relevant arguments advanced by the parties regarding the amount of the compensation and any supporting evidence submitted by them would potentially be decisive for the outcome of the case.

However, in the Court\u2019s view, the above principle does not hold true in the present case where, as mentioned above, the lower court did not provide adequate reasons for its decision. The Court also notes, in this connection, that in the present case the Baku Court of Appeal did have the competence to fully review the merits of the case on points of both fact and law.",

It is true that the Baku Court of Appeal mentioned that, in dismissing the appeal, it had had regard to three factors: (i) that the flat had originally been allocated on the basis of the size of the family; (ii) that the parties had resided in the flat from the time when it had been allocated; and (iii) that the applicant\u2019s former family members had no other accommodation (see paragraph 14 above).

In such circumstances, it is impossible to ascertain whether the courts considered the applicant\u2019s argument as to the length of time but failed to mention their reasons for finding it inadequate or irrelevant, or whether they simply neglected to consider this issue at all in their assessment. As the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision in the Agalarov case did not specify the exact period of time which was to be covered by the compensation and left that matter to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, the courts in the present case were also required to respond to this submission by the applicant.",

The Supreme Court reasoned that, because the applicant\u2019s former family members had had a right to use the flat before it was privatised, the termination of that right was possible only with their agreement (see paragraph 17 above). This reasoning does not appear to be in line with the second sentence of Article 228.2 of the Civil Code, based on which the claim was decided, which provided for the termination of the right of use by way of a court decision, specifically in situations where there was no agreement between the holders of that right and the owner of the residential space. That provision did not provide for any exceptions that depended on when the rights of ownership and of use arose relative to each other. The Supreme Court neither held that Article 228.2 of the Civil Code was inapplicable nor provided any legal basis for the additional reasoning that contradicted the provisions of that Article.",
