Although the Court of Cassation mentioned in its reasoning Article\u00a088 \u00a7\u00a05 as clarified by Article\u00a01 \u00a7\u00a06 of Law 1711/1987, it did that in order to draw an additional argument for the way it had already interpreted Article\u00a086 \u00a7\u00a06 (a) in an earlier part of its reasoning. The Court of Cassation\u2019s understanding of Article\u00a086 \u00a7\u00a06 (a) was supported by numerous other court decisions, which the Court of Cassation would have followed any way. In any event, there is no indication that Law no.\u00a01711/1987 was enacted in order to prejudice the applicants\u2019 chances of winning their case before the Court of Cassation. Article\u00a01 \u00a7\u00a06 of the law was of a general nature and the intention of Parliament was to resolve the dispute that had arisen concerning the notion of \u201ctransfer\u201d in Article\u00a088 \u00a7\u00a05. Therefore, Article\u00a01 \u00a7\u00a06 pursued a public interest aim, i.e. the certainty of the law (\u03b1\u03c3\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5).

The wording itself of Article\u00a086 \u00a7\u00a06 (a), which refers to a transfer by the owner, excludes the interpretation adopted by the Court of Cassation. In any event, even if the Court of Cassation only drew an additional argument from Article\u00a088 \u00a7\u00a05, this suffices to establish a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention because it shows that the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision was influenced by Law no.\u00a01711/1987. The case-law prior to the acquisition of the ship by the applicants did not support in any way the Court of Cassation\u2019s understanding of the relevant provisions. The applicants had the right to rely on that case-law. In the applicants\u2019 view, Article\u00a01 \u00a7\u00a06 of Law no.\u00a01711/1987 was not a genuinely interpretative provision as shown by its \u00a7\u00a013. This law was enacted in order to prejudice their chances of success in the litigation opposing them to NAT, a public body. This is shown by the fact that NAT appealed in cassation only after the law in question had been enacted, two years after the decision of the Court of Appeal. It was not at all certain that the Court of Cassation would have pronounced in favour of NAT. The applicants lastly stress that Article\u00a01 \u00a7\u00a06 of Law no.\u00a01711/1987 is the only provision in Greek law that obliges a successful bidder to pay more than he bids at the auction.",
