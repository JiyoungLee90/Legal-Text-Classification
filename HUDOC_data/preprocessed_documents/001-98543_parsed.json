In other words, when a State decides to compensate the past wrongs for which it bore no responsibility, it enjoys a significant discretion (grand pouvoir d'appreciation) in determining the beneficiaries and the modalities of any compensation scheme and, in principle, no challenge to the eligibility conditions as such may be allowed (see Maltzan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077; Epstein and Others v.\u00a0Belgium (dec.), no.\u00a09717/05, ECHR 2008...

It is clear that the Polish State has no obligations of any kind to redress the wrongs inflicted by another State as its citizens were victims of the exactions and persecution committed by the German occupying authorities and not perpetrators (see Wo\u015b v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), cited above, \u00a7\u00a085).",

Thus, the Polish Foundation and, a fortiori, the Polish State cannot bear responsibility in cases where an applicant, due to the scope of the substantive eligibility conditions as such, was not included in the group of persons entitled to certain benefits. The Court emphasises that the Polish Foundation exercised only a certain measure of discretion when assessing the facts of individual cases and the evidence submitted by the claimants. Its assessment of those elements was decisive for the outcome of the proceedings before the Foundation. The Court considers that the responsibility of the  may be engaged exclusively as regards those cases where the dispute concerns the application of the eligibility conditions to the facts of individual cases in the area falling within the Foundation's margin of discretion.

Hence, the thrust of this part of the application is directed against the Polish Foundation's erroneous assessment of the facts underlying her claim and the resultant flawed application of the eligibility conditions to her case (compare and contrast Jakowicz v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), cited above, \u00a7\u00a080). In the case of Jakowicz the Foundation dismissed the applicant's claims, which went beyond the scope of the substantive eligibility conditions and as such were outside the Foundation's remit. By contrast, in the present case the Foundation refused the applicant's claims while exercising its discretion as to the assessment of relevant facts which had a direct bearing on the determination of her eligibility status. Thus, this part of the application can be distinguished from the Jakowicz case on the ground that it concerned a dispute as to the assessment of relevant facts and not a mere challenge to the substantive eligibility conditions.

The Polish Foundation's statutes were subsequently amended with a view to implementing the provisions of the GFA and the Agreement of 16\u00a0February\u00a02001. Thus, the Foundation's regulations stipulated the conditions which had to be fulfilled by a person seeking benefits. It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court in its Resolution of 27\u00a0June 2007 found that the basis of the rights of a person seeking payment from the Polish Foundation were the Foundation's statutes, the rules of the Verification Commission and the relevant provisions of the GFA. The Court is mindful of the particular character of the legal regime governing the second compensation scheme which defined the categories of eligible claimants. Nevertheless, it finds that the Polish Foundation's regulations could be considered to create a right for a claimant arguably fulfilling the relevant eligibility conditions to claim compensation from the Foundation (see,\u00a0mutatis mutandis, Wo\u015b v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), cited above, \u00a7\u00a083).",

The claimants in that case had been prisoners in the Auschwitz concentration camp and had been subjected to forced labour for a company.

It recognised that there had been interference with the claimants' property rights, but considered that the provision as a whole was constitutionally permissible. In taking that view, the Federal Constitutional Court took into account the purpose of the Act, which was to provide rapid compensation to as many forced labourers as possible and, at the same time, to establish legal security for German companies. It held that the interference with the property rights of the forced labourers could be justified, having regard to the overall scope of the provision in question.

In the present case, as regards structural guarantees, the Court notes that the members of the Verification Commission and the Appeal Commission were appointed and dismissed by the Foundation's management board and, in respect of the latter, in consultation with the Foundation's supervisory board. The Foundation's statutes also specified that the rules governing the operation of the Foundation's adjudicating bodies were to be set out in the regulations drafted by the management board and adopted by the supervisory board. The Foundation's governing bodies were in turn appointed and dismissed by the Government Minister at his or her full discretion. Furthermore, a degree of control and supervision over the Foundation was exercised by the Government Minister. Furthermore, it appears that the members of the Verification Commission and the Appeal Commission did not have tenure. Thus, the Court considers that the independence of the Foundation's adjudicating bodies, despite the Government's arguments to the contrary in respect of the Appeal Commission, was open to serious doubt. As regards procedural guarantees, it appears that the adjudicating commissions had no clear and publiclyavailable rules of procedure (see H. v.\u00a0, 30\u00a0November 1987, \u00a7\u00a053, Series A no.\u00a0127B) and did not hold public hearings. For these reasons, they cannot be regarded as tribunals within the meaning of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1.",

However, the Court notes that until June 2007 the domestic courts' prevailing position, as confirmed in the Supreme Court's Resolution of 27 June 2007, was that judicial review by either administrative or civil courts in respect of the Foundation's decisions was excluded (see paragraphs 1721 above). The Government, in their submissions, actually confirmed that the applicant could not submit any appeal against the Appeal Commission's decision to any Polish court.",

In other words, she attempted to challenge the substantive regulations which defined the scope of the beneficiaries of the second compensation scheme. As such, her claim was not satisfied by the Polish Foundation, and could not have been, since the Foundation had no discretion as to the substantive aspects of that scheme.
