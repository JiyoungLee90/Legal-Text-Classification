It found no good reason for regarding Asinara as an unsuitable locality for compulsory residence. It emphasised that the contested measure was designed to separate the individual from his milieu and render his contacts with it more difficult. This requirement took precedence over other problems, such as the absence of regular employment and of adequate accommodation for a family; moreover, at the time of his marriage the applicant could not have hoped to live with his wife and son since he was then in detention on remand and under a serious charge. His criminal record, the most disquieting criminal activities in which he engaged under the cloak of honesty, his violent character and his exceptional cunning showed that he presented a marked danger to society (spiccata pericolosit\u00e0 sociale).

The Government objected to the Commission having on its own initiative taken into consideration Article 5 (art. 5) \u2013 and Article 6 (art. 6) - as from May 1976 (see paragraph 54 above). Their argument ran as follows. In order to bring a case before the Commission, a \"person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals\" must claim to be the victim \"of a violation ... of the rights set forth in [the] Convention\". By these words, Article 25 (art. 25) identified both the persons empowered to lodge an application and the object of the proceedings instituted before the Commission and then, if appropriate, before the Court, namely a finding that the breach alleged by the applicant did occur. However, Mr. Guzzardi initially invoked only Articles 3, 8 and 9 (art. 3, art. 8, art. 9) of the Convention and Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2) (see paragraph 53 above). Whilst the characterisation in law to be given to a contested measure was a matter for the trial judge, the Commission had overlooked another general principle, that is to say the obligation to limit the decision to facts adduced by the litigant. In order to find a violation of Article 5 (art. 5), the Commission had relied on circumstances which Mr. Catalano had mentioned neither in his first letter, dated 17 November 1975, nor in the application form and explanatory memorandum of 30 January 1976, those circumstances being the restriction to 2.5 sq. km. of the area reserved for persons in compulsory residence, the almost permanent supervision, the impossibility of making social contacts and the length of the compulsory residence. In the Government\u2019s submission, the Commission had thereby erred outside its jurisdiction.",

For the Government, these expressions were merely \"hyperboles and metaphors\" employed in a context alien to Article 5 (art. 5) (see page 18 of the memorial of 8 February 1978), but the Court considers, as did the Commission, that they amounted to a complaint of a failure to observe the right guaranteed by Article 5 (art. 5).",

He had in no way claimed to be deprived, in practice, of his liberty at Cala Reale; the Commission had erred in affirming the contrary when it ruled on the admissibility of his complaints. Furthermore, the procedure laid down by section 4 of the 1956 Act was concerned solely with the lawfulness of the compulsory residence order, whereas the settling of the arrangements for implementing the order was a matter for discretionary administrative decisions and hence fell outside the jurisdiction of the courts. This was so, for example, as regards the designation of the district where the person was to reside: the court merely \"took formal notice\" of the place \"specified\" by the administrative authority and, subject where necessary to a review of lawfulness, \"recorded\" the latter\u2019s choice.

He did not, it is true, rely expressly on Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention; he confined himself to mentioning the Convention as a whole in the general context of the living conditions at Cala Reale. However, a more specific reference was not essential in the circumstances since it did not constitute the sole means of achieving the aim pursued. Before the Italian courts, the applicant adduced arguments such as to show that the manner in which the 1956 Act had been applied to him resulted in the measures restricting an individual\u2019s liberty authorised by that Act being transformed into a veritable deprivation of liberty suffered in a locality which he went so far as to describe as a concentration camp in which he was imprisoned. He therefore derived from the Italian legislation pleas equivalent, in the Court\u2019s view, to an allegation of a breach of the right guaranteed by Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention (see paragraph 71 above). In so doing, he provided the national courts, in particular the Court of Appeal, with the opportunity which is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States by Article 26 (art. 26), namely the opportunity of putting right the violations alleged against them (see the De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 29, par. 50; the Airey judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p. 10, par. 18). If his appeal to the Court of Cassation proved unsuccessful, on account of the impossibility of emphasising the issue of deprivation of liberty with the degree of precision called for, this was probably due to the limits on the powers of that Court: having jurisdiction on issues of law, it could scarcely take cognisance as an issue of fact of the situation obtaining on Asinara nor find in the decision of the Court of Appeal any material on which it could determine whether there existed a condition of detention incompatible with Italian law, of which the Convention forms an integral part.",

They further criticised him for not having challenged on appeal and then, if need be, in cassation the decision given by the Regional Court on 20 January 1976 (ibid.) This latter criticism, which was subsequently abandoned, was supplemented by another in a memorial which, being dated 21 February 1977, preceded the closure of the initial examination of admissibility (1 March 1977): the Government claimed, as they subsequently did before the Court, that the request in question was addressed to an authority lacking jurisdiction.

Both applications were dealt with on 20 January 1976, in a single decision. The Regional Court first of all declared, in contrast to an Order by the Milan Court of Appeal (dated 27 October 1975), that the implementation of preventive measures was the responsibility of the police and not of the judge supervising the execution of sentences. It did not, however, confine itself to this remark and did not decline its own jurisdiction in the matter: exigencies of the protection of society, it added, justified the special form of isolation undergone by persons residing at Cala Reale. It was apparently for this reason of substance that the Regional Court dismissed the applications (respin[s]e le istanze), whilst letting it be understood that the applicant\u2019s living conditions should be improved and directing that a copy of its decision be communicated to the Minister of the Interior and to the Sassari questore (see paragraph 20 above).",

The factors listed above were not sufficient to render the situation of persons in compulsory residence on the island comparable to the situation of prisoners as laid down by Italian law; there existed a whole series of fundamental differences that the Commission had wrongly overlooked. The distinguishing characteristic of freedom was less the amount of space available than the manner in which it could be utilised; a good many districts in  and elsewhere were less than 2.5 sq. km. in area. The applicant was able to leave and return to his dwelling as he wished between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. His wife and son lived with him for fourteen of the some sixteen months he spent on Asinara; the inviolability of his home and of the intimacy of his family life, two rights that the Convention guaranteed solely to free people, were respected. Even as regards his social relations, he was treated much more favourably than someone in penal detention: he was at liberty to meet, within the boundaries of Cala Reale, the members of the small community of free people - about two hundred individuals - living on the island, notably at Cala d\u2019Oliva; to go to Sardinia or the mainland if so authorised; to correspond by letter or telegram without any control; to use the telephone, subject to notifying the carabiniere of the name and number of his correspondent. The supervision of which he complained constituted the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the measure ordered in his respect.

He lived there principally in the company of other persons subjected to the same measure and of policemen. The permanent population of Asinara resided almost entirely at Cala d\u2019Oliva, which Mr. Guzzardi could not visit, and would appear to have made hardly any use of its right to go to Cala Reale. Consequently, there were few opportunities for social contacts available to the applicant other than with his near family, his fellow \"residents\" and the supervisory staff. Supervision was carried out strictly and on an almost constant basis. Thus, Mr. Guzzardi was not able to leave his dwelling between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. without giving prior notification to the authorities in due time. He had to report to the authorities twice a day and inform them of the name and number of his correspondent whenever he wished to use the telephone. He needed the consent of the authorities for each of his trips to Sardinia or the mainland, trips which were rare and, understandably, made under the strict supervision of the carabinieri. He was liable to punishment by \"arrest\" if he failed to comply with any of his obligations. Finally, more than sixteen months elapsed between his arrival at Cala Reale and his departure for Force (see paragraphs 11, 12, 21, 23-42 and 51 above).",

The administrative authorities also had some misgivings for they investigated the possibility of taking remedial measures; since they did not pursue the matter in the face of the expense involved and the time needed, the Ministry of the Interior decided in August 1977 to strike Asinara out of the list of places for compulsory residence (see paragraphs 20 and 43 above). Two telegrams from the Ministry to the Milan Chief of Police, dated 19 and 23 August 1977 and concerning one Alberti Gerlando, establish that this decision was not unconnected with application no 7367/76 even though Mr. Guzzardi had already left Cala Reale; the Government appended these telegrams to their memorial of May 1980.

In paragraph 1 of section 1, the 1956 Act refers to \"idlers and habitual vagrants who are fit for work\", a phrase clarified by the  in its judgment no. 23 of 23 March 1964. In the Government\u2019s opinion, the imposition on a \"vagrant\" of preventive measures restricting, or even depriving him of, his liberty was justified, under the Convention and Italian law, not so much by his lack of a fixed abode as by the absence of any apparent occupational activity (\"attivit\u00e0 lavorativa palese\") and, hence, the impossibility of identifying the source of his means of subsistence. The existence of this danger factor, the Government continued, was recognised by the  in its decision of 30 January 1975 (see paragraph 12 above); in addition and above all, that Court took notice of the far more serious risk stemming from the applicant\u2019s links with mafia associations which engaged in kidnapping with a view to extracting ransoms. According to the Government, provision could not be made in an international instrument for the typically Italian phenomenon of the mafia, yet it would be an absurd conclusion to regard Article 5 par. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e) as allowing vagrants but not presumed mafiosi to be deprived of their liberty.",

What is more, they in no way described or depicted Mr. Guzzardi as a vagrant. Admittedly, they noted, in passing, that there were serious doubts as to whether he really worked as a mason as he claimed, but they laid much greater stress on his record, his illegal activities, his contacts with habitual criminals and still more his links with the mafia. The Chief of Police even said that no state of poverty, idleness or vagrancy furnished an explanation for this criminal conduct (\"manifestazioni criminose che non hanno una causa giustificativa in uno stato di indigenza ovvero di ozio o di vagabondaggio\").",

Although they denied it, the Government were in essence reasoning a fortiori; at the hearing of 9 February 1978 before the Commission, their Agent described Mr. Guzzardi as \"a vagrant in the wide sense of the term\", \"a monied vagrant\" (see p. 61 of the verbatim record: \"vagabondo nel senso largo dell\u2019espressione\"; \"vagabondo ricco\").

However, in that case as well a question would arise as to the measure\u2019s \"lawfulness\" since, solely on the basis of the 1956 and 1965 Acts, an order for compulsory residence as such, leaving aside the manner of its implementation, does not constitute deprivation of liberty (see paragraph 94 above). It would also be necessary to consider whether the requirements of paragraph 3 of Article 5 (art. 5-3) had been observed (see the Lawless judgment of 1 July 1961, Series A no. 3, pp. 51-53, par. 13-14). In any event, the phrase under examination is not adapted to a policy of general prevention directed against an individual or a category of individuals who, like mafiosi, present a danger on account of their continuing propensity to crime; it does no more than afford the Contracting States a means of preventing a concrete and specific offence.

Within the framework so traced, the Court may take cognisance of all questions of fact or of law arising in the course of the proceedings instituted before it; the only matter falling outside its jurisdiction is the examination of complaints held by the Commission to be inadmissible, in the present instance the complaint formulated by Mr. Guzzardi at the outset under Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2) (see the above-mentioned Winterwerp judgment, pp. 27-28, par. 71-72; the above-mentioned Schiesser judgment, p. 17, par. 41; paragraphs 53 and 55 above).",

If, therefore, the applicant was not deprived of his liberty as such - i.e. stricto sensu - but only restricted in his freedom of movement and choice of residence, there can have been no breach of the Convention, - and what might, otherwise, have involved a breach of Protocol No. 4 (P4) cannot do so because this Protocol (P4) is not binding upon Italy.",

Certainly before the Italian courts, the applicant does not appear to have challenged the legality of his preventive detention as such, but merely to have complained of the conditions of his banishment on Asinara - (that the area within which he had to stay was too small, that there was no available work for him to do, that he could not have his family with him, that he could not attend a place of religious worship, etc., etc.). In the proceedings before the European Commission of Human Rights (to which the case of course went in the first place), it seems uncertain whether the applicant took his complaint much further, or whether he ever definitely invoked Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention or alleged any breach of it as such. Certainly his original complaints were exclusively based on Articles 3, 8 and 9 (art. 3, art. 8, art. 9) - (inhuman or degrading treatment, absence of respect for private and family life, and absence of freedom to manifest his religion in worship, etc.). There seem to be some grounds for thinking that it was largely the Commission, acting proprio motu, which decided that his complaint came under or involved Article 5 (art. 5) (deprivation of liberty), and which proceeded accordingly. This is significant because, since the Commission was unable to find any contravention of Articles 3, 8 and 9, (art. 3, art. 8, art. 9), Article 5 (art. 5) was left as the only one under which a breach of the Convention could be held to have occurred.",

The ultra petita (or as it is sometimes called, the ex, or extra, petita) rule precludes that an international tribunal or equivalent body should deal with matters that are not the subject of the complaint brought before it, and still more that it should give a decision on those matters against the defendant party in the case. If it does this, proprio motu, it is acting ultra vires. It would be perfectly proper for the Commission, if satisfied that a certain complaint has both definitely been made and was justified, to hold that a breach of a given Article of the Convention was involved, even though the complainant, while making the complaint, did not invoke that particular Article or allege a breach of it. It would be quite another thing, however, for an international tribunal or equivalent body to hold a sort of roving commission over the facts of a case in order to see whether, if established, some of them could be regarded as entailing an illegality or breach of treaty, - and then in due course to find that they could and did, although they were not matters (or not the actual matters) of which the plaintiff had complained or alleged any illegality or breach. This would be tantamount to saying to the plaintiff \"We do not think you have a good case in regard to the particular matters you have complained of, but we perceive other matters (or aspects of the case) which you did not complain of, but of which in our view you justifiably could have complained, and so we shall be happy to find in your favour in those respects.\" Of course it would never be put so crudely, but it might well in practice amount to that, however carefully wrapped up.

Assuming for the purposes of the argument that there was what amounted to, or implied, a complaint of deprivation of liberty, the question then is whether what occurred was truly of that kind, or was essentially in the nature of a restriction on freedom of movement and choice of residence. Some of the arguments for and against are summarized in paragraphs 90 and 91 of the judgment, and although there is much more to be said, I see no point in embarking on an elaborate analysis of what must in the long run remain a matter of appreciation and opinion, - namely whether the condition of the applicant\u2019s existence on Asinara were sufficiently stringent to amount to a sort of imprisonment, even though a mild one as imprisonments go, or whether, on the other hand, there was no more than a banishment accompanied by measures of confinement to house and grounds but, subject to that, without any restriction on movement within an area of at least a half-mile radius, or more according to some accounts. This could be argued about endlessly and either view is reasonably maintainable - for the issue is essentially one of degree. What, to me, decisively tilts the balance is the fact of Article 2 \u00a7 1 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2-1) to the Convention (see paragraph 2 above) \u2013 to which paragraph 92 of the Court\u2019s judgment refers, but only ephemerally and without bringing out the real point.",

The resulting picture is that Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention guaranteed the individual against illegitimate imprisonment, or confinement so close as to amount to the same thing - in sum against deprivation of liberty stricto sensu - but it afforded no guarantee against restrictions (on movement or place of residence) falling short of that.

It is of course obvious that all deprivation of liberty, especially if it takes the form of actual imprisonment or other close confinement, must imply restricting freedom of movement and choice of residence. It is inherently in its character to do so. But the reverse is not true. Mere exile or banishment, for instance, does not in itself involve deprivation of liberty, - or at any rate it is something that, per se, falls clearly on that side of the line which is occupied by the concept of restriction on movement and place of residence. Equally clearly, such restriction may be accompanied by conditions that turn it into a deprivation of liberty, as the Court has found to be the fact in the present case. Between the one concept and the other there may be many different degrees of circumstances and situation, so that it is always a question of where to draw the line which, as mentioned earlier, must in the last resort be a question of personal appreciation. Deducing, as I have done, from the existence of Article 2 of the Protocol (P4-2) that the concept of deprivation of liberty under Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention must be interpreted fairly strictly, I come to the conclusion that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s residence on Asinara do not bring his case within that concept, or at any rate that the Italian Government must be given the benefit of any doubt that may exist, as exist it does.",

To me all this has very much more the flavour of Article 2 of the Protocol (P4-2) than of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention, even if a residue of doubt may remain, - but in that event, is it right to condemn a Government for breach of the Convention in the presence of a very reasonable doubt as to whether any has occurred?",

The irony is that, had the authorities dealt with him in that way, no contravention of the Convention would have been involved because the matter would have been covered by one of the sub-paragraphs to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (art. 5-1) to which reference has been made in footnote 4 above. The Italian Government is therefore being condemned by the judgment of the Court for treating the applicant in a much more lenient way than the altogether harsher one they could legitimately have adopted without any infraction of the Convention. There is a manifest injustice here that could easily have been avoided. This situation also constitutes one of the many absurdities of the case - (and see further paragraph 12 below).",

The case is therefore evidently one of obligatory residence in a certain place, accompanied by restrictions on any movement outside the general area of that place. The Court could easily have so held, and the judgment does not, in my opinion, furnish any convincing explanation of why it did not do so. But until the Court modifies the general trend of its present policy in the interpretation of the Convention, this sort of thing will doubtless continue, - and one of the consequences will be that, provided they keep within the letter of the Convention, governments will have no particular inducement to conform to its spirit - since, as this case shows, doing so can be penalized as much as not so doing.",

But where there are grounds for genuine doubt whether any contravention has in fact occurred, such factors, though in no way conclusive per se, may legitimately be taken into account (I do not put it any higher than that) in deciding how to set about resolving the doubt - again I put it no higher. In the present case, however, the Court completely ignored the plea of the Italian Government to the effect that public order in Italy at this time was seriously menaced by threats coming essentially from political terrorism and the mafia, and that the authorities were under strong pressure to combat these evils by draconian measures - pressure which they had so far resisted, as was exemplified in the case of Guzzardi by the relative leniency of his original treatment as described in paragraph 8 above.

The process of simply ignoring the whole context in which a case occurs is bound to lead to injustices and absurdities, one instance of which was given supra in paragraph 9. The present case in fact bristles with absurdities. Another instance of this is that, as pointed out by the Italian Government, whereas by reason of sub-paragraph (e) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (art. 5-1-e) of the Convention, a vagrant can, merely by reason of his being such, be placed under detention without any contravention of the Convention, a known terrorist cannot even have his movements restricted under the conditions applied to Guzzardi without such a breach resulting \u2013 if the judgment of the Court is correct. To be sure, modern terrorism was an evil not specifically present to the minds of those who drafted the Convention, or they would doubtless have provided for it. Again, it is admittedly for governments and none other to remedy this defect: the Court cannot do so by deeming a terrorist to be a vagrant even though he is in fact much worse than a vagrant (who may well be a harmless individual, which a terrorist never is). But this does not alter the fact that, according to the order of things resulting from the Court\u2019s judgment, a terrorist may be much better off than a vagrant. (He may even be paid a million lire!). All these absurdities could have been avoided by an attitude of greater realism against the background of the case, leading to the conclusion \u2013 for which there was ample warrant on the facts - that the case was basically one of restriction on movement and place of residence and not one of deprivation of liberty under Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention, interpreted, as it has to be, in the light of the existence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2).",

This outcome is, I think, compounded by the monetary award made to the applicant, which carries matters into that region of the absurd to which the English expression of \"cloud-cuckoo land\" applies.

The judgment applies to the proceedings on appeal and in cassation, in other words to the domestic proceedings, the principle that the rule of exhaustion must be interpreted \"with a certain degree of flexibility and without excessive regard for matters of form\" (\u00a7 72). This principle is certainly correct if one applies it to the international rule itself when one is in the process of determining its scope. On the other hand, to apply it to domestic law in order to determine and interpret the conditions laid down there under in the matter of remedies amounts to endowing the international court with jurisdiction to interpret that law and, in the final analysis, to base itself on a domestic law that does not exist. Reference back to domestic law by the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies can only mean a reference back to that law as interpreted by domestic case-law [see, on this point, Jacobs, The European Convention on Human Rights, , 1975, p. 240]. I thus conclude that there was no call to enquire whether \"in the Court\u2019s view\" the pleas advanced by the applicant on appeal and in cassation were equivalent to an allegation of a breach of the right to individual liberty. What should have been done, in my view, was to determine whether, in the light of Italian legislation and case-law, Mr. Guzzardi had exercised such remedies and adduced such arguments as were capable of leading to the reversal of the decision he was challenging. I would add that the case-law of the Court and the Commission relied on by the judgment in support of its extensive interpretation definitely does not corroborate that interpretation; indeed, in each of the cases mentioned the principle that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies should be flexibly interpreted concerns the scope of the international obligation and not the interpretation of domestic law.",

Of course, I have no difficulty in accepting that the restrictions on liberty of movement to which Mr. Guzzardi was subjected were particularly severe. However, I do not detect in those restrictions the features which would make it possible to speak of \"deprivation\" of liberty. Mr. Guzzardi was not confined within the perimeter of a prison and his living conditions - albeit far from agreeable - were in striking contrast with those that obtain in prison: thus, he could spend his time as he chose, he was not obliged to work, and, for the greater part of his stay on Asinara, he was able to live together with his wife and his son - and even for a while with his parents-in-law. One could add to this list. I am therefore inclined to the view that the compulsory residence order imposed on Mr. Guzzardi did not constitute deprivation of liberty.",

There can be no doubt that these purposes are consonant with the aims recognised as legitimate by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c); this is especially true of the second reason mentioned in that provision: \"when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence\". The judgment rejects this possibility on the ground that the sub-paragraph (art. 5-1-c), which speaks of \"an\" offence, is not adapted to a \"policy of general prevention directed against an individual or a category of individuals who, like mafiosi, present a danger on account of their continuing propensity to crime\" (\u00a7 102). This narrow interpretation is not without paradoxical results: it means that one is entitled to imprison persons presumed to have committed the occasional crime but that one is forbidden to imprison persons belonging to criminal associations, whose particularly dangerous character resides precisely in the fact that it is extremely difficult to obtain evidence of their criminal activities which is sufficient in law and who can be prevented only by certain restrictive measures from pursuing those activities. The wording of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) probably denotes that this problem was not fully thought through; it does not, however, prevent a democratic State from taking the requisite protective measures when organised crime threatens to destroy its legal institutions. The very terminology employed in the sub-paragraph (art. 5-1-c), which clearly refers to activities that are manifestly criminal and not to activities covered by the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention, renders groundless the fear that a less restrictive interpretation would favour the institution of a police state.",

On the other hand, I do deduce from this principle that certain measures which, from the viewpoint of the Convention, might be seen as open to considerable criticism in a so-called normal situation are less open to criticism and can be considered as being in conformity with the Convention when there is a crisis over-shadowing public order and notably when rights of others, which are also guaranteed by the Convention, are being threatened by the activities of certain dangerous and anti-social elements.

In addition, the bounds that Article 5 (art. 5) requires the Contracting States not to exceed in their judicial, disciplinary and police systems may vary from one situation to another (see the Engel judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 25, \u00a7 59).",

The conditions which constitute, probably under the laws of all the States, the \"classic\" reasons for detention on remand were thus satisfied in Mr. Guzzardi\u2019s case. Besides, it seems that the Italian authorities as well saw his situation in this light: they selected Asinara as the place for compulsory residence because that island was particularly well suited for separating the applicant from his apparently Mafioso milieu (see the Milan Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of 12 March 1975 and the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment of 6 October 1975: paragraphs 17 and 19 of the present judgment); the authorities were extremely cautious about granting authorisations for visits to Sardinia or the mainland since they feared that he might make use of such occasions in order to escape (see paragraph 14 of the present judgment).
