This is particularly true in cases such as the present one, where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 was determined by the prosecution without judicial review of whether the evidence collected supported a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences he was charged with (see Ilijkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7 81, 26 July 2001, and Mamedova, cited above, \u00a7 74).",

Glass partitions were fitted in accordance with the Rules of Internal Order in Remand Prisons and served to prevent any objects from being passed between detainees and visitors and also to protect visitors from spontaneous dangerous acts on the part of detainees, as well as for the reasons of hygiene, to stifle the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.

The collateral effect of this was the refusal of a prison visit to the applicant\u2019s mother. The wording of the decision reveals that consideration of the impact that the refusal of a parental visit would have on the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his family life played no part in the assessment, the investigator\u2019s sole motive being to advance the criminal investigation of which he was in charge.

The regulation of such issues may not amount to the one-size-fits-all approach and the States are expected to develop their proportionality assessment technique, enabling the authorities to balance the competing individual and public interests and to take into account the peculiarities of a case, such as for instance the fact that the detainee is a juvenile (compare Trosin, cited above, \u00a7 42, and Khoroshenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0142).",

His parents were neither witnesses nor co-defendants in the criminal proceedings against him and there were no apparent indications substantiating the risk of collusive action or any other form of obstruction to the process of collecting evidence (compare Moiseyev, cited above, \u00a7 255).
