In order to minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 of the Convention provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and to secure the accountability of the authorities for that measure (see Kurt v.

The difference between deprivation and restriction of liberty is one of degree or intensity, and not of nature or substance (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 22; Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, \u00a7 92-93, Series A no. 39; Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2010; and Austin and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 57).",
