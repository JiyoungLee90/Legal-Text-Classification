The Assize Court pointed out that neither the informers\u2019 statements included in the confidential file created by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office nor those appearing in the file set up by the Witness Protection Board contained, or could contain, evidence for use in a subsequent set of proceedings. That being the case, the Assize Court ruled that the failure to communicate evidence contained in the said files to the defence and the absence of court supervision of the procedure for granting police protection had not influenced the adversarial nature of the proceedings, the rights of the defence or the fairness of the trial.",

Regard must also be had to the applicants\u2019 conduct and to the fact that owing to the \u201claw of silence\u201d which is observed in such criminal circles, it was very difficult indeed to make swift headway at the preliminary and judicial investigation stages. It was not until R.C. and D.S. gave their statements that further evidence against the applicants was discovered and the investigation, which had come to a standstill, began to progress again. The delay thus caused lasted an estimated three years. Once the investigators had obtained cogent new evidence, they completed the investigation within a year and a half. Moreover, the applicants availed themselves of all the remedies at their disposal and had recourse to the option of requesting additional investigative measures, which necessarily extended the overall length of the proceedings. The outcome was an exceptional set of proceedings which had encountered such unusual circumstances as the quashing of the judgment of the Li\u00e8ge Assize Court, which had been delivered barely a month and a half after the judgment of a Chamber of the Court in the case of Taxquet v.\u00a0Belgium (no. 926/05, 13 January 2009).

The final judgment was delivered on 30 March 2011 by the Court of Cassation, which dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law against the applicants\u2019 conviction by the Brussels-Capital Assize Court on 28 September 2010.

The only extension of the length of proceedings which might be attributed to the authorities stemmed from the fact that in order to take account of the aforementioned Taxquet case-law, the first assize decision was set aside and the whole proceedings had to start again from the beginning (see paragraph 38 above).",
