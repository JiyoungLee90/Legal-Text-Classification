The case originated in an application (no. 54578/00) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Dragomir Dimitrov Alexov (“the applicant”) who was born in 1966 and lives in , on 21 October 1999.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr V. Stoyanov, a lawyer practising in Pazardzhik.
The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Kotzeva, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, (a) that he had been detained in inadequate conditions at the Pazardzhik Regional Investigation Service detention facility, the Pazardzhik Prison and the Montana Regional Investigation Service detention facility and that he had no effective remedy in respect thereof, (b) that the authorities had unlawfully searched his apartment on 26 August 1999 and that he had no effective remedy thereof and (c) that his pre-trial detention had been unlawful, of excessive length and unjustified, his appeals had not been examined speedily and that he lacked an enforceable right to seek compensation for being a victim of an arrest or detention in breach of the provisions of Article 5 of the Convention.
By a decision of 22 May 2006 the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
On 17 August 1999 a burglary was committed and, among other items, a television and a video recorder were stolen.
A preliminary investigation was opened against two other suspects on 17 August 1999 and against the applicant on 28 August 1999. On the same day the applicant confessed to having committed five burglaries with his accomplices between 29 January and 20 August 1999.
On 31 August 1999 the applicant was charged with committing burglary on 17 August 1999 with his accomplices.
The applicant gave another four statements to the investigator confessing to the other burglaries and providing additional information on how they had been perpetrated.
On 17 September 1999 the preliminary investigation into the burglary of 17 August 1999 was joined to the preliminary investigations into the other four burglaries.
On 7 October 1999 the charges against the applicant were amended to include the other four burglaries.
The preliminary investigation was concluded on 15 October 1999 and on 21 December 1999 the Pazardzhik district public prosecutor’s office issued an indictment against the applicant and his two accomplices for the five burglaries.
The Pazardzhik District Court conducted eleven hearings in the case, the last of which was held on 30 September 2004.
The Court has not been informed of any subsequent developments in or of the outcome of these proceedings.
On 26 August 1999 the police, with the approval of the public prosecutor’s office, searched the apartment in which the applicant and one of his accomplices had been living. The applicant had been renting the said apartment under a lease dated 2 March 1999.
The search and seizure protocol indicates that the search was conducted in the presence of two witnesses. Various items were seized including three cameras, a hi-fi system, a dining set, gloves and a wrench.
On 28 August 1999, under an order issued by an investigator and approved by the public prosecutor’s office, the applicant was arrested and detained for twenty-four hours beginning at 5 p.m. The grounds for his detention were that he was suspected of having committed the burglary on 17 August 1999 because the stolen television and a wrench that had allegedly been used to perpetrate the offence had been found in his apartment, and he had attempted to abscond.
On 29 August 1999 the public prosecutor’s office extended the applicant’s preliminary detention for another two days until 5 p.m. on 31 August 1999.
The applicant was placed in pre-trial detention as part of the decision of 31 August 1999 to charge him and his accomplices with the burglary on 17 August 1999 (see paragraph 9 above). That decision was issued by an investigator and was confirmed later in the day by the public prosecutor’s office. In ordering the applicant’s pre-trial detention, the investigator referred to his alleged lack of a permanent address, the fact that he had committed a number of other burglaries and, in general terms, the risk that he might abscond, re-offend or obstruct the investigation.
The applicant’s pre-trial detention was confirmed in the decision of 7 October 1999 to amend the charges against him (see paragraph 12 above). That decision was issued by an investigator without any indication that it was subsequently confirmed by the public prosecutor’s office. In ordering the applicant’s pre-trial detention, the investigator referred to the lack of a permanent address, the fact that he had committed a number of other burglaries and, in general terms, his personality, the gravity of the offences and the risk that he might abscond.
The report of 15 October 1999 concluding the preliminary investigation (see paragraph 13 above) indicated that the applicant was in pre-trial detention.
In his submissions to the Court, the applicant stated that he had appealed against the decision to order pre-trial detention on 8 October 1999. In his appeal, he had argued, inter alia, that there was no risk of him obstructing the investigation as it had effectively been completed, that he had made a full confession, that he had a permanent address and that his detention had not been ordered by a court, in violation of the Convention. In his submissions to the Court, the applicant further claimed that, because of a delay in scheduling a hearing for the examination of his appeal, on 18 October 1999 he had filed a complaint to that effect with the Supreme Judicial Council and the Ministry of Justice. This purportedly led to a hearing being scheduled for the very next day, 19 October 1999, to which the applicant was summoned at very short notice, while his counsel had found out about it only by chance and had not had time to prepare for the hearing or to call witnesses.
The Government, on the other hand, presented the Court with a copy of the applicant’s appeal dated by the Pazardzhik District Investigation Service as having been deposited only on 18 October 1999.
On 19 October 1999 the appeal was examined by the District Court, which dismissed it on the grounds, inter alia, of the applicant’s prior criminal record and lack of employment, the gravity of the offences and the fact that he did not appear to have a permanent address, as he had been living in rented apartments in different cities and could not provide the permanent address of his next of kin.
On 5 November 1999 the applicant filed another appeal against his detention and requested that bail be set. He maintained that his continued detention was in violation of the Convention, that he had a permanent address and that there was no risk that he would abscond, obstruct the investigation or re-offend.
A report from the Pazardzhik Prison governor dated 9 November 1999 was presented to the District Court which certified that the applicant had thus far been detained for a period of two months and twelve days calculated from 28 August to 10 November 1999.
The District Court examined the applicant’s appeal on 10 November 1999. At the hearing the applicant presented a copy of his rental agreement and called a witness, who informed the court that he would put the applicant up and pay his bail. Taking this into account, the District Court found in favour of the applicant and ordered his release on bail of 400 Bulgarian levs. The release was to be effected once a recognizance had been provided. In reaching its decision the court referred, inter alia, to the fact that the applicant had been rehabilitated in respect of his previous convictions, that he had an address at which he could be contacted and that there was insufficient evidence that he might abscond, obstruct the investigation or re-offend. As evidenced by a bank receipt, the recognizance was deposited on 22 December 1999.
The indictment of 21 December 1999 (see paragraph 13 above) indicated that the applicant had been in pre-trial detention since 31 August 1999 and that recognizance had still not been provided.
A communiqué from the Pazardzhik Prison governor, dated 27 December 1999, was sent to the District Court to certify that the applicant had been released on 21 December 1999. However, the original text of the communiqué indicated 22 December as the release date which had been changed to 21 December by hand.
The conditions of detention
The applicant said that he had been detained at the Pazardzhik Regional Investigation Service detention facility from 28 August to 31 October 1999 where the cells were small, overcrowded and below street level. There was no natural light or fresh air and a strong, unbearable smell in the cells. Quite often there were rodents and cockroaches. A bucket was provided for sanitary needs. There was no hot water or soap. The applicant was not allowed out of his cell for exercise. The food provided was of insufficient quantity and substandard. The applicant was not allowed to read newspapers or books.
The applicant stated that he was detained at the Pazardzhik Prison for about two months from 1 November 1999 onwards where the conditions were slightly better than in the Pazardzhik Regional Investigation Service detention facility. Similarly, though, the food was insufficient and of the same inferior quality; the cells were small and overcrowded; the light was poor and a bucket was provided for sanitary needs. Limited exercise was provided in the prison yard.
The applicant’s description of the conditions at the above facilities is corroborated by the signed declaration of another detainee, Mr R. Dobrev.
On 18 April 1998 the applicant was arrested in a block of flats in the town of  where a burglary had been committed. He was questioned by the police and released.
At the time, the applicant was living in  and so was able to give the authorities his address in that town. In the summer of 1998 he moved to .
On 11 February 1999 the authorities opened a preliminary investigation against the applicant in relation to the burglary in .
On 15 October 1999 the authorities charged the applicant with the burglary in  and ordered that he be placed in pre-trial detention. The decision was issued by an investigator and confirmed later in the day by the public prosecutor’s office. In ordering the applicant’s pre-trial detention, the investigator referred to his “personality”. As the authorities were unable to find the applicant at his  address, an arrest warrant for his detention was issued on the same day, 15 October 1999.
The preliminary investigation in relation to the burglary in  was suspended on 18 October 1999.
On 23 May 2000 the applicant was arrested in Plovdiv on the basis of the  arrest warrant. He was then transferred to the Montana Regional Investigation Service.
The preliminary investigation in relation to the burglary in  was resumed on 29 May 2000. It is unclear when the applicant was formally charged.
The preliminary investigation was completed on an unspecified date and on 5 June 2000 the investigator in charge forwarded the case file to the public prosecutor’s office with a recommendation for the applicant to be indicted for the burglary in .
On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against his pre-trial detention.
In a decision of 22 June 2000 the  found in favour of the applicant and released him on condition that he did not leave his place of residence without the authorisation of the public prosecutor’s office. The decision became final and the applicant was released on 26 June 2000.
On 11 September 2000 the Montana district public prosecutor’s office discontinued the preliminary investigation against the applicant in respect of the  burglary for lack of evidence. The restriction imposed on the applicant not to leave his place of residence without the authorisation of the public prosecutor’s office was also lifted.
The decision of the public prosecutor’s office was confirmed by the Montana District Court on 21 September 2000.
The applicant was detained at the Montana Regional Investigation Service detention facility from 23 May to 26 June 2000.
He described the cells as overcrowded and lacking natural light and fresh air. The food was of insufficient quantity and substandard. He was not allowed to read newspapers or books or to go out of his cell for exercise.
At the relevant time, Article 191 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1974 (“the CCP”) provided that in the course of an inquiry (that is to say, when there is insufficient evidence to initiate formal criminal proceedings) a search of premises could be conducted only when examining the scene of the crime and if there would be no possibility of collecting and securing evidence if a search was not carried out immediately.
At the relevant time Article 134 of the CCP provided that a search of premises could be carried out if there was probable cause to believe that objects or documents of potential relevance to a case would be found there. Such a search could be ordered by the trial court (during the trial phase) or by the prosecutor (during the pre-trial phase) (Article 135).
Searches were to be conducted in the presence of witnesses and the occupier of the premises or an adult member of his or her family. If the occupier or an adult member of his or her family was unable to be present, the search was to be conducted in the presence of the manager of the property or a representative of the municipality (Article 136).
There was no special procedure through which a search warrant issued by a prosecutor could be challenged. Thus, the only avenue of appeal available was a hierarchical one to a higher ranking prosecutor (Article 182). Such appeals did not have suspensive effect (Article 183).
The relevant provisions of the CCP and the Bulgarian courts’ practice before 1 January 2000 are summarised in the Court’s judgments in several similar cases (see, among others, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, §§ 25-36, ECHR 1999-II, Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, §§ 55-59, 26 July 2001; and Yankov v. Bulgaria, no. 39084/97, §§ 79-88, ECHR 2003-XII (extracts)).
After 1 January 2000 the legal detention regime under the CCP was amended with the aim of ensuring compliance with the Convention (TR 102 Supreme Court of Cassation (“the SCC”)). The amendments and the resulting practice of the Bulgarian courts are summarised in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Dobrev v. Bulgaria (no. 55389/00, §§ 32-35, 10 August 2006) and Yordanov v. Bulgaria (no. 56856/00, §§ 21-24, 10 August 2006).
On the basis of the relevant law before 1 January 2000, when ruling on applications for release of a person charged with a “serious” offence, the domestic courts generally disregarded facts and arguments concerning the existence or absence of a danger of the accused person’s absconding or committing offences and stated that anyone accused of a serious offence was to be remanded in custody unless exceptional circumstances dictated otherwise (see decisions of the domestic authorities criticised by the Court in the cases of Nikolova and Ilijkov, both cited above, and Zaprianov v. Bulgaria, no. 41171/98, 30 September 2004).
As of 1 January 2000 the relevant part of the amended Article 152 provided:
“(1)  Detention pending trial shall be ordered [in cases concerning] offences punishable by imprisonment..., where the material in the case discloses a real danger that the accused may abscond or commit an offence.
(2)  In the following circumstances it shall be considered that [such] a danger exists, unless established otherwise on the basis of the evidence in the case:
in cases of special recidivism or repetition;
where the charges concern a serious offence and the accused has a previous conviction for a serious offence for which he or she received an immediate sentence of not less than one year’s imprisonment;
where the charges concern an offence punishable by not less than ten years’ imprisonment or a heavier punishment.
(3)  Detention shall be replaced by a more lenient measure of control where there is no longer a danger that the accused will abscond or commit an offence.”
Divergent interpretations of the above provisions were observed in the initial period after their entry into force on 1 January 2000.
In June 2002, interpreting the amended provisions on pre-trial detention, the SCC stated that when examining an appeal against pre-trial detention the courts’ task was not only to verify whether the initial decision on remand in custody was lawful but also to establish whether continued detention was still lawful and justified. In such proceedings the courts had to examine all available evidence on all relevant aspects, including, if applicable, the amount of the recognizance (TR 102 SCC).
Article 150 § 5 of the CCP, as in force at the relevant time, provided:
“When the measure for securing [a person’s appearance in court] is changed from a more [restrictive] one to bail, the [person] shall be released following provision of a recognizance.”
The State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act 1988 (the “SMRDA” – renamed in 2006) provided at the relevant time that the State was liable for damage caused to private persons by (a) the illegal orders, acts or omissions of government bodies and officials acting within the scope of, or in connection with, their administrative duties and (b) investigation bodies, the prosecution and the courts for unlawful pretrial detention if a detention order was set aside for lack of lawful grounds (sections 1-2).
In respect of the detention regime and conditions of detention, the relevant domestic law and practice under sections 1 and 2 of the SMRDA were summarised in the cases of Iovchev v. Bulgaria (no. 41211/98, §§ 7680, 2 February 2006) and Hamanov v. Bulgaria (no. 44062/98, §§ 56-60, 8 April 2004).
In respect of the unlawful search of premises, the only reported case is one dating from 2002 in which the Sofia City Court examined, on appeal, an action for damages stemming from an allegedly unlawful search and seizure conducted by the authorities in the claimant’s home. The court quashed the judgment of the lower court and remitted the case solely because the lower court had failed to examine the action under section 1 of the SMRDA, having examined it as a tort action instead. Accordingly, the Sofia City Court instructed the lower court to re-examine the action solely under the SMRDA (реш. от 29 юли 2002 г. по гр. д. № 169/2002 г., СГС, IVб отд.).
The CPT visited  in 1995, 1999, 2002, 2003 and 2006.
The Pazardzhik Prison was visited in 1995 while the Pazardzhik Regional Investigation Service detention facility was visited both in 1995 and 2006. The Montana Regional Investigation Service detention facility has never been visited, but there are general observations about the problems in all investigation service establishments in the 1995, 1999, 2002 and 2006 reports.
A summary of the relevant findings and observations of the CPT, prior to its 2006 visit report, is contained in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Dobrev (cited above, §§ 44-56) and Malechkov v. Bulgaria (no. 57830/00, §§ 38-50, 28 June 2007).
Separately, the CPT in several of its reports has recommended that States apply a minimum standard of 4 sq m per detainee in multipleoccupancy cells (see, for example, the CPT reports on the 2002 visit to Bulgaria, CPT/Inf (2004) 21, paragraphs 82 and 87, on the 2004 visit to Poland, CPT/Inf (2006) 11, paragraphs 87 and 111, and the 2006 visit to Bulgaria, CPT/Inf (2008) 11, paragraphs 55, 77 and 90).
The CPT found that this facility was operating below its official capacity of forty-two places (e.g. there were 13 detainees at the time of the visit) and that there was no overcrowding in the cells (e.g. three persons in a cell measuring some 12 sq m). In addition to beds, the cells were fitted with a table, chairs and shelves. However, the cells were located in the basement and had limited access to natural light; further, artificial lighting was dim and ventilation left something to be desired.
As to the regime of available activities, the CPT found that at the time of its visit detainees were being allowed to stroll around an empty room without access to natural light. Inside their cells, in addition to books and newspapers, detainees were in principle allowed to have batteryoperated radio and TV sets, but few such were witnessed.
Certain improvements were found in respect to detainee’s access to sanitary facilities but none in respect to hygiene. Food meanwhile was provided three times a day, but there were some complaints about its quantity and/or quality.
