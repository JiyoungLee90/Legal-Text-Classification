Turkey, judgment of 16\u00a0September 1996, Reports 1996-IV judgment, p. 1219, \u00a7\u00a0105; Kurt v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p.\u00a01192, \u00a7 159).\u00a0The Court considers that it is particularly important to respect the confidentiality of mail from the Convention organs to persons who are detained since it may concern allegations against the prison authorities or prison officials. The opening of letters from the Convention organs undoubtedly gives rise to the possibility that they will be read and may also conceivably, on occasions, create the risk of reprisals by the prison staff against the prisoner concerned (Campbell v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 March 1992, Series A no. 233, \u00a7\u00a062).",

The Court is also well aware that no allegations of undue pressure have been made in the present case. However, it notes that the domestic authorities examined the applicant\u2019s complaint about the letter of 2 having been interfered with. The Pruszk\u00f3w District Court, in its decision of 9 May 2002, accepted that this indeed had been the case and that the letter had been controlled by the prosecutor who had been competent to deal with the applicant\u2019s case. It considered that he had no criminal case to answer, but did not entertain doubts that the letter had indeed been subject to interception. The Government have not adduced arguments which would make the Court see grounds on which to challenge these findings of the domestic authorities. Accordingly, there has been an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence.",
