The case originated in an application (no. 64705/01) against the  lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Giuseppe Mostacciuolo (“the applicant”), on 4 March 1998.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Collarile and Mr C. Marcellino, lawyers practising in . The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented successively by their Agents, Mr U. Leanza and Mr I.M. Braguglia, and their co-Agents, Mr V. Esposito and Mr F. Crisafulli. Mr V. Zagrebelsky, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 of the Rules of Court). The Government accordingly appointed Mr L. Ferrari Bravo to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).
On 22 January 2004 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in .
On an unspecified date E.A.S., a company, applied to the Benevento District Court for an order against the applicant for payment of 7,500,000 Italian lire (3,873.43 euros (EUR)) in performance of a contract for professional services. In a decision of 13 October 1988 the President of the court granted the application. The order was served by E.A.S. on 28 November 1988. On 3 December 1988 the applicant challenged it in the same court.
Preparation of the case for trial began on 13 January 1989. On 18 January 1989 the case was joined to another case that was pending between the same parties. The immediate enforceability of the order was suspended. Of the seventeen hearings listed between 14 June 1989 and 26 November 1998 two were devoted to hearing evidence from the applicant, three to hearing other evidence, six were adjourned by the court of its own motion, one was adjourned to allow the parties to reach a friendly settlement, four were adjourned at the request of the applicant or both parties and a one was adjourned because E.A.S. had failed to appear.
However, on an unspecified date the case was referred to the panel of judges dealing with the oldest cases (sezione stralcio). Of the six hearings listed between 16 March 1999 and 28 November 2001 one was adjourned because E.A.S. had not appeared (owing to the registry's failure to notify it of the date to which the hearing had been adjourned by the court of its own motion), one was adjourned because the lawyers were on strike, one was adjourned to allow the parties to make their submissions, and two were adjourned by the court of its own motion.
Following a hearing, the date of which has not been communicated to the Court, on 25 September 2002 the court set the case down for hearing of oral submissions on 8 June 2004.
On 10 January 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Rome Court of Appeal under Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001, known as the “Pinto” Act, complaining of the excessive length of the above-described proceedings. He asked the court to rule that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to order the Italian Government to pay compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage sustained. The applicant claimed EUR 14,460.94 in pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. He sought the reimbursement of his costs, including those incurred before the Court, but did not quantify or provide a breakdown of them.
In a decision of 21 June 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 3 September 2002, the Court of Appeal found that a reasonable time had been exceeded. It awarded the applicant EUR 1,000 on an equitable basis and EUR 800 for costs and expenses, including those incurred before the Court, but without apportioning them.
That decision was served on 23 January 2003 and became binding on 24 March 2003. The applicant served the authorities with notice to comply on 11 October 2003. The applicant brought attachment proceedings before the  judge responsible for enforcement proceedings and a hearing was to be held on 28 March 2004.
In a letter of 21 January 2003, the applicant informed the Court of the outcome of the domestic proceedings and asked the Court to resume its examination of his application.
The applicant did not indicate that he had appealed to the Court of Cassation.
