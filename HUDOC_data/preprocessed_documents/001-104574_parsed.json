It\u00a0dismissed the\u00a0argument that such participation had given rise to doubts regarding his impartiality, finding that the judge in question had not been a\u00a0member of the panel that\u00a0had given a decision at first instance. As regards the applicant\u2019s complaint that Judge R.K. had been a member of the panel of the second-instance court twice, the court noted that, according to the domestic law, such judge was not ex lege excluded from dealing with the case. It was however open to the party having doubts as to the lack of impartiality of the judge to challenge him or her during the proceedings; the applicant had failed to do that. Since the applicant accepted the composition of the second-instance court which gave the judgment on 12 September 2006, he cannot effectively raise doubts as to the lack of impartiality of one of the judges at the cassation appeal stage.",

Thus, it cannot be said that by deciding the first case Judge R.K. necessarily prejudged the outcome of the second (see Gillow v. the United Kingdom, 24 November 1986, \u00a7 73, Series A no. 109; and Aleksey Petrov v.\u00a0Bulgaria (dec.), no. 27103/04, 2 November 2010).",
