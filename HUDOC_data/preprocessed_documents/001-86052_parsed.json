The Court of Appeal found, however, that the judge\u2019s possible relationship with an official participating in the preliminary investigation did not prove the judge\u2019s partiality. It noted that although I. P. had been the head of the team of police officers investigating the case, the investigation had in fact been carried out by another police investigator. None of the reports concerning various investigative activities (uurimistoimingu protokoll) in the case file had been drawn up by I. P. Moreover, besides judge E.

Impartiality normally denotes absence of prejudice or bias. The Court has determined the existence or absence of impartiality of a judge according to a subjective test, that is on the basis of the personal conviction or interest of a particular judge in a given case, and also according to an objective test, that is, by ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see, for example, Kyprianou v.

This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Micallef v. Malta, no. 17056/06, \u00a7\u00a074, 15\u00a0January 2008; Wettstein v.

However, in proceedings originating in an individual application the Court has to confine itself, as far as possible, to an examination of the concrete case before it (see Wettstein, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041). Moreover, the Court reiterates that the Contracting States are under the obligation to organise their legal systems so as to ensure compliance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1, impartiality being unquestionably one of the foremost of those requirements. The Court\u2019s task is to determine whether the Contracting States have achieved the result called for by the Convention (see De\u00a0Cubber, cited above, p. 20, \u00a7\u00a035).",

If not from the beginning, this was the case at least from the time the second applicant had voiced his suspicions to that effect.",

This means, in the Court\u2019s view, that I. P.\u2019s connection with the applicants\u2019 criminal case must have been considerably closer than, for example, that of the head of a police institution who could have had formal responsibility for all criminal matters dealt with at any given time. Moreover, the first applicant had been informed by the police and the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office that I. P. was a member of the team of investigators set up for the criminal case concerned having the powers to conduct all investigative activities. The first applicant can be understood as having considered I. P. personally responsible for the investigation. Furthermore, the Court cannot disregard the first applicant\u2019s statements before the City Court according to which I. P. had in fact participated in the investigation (see paragraph 12 above).",

The Court does not consider it decisive that two lay judges were in the composition of the court or that the case was also heard by the Court of Appeal. It appears evident that the professional judge\u2019s role in the proceedings was paramount compared to the lay judges. The Court of Appeal, however, failed to remedy the situation. The Court notes that the impartiality issue was raised before the Supreme Court which also had all powers to remedy the situation but which decided not to grant the applicants leave to appeal.",
