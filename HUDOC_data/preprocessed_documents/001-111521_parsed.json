In his opinion, the amendment of 16 March 2001 could be held applicable to the applicant\u2019s situation because it did not affect her right to receive the pension as such, but simply redefined its amount.",

The Court has determined the existence or absence of impartiality of a judge according to a subjective test, that is, on the basis of the personal conviction or interest of a particular judge in a given case, and also according to an objective test, that is, by ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see, for example, Kyprianou v.  [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2005XIII). In deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that these requirements are not met, the standpoint of a party is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified. In this respect even appearances are of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public and above all in the parties to proceedings (see Kleyn and Others v. the  [GC], nos. 39343/98, 39651/98, 43147/98 and 46664/99, \u00a7\u00a7 191 and 194, ECHR 2003VI).",

Furthermore, given the limited number of judges sitting in the relevant Division of the Supreme Court of Georgia (see paragraph 46 above), it may often prove to be unavoidable, and it would indeed be only natural, for the same judges to be involved in the examination of an issue on which they have already expressed an opinion in a previous set of unrelated but similar proceedings at the cassation level. Consequently, the fact that Judge S. was involved in both of the applicants\u2019 unconnected but similar pension disputes, first acting in the minority and then forming part of the majority of the cassation court, cannot justify, from an objective standpoint either, the applicant\u2019s apprehension that the judge lacked the necessary impartiality in the course of her second dispute.",

They emphasised that at the time of the introduction of that clause salaries in the public sector, in line with which the life-time pension was intended to be adjustable, had been very low. Thus, relying on the official statistical data, the Government stated that the average monthly salary in the public sector at that time had been roughly equal to GEL 85 (EUR 39). However, over a period of several years thereafter, salaries had increased significantly. By 2004 the average salary in the public sector had risen to GEL\u00a0192 (EUR\u00a088), while in 2008 it was GEL 870 (EUR 399).",

The second option had been chosen. The Government added that, in addition to reducing the life-time and adjustable pension of retired Supreme Court judges to GEL\u00a01,200\u00a0(EUR\u00a0551), a move which concerned 21 individuals overall, the respondent State had also concurrently adopted, on 27 December 2005, a new Act on State Compensation (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above), which similarly discontinued the application of the same adjustment principle to the pensions of 850 retired civil servants (former officials of the Defence, Interior and Security Ministries (191 individuals), former public prosecutors (98 individuals) and former members of Parliament (561 individuals)).",

Consequently, the Government\u2019s argument that the removal of the clause had been a necessary austerity measure, aimed at avoiding an added burden for taxpayers when State expenditure increased owing to the payment of higher public salaries, was illogical.

No such reason had ever been cited, even in approximate terms, whether in the official explanatory memorandum to the amendment of 23 December 2005, by the legislature during the examination of that amendment in Parliament or in the respondent authority\u2019s submissions during the relevant judicial proceedings at domestic level.",

The supposed causal link between the two events was further undermined by the fact that, while the removal of the clause had occurred in December 2005, the pension of ordinary senior citizens had started to rise only several years later, in 2008. If the State budget deficit was the real reason for the annulment of the life-long and adjustable pension of the twenty-one retired senior Supreme Court judges, the applicant wondered how it had become possible to increase significantly in a rather short period of time the salary of acting judges of the Supreme Court, which was currently fixed at GEL 4,400 (EUR 2,020). As further proof of the manifestly unfair distribution of public funds between acting senior public servants and retired judges\u2019 pensions, the applicant also commented on the fact that Ministers\u2019 salaries had recently reached approximately GEL\u00a05,000\u00a0(EUR 2,305); the salary of the Chief Public Prosecutor had risen to GEL\u00a04,000 (EUR 1,844) and that of the regional public prosecutors was set at GEL 2,580 (EUR 1,190).

She emphasised in that respect that not only the social well-being of individual judges was at stake but also the protection of the judicial system in the form of the guarantees for its independence from outside pressure. The applicant also submitted opinions issued by the Constitutional Court of Georgia and various State and independent legal experts, all of which warned the Georgian Parliament that the removal of the adjustment clause in relation to the pensions rights of retired judges would be incompatible with the relevant international standards on the protection of judges and might undermine the guarantees of stability, irremovability and independence of the judiciary.",

Furthermore, the subsequent discontinuation of the adjustment requirement since 1 January 2006, as a result of which the applicant became unable to claim a higher pension despite the significant rise in the salary of acting Supreme Court judges, a statutory change which clearly reduced the initial scope of the applicant\u2019s pension entitlement, must be regarded as interference with her right to the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions. This interference thus requires to be justified under the relevant \u201clawfulness\u201d, \u201cpublic interest\u201d and \u201cproportionality\u201d principles contained in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for instance, Laki\u0107evi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a059).",

It further notes that, whilst discontinuing the adjustment requirement, the amendment of 23\u00a0December 2005 entitled the applicant instead to a sum of GEL\u00a01,200\u00a0(EUR\u00a0551). It is significant that the new amount of the applicant\u2019s retirement benefit slightly exceeded the amount of her final salary before retirement (see paragraph 7 above). It therefore preserved, in substance, the initial equivalence requirement of her special pension entitlement and, as the Government demonstrated, was still much higher than the average retirement pension in , thus maintaining the idea of a special, more generous welfare scheme for retired Supreme Court judges. That being so, the Court finds that the amendment of 23 December 2005 cannot be said to have impaired the very essence of the applicant\u2019s special retirement benefit as it was initially contemplated by the respondent State (contrast, for instance, Laki\u0107evi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 72, and Kjartan \u00c1smundsson, cited above, \u00a7 45).",
