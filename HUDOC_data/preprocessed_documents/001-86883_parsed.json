The Government did not provide a detailed description of the investigative measures in case no. 37016 and the dates on which they were taken. However, it appears from the Government\u2019s submissions that the crime scene was inspected and the residents of Tsa-Vedeno detained on 3 May 2001 were questioned for the first time as late as 2005. The district prosecutor\u2019s office sent requests for information to various State agencies only in 2004-05. It is obvious that these measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. These delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",
