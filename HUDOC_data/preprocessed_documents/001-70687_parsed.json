The Court recalls that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0 (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012, and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v. , no.\u00a053431/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 23 October 2003). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violations found. It therefore considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the award made by the domestic court. For this reason the Court does not find it necessary to make an award for pecuniary damage in so far as it relates to the principal amount (see Poznakhirina v. Russia, no.\u00a025964/02, \u00a7 33, 24 February 2005).",
