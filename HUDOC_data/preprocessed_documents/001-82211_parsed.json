Poland, no. 55383/00, \u00a7\u00a030, 13 July 2004); this requirement is additionally reinforced in States where domestic law itself provides that all such cases must be resolved with particular urgency (see Borgese v. Italy, judgment of 26 February 1992, Series\u00a0A no. 228B, \u00a7\u00a018). This is particularly so when a judgment has already been adopted and the authorities have only to enforce it. The Court notes that the particular hardship to which a person is undoubtedly subjected when he or she is unlawfully deprived of a salary, even for a short period, has been taken into account by the domestic legislator in Article 208 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 19 above), which makes court orders for reinstatement and the payment of part of the salary immediately enforceable.",

The court order concerned the applicant's reinstatement and payment of his salary, which, in the absence of any claim that he had alternative sources of revenue, was presumably his main source of income. Moreover, there were no apparent objective factors preventing the immediate enforcement of the judgment. Enforcement did not require important resources since it involved only the applicant's reinstatement and the payment of a single month's salary. Nor should it have required the use of coercive measures, such as if the order concerned a private company (see, a contrario, Fociac v. Romania, no. 2577/02, 3 February 2005), since the order was given to a Minister.",
