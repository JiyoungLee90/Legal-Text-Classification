The case originated in an application (no. 17267/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Croatian national, Mr Danko Škare (“the applicant”), on 21 May 2003.
The applicant was represented by Mr I. Juričić, a lawyer practising in . The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Š. Stažnik.
On 25 January 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in .
On 17 July 1991 the Government adopted a decree forbidding any transactions with the immovable property situated in Croatia and belonging to the former ’s federal institutions or legal entities having seat in one of its former federal units ( – “the Decree”, Official Gazette no. 36/1991). The Decree entered into force on 24 July 1991 and was to remain in force pending the process of succession of the former .
In the period between 1993 and 1999 the Decree was challenged on five occasions by various petitioners in abstract constitutional review proceedings. The  refused all the petitions finding that the Decree had not been in breach of the Constitution.
In the period between July 1991 and April 1994, starting with the decree of 31 July 1991, the Government adopted several successive decrees forbidding transactions with other property that had remained in Croatia and belonging to the legal entities having seat in one of the former ’s federal units. Eventually, on 24 March 1994 Parliament passed an act of the same content (Zakon o zabrani raspolaganja i preuzimanju sredstava određenih pravnih osoba na teritoriju Republike Hrvatske – “the Act”, Official Gazette nos. 29 and 35/1994).
The applicant was working as a professor at the former Military Academy in .
On 13 and 16 August 1991, the Zagreb Garrison of the Yugoslav People’s Army (“the YPA”), issued two decisions granting the applicant the right to occupy a flat in  of 99.35 square metres that was owned by the YPA. He was also obliged to give back a flat of 51.56 square metres that had previously been awarded to him by the YPA, in which he had been living with his wife and two children until then.
They still live in the last-mentioned flat.
On 11 September 1992 the applicant brought a civil action against the State in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) seeking to use the flat granted to him by the above-mentioned YPA decisions.
On 5 October 1992 the Municipal Court dismissed the applicant’s claim. It found that the YPA decisions had no legal effect since they had been issued contrary to the peremptory rules of the Decree.
The applicant appealed to the  (Okružni sud u Zagrebu), which on 2 March 1993 quashed the first-instance judgment for incomplete facts and remitted the case.
In the resumed proceedings, on 7 March 1995 the Zagreb Municipal Court again dismissed the applicant’s claim repeating its previous findings. The applicant again appealed.
On 30 December 1996 the  (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment.
The applicant then lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija) with the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske). On 18 May 2000 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law.
On 20 November 2000 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court’s decision with the  (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske).
Before dealing with the applicant’s complaint, the  decided first to examine three petitions for constitutional review (prijedlog za ocjenu ustavnosti) directed against the Decree and the Act – which, in the Government’s view, constituted the relevant substantive law applicable to his case. The  dismissed the two petitions against the Decree on 18 July and 28 December 2001, respectively. On 12 April 2002 it dismissed the petition against the Act.
At the ’s panel meeting held on 30 June 2004 the rapporteur informed his colleagues that, meanwhile, a new case had been assigned to him raising apparently the same legal issues as that of the applicant. The rapporteur therefore withdrew the case from the agenda. Subsequently, it was established that no such similarity had existed as it initially appeared.
On 6 April 2005 the  dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint. It observed obiter dictum that it could not deal with the applicant’s argument that the Decree had been adopted ultra vires, since that issue could be examined only in abstract constitutional review proceedings, and not in those concerning a constitutional complaint.
