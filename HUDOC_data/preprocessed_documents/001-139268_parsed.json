The applicant could have relied on the Law on Compensation for Damages (see paragraph\u00a053 above) to seek compensation for his unlawful confinement in the psychiatric hospital. Under section 4 of the above Law, the applicant could have submitted, within six months of his discharge date, a complaint to the Ministry of Justice. Alternatively, it has been open to him to submit a civil claim to a court of general jurisdiction for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage caused by the execution of the court order of 16\u00a0September\u00a02002. The Government submitted two examples of situations in which requests for compensation had been upheld. Thus, on 9\u00a0February 2005, following a person\u2019s acquittal in criminal proceedings the Ministry of Justice decided to pay compensation for the time the person in question had been held in detention while the proceedings had been pending. On 24\u00a0August 2005 the Riga City Centre District Court awarded compensation to a person who had been convicted in criminal proceedings by a first-instance court and later acquitted.",

Finland, no.\u00a034806/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0144151, ECHR\u00a02012 (extracts)) and reiterates that before determining whether the applicant has been reliably shown to have been suffering from a mental illness of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement, and whether the validity of his continued confinement depended on the persistence of the mental illness (see, among other authorities, Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-39, reiterated in L.M. v. Latvia, no. 26000/02, \u00a7\u00a046, 19\u00a0July 2011), it must establish whether the applicant\u2019s detention was carried out \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d and was \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (e) (see Storck v.

In the latter respect the Convention essentially refers back to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof.

Until 1 February 2004, defamation of state officials was a criminal offence, but the applicant was absolved from criminal liability on account of his state of mental health. Instead, he was ordered to undergo compulsory medical treatment under guard. Noting also that the applicant\u2019s detention in the psychiatric hospital was ordered in the course of criminal proceedings relating to the assessment of his mental capacity, the complaint falls to be examined under Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(e) of the Convention.",

The Court points to the vague reasoning provided by the medical experts and national courts in connection with such a radical measure. However, even assuming that by relying on the medical experts\u2019 report the first-instance court in 2001 had reliably established that the applicant\u2019s mental state warranted confinement in a psychiatric hospital under guard, the Court notes that until adoption of the final decision in January\u00a02003 no other medical examinations had been ordered. Accordingly, for more than a year no assessments were carried out as to the continued necessity of confining the applicant to an inpatient psychiatric hospital under guard, or the possibility of applying any other less restrictive measure. The Court notes in particular that in the absence of any explanation by the national authorities, the execution of the order and the applicant\u2019s subsequent detention in a psychiatric hospital was carried out more than a year and six months after the final decision ordering his inpatient treatment came into effect.",

Neither has the Court\u2019s attention been brought to any procedures enabling further medical assessments to verify the necessity of continued compulsory hospitalisation in cases where an order for confinement has been made but its execution has been delayed. The Court reiterates that matters relating to the execution of detention form part of the broader notion of the lawfulness of detention under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(e) of the Convention (see Ashingdane v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, \u00a7\u00a044, Series A no. 93). The above principle suggests that if the measure is not carried out immediately, in order to be lawful in the light of Article\u00a05 of the Convention there has to be an opportunity to acquire an assessment to verify the necessity of medical confinement within a reasonable time before its execution (see, mutatis mutandis, Luberti v. Italy, 23 February 1984, \u00a7\u00a028, Series A no. 75). Observing the considerable delays in the execution of the applicant\u2019s detention at the material time and the lack of any safeguards under the domestic law permitting a review of the medical necessity of compulsory medical measures before its execution, the applicant\u2019s detention was carried out contrary to the principle established under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(e) that the existence of a mental illness warranting confinement in a hospital must be established at the time of its implementation. The Court furthermore notes and the Government do not deny (see paragraph\u00a099 below) that at the time when the applicant was detained in the psychiatric hospital, section\u00a0271 of the Criminal Law, which had formed the legal basis for the criminal proceedings against him, had already been declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court and had furthermore been repealed from the Criminal Law raising serious questions as to the lawfulness as such of the applicant\u2019s confinement to the psychiatric hospital.",

The Government referred to the Court\u2019s conclusions in Gri\u0161ankova and Gri\u0161ankovs v. Latvia ((dec.) no.\u00a036117/02, 13\u00a0February\u00a02003, ECHR 2003-II (extracts)), where it was held that where an individual calls into question a provision of a Latvian legislation or regulation as being contrary to the Convention, and the right relied on is among those guaranteed by the Latvian Constitution, proceedings should, in principle, be brought before the Constitutional Court prior to being brought before the Court. The Government cited several examples of case-law in which the Constitutional Court had effectively remedied issues in relation to persons of diminished mental capacity, highlighting one such judgment of December\u00a02010 in which the Constitutional Court found that the institute of absolute legal incapacity enshrined in the Civil Law was incompatible with the Constitution. In the light of the above, the Government argued that given the applicant\u2019s experience in submitting various complaints, he would have been aware of his entitlement to submit such a complaint to the Constitutional Court. The Government contended that the Court was prevented from considering the applicant\u2019s complaint, since the compatibility of section 4021 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had never been assessed by competent Latvian authorities.",

The Court notes at the outset that it does not question the effectiveness of a constitutional complaint in cases where the constitutionality of the provisions of national legislation is called into question (see Gri\u0161ankova and Gri\u0161ankovs, cited above). However, it cannot agree that the constitutionality of section 4021 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was the issue in the present case. Rather, the issue was the absence of safeguards which rendered the framework of compulsory medical measures under the former Code of Criminal Procedure incompatible with the guarantees enshrined in Article\u00a05 of the Convention. The Court reiterates that the Constitutional Court in Latvia is empowered to repeal legal provisions which it finds unconstitutional, but not to adopt new legal procedures or to close a legislative gap (see Liep\u0101jnieks v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a037586/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a073 and 75, 2\u00a0November 2010).

Finland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0169170). However, owing to the passage of time since the applicant\u2019s last medical examination, it could not be said that when he was admitted to the hospital the necessity of the measure had been lawful in the light of Article\u00a05 of the Convention. The Court considers that to be even more so in the light of the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s confinement to a psychiatric hospital had been rendered unlawful by the fact that the provision of the Criminal Law that had formed the legal basis for the criminal proceedings against him had been declared unconstitutional (see paragraph\u00a099 below). The Court highlights the undisputed fact that since November\u00a02001 there had been no judicial review as to the persistence of the conditions requiring the applicant\u2019s continued confinement in a psychiatric hospital. These circumstances therefore rendered the speediness of the review even more pertinent. However, even though immediately after his confinement on 30\u00a0July\u00a02004 the applicant approached the head of the hospital administration with a request for his release, no action was taken by the authorities until 3\u00a0September\u00a0of that year (see paragraphs 28 - 29 above).",

There is no evidence to suggest that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were discontinued on rehabilitating grounds which would give way for the applicant to claim damages (contrast Dreiblats v. Latvia (dec.), no. 8283/07, 4\u00a0June\u00a02013). The Court observes, however, that the impugned order was issued based on the applicant\u2019s state of mental health, the assessment of which was carried out by medical experts. While it cannot be excluded that the validity of the order might depend on posterior legislative changes, it is also clear that it requires further medical assessments. This argument was also advanced by the Government (see paragraph 66 above) and was supported by the Senate\u2019s judgment, which referred to the special proceedings applicable to measures of a medical nature (see paragraph 18 above). The Court concludes that the Government have not shown that the legislative changes automatically made the order unlawful for the purposes of the Law on Compensation for Damages (see paragraph\u00a053 above), thus failing to provide any certainty as to the prospects of success as required by the relevant case-law (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, 16\u00a0September\u00a01996, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06668, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV, and contrast Dreiblats, cited above)\u00a0.
