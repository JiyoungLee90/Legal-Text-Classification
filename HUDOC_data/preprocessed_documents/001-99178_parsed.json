As early as in April 2008 the expert psychiatrists concluded that the applicant suffered from a delusional disorder and should be placed in a psychiatric hospital. However, the District Court finally scheduled a hearing in November 2008, that is, seven months later (see paragraphs 9 and 13 above). During that time, the applicant was kept in a regular detention centre",
