In the case of bank deposits, the running of that period could be interrupted only by a new deposit or withdrawal, by a transfer of funds or by the payment of interest. The Court of Appeal also based its decision on Legislative Decree no. 1195/1942, according to which sums of money in bank accounts that had remained dormant for twenty years were transferred to the State on expiry of that period.",

It must look behind appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of. That assessment may involve not only the relevant compensation terms \u2013 if the situation is akin to the taking of property \u2013 but also the conduct of the parties, including the means employed by the State and their implementation. In that context, it should be stressed that uncertainty \u2013 be it legislative, administrative or arising from practices applied by the authorities \u2013 is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State\u2019s conduct. Indeed, where an issue in the general interest is at stake, it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time, in an appropriate and consistent manner (see Tunnel Report Limited v.

In that regard the Court of Cassation held that the act of recognition had to have been addressed to the creditor and to have reached him or her, and that the mere fact of entering the debt in the bank\u2019s records did not amount to recognition of the claim for the purposes of Article 260 and was therefore not capable of stopping the running of the limitation period (see paragraphs 18 and 21 above).",

Account holders are therefore entitled to believe, in good faith, that their deposits are safe, especially if they see that interest has been credited to their account.
