In the light of the material in its possession, the Court considers that the enforcement proceedings must be regarded as having ended on 4 September 2006 when the first-instance court reimbursed the applicants the costs of enforcement as established by its decision of 16 April 2004. That was the last activity taken in the course of the proceedings which was supported by documentary evidence. The Court cannot accept the applicants\u2019 assertion that the proceedings are still pending since no evidence has been presented as to whether, when and in what form they requested the first-instance court to determine their claim for the alleged remaining costs and expenses. The enforcement proceedings therefore lasted over twelve years and eight months of which nearly nine years and five months fall within the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction at two levels of jurisdiction.",

Such inactivity is surprising, having regard to the fact that, as the Government pointed out, the applicants were represented by a lawyer of their own choosing. Their motions to expedite the proceedings post-dated that period (see paragraph 18 above). However, such requests, even if made within the above-mentioned gap, could not have expedited the proceedings (see Atanasovic and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031).",

It is not in doubt that during that time the applicants and the first-instance court were inactive. The Government maintained that the courts\u2019 inactivity had resulted from the applicants\u2019 failure to pay the costs of enforcement. In this connection, the Court observes that on 26 October 1994 the first-instance court ordered the applicants to make an advance payment of these costs. The only proof of payment was dated 17 November 2000 (see paragraph 12 above). In the absence of any evidence, the Court considers the applicants\u2019 arguments that these costs had been paid before that date unsubstantiated. However, the Court is not persuaded that this blatant failure was the reason for the first-instance court\u2019s inactivity. Nor did the first-instance court, in its reply to the applicants\u2019 request for the proceedings to be expedited, put forward that failure as justification for the delay (see paragraph 13 above). In this connection, it notes that the first-instance court dismissed the debtor\u2019s objection of 2 November 1994 on 1 November 2000 (see paragraph 10 above). At that time, the applicants had not yet complied with the court\u2019s payment order. It was only on 8 November 2000, which was after that decision, that the first-instance court again requested the applicants to pay the costs of enforcement together with interest (see paragraph 11 above). In addition, the first-instance court, although empowered to do so under section 32 \u00a7 3 of the Act, did not stay the proceedings on that ground and did not issue any warning to the parties.",
