It was accompanied, and this fact was not disputed by the Government, by intense pain in his ordinary daily physical activities, such as walking.

The applicant supported his argument with written statements by three former co-detainees who insisted they had shared cells with the applicant. In addition, he submitted a certificate issued at the time of his detention (see paragraph 64 above). The Government also supported their version of events with certificates, the only difference being that the latter were issued long after the applicant\u2019s release (see paragraph\u00a062 above). Although it was open to the Government to submit copies of\u00a0registration logs\u00a0recording cell population and showing the names of inmates detained together with the applicant in the relevant period, they failed to do so. The Government\u2019s certificates therefore, are of little evidential value for the Court\u2019s analyses (see Chudun v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a020641/04, \u00a7 84, 21 June 2011).

In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds are found to have been \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings. The presumption is in favour of release. As the Court has consistently held, the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 3 does not give judicial authorities a choice between either bringing an accused to trial within a reasonable time or granting him provisional release pending trial. Until his conviction, the accused must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continued detention ceases to be reasonable. A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons to justify his or her continued detention (see, among other authorities, Castravet v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a023393/05, \u00a7\u00a7 30 and 32, 13\u00a0March 2007; McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2006-X; Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v.

Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention cannot be seen as unconditionally authorising detention provided that it lasts no longer than a certain period. Justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see Shishkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a038822/97, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 2003-I).",

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7 67, 7\u00a0April 2005, and Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 84-85, 26 July 2001). The national judicial authorities must examine all the facts for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, and must set them out in their decisions dismissing applications for release.When deciding whether a person should be released or detained, the authorities are obliged to consider alternative measures of ensuring his appearance at trial (see Idalov v. Russia [GC], no.\u00a05826/03, \u00a7\u00a0140, 22\u00a0May 2012, and Suslov v. Russia, no.\u00a02366/07, \u00a7\u00a086, 29\u00a0May 2012, with further references).

In the present case the decisions of the domestic authorities gave no reasons why they considered the risk of his absconding to be decisive. The Court finds that the existence of a risk that the applicant might abscond was not established. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s health condition made the risk of absconding very slight as he was mostly bedridden and had difficulties walking on his own.",

In any event, even if a risk of undue influence existed, it may be assumed that it would decrease gradually as the investigation proceeded and the witnesses were interviewed, with the records of their questioning being attached to the case file as evidence. The Court is therefore not persuaded that compelling reasons existed to fear that he would interfere with witnesses or otherwise hamper the investigation of the case throughout the entire period of his detention, and certainly not compelling enough to outweigh the applicant\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",
