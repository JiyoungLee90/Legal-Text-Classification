Moreover, the decision had been issued in spite of a decision staying the registration proceedings and the existence of pending contentious proceedings. The appellants\u2019 argument that the Supreme Court of Cassation had no jurisdiction to hear a legal challenge against the Sofia City Court\u2019s decision was unavailing because the prosecuting authorities were not competent to make pronouncements on such points. Faced with pending judicial proceedings and a pending criminal investigation, they were bound to take measures to prevent changes in the status quo before any judicial resolution of the matter. The appellants\u2019 attempts to change that status quo were premised on rights acquired through a judicial decision based on false documents. It was necessary for the judiciary to check the lawfulness of that decision and for the investigating authorities to gather evidence with a view to uncovering the truth. The bank had to be protected against damage flowing from offences that had already been committed and from the risk of future offences.

That made it impossible for the bank\u2019s executive board to function. The attempts to approach the Chief Prosecutor with a view to solving the problem had proved unfruitful. At the same time, a check of the bank\u2019s finances carried out in December 2004 showed that its credit portfolio was deteriorating due to the ever more frequent failure of its debtors to service considerable loans extended by the bank, and that the bank was not carrying out proper creditrisk assessments. All of that seriously affected its stability and the interests of its creditors and depositors. It was therefore necessary to take urgent measures to solve the problem with the bank\u2019s management. The BNB\u2019s deputy-governor accordingly decided to call a meeting of the bank\u2019s supervisory board on 11 February 2005 with a view to taking measures, possibly including replacing the members of the bank\u2019s executive board, that could allow the bank to be effectively managed.

On 4 May 2005 it noted that, contrary to a statutory rule prohibiting banks from exposing more than a quarter of their capital to any one debtor, the bank had, as early as July 2004, extended a large loan to a company. In spite of the BNB\u2019s instructions to fix that, the bank later had, on the contrary, vastly increased its exposure to that company. It was also overly exposed to other debtors, and faced with a serious deterioration of its credit portfolio, with ever more frequent failures by its nine principal debtors to service their loans. That required the bank to increase its non-performing loan provisions, but doing so would deplete its capital to a level requiring revocation of its licence. The BNB therefore asked all persons engaged with running the bank to join efforts to remedy its situation, and instructed the bank immediately to bring its exposure into line with the statutory requirements and collect its overdue loans from nine companies and all of its loans from another company. The BNB also barred the bank from taking in new term deposits, except from shareholders, and warned it that failure to comply with those instructions would lead to harsher measures, including the appointment of special administrators or revocation of its licence.",

She noted that it had already been established that the bank\u2019s financial situation had substantially deteriorated and that its capital was below the amount required by law, which called for immediate remedial action; in particular, the collection of some of the loans extended by the bank. Despite instructions to that effect by the BNB and a warning that failure to act would trigger harsher measures, the bank\u2019s management had not taken such action. A report by an inspector appointed by the BNB showed that the bank\u2019s liquidity was worsening daily. The bank was therefore at risk of insolvency that its shareholders and management had not taken steps to avert. There was uncertainty in relation to the persons running the bank: those actually doing so no longer featured in the register of companies and were not in law entitled to act on the bank\u2019s behalf, whereas those featuring in the register could not in fact do so because of the decisions of the prosecuting authorities (see paragraphs 42-49 above). That threw doubt on the reliability of the reports which the bank was submitting to the BNB; there were reasons to believe that its financial situation was worse than transpiring from these reports. At the same time, the infighting between the bank\u2019s shareholders precluded outside assistance. All that showed that the interests of the bank\u2019s depositors were at serious risk, and the BNB had no choice but to place it under administration and appoint special administrators to run it.

Sections 9(2) and 13(1) of that Act are almost identical to sections 79(3) and\u00a082 of the 1997 Act. Section 11(3) of the 2002 Act, as originally enacted, provided that in proceedings in which the court was to decide whether to grant the BNB\u2019s petition to open insolvency proceedings against a bank, the bank was to be represented by the special administrators appointed by the BNB. A new subsection (4), added in 2006, now provides that shareholders who at the time of revoking of the bank\u2019s licence hold more than five per cent of its shares are entitled to take part in the proceedings. However, section 16(1) in fine provides that only the BNB, the special administrators appointed by it, and the public prosecutor may appeal against the insolvency court\u2019s decision on the winding-up petition against the bank. In a decision of 11 January 2016 (\u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 4 \u043e\u0442 11.01.2016 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0442.\u00a0\u0434. \u2116 3343/2015 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, I \u0442. \u043e.), given in the case of a bank whose licence was revoked by the BNB on 6 November 2014, the Supreme Court of Cassation asked the Constitutional Court to declare sections 11(3) and 16(1) unconstitutional and contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the light of this Court\u2019s judgment in Capital Bank AD (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 117-18). On 4 February 2016 the Constitutional Court admitted the request for examination in so far as it concerned the constitutionality of those sections, but turned it down in so far as it concerned their compatibility with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, on the basis that under the applicable rules of procedure the Supreme Court of Cassation only had standing to seek pronouncements on the constitutionality of statutes, not their compatibility with international treaties (see \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u043e\u0442 4\u00a0\u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 2016 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043a. \u0434. \u2116\u00a01/2016 \u0433., \u041a\u0421).

When dealing with legal challenges against the decision of the BNB on 6 November 2014 to revoke the licence of a bank (see paragraph 79 above), that court held that its shareholders did not have standing to bring claims under section 151(3) on their own behalf (see \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 3725 \u043e\u0442 02.04.2015 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 3438/2015 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441-\u0432). In a parallel case, it held that the bank\u2019s managers, who had earlier been replaced by special administrators appointed by the BNB, did not have such standing either (see \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 2038 \u043e\u0442 25.02.2015 \u0433., \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 1813/2015 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441-\u0432). In the wake of those decisions, on 9 March 2015 the President of the Supreme Bar Council asked that court to give an interpretative decision on these points, arguing that its rulings were contrary to, inter alia, Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The plenary court deliberated on the admissibility of the request (\u0442\u044a\u043b\u043a. \u0434. \u2116 4/2015 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u041e\u0421) on 29 March 2016.",

In 1998 that provision was superseded by the similarly worded paragraph 4(1) of the transitional and concluding provisions of the Bank Deposits Guarantee Act 1998, which provided that when seeking the opening of insolvency proceedings against a bank the BNB\u2019s governor had to ask the investigating authorities to check whether members of the bank\u2019s executive and supervisory boards had committed offences, and freeze their bank accounts and immovable property. By paragraph 4(3), these were to be later unfrozen, unless within six months after the BNB had lodged the winding-up petition the investigating or prosecuting authorities informed it that they had opened criminal proceedings in connection with the insolvency, or the bank\u2019s liquidators informed it that they had brought a claim against the boards\u2019 members.",

The BNB had not taken any of that into account, instead choosing fully to trust the administrators\u2019 findings.

In this respect, the situation was likewise identical to that in Capital Bank AD (cited above). The only difference is that the Sofia City Court\u2019s decision in the present case was not appealed against. But, given that in Capital Bank AD\u2019s case the appeals were lodged by the prosecuting authorities (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 29, 32 and\u00a0117 in fine), and that the bank\u2019s shareholders and management in the present case could not take part in the proceedings, this does not make any difference.

It was not disputed that it was lawful and pursued a legitimate aim: to ensure that the managers of a bank which had fallen into insolvency would not dissipate their assets in anticipation of possible criminal charges or civil claims relating to the way in which they had run the bank before the insolvency.

Poland (dec.), no.\u00a030417/96, \u00a7 85, ECHR 2002-X (extracts)). In normal circumstances, such freezing, which has a strictly limited duration of six months (see paragraph 83 above), could be regarded as falling within that margin. But in this case the Court does not need to pass upon that point, because the situation at hand was quite unusual: as a result of decisions taken by the prosecuting authorities, in relation to which the Court found a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraphs 97-99 above), Mr Panev and Mr\u00a0Ivanov were not able to take up their duties, and were managers of the bank on paper only. The risk that the freezing was intended to avert was therefore not present, and it could not therefore be regarded as necessary. However, as apparent from the BNB\u2019s reply to Mr Panev\u2019s and Mr Ivanov\u2019s protests against the freezing (see paragraph 74 above) and the Government\u2019s submissions, the applicable statutory rule, which did not appear to permit of any exceptions, required the BNB to freeze the accounts without being able to take into account the applicants\u2019 individual circumstances. It follows that even though the BNB\u2019s decision in that respect could theoretically have been subject to judicial review (see paragraph 84 above), no information has been provided which suggests that Mr Panev and Mr Ivanov could, in practice and in a timely fashion, have successfully challenged it.",

The words \u201cinjured party\u201d in Article 41 (former Article\u00a050) of the Convention are synonymous with the term \u201cvictim\u201d in Article 34 (former Article 25) and denote the person directly affected by the failure to observe the Convention (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), 10 March 1972, \u00a7 23, Series A no. 14; The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) (Article 50), 6 November 1980, \u00a7 13, Series A no. 38; and Airey v.

The complaint that Mr Bonev made in his personal capacity with respect to the decisions taken by the prosecuting authorities in relation to bank was declared inadmissible precisely because he was not directly affected by those decisions (see paragraph 144 above). Only the bank, although now dissolved, may claim just satisfaction in that respect. The question how any award made in its favour is to be distributed is a separate matter (see OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia (just satisfaction), no. 14902/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 31 July 2014).",

As shown from the steps taken by the BNB in the wake of those decisions, they gave rise to considerable uncertainty about which persons were entitled to manage and represent the bank, which in turn inhibited the efforts to remedy its already dire financial situation (see paragraphs 59, 60, 61 and 64 above). However, it appears that the bank had serious financial problems even before those decisions (see paragraph 63 above). The Court is therefore not persuaded that, had it not been for the prosecuting authorities\u2019 decisions, the bank would have been able to overcome those problems and avoid insolvency.

To the extent that they relate to inadmissible complaints, their claims for just satisfaction must be rejected (see Nencheva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 162). In as much as the four applicants based their claims on the authorities\u2019 actions in relation to the bank, the Court notes that only Mr\u00a0Bonev was found to have standing to complain on the bank\u2019s behalf (see paragraphs 91 and 92 above). But, as already noted (see paragraph 158 above), even he cannot be regarded as an \u201cinjured party\u201d, within the meaning of Article 41 of the Convention, with respect to the breaches found in relation to the bank. It follows that none of the four applicants is entitled to compensation in respect of any non-pecuniary damage allegedly suffered as a result of those breaches. By contrast, Mr Panev and Mr Ivanov must have endured some non-pecuniary damage as a result of the unjustified freezing of all of their bank accounts. However, since they did not make any claim in respect of that, the Court sees no reason to award them anything under this head (see Rule 60 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court and points 5 and 15 of the Practice Direction on Just Satisfaction Claims).",
