The domestic courts therefore confirmed that the applicant companies\u2019 licences had been withdrawn for the legitimate purpose of eliminating the effects of a decision taken by the local authorities in breach of the rules of free market competition, namely, the purpose mentioned in the judgment of 28 June 2006.

Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, \u00a7 134, ECHR 2005-XII (extracts)). In the current case, the domestic courts agreed that the withdrawal of the applicants\u2019 licences was made necessary by a previous court order as well as by legislative changes which intervened in the meantime. However, in analysing the applicants\u2019 complaint both the V\u00e2lcea County Court and the Timi\u015foara Court of Appeal had failed to establish any fault on the authorities\u2019 side.

Moreover, the Court already held in a number of cases that mistakes or errors by State authorities should serve to the benefit of those affected, especially where no other conflicting private interest is at stake.
