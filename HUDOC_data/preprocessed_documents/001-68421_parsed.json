The quotation further confirms that the means inquiry required by regulation 41(2) was at the centre of the enforcement procedure which was laid down by the 1989 Regulations, and that, without it, the magistrates plainly could not properly arrive at a conclusion as to whether the failure to pay had been due to the applicant\u2019s wilful refusal or culpable neglect. The Court recalls that the ex parte Johnson case was subsequently considered by the Commission, which unanimously concluded that it could be said, with the practically possible degree of certainty, that the magistrates had acted in excess of jurisdiction in the circumstances of that case and that therefore there had been a violation of Article 5 of the Convention (Johnson v. the United Kingdom, Commission report of 9 September 1998, see \u00a7\u00a7 41-44). The Court further notes that in the domestic case of Meara v. DPP (see Lloyd, \u00a7 50) \u201cthe holding of a full means inquiry\u201d was held to be an essential prerequisite of a finding of culpable neglect. The Government have not been able to point to any previous case which draws a distinction, under the applicable regulations, between the holding of no means inquiry and no proper means inquiry, as being a distinction of decisive importance for the question whether or not there has been a breach of a condition precedent or a lack of jurisdiction.",

It is true, as pointed out by the Government, that in cases concerning procedural defects under Article 5, in particular Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4, the Court has held that just satisfaction was to be awarded only in respect of damage resulting from a deprivation of liberty that the applicant would not have suffered if he or she had had the benefit of the missing guarantees (e.g. Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, ECHR 1999-II, \u00a7 76). However where there are findings of unlawfulness in the detention itself under the first paragraph of Article 5, it may be noted that generally the Court makes an award which reflects the importance of the right to liberty which should not be removed save under the conditions provided for in domestic law and in conformity with the rule of law. As well as the length of the detention, the degree of arbitrariness disclosed by the circumstances of the case may be a factor influencing the appropriateness of making any award (e.g. Conka and Others v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, ECHR 2002-I; Assanidz\u00e9 v. Georgia, no.\u00a071503/01, ECHR 2004-...).

In Perks, the Court saw no reason to disregard the Government\u2019s concession that the situation of Mr Perks was exceptional given that the appeal court had found it unlikely that the magistrates\u2019 court would have committed him to prison if they had known more about his health problems and personal circumstances, matters to which, the Government had also accepted, a reasonably competent solicitor would have drawn the magistrates\u2019 court\u2019s attention. An award for non-pecuniary loss was therefore made to Mr Perks. It is noteworthy that the Court went on to find that there was no basis to speculate, as regards the other applicants in Perks, as to the outcome of their proceedings before the magistrates\u2019 courts, and found that the finding of a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction.",

While the applicants argue generally that a reasonably competent solicitor would have made a difference in their cases and that the High Court, once they were represented, quashed the committal decisions, this was also the position for the other applicants in Perks. The Court cannot engage in speculation as to which domestic cases it was likely that the applicant\u2019s representative would have brought to the attention of the magistrates nor what action the magistrates would have taken had they been referred to those cases.
