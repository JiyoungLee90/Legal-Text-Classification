The case originated in an application (no. 34822/04) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Yevlampiya Sergeyevna Lukinykh (“the applicant”), on 19 August 2004.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 25 April 2008 the application was communicated to the Government. In accordance with the pilot judgment Burdov v. Russia (no. 2) (no. 33509/04, ECHR 2009), the application was adjourned pending its resolution at the domestic level.
The Government later informed the Court that enforcement of the domestic judgment in the applicant’s favour was impossible because it had been quashed by way of the supervisory-review proceedings and requested the Court to consider the application on the merits. The Court therefore decided to resume examination of the present case.
The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Nizmennoye, the Kaliningrad Region.
In the 1990s the applicant subscribed to a State savings scheme which would entitle her to receive a passenger car in 1994. She paid the car’s full value but never received the car. The applicant brought the court action against the authorities, claiming the full monetary value of the specialpurpose settlement orders for purchasing of a car.
On 19 August 2002 the Yakutsk Town Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic allowed the applicant’s action. The court found that the State commodity bonds, including the special-purpose settlement orders, were to be recognised as the State internal debt, and should be settled at the expense of the federal budget. With reference to the State Commodity Bonds Act of 1995 as amended on 2 June 2000 the court noted that the compensation to the bearers of special-purpose settlement orders that gave the right to purchase passenger cars in 1993-1995 was to be paid in 2002-2003. The court awarded the applicant 115,000 Russian roubles against the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
On 18 September 2002 the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic upheld the judgment and it became final. The award remained unenforced.
According to the Government’s observations of 23 October 2008, on 16 September 2004 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic reviewed the lower courts’ judgments by way of the supervisory review proceedings, acting upon a relevant request by the respondent authority. The Presidium found that the lower courts had failed to take into account the provisions of the amended State Commodity Bonds Act and the Government’s Resolution no. 1006 and therefore had misapplied the domestic law. The Presidium annulled the judgment of 19 August 2002 and the appeal decision of 18 September 2002 and delivered a new judgment in which it dismissed the applicant’s claim in full.
On 2 June 2000, section 3 of the State Commodity Bonds Act (federal law no. 86-FZ of 1 June 1995) providing that the specialpurpose settlement orders were to be recognised as the State internal debt was amended to read, in the relevant parts, as follows:
“To set, in the [State Programme for the redemption of the State internal debt of the Russian Federation], the following sequence and terms of redemption of State commodity bonds, depending on the type of the bond:
-  in respect of bearers of special-purpose settlement orders that gave the right to purchase passenger cars in 1993-1995 – payment of monetary compensation equal to a part of the value of the car described in the order, as determined on account of the percentage of the part of the full value of car paid by the owner by 1 January 1992 (in accordance with the price scales in force until 1 January 1992), as well as the price of the cars determined in co-ordination with car manufacturers at the moment of redemption.”
On 27 December 2000 the Government approved, by Resolution no. 1006, the State Programme for the redemption of the State internal debt of the Russian Federation arising from State commodity bonds in the period of 2001-2004. Paragraph 3 of the Programme set out that the State commodity bonds were to be redeemed by way of payment of pecuniary compensation.
