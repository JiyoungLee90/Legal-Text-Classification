To assess this evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Talat Tepe v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 31247/96, \u00a7 48, 21 December 2004). Such proof may, however, follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 121, ECHR 2000IV). Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such control (see, mutatis mutandis, Maslova and Nalbandov v.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court has had particular regard to the fact that in the first hearing which was held before the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court on 30 November 2000, the judges observed that the applicant had five purple bruises on his right hand and decided that the Diyarbak\u0131r Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office should be informed of the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment.

However, according to the information in the case-file, no action whatsoever was taken by the public prosecutor on the allegations of ill-treatment that were brought to his attention. Moreover, while in his defence submissions before the trial court, the applicant stated that he had been ill-treated, the court did not take any action in response to these allegations. In this connection, the Court observes that it was only after 7 June 2007, the date on which the applicant filed a petition with the Diyarbak\u0131r Public Prosecutor, that an investigation was finally initiated into the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment allegations. In the course of the investigation, the Diyarbak\u0131r Public Prosecutor requested the Forensic Medicine Institute to prepare a medical report.
