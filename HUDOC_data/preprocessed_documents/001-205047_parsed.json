The Court of Cassation also took into account the expert reports obtained in the criminal proceedings \u2013 which had been discontinued because of the expiry of the five-year prosecution period \u2013 against the applicants for the forest trespassing offence. According to the experts heard by the criminal courts, the applicants\u2019 property fell within the boundaries of the forest corresponding to the boundary-marking exercises of 1939 and 1985. In the light of documents produced in those previous proceedings as well as the cadastral maps and application documents, the Court of Cassation held that the 1985 application exercise had not been erroneous. The Court of Cassation therefore concluded that the property in question could not be owned by private individuals in so far as it was classified as a forest and that therefore the annotation had been lawful. It went on to add that the administration always had the possibility to seek the annulment of the applicants\u2019 title deed in so far as the land cadastre of 1956 had been null and void.",

Furthermore, they argued that the Court of Cassation had not commented at all on the expert report obtained by the Ey\u00fcp Civil Court in their own proceedings. In their opinion, there were significant contradictions between the conclusions reached by experts in their case and the ones that had been taken into account by the Court of Cassation in those other proceedings. For that reason, the applicants argued that the Court of Cassation, rather than quashing the judgment on the merits, should have remitted the case back to the Ey\u00fcp Civil Court due to incomplete examination. In that connection, the applicants submitted that there had been errors in the application of the forest boundaries by the cadastral commission in 1985 and that the amendments of 2003 in the cadastre law had called for a special procedure to be followed by forest cadastral commissions to rectify the errors in forest maps. Finally, the applicants considered that the ten-year prescription period had expired in respect of the land cadastre of 1956 and that therefore the forest administration did not have a right to claim that the property could not be owned by private individuals.",

In particular, the Court reiterates that Article 6 obliges the courts to give reasons for their judgments but cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument (see Van de Hurk v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 19 April 1994, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 288). The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision. It is moreover necessary to take into account, inter alia, the diversity of the submissions that a litigant may bring before the courts and the differences existing in the Contracting States with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules, legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments. That is why the question whether a court has failed to fulfil the obligation to state reasons, deriving from Article 6, can only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case. If, however, a submission would, if accepted, be decisive for the outcome of the case, it may require a specific and express reply by the court in its judgment (see Petrovi\u0107 and Others v. Montenegro, no. 18116/15, \u00a7 41 17 July 2018 with further references).",

Relying on the information in similar proceedings regarding adjacent properties concerning the boundaries of the same forest, the Court of Cassation found it established that the area which included the applicants\u2019 land had been a forest and that there had been no errors in the subsequent application of the forest boundaries. The high court further noted that the land could not have been subject to private property on account of its forest status (see paragraph 17 above). That conclusion was also accepted by the trial court when the case was remitted to it. In view of the above, in particular in light of the reasoning adopted by the Court of Cassation, explaining that the applicants\u2019 property was within the boundaries of the forest, the Court considers that it was not necessary for the domestic courts to examine in further detail the applicants\u2019 argument based on the recent amendments to the cadastre law providing for the correction of errors committed by forest cadastral commissions. Finally, the Court notes that the Court of Cassation gave a specific reason why it dismissed the applicants\u2019 argument concerning the applicability of the prescription period (compare and contrast, Deryan v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 41721/04, \u00a7 36, 21\u00a0July 2015).",
