The administrative case against the applicant was examined in an expedited procedure under Article 277 of the CAO. The applicant was similarly taken to and kept in a police station \u2013 without any contact with the outside world \u2013 where he was presented with a charge and in several hours taken to a court and convicted. The Court therefore does not see any reason to reach a different finding in the present case and concludes that the applicant did not have a fair hearing, in particular on account of not being afforded adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence.",

While accepting this approach, I would have preferred to examine separately the complaints relating to the lack of legal assistance. The applicant alleges that he had neither been informed of his right to have a lawyer nor refused to have one (paragraph 71). For the same reasons expressed in my partly dissenting opinion in the Galstyan case, to which I refer, I find that there has been a violation of Article 6 paragraph 1 taken together with Article 6 paragraph 3 (c) also in this respect.",
