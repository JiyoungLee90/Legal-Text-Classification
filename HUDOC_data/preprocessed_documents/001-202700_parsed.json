Belgium\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a0926/05, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2010, and\u00a0Schatschaschwili v. Germany\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a09154/10, \u00a7 101, ECHR 2015). Compliance with the requirements of a fair trial must be examined in each case having regard to the development of the proceedings as a whole and not on the basis of an isolated consideration of one particular aspect or one particular incident. In evaluating the overall fairness of the proceedings, the Court will take into account, if appropriate, the minimum rights listed in Article 6 \u00a7 3, which exemplify the requirements of a fair trial in respect of typical procedural situations which arise in criminal cases. They can be viewed, therefore, as specific aspects of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings in Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, for example,\u00a0Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, \u00a7\u00a7 250-52, 13\u00a0September 2016;\u00a0G\u00e4fgen v.

While the problems raised by absent witnesses and anonymous witnesses are not identical, the two situations are not different in principle. If the defence is unaware of the identity of the person it seeks to question, it may be deprived of the very particulars enabling it to demonstrate that the witness is prejudiced, hostile or unreliable, and, just as in the case of an absent witness, may be faced with difficulties in challenging the reliability of the evidence given by the witness (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a026766/05 and 22228/06, \u00a7 127, ECHR 2011, and Scholer v. Germany, no. 14212/10, \u00a7 50, 18 December 2014). Similar considerations apply to witnesses with concealed identities (see, for example, Papadakis v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 50254/07, \u00a7\u00a7 86-95, 26\u00a0February 2013).",

By rendering the administration of justice transparent, publicity contributes to fulfilling the aim of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention. The requirement to hold a public hearing, however, is subject to exceptions. Thus, it expressly permits the press and the public to be excluded from all or part of a trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. Furthermore, it may on occasion be necessary under Article 6 to limit the open and public nature of proceedings in order, for example, to protect the safety or privacy of witnesses, or to promote the free exchange of information and opinion in the pursuit of justice. In any event, before excluding the public from criminal proceedings, the national court must make a specific finding that exclusion is necessary to protect a compelling public interest and must limit secrecy to the extent necessary to preserve that interest. It is relevant, when determining whether a decision to hold criminal proceedings in camera was compatible with the right to a public hearing under Article 6, whether public interest considerations where balanced with the need for openness, whether all evidence was disclosed to the defence and whether the proceedings as a whole were fair (see Artemov v. Russia, no. 14945/03, \u00a7 102, 3\u00a0April\u00a02014;\u00a0Welke and Bia\u0142ek v. Poland, no. 15924/05, \u00a7 77, 1\u00a0March\u00a02011; Belashev v.

The review of the counterbalancing factors is also required in cases where it finds it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless is satisfied that it carries significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness.

No evidence was at any stage adduced to substantiate the existence of any threats made against the witness or his family and a question by the defence to this end was not allowed (see paragraph 15 above). The Government\u2019s argument that the witness\u2019s fear had been justified given the applicant\u2019s notoriety, an argument not relied on by the domestic courts, is similarly unsubstantiated (compare\u00a0Ellis, Simms and Martin, cited above, \u00a7 80). Even if the notoriety of the defendant or his associates may justify the anonymity of a witness, even in the absence of any specific threat, the Court notes that the trial court did not conduct appropriate enquiries to determine whether or not there were objective grounds for fear and whether those grounds were supported by evidence (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, \u00a7 124, cited above). Accordingly, the Court cannot accept that the domestic courts examined whether there existed objective reasons in support of the fear expressed by the witness that would justify his status as a protected witness (compare Scholer, \u00a7 56, cited above).",

Furthermore, the Court notes that, in relation to the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the exclusion of the public from three hearings, the Government expressly relies on the fact that the protected witness\u2019 identity was already known to the applicant and maybe to some other persons from his surroundings. Considering these circumstances, it remains unclear how concealing the witness\u2019s identity from the defence alleviated any fear on the part of the witness, irrespective of whether the fear had been objectively justified or not. This is further underlined by the prosecutions\u2019 reliance on audio and video evidence recording the circumstances and location of the meetings between the applicant and witness 3-1. The fact that the applicant failed to appeal against the decision assigning the witness protected status (see paragraph 7 above) cannot lead to a different conclusion, especially given the dismissal of his objections in this regard during the proceedings (see paragraph 15 above). The Court reiterates that while the absence of good reason for the non-disclosure of the identity of the witness in cannot of itself be conclusive of the unfairness of a trial, it is a very important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the overall fairness of a trial, and one which may tip the balance in favour of finding a breach of Article 6 (see, mutatis mutandis, Schatschaschwili, \u00a7 113, cited above).",

The Court observes that the audio and video recordings served to establish similar factual circumstances to those described in witness 3-1\u2019s testimony, namely, the place and time at which the money exchanged hands and its purpose. However, given that the trial court \u201cconfirmed beyond doubt\u201d the purpose for which the money was given on the basis of that witness\u2019s testimony, which was considered to be of particular gravity, it appears to have given that witness\u2019s testimony particular weight (see paragraphs 16 and 19 above). Therefore, even if it cannot be said that witness 3-1\u2019s testimony constituted either \u201csole\u201d or \u201cdecisive\u201d evidence, it certainly carried significant weight for the outcome of the case.",
