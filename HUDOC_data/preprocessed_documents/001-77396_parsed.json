The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances.

The officers of the local department of the interior were present at the site in early April 2000 and an investigation was opened one week later. Already such a substantial delay in opening of the investigation into a very serious crime could not but affect the future effectiveness of the proceedings. Once the investigation began, it continued to be plagued by inexplicable delays. The Court notes that majority of the documents in the case-file were produced in July 2003, after the case had been communicated to the respondent Government, and more than three years after both the events in question and the opening of the proceedings. The steps that were taken in July 2003 included such crucial steps as identification and questioning of witnesses, an additional examination of the site and the attempts to identify the military units that could have been involved in the murders. The results of the ballistic expert reports were only sent out to the relevant authorities in July 2003, even though they were available already in June 2000. It is obvious that these measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and certainly as soon as the investigation had commenced. The Court reiterates that it is crucial in cases of deaths in contentious situations for the investigation to be prompt. The passage of time will inevitably erode the amount and quality of the evidence available and the appearance of a lack of diligence will cast doubt on the good faith of the investigative efforts, as well as dragging out the ordeal for the members of the family (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).

These documents contained hardly any significant information about the state of the bodies or the type of injuries and clearly cannot be called compatible with the requirement of thoroughness expected from an authority charged with law-enforcement tasks.

However, as noted above, the applicants were entirely excluded from the proceedings. Contrary to the usual practice under national law, they were not granted the official status of victims in criminal proceedings, a procedural role which would have entitled them to intervene during the course of the investigation. Thus, it is unclear how they could have made use of this provision. Even assuming that they could, the decisions to adjourn the investigation were any way repeatedly quashed by the supervising prosecutors who instructed the investigation to take certain steps \u2013 but these orders were not complied with. The Court is thus not persuaded that an appeal by the applicants would have been able to remedy the defects in the proceedings.

The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed.

This possibility cannot be excluded, given the similar circumstances of the deaths in both cases \u2013 residents were shot with machine-guns in their houses or in the courtyards and the houses were set on fire \u2013 and the proximity of Novye Aldy to the applicants' house. The Government dismissed this link in their observations, without explaining why. In the documents submitted to the Court no linkage can be traced to the investigation in the Novye Aldy case and it is therefore difficult to evaluate the validity of this conclusion.
