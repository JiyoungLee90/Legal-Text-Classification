Referring to section 32(3) of the Land Ownership Act, it found that some of the plots had been assigned to different owners pursuant to the 1948 Act, and that these owners, being natural persons, had proved their property rights by showing their deeds of assignment. The Land Office based its decisions on the following documents: the decision of the former Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav State Notary (st\u00e1tn\u00ed not\u00e1\u0159stv\u00ed) of 26 May 1977 on the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s inheritance, the decision of the former Doksy District National Council of 7\u00a0June 1949 on the expropriation of the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s property, the record of the former L\u00edny Local National Council (m\u00edstn\u00ed n\u00e1rodn\u00ed v\u00fdbor) of 7 November 1949 on the proceedings on the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s appeal against the expropriation, the decision of the former Liberec Regional National Council (krajsk\u00fd n\u00e1rodn\u00ed v\u00fdbor) of 29 November 1949 by which the decision of expropriation had been modified, and an extract (v\u00fdpis) from the land register (pozemkov\u00e1 kniha) relating to the L\u00edny and Kr\u00e1sn\u00e1 Ves Districts.

Moreover, the Constitutional Court in its above decision, which was adopted in full knowledge of the Land Office\u2019s decision of 25 July 1995, did not suggest that different considerations might apply as regards a possible judicial review of that latter decision. In these circumstances, the Court cannot attach weight to the allegedly different character of the two administrative decisions of the Land Office underlined by the Government (see paragraph 46). It recalls that section 250(f) of the Code of Civil Procedure was still in force at the relevant time and the Constitutional Court indeed found its application in the applicant\u2019s case to be unobjectionable.",

It must also be shown that the costs were actually and necessarily incurred and that they are reasonable as to quantum (see, among other authorities, the Philis v. Greece (no. 1) judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 209, p. 25, \u00a7 74, and the Nikolova v. Bulgaria judgment of 25 March 1999, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, p. 227, \u00a7 79). The Court notes that Mr Bou\u010dek confirmed that his uncle\u2019s expenses relating to the proceedings before the Convention institutions were covered by the legal aid which had been awarded to him by the Commission. It also notes that the costs in the inheritance proceedings could not have been incurred in order to prevent or rectify a violation affecting the restitution proceedings. It considers therefore that it should reject this part of the claim. With regard to the costs of Mr Bou\u010dek\u2019s representation before the Convention organs, the Court recalls that it does not regard itself bound by domestic scales and practices, although it may derive some assistance from them (see, among many other authorities, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13\u00a0July 1995, Series A no.\u00a0316, p. 83, \u00a7 77, and the Baskaya and Ok\u00e7uo\u011flu v. Turkey judgment of 8\u00a0July 1999, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1999-IV, \u00a7\u00a098). Noting that the application has been only partly successful and deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant\u2019s nephew in aggregate the sum of CZK 85,000[] in legal costs and expenses for the proceedings before the Commission and the Court, less the 4,100 French francs received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe, such sum to be paid, according to the wish expressed by the applicant\u2019s nephew, into his lawyer\u2019s bank account in the Czech Republic.",
