If a child affected with a genetic problem was born as a result of failure to carry out genetic testing, a claim for just satisfaction (zado\u015b\u0107uczynienie) arose on the parent\u2019s part. The lower courts had erred in that they had found that there was no adequate causal link between the doctors\u2019 conduct in the applicant\u2019s case and the fact that she had not had access to legal abortion. In this respect the court noted that there had been enough time between the 18th week of the pregnancy, when the suspicions had arisen, and the 22nd, when the time-limit for legal abortion had expired, to carry out genetic testing. When the tests had finally been carried out, the applicant had received the results two weeks later. The tests should therefore have been carried out immediately after the suspicions had arisen, but instead, as a result of procrastination on the part of doctors S.B., G.S. and K.R., they had ultimately been conducted much later.",

In such circumstances, the hospital was under an obligation to carry out tests in order to either confirm or dispel these suspicions, but had failed to do so. Other tests had been carried out instead, concerning a possible inflammatory condition of the foetus, which were irrelevant for the diagnosis of Turner syndrome. The hospital had exposed the applicant to unnecessary stress, while the correct diagnosis had not been made. The defendants had been aware that time was of the essence in the availability of legal abortion, but had failed to accelerate their decision-taking. The hospitals were liable for the negligent acts of their employees in so far as it was their duty to provide the applicant with full information about any genetic disorder of the foetus and how it might affect its development and to do so in time for her to prepare herself for the prospect of giving birth to a child with a genetic disorder.

In this regard, the question whether an applicant can claim to be a victim of the violation alleged is relevant at all stages of the proceedings under the Convention (see, inter alia, Siliadin v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a073316/01, \u00a7\u00a061, ECHR 2005-VII, and Scordino v.

An applicant\u2019s status as a victim of a breach of the Convention may depend on compensation being awarded at domestic level on the basis of the facts about which he or she complains before the Court (see Normann v. Denmark (dec.), no. 44704/98, 14\u00a0June 2001; and Jensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark (dec.), no. 52620/99, 20\u00a0March 2003).

The applicant\u2019s victim status also depends on whether the domestic authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, the breach of the Convention. Only when those two conditions are satisfied does the subsidiary nature of the protective mechanism of the Convention preclude examination of an application (see Eckle v.

Following that scan the applicant feared that the foetus was affected with a genetic disorder and that, in the light of the results of subsequent scans her fears cannot be said to have been without foundation. She tried, repeatedly and with perseverance, through numerous visits to doctors and through her written requests and complaints, to obtain access to genetic tests which would have provided her with information confirming or dispelling her fears; to no avail. For weeks she was made to believe that she would undergo the necessary tests. She was repeatedly sent to various doctors, clinics and hospitals far from her home and even hospitalised for several days for no clear clinical purpose (see paragraph 20 above). The Court finds that the determination of whether the applicant should have access to genetic testing, recommended by doctors in light of the findings of the second ultrasound scan, was marred by procrastination, confusion and lack of proper counselling and information given to the applicant.",

Whilst Article\u00a08 contains no explicit procedural requirements, it is important for the effective enjoyment of the rights guaranteed by this provision that the relevant decisionmaking process is fair and such as to afford due respect for the interests safeguarded by it. What has to be determined is whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and notably the nature of the decisions to be taken, an individual has been involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, to a degree sufficient to provide her or him with the requisite protection of their interests (see, mutatis mutandis, W. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 8\u00a0July 1987, Series A no.\u00a0121, pp.\u00a02829, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a062 and\u00a064).

The present case differs from cases where the applicants complained about denial of or difficulties in obtaining access to certain health services for reasons of insufficient funding or availability. The Court has already found that it has not been argued, let alone shown, that there were any objective reasons why the genetic tests were not carried out immediately after the suspicions as to the foetus\u2019 condition had arisen but only after a lengthy delay (see paragraph\u00a0154 above). The difficulties the applicant experienced seem to have been caused, in part, by reticence on the part of certain doctors involved to issue a referral, and also by a certain organisational and administrative confusion in the health system at the material time as to the procedure applicable in cases of patients seeking services available outside their particular region of the then Medical Insurance Fund and the modalities of reimbursement between the regions of costs incurred in connection with such services.",

Hence, access to full and reliable information on the foetus\u2019 health is not only important for the comfort of the pregnant woman but also a necessary prerequisite for a legally permitted possibility to have an abortion to arise.",

In the Court\u2019s view this is wholly irrelevant for the assessment of the case at hand, given that the legal obligation to secure access to pre-natal genetic testing arose under the provisions of the 1993\u00a0Act regardless of the nature and severity of the suspected condition (see paragraph\u00a066 above).",

The Court notes that the Supreme Court criticised the conduct of the medical professionals who had been involved in the applicant\u2019s case and the procrastination shown in deciding whether to give the applicant a referral for genetic tests. Such a critical assessment on the part of the highest domestic judicial authority is certainly, in the Court\u2019s view, of relevance for the overall assessment of the circumstances of the case.",

Firstly, they can simply dispel the suspicion that the foetus was affected with some malformation; secondly, a woman carrying the foetus concerned can well choose to carry the pregnancy to term and have the baby; thirdly, in some cases (although not in the present one), prenatal diagnosis of an ailment makes it possible to embark on prenatal treatment; fourthly, even in the event of a negative diagnosis, it gives the woman and her family time to prepare for the birth of a baby affected with an ailment, in terms of counselling and coping with the stress occasioned by such a diagnosis. Furthermore, the Court emphasises that the 1993 Act clearly provides for a possibility of abortion in cases of certain malformations. It is not in dispute that some of these malformations could only be detected by way of prenatal genetic tests. Therefore the Government\u2019s argument has failed to convince the Court.",

In the Tysi\u0105c case the Court emphasised that where, as in Poland, abortion was permitted on the grounds that the pregnancy endangered the mother\u2019s life or health, Article 8 required that domestic law should provide effective procedural mechanisms capable of determining whether the conditions existed for obtaining a lawful abortion in situations where a pregnant woman had objective grounds for fearing that the pregnancy or delivery would have a serious negative impact on her health.",

In the first place, it was not, as in Tysi\u0105c, risks to the applicant\u2019s own life or health resulting from the pregnancy which were in issue in the present case but rather the fear that the foetus was suffering from irreversible damage. The primary and immediate concern of the applicant was to obtain an accurate medical diagnosis of the condition of the foetus, which would in turn have made it possible to determine whether or not the conditions for a lawful abortion applied in the applicant\u2019s case. According to the ultrasound scans performed in the 14th and 18th week of the applicant\u2019s pregnancy, the foetus appeared to be suffering from an unidentified congenital defect. Genetic testing by way of amniocentesis was recommended to confirm or dispel this suspicion and to identify the nature and seriousness of any foetal defect. Despite her persistent efforts, the applicant did not succeed in obtaining the required genetic tests until the 23rd week of her pregnancy and, even then, had to wait for a further two weeks before the results of the tests revealed the presence in the foetus of Turner syndrome, by which time it was in any event too late for an abortion to be carried out. It is the denial of prompt access to a medical diagnosis of vital importance to the applicant and the lack of any procedural mechanism to ensure that such a diagnosis was not so impeded or delayed as to deprive the applicant of any possibility of a lawful termination of her pregnancy that is at the heart of her complaint under Article\u00a08 of the Convention.",

The Government place reliance, however, on the fact that the applicant ultimately obtained access to a prenatal genetic examination as she had requested and that, as the examination confirmed, the condition from which the foetus was found to be suffering did not in any event qualify as a severe or life-threatening condition which would have entitled her to a lawful termination. This to my mind is to take too narrow a view of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Article. Whether or not the prenatal test had shown that the foetus was severely and irreversibly damaged or suffered from an incurable life-threatening ailment for the purposes of the 1993\u00a0Act, the provision of effective access to accurate information on the condition of a foetus is unquestionably a vital element of the health and well-being of a woman during pregnancy and forms an integral part of her private life protected by that Article. The importance of prompt access to such information is further reinforced in a case such as the present, where delays in the provision of information seriously restrict the ability of the woman concerned to make an informed decision as to whether or not to seek a termination of her pregnancy.",

What must have appeared to the applicant to be a deliberate attempt to place obstacles in the way of discovering the precise condition of the foetus and thereby to deprive her any possibility of a lawful termination, can only have added to the sense of anxiety and frustration felt by a person in an already vulnerable state.",

This, in my view, is to extend the scope of that Article too far. It is true that the applicant was, to use the words of the judgment, \u201cshabbily treated\u201d by the doctors dealing with her case. At every turn, her repeated efforts to obtain the genetic tests which she was advised were necessary, and to which she was clearly entitled, were frustrated. It is true, too, that the Supreme Court was strongly critical of the manner in which the applicant\u2019s case had been treated, awarding damages to her for the distress, anxiety and humiliation she had been required to endure. However, it is also true that the threshold of Article 3 is and must remain a high one and that treatment must attain a minimum level of severity, if it is to fall within the scope of the Article. The circumstances of the present case are in my view far removed from those of physical or mental ill-treatment by officials of the State or degrading conditions of detention which have traditionally been the subject of findings of a violation of the Article. I can readily accept that in the weeks in which she awaited an accurate diagnosis, the applicant suffered intense anxiety and that this can only have been added to by what must have appeared to be the callous and obstructive attitude of the doctors. However, I do not consider that in all the circumstances of the case the applicant was subjected to degrading treatment for the purposes of Article\u00a03 of the Convention. The judgment seeks to draw an analogy in this regard with cases of enforced disappearances, where the responsible authorities systematically prevaricate or provide false information to applicants about the whereabouts and fate of their missing relatives. I am not persuaded that any true analogy can be drawn between such treatment, or the suffering and distress thereby caused, and the actions of the health professionals in the present case, prompted as they may have been to deter the applicant from pursuing the possibility of a termination of her pregnancy.",

Indeed, this case, like Tysia\u00e7 (Tysiac v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a05410/03, 20 March 2007), has in part been presented by the applicant, and the judgment approved by the majority has similarly been put together, in such a way as if this was an \u201cabortion\u201d case, or a case about the \u201cright\u201d to have an abortion. This is not so. Polish law allows a woman to seek an abortion in the narrowly defined circumstances envisaged in Section 4(a) of \u201cthe 1993 Act\u201d (see para.\u00a067 of the judgment). One may agree or disagree with that provision of law, but there is nothing this Court can do about it in the instant case; and indeed this Court has not been called upon to do anything about it. What this Court has been called upon to examine is whether, from the moment that there was some indication that the child the applicant was carrying might be suffering from some form of deformity or malformation, the treatment she received at the hands of the health care professionals with whom she came into contact was in breach of her fundamental human rights as protected by the Convention.",

                        "content": "3.\u00a0\u00a0In its judgment of 11 July 2008 the Polish Supreme Court (see paragraphs 52 to 54) held, in substance, that the applicant, as a patient, had the right to be referred in a proper and efficient manner for the necessary genetic testing so that she could have the necessary information as soon as possible about her unborn child\u2019s health. That court likewise held that there were no legal or medical grounds on which to automatically link genetic testing with access to abortion under the 1993 Act. The facts, however, show that the applicant, who as a woman with child must be regarded as a vulnerable person in view of her condition (and irrespective of whether or not the child she was carrying had any abnormality), was subjected to what can best be described as a string of constructive prevarications by the health care professionals in question, and was shoved from pillar to post for several weeks, presumably because the doctors involved suspected that if the results were to show that the unborn child was affected with some malformation, she would request an abortion. Now, apart from the fact that it is very doubtful whether a child suffering from Turner syndrome can be described as \u201cseverely damaged\u201d or as \u201csuffering from an incurable life-threatening ailment\u201d for the purposes of the abovementioned Section\u00a04(a) of the 1993 Act, the doctors concerned were perfectly entitled, on grounds of conscientious objection, to refuse to terminate the life of the unborn child by performing an abortion or, indeed, even to refuse to refer the applicant for an abortion. What they were not entitled to do was to keep her in the dark and increase her distress and anxiety to such an extent that she was prepared to ask for an abortion \u2013 her appel de d\u00e9tresse \u2013 even without a proper diagnostic finding (see paragraphs 17 and 30). Instead of providing the necessary care and, above all, support to the parents who were facing the possible birth of a handicapped child, the system worked to push the applicant to take an extreme measure \u2013 the same measure that the doctors wanted to avoid. To that extent the Court\u2019s conclusions in paragraphs 159 to 161 are unimpeachable.",

In Tysia\u00e7, it will be recalled, the woman had requested an abortion because she claimed that otherwise her health \u2013 her eyesight \u2013 would suffer. The Court found that, once that a woman could in certain circumstances under Polish law ask for the termination of her unborn child\u2019s life to preserve her own health, when a referral was refused by the medical profession there had to be a procedure before an independent body competent to review that refusal to terminate the pregnancy and to review the relevant evidence; a procedure in which the pregnant woman could be heard in person, and where written grounds for the decision would be given (Tysia\u00e7 \u00a7117). For reasons which are still not entirely clear to me, the Court in that case chose to examine the issue under Article 8 instead of under Article 6. The very limited issue involved in that case was highlighted in the separate opinion of Judge Bonello: \u201cThe decision in this case related to a country which had already made medical abortion legally available in certain specific situations of fact. The Court was only called upon to decide whether in cases of conflicting views ... as to whether the conditions to obtain a legal abortion were satisfied or not, effective mechanisms capable of determining the issue were in place. My vote for finding a violation goes no further than that.\u201d Even in the instant case the matter should, if at all, have been further examined under Article 6 and not under Article 8.",

Notwithstanding all the \u201cevolutive interpretations\u201d of the Convention adopted by the Court, when it comes to the right to life of the unborn child the Court has been exceptionally pusillanimous, with only cursory references hinting at some form of protection (see, for instance, Odi\u00e8vre v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a042326/98 13\u00a0February 2003, \u00a7\u00a045), the Court in most cases preferring to avoid the issue (Vo v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a053924/00, 8\u00a0July 2004, \u00a7\u00a085) or to invoke the \u201cmargin of appreciation\u201d doctrine (as in Boso v.\u00a0Italy (dec.) no.\u00a050490/99, 5\u00a0September 2002). The Court, moreover, seems not to be giving the proper weight and importance to the clear proposition made by the Commission in its report of 12\u00a0July 1977 in the case Br\u00fcggemann and Scheuten v.\u00a0 (Application no.\u00a06959/75) to the effect that \u201c...pregnancy cannot be said to pertain uniquely to the sphere of private life. Whenever a woman is pregnant her private life becomes closely connected with the developing foetus\u201d (\u00a7\u00a059). So we continue to drag Article\u00a08 into the fray, making things \u201cconfused worse confounded\u201d.
