The case originated in twelve applications (nos. 55003/16, 55165/16, 55199/16, 58368/16, 14938/17, 20906/17, 22606/17, 25312/17, 61028/17, 61340/17, 77837/17 and 77858/17) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”). The applicants’ personal details are set out in the appendix to this judgment.
The applicants were represented by lawyers indicated in the appendix to this judgment. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 13 July 2018 the applicants’ complaints concerning the delayed enforcement of final judgments in their favour and the existence of an effective remedy in that regard were communicated to the Government and the remainder of their applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants were employed by Fabrika reznog alata, a socially/State-owned company based in Čačak (hereinafter – “the debtor”).
The applicants obtained final court decisions ordering the debtor to pay them their salaries plus default interest and costs and expenses. The essential information as to the domestic proceedings in respect of each application is indicated in the appendix to this judgment.
Between 22 December 2014 and 4 December 2015 the Kragujevac Court of Appeal (Apelacioni sud u Kragujevcu) and the Čačak High Court (Viši sud u Čačku) found that the applicants’ right to a trial within a reasonable time had been violated and awarded them between 100 and 400 euros (EUR) each in respect of non-pecuniary damage (see the appendix to this judgment). They further ordered the Čačak Court of First Instance (Osnovni sud u Čačku) to speed up the enforcement proceedings.
All the applicants complained to the Supreme Court of Cassation about the amount of the awards. The Supreme Court of Cassation rejected their appeals.
Between 12 May 2016 and 6 July 2017 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the applicants’ right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions and ordered that the sums awarded in the domestic decisions mentioned in paragraph 6 above be paid directly by the State. Furthermore, it held that the sums awarded in respect of non-pecuniary damage were reasonable.
The impugned judgments were enforced shortly thereafter.
