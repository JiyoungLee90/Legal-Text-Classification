The Court notes in this context that while Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 obliges the courts to give reasons for their judgments, it cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument adduced by a litigant. The extent to which the duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision at issue. It is moreover necessary to take into account, inter alia, the diversity of the submissions that a litigant may bring before the courts and the differences existing in the Contracting States with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules, legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments. That is why the question whether a court has failed to fulfil the obligation to state reasons, deriving from Article 6 of the Convention, can only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see the Ruiz Torija v. Spain judgment of 9\u00a0December 1994, Series A no.\u00a0303-A, p.\u00a012, \u00a7 29). ",

It would appear to the Court that the Supreme Administrative Court in reaching its decisions incorporated the reasons given by the Cathedral Chapter for the latter\u2019s own decisions on these issues. It is significant in this respect that the decisions of the Cathedral Chapter were appended to both appeal decisions which the Supreme Administrative Court delivered. Whether or not the reasoning by incorporation technique used by the Supreme Administrative Court satisfied the requirements of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention in the circumstances of the instant case must be answered accordingly by reference to the grounds invoked by the Cathedral Chapter to reject the evidence adduced by the applicant and to dismiss his complaints.

It was the clear conclusion of the Cathedral Chapter in its June 1990 decision (see paragraph 16 above) that the Parish Board lacked the competence to transform a post from a full-time to a part-time one and that any decision taken by the Parish Board with respect to the applicant\u2019s post only served as a confirmation of his working hours for the purposes of the application of the new collective agreement arrangements. It is to be noted in this respect that the Cathedral Chapter had due regard to the documents produced in the proceedings but did not consider them to be sufficient to support the applicant\u2019s assertions that the 1966 decision established a full-time post of verger (see paragraph 16 above). It is also to be observed that the reasoning of the Cathedral Chapter goes further than that used by the Parish Council in its October 1989 decision since the latter decision does not refer to the Parish Board\u2019s lack of competence to change the nature of a post. Having regard to the requirements of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 the Court finds no fault with the way in which the Cathedral Chapter dealt with the evidence before it nor with the adequacy of the reasons which it adduced to ground its rejection of the applicant\u2019s appeal.",

As to that issue, the applicant sought to adduce evidence that he had worked a forty-hour week since assuming the office of verger in 1966. However the Cathedral Chapter, in full cognisance of the written evidence presented by the applicant, concluded that that evidence did not substantiate his claim especially since he ran a funeral home alongside his duties as verger, a factor which would have a bearing on the calculation of the hours worked. The Court considers that the reasons given by the Cathedral Chapter for confirming the level of compensation fixed by the Parish Council and its evaluation of the evidence before it cannot be criticised from the standpoint of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01.",

It is true that in upholding the Cathedral Chapter\u2019s decisions and appending those decisions to its own decisions the Supreme Administrative Court gave the applicant some clue as to what the reasons for its decisions were. However, in view of the fact that the reasoning of the Cathedral Chapter was rather categorical and brief, the Supreme Administrative Court should not have restricted itself, as it did twice, to holding that \u201cthe Court finds no reason to alter the decision\u201d; the less so since it had not granted the applicant an oral hearing. The \u201cnational traditions and practices\u201d referred to by the Delegate of the Commission do not in my opinion constitute sufficient justification for the imperfection of the reasoning. Given especially that there is some doubt about whether the Cathedral Chapter might be considered an independent and impartial tribunal in the sense of Article 6, in which case the Supreme Administrative Court was the first and only such tribunal to adjudicate on the applicant\u2019s claim with full competence to review the Cathedral Chapter\u2019s decisions, it was important that the former showed that a full review had indeed been carried out.",
