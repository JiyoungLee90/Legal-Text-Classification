To that end, although redress may consist of pecuniary compensation in certain cases, given that the applicant in the present case did not seek such compensation, the Court considers it appropriate to examine whether the measures taken by the authorities to investigate the allegations and, if appropriate, identify and punish those responsible, could be regarded as providing redress in the circumstances of the case. In this connection, the Court will also have regard to the extent to which the national courts may be considered to have submitted the case before them to the scrupulous examination required by Article 3 of the Convention in order to maintain the deterrent power of the judicial system and the important role it plays in upholding the prohibition of ill-treatment (see, mutatis mutandis, Okkal\u0131 v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 52067/99, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 2006XII).",

This is essential for maintaining the public\u2019s confidence in, and support for, the rule of law and for preventing any appearance of the authorities\u2019 tolerance of or collusion in unlawful acts (see Okkal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 65; T\u00fcrkmen v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 43124/98, \u00a7 51, 19 December 2006; see also, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

If when that Law entered into force the defendants had already been convicted, the execution of their sentences was suspended. In its judgments concerning such issues, the Court has considered that suspension of the proceedings or execution of the punishment is comparable to a partial amnesty. It has held that such suspensions are measures which cannot be considered permissible under its jurisprudence since, as a result, the convicted officers enjoy virtual impunity despite their conviction (see Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran v. Turkey, no. 42942/02, \u00a7 69, 8 April 2008 and the cases cited therein).",

Subsequently, in a number of judgments the Court has observed that the sentences imposed on law enforcement officials for ill-treatment or unlawful killing have first been reduced to below two years by the trial courts, and then the pronouncement of their sentences suspended altogether. The Court has found that suspension of the pronouncement of a judgment has a stronger effect than the deferral of the execution of a sentence, and results in the impunity of the perpetrators. For the Court, such practice suggests that the national judges exercise their discretion to minimise the consequences of extremely serious unlawful acts rather than show that such acts can in no way be tolerated (see Taylan, \u00a7 46; Eski, \u00a7 36; B\u00f6ber, \u00a7 35; and Kasap, \u00a7\u00a060, all cited above).",

For example, the Court held in the case of Bat\u0131 and Others v.

That assessment will not only enable the Court to determine whether or not the national authorities did all they could to provide the applicants with adequate redress by prosecuting and punishing the persons responsible for their ill-treatment, but will also allow it to decide whether or not the same authorities complied with their separate and freestanding procedural obligation to act promptly and with reasonable expedition (see Bat\u0131 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 136).",

One such hearing, which was scheduled to take place immediately before the proceedings were to become time-barred, was postponed because of the failure of the defendants\u2019 lawyers to attend, in breach of the national legislation (see paragraph\u00a069 above). Moreover, the Court cannot but note that the trial court held its hearings very infrequently; in the course of the trial which lasted for a period of just over five years between 7 October 2004 and 29 December 2009, twenty-one hearings were held, thereby averaging one hearing every three months.",

The importance of doing so is well evidenced in the present application, where the police officers who ill-treated the applicants \u2013 in particular police chief K.\u015e.S. \u2013 used their powers to stall the investigation by failing to reply to the prosecutor\u2019s requests for a long period of time and by putting pressure on the applicants.",

The Court notes in this connection that the applicants, after having overcome the hurdles put in their way by the defendant police officers, managed to reappoint their own lawyer who took part in each of the twenty-one hearings and represented them. In the transcripts of those hearings, the applicants were referred to as the interveners and their lawyer as counsel of record (see paragraphs 53 and 59 above). No authority, not even the trial court, questioned the applicants\u2019 standing in those proceedings. To the contrary, the lawyer was able to make oral submissions before the trial court and submit written observations. Nevertheless, the Court of Cassation refused to examine the pertinent points raised by the applicants in their appeal. For the Court, the conclusion reached by that court sums up the attitude displayed by the judiciary throughout the criminal proceedings towards the two children who were ill-treated in police custody.",

In this connection, the Court must also emphasise that the characterisation or lack of characterisation given by a State to a factual situation cannot decisively affect the Court\u2019s conclusion as to the existence of a deprivation of liberty (see Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, \u00a7 92, 23 February 2012). Thus, the fact that both the national authorities and subsequently the respondent Government considered that the applicants had not been arrested but had been kept in a police station as \u201cstatement makers\u201d or as witnesses does not automatically mean that they were not deprived of their liberty since, regardless of its purpose, the deprivation of liberty must be lawful.",

Turkey, no. 25656/94, \u00a7 372, 18 June 2002, and Er and Others v. Turkey, no. 23016/04, \u00a7 69, 31 July 2012). The serious deficiencies in the keeping of such records, according to the Court, attested to the absence of effective measures to safeguard individuals in detention against the risk of disappearance (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 313 and 372). In those cases the Court also refused to entertain the unsatisfactory and arbitrary distinctions drawn by the respondent Government between being taken into custody and being taken in for the purposes of assisting the military (see \u00c7i\u00e7ek v.
