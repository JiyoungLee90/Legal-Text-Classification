He stated that in  there was no opportunity for detainees to challenge their conditions of detention effectively before the domestic authorities. On the merits, he contested the Government's submissions as untrustworthy and false. In particular, if, as the Government argued, remand centre IZ-77/2 had accommodated 3,194 inmates whilst its capacity was 2,120 persons, the applicant could not have possibly been afforded 4 square metres of cell space but had been afforded less than 2 square metres. Furthermore, from the cell space of a particular cell one was to deduct the space used for the cell amenities \u2013 such as bunks, the table and the toilet, which left even less cell space per detainee. The applicant and the other detainees had had to sleep in shifts because there had not been enough bunks. The applicant further stated that, contrary to the Government's assertion, he had not been provided with bedding, the windows in his cells had been covered with metal shutters and he had had to sleep in his jacket because it had been extremely cold in winter.",

In that respect the Court firstly notes that it is for the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that an effective remedy was available in theory and in practice at the relevant time; that is to say, that the remedy was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see, among other authorities, Kohlhofer and Minarik v. the Czech Republic, nos.\u00a032921/03, 28464/04 and 5344/05, \u00a7 77, 15 October 2009). However, the Government have not specified with sufficient clarity the type of complaint which would have been an effective remedy in their view, nor have they provided any further information as to how such a complaint could have prevented the alleged violation or its continuation or provided the applicant with adequate redress. Moreover, in a number of judgments the Court has held that the problem of overcrowding was of a structural nature and thus did not concern the applicants' personal situation (see Guliyev v. Russia, no. 24650/02, \u00a7 34, 19 June 2008; Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004; and Kalashnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 47095/99, ECHR 2001-XI (extracts)). In sum, the Court considers that the Government have not substantiated their claim that the remedy or remedies the applicant allegedly failed to exhaust were effective ones (see, among other authorities, Kranz v. Poland, no. 6214/02, \u00a7 23, 17 February 2004). It therefore considers that the applicant's complaints under Article 3 cannot be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies.",

In particular, he complains on account of the allegedly severe overcrowding in his cells, which existed, according to him, throughout the whole period of his detention in the above-mentioned facilities, as from 28 August 2002. Bearing this in mind, the Court considers that the continuous nature of the applicant's detention on remand and his almost identical description of the general conditions of his detention in both facilities and the allegation of severe overcrowding as the main characteristics of the conditions of his detention warrant examining his detention in the above mentioned time span without dividing it into separate periods (see Igor Ivanov v.

Hence, those certificates are of little evidential value to the Court (see Belashev v. Russia, no. 28617/03, \u00a7 52, 4 December 2008). However, if the registration logs still exist, the Court finds it peculiar that the Government preferred to rely on the director's certificates to support their allegations concerning the conditions of the applicant's detention when it was open to them to submit copies of registration logs showing the names of inmates detained with the applicant (see ibid.).",

Thus, it appears that the number of detainees exceeded the detention facility's capacity by one-and-a-half times. Against this background and the applicant's submission that conditions of his detention from 17 to 28 August 2002 had been satisfactory, it was particularly important that the Government produced the relevant documents to support their submission that the applicant had not been subsequently held in severe overcrowding, as alleged.",

It is particularly difficult in a case where personal suffering, whether physical or mental, is the subject of the claim. There is no standard by which pain and suffering, physical discomfort and mental distress and anguish can be measured in monetary terms. The Court has no doubt that the domestic courts in the present case, with, as pointed out by the Government, every desire to be just and eminently reasonable, attempted to assess the level of physical suffering, emotional distress, anxiety or other harmful effects sustained by the applicant as a result of the treatment to which he had been subjected (see Shilbergs, cited above, \u00a7 76).",
