The applicant had argued that he wanted to obtain his divorce beforehand in order to be able to remarry and to provide financial security for his new family. The court, relying on Article 628 of the Code of Civil Procedure, found that the refusal to separate the proceedings had delayed the decision on the divorce petition. This did not, however, cause undue hardship to the applicant, as he had caused the delays. By lodging an unfounded criminal and disciplinary complaint against Judge R. he had caused the latter to consider himself biased. Following the change of judges, he had pursued his unfounded requests for rectification of the record. He had then applied for apportionment of the increase in the spouses\u2019 assets during the marriage, which had further prolonged the proceedings for an unspecified period of time.",

Moreover, by lodging his request to apportion the increase in the spouses\u2019 assets during their marriage only at an advanced stage of the proceedings, he delayed the District Court\u2019s decision on custody, which the latter had decided to take at the same time as that on divorce and all other ancillary matters. The fact that the applicant lodged an appeal against the District Court\u2019s partial judgment which he subsequently withdrew also prolonged the proceedings. Furthermore, having regard to the applicant\u2019s submissions to the District Court of 1 June 1999 and of 9 August 2001 (see paragraphs 12 and 29 above), the Court is satisfied that the applicant lodged a request by reference to Article 623 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

As the Government essentially admitted themselves, the proceedings had been delayed at first instance following the hearing in September 1998 until May\u00a01999 and had not been examined on the merits between November\u00a01999 and December 2000. Furthermore, the proceedings had not been furthered between January 2002 and March 2003 following two changes in the judge to whom the case was assigned. Moreover, as indicated above, the decision on custody alone was delayed due to the fact that the District Court, as provided by the Code of Civil Procedure, took a decision on the divorce and all ancillary matters simultaneously. The Court reiterates in this connection that Article 6 \u00a7 1 imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see, among many other authorities, S\u00fc\u00dfmann \nv. Germany, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 55, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV; Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7 183, ECHR 2006V; and Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2006V). The Court accepts that it may, as a rule, be in the interest of the proper administration of justice to decide on all matters linked to the divorce of a couple simultaneously. Nevertheless, it finds that special diligence was required because of the decision on custody (compare, inter alia, Nuutinen v. Finland, no. 32842/96, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2000VIII, and Niederb\u00f6ster \nv. Germany, no. 39547/98, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2003IV (extracts)) as excessive duration of custody proceedings may lead to a de facto decision on custody for reasons of continuity. In view of the foregoing, the length of the custody proceedings failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.",
