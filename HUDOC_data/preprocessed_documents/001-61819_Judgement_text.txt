The case originated in six applications (nos. 73562/01, 73565/01, 73712/01, 73744/01, 73972/01 and 73973/01) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by six Moldovan nationals, Mr Pavel Sîrbu, Mr Petru Bragoi, Mr Vitalie Cornovan, Mr Gheorghe Bragoi, Mr Alexandru Usatîi and Mr Iulian Guştiuc (“the applicants”), on 10 April 2001.
The applicants were represented by Mr Ştefan Urîtu, of the Moldovan Helsinki Committee. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Vitalie Pârlog.
The applicants complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that, because of the non-enforcement of the judgments of 1 August 1997 and 18 August 1997, their right to have their civil rights determined by a court had been violated and that they had been unable to enjoy their possessions, and thus their right to protection of property under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention was violated. The applicants also relied on Article 10 of the Convention.
The applications were allocated to the Fourth Section. On 4 February 2003 a Chamber of that Section decided to communicate the applications to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
On 20 January 2004 a Chamber of the Fourth Section decided to join the applications in accordance with Rule 42 (1) of the Rules of the Court.
The applicants, all of whom are Moldovan citizens, live in the .
The applicants are inspectors of the Chişinău Fire Department attached to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
On 21 July 1994 the Government passed Decision No. 534-10, classified secret, which concerned the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of National Security (Intelligence Service) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. According to that Decision, among other things, the personnel of the above-mentioned institutions were entitled to a monthly allowance of approximately MDL 135 instead of the old allowance of MDL 7.06. This Decision was not published in the Official Gazette (Monitorul Oficial) and accordingly the applicants did not know about it.
The applicants started to receive the increased allowance on 1 June 1995. They found out that their colleagues from other Ministries had been receiving the higher rate from 1 July 1994.
In June 1997 the applicants lodged an action with the Centru District Court against the Ministry of Internal Affairs seeking the payment of the increased allowance for the period July 1994 – June 1995.
By a judgment of 1 August 1997 the Centru District Court awarded Mr Gheorghe Bragoi, Mr Alexandru Usatîi and Mr Iulian Guştiuc compensation of MDL 1,407 each. By another judgment of 18 August 1997 the Centru District Court awarded Mr Pavel Sîrbu and Mr Vitalie Cornovan compensation of MDL 1,407 each and Mr Petru Bragoi compensation of MDL 1,127.02. No appeals were lodged and the judgments became final. Enforcement warrants were issued.
On numerous occasions the applicants lodged complaints about the non-enforcement of the judgments of 1 August 1997 and 18 August 1997 with the Ministry of Justice. In its replies, the Ministry of Justice informed the applicants that the judgments could not be enforced due to the “lack of funds in the bank account of the Ministry of Internal Affairs”.
On 15 May 2003, after the cases were communicated to the Government, the judgments were executed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, in force between 26 December 1964 and 12 June 2003, stated:
