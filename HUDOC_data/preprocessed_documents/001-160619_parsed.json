Filling a gap in Liechtenstein law which, in its view, did not provide for compensation for damage suffered by a complainant as a result of a breach of the reasonable-time requirement, the Constitutional Court developed a right for the complainant to be exempted from, or be reimbursed, certain costs of the proceedings, in particular lawyer\u2019s fees and court costs, as redress for such damage (see in detail paragraphs 52-54 above).",

It appears from its reasoning (see paragraphs\u00a034 and 36 above) that this order was made to redress the breach of the reasonable-time requirement. However, it is unclear whether that order was made to afford redress to the applicant or \u2013 given that the Constitutional Court also finds breaches of the reasonable-time requirement on its own motion (see paragraph 50 above) \u2013 whether it was aimed at granting redress to F.H. himself, who was the opposing party in the proceedings at issue and as such equally affected by the non-compliance with the right to a hearing within a reasonable time. The Court notes in this context that the Government do not appear to have argued that the State had been charged with payment of F.H.\u2019s lawyers\u2019 fees in order to grant compensation to the applicant for the breach of the reasonable-time requirement found by the Constitutional Court. Having regard to the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraphs 52 and 55 above), the Court considers that the Government, in any event, did not demonstrate that the applicant, who had succeeded in part in his constitutional complaint, would have been ordered to pay F.H.\u2019s lawyers\u2019 fees in the proceedings before that court otherwise.",

It is therefore not satisfied that the redress granted was reasonable having regard to the awards of just satisfaction provided for under Article 41 of the Convention.

However, they had been pending from 10 June 2005 until 28 December 2009, that is to say for more than four and a half years, before the Regional Court. The proceedings before that court were delayed, in particular, from 6 September 2007 until 28 December 2009, that is to say for more than two years and three months, the period which it took the Regional Court to draft its judgment following the close of the hearing. The Court shares the view taken by the Constitutional Court that this delay in giving judgment, which the Constitutional Court considered as a \u201cperiod of inactivity\u201d, was unreasonable. It has also regard, in this context, to Article\u00a0415 of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides that where a judgment cannot be given directly after the close of the oral hearing, it is to be given within eight days from the close of the hearing. Moreover, the applicant did not contribute in any way to the duration of the proceedings at that stage and even urged the Regional Court on 22 April 2009 to deliver its judgment (see paragraph 15 above). The Court further considers that this delay in the proceedings before the first-instance court could not be made up by the fact that the proceedings were not unduly delayed by the higher courts and that the overall length of the proceedings was not as such unreasonable (compare, mutatis mutandis, for cases in which protracted periods of inactivity in the proceedings led to a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1, despite the fact that the overall duration of the proceedings was not as such unreasonable, Guincho v. Portugal, 10 July 1984, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36 and 41, Series\u00a0A no. 81; B. v. Austria, 28 March 1990, \u00a7\u00a7 52-55, Series A no. 175, and Abdoella v. the Netherlands, 25 November 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 22-25, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0248A).",
