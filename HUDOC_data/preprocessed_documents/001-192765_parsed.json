They alleged that if their appeal had been examined by the 4th Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation, which, contrary to the 13th Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation, calculates the limitation periods not from the date of the building use permit but from the date of the earthquake, their actions would have been examined on their merits.

The reason why the applicants\u2019 claim for damages was considered out of time was because their appeal was reviewed by the 13th Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation, which characterised their claim as a contractual claim and took the view that the ten-year limitation period under section 125 of the former Code of Obligations started to run from the date when the construction works had ended, whereas in similar cases, the 4th Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation characterised claimants\u2019 actions as actions in tort, applied section 60 of the former Code of Obligations and took the date of the earthquake as the basis in calculating the limitation period. The Court further notes that the application made by the applicants for harmonisation of the case-law was dismissed by the First Presidency of the Court of Cassation, which, without giving a detailed explanation, held that there was no need for harmonisation (see paragraph 19 above).",
