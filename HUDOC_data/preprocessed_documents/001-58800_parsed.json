The takeover battle resulted in victory for Guinness. Guinness's offer to the Distillers' shareholders, like Argyll's, included a substantial share exchange element and, accordingly, the respective prices at which Guinness and Argyll shares were quoted on the stock exchange was a critical factor for both sides. During the course of the bid the Guinness share price rose dramatically, but once the bid had been declared unconditional it fell significantly. According to the third applicant the share price rose in line with the range of the company's market sector and the fall was a consequence of normal market forces.",

It was alleged that supporters were offered secret indemnities against any losses they might incur and, in some cases, also large success fees if the Guinness's bid was successful. Such inducements, if true, would have been unlawful (1)\u00a0because they were not disclosed to the market under the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers and (2) because they were paid out of Guinness' own monies in breach of section 151 of the Companies Act 1985 (the \u201c1985\u00a0Act\u201d), which prohibits a company from giving financial assistance for the purpose of the acquisition of its own shares.",

This is especially true of their arguments in support of their complaints, firstly, that there was improper collusion between the DTI inspectors and other agencies and, secondly, that the prosecution had deliberately withheld from them materials of relevance to their defence. As to the latter issue the Court notes that the Commission in its partial admissibility decision adopted on 9 April 1997 (see paragraph\u00a04 above) declared inadmissible the applicants' complaint under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a03 (d) that the alleged non-disclosure of materials prevented them from securing the attendance of witnesses favourable to their defence.",

On 12 January 1987 the inspectors notified the Secretary of State of the evidence in their possession and on 13 January 1987 the latter drew it to the attention of the DPP. By letter from the Secretary of State dated 29 January 1987, the inspectors were required to provide the Secretary of State with any information they had relating to possible criminal offences and key documents and transcripts of evidence given to them. At a meeting held on 30 January 1987 attended by the inspectors it was formally agreed that transcripts and relevant documents be first passed to the DTI and that copies be forwarded thereafter to the lawyers advising the DPP.

In the applicants' view, the significance of this recommendation had to be seen in the context of the great uncertainty in domestic law governing the true extent of the Inspector's powers under the 1985 Act and the lack of safeguards to prevent the impermissible degree of cooperation between the inspectors and the prosecuting authorities. The applicants also stressed that, in the evidence which he gave to the Select Committee, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions at the relevant time confirmed that he had been in informal contact with the police before the actual decision was taken on 5 May 1987 to carry out a police investigation. In his evidence, he stated that the strategy worked out had been designed to allow the police inquiry to run one step behind the inspectors' investigation, given that the inspectors were passing on the transcripts of the evidence which they were collecting from the applicants.",

On this point, the applicants are correct since the Court of Appeal did not have regard to the infringement of the applicants' right not to incriminate themselves which resulted from the use made by the prosecution of information which domestic law compelled them to provide on pain of sanction.

The Court does not accept that submission and refers in this connection to the nature and purpose of investigations conducted by DTI inspectors. It observes that, in its judgment in the case of Fayed v. the United Kingdom, the Court held that the functions performed by the inspectors appointed under section 432(2) of the Companies Act 1985 were essentially investigative in nature and that they did not adjudicate either in form or in substance. Their purpose was to ascertain and record facts which might subsequently be used as the basis for action by other competent authorities \u2013 prosecuting, regulatory, disciplinary or even legislative (judgment of 21 September 1994, Series A no. 294-B, p. 47, \u00a7 61). As stated in that case, a requirement that such a preparatory investigation should be subject to the guarantees of a judicial procedure as set forth in Article 6 \u00a7 1 would in practice unduly hamper the effective regulation in the public interest of complex financial and commercial activities (ibid., p. 48, \u00a7\u00a062). It is to be further observed that the Court in its Saunders judgment impliedly confirmed this approach (judgment cited above, p. 2064, \u00a7 67). ",

Although the third applicant has specifically pleaded that in the absence of the transcripts a prosecution could never have been mounted against him, and the other applicants also consider this true of their cases, the Court cannot speculate as to the other means which the prosecuting authorities could have deployed in order to put them on trial.

The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party (see the Brandstetter v. Austria judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no. 211, pp. 27-28, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67; and Rowe and Davis cited above, \u00a7 60).

It notes in this connection that, and in contrast to the position in Rowe and Davis, the present applicants had received all the materials which had not been disclosed to them by the stage of the second set of appeal proceedings and the Court of Appeal was able to consider the impact of the new material on the safety of the conviction in the light of detailed argument from their defence lawyers. The Court recalls that, in accordance with its decision on the scope of the case, it is not open to the applicants, with reference to their arguments on non-disclosure, to impugn the fairness of the proceedings from the standpoint of their inability to summon witnesses in their defence (see paragraphs 75-76 above). However, the fact that this possibility was open to them but not taken up must also weigh in the balance when assessing whether the second set of appeal proceedings were capable of curing any prejudice which the applicants may have suffered on account of the prosecution's failure to disclose documents to them.

The term \u201ccharge\u201d, for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1, may be defined as \u201cthe official notification given to an individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence\u201d, a definition that also corresponds to the test whether the situation of the suspect has been \u201csubstantially affected\u201d (see the Hozee v. the Netherlands judgment of 22 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1100, \u00a7 43). The Court confirms in this context its view that the inspectors were not engaged in the determination of criminal charges against the applicants. It further recalls that it has rejected the applicants' submissions that the inspectors were acting in collusion with the authorities in an attempt to lay the basis of their subsequent prosecution. For these reasons, the Court considers that time should be taken to run for the purposes of calculating the relevant period as from the date of the laying of charges against the first and second applicants and the date of arrest of the third applicant, namely: 8 October 1987, 13\u00a0October 1987 and 30 September 1987 (see paragraphs 24, 25 and 20 above).",
