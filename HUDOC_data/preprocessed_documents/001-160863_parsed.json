Law no. 304/2004 on the organisation of the judicial system stated that the military courts and military prosecutors\u2019 offices were part of the general judicial system and were organised and functioned according to the same rules and regulations as their civilian counterparts. Similarly, Law no.\u00a0303/2004 on the status of judges and prosecutors also referred to military judges and prosecutors and provided that the High Council of the Judiciary had the right and obligation to defend judges and prosecutors from any act of interference which might affect their independence and impartiality. The Government further submitted that the High Council of the Judiciary was the competent body to recommend military prosecutors for appointment by the State President, relying exclusively on their professional expertise. They contended that the need for assent from the Ministry of Defence, which was a prerequisite for the appointment of military judges and prosecutors, referred only to medical, physical and psychological assessments of candidates. They added that military prosecutors\u2019 salaries were paid from the budget of the Ministry of Defence, but that the Ministry acted merely as a manager of the military courts\u2019 budget. The Government contended that it could not be concluded from such considerations that military prosecutors and judges were in a relationship of direct or indirect subordination within the military hierarchy. Moreover, military prosecutors could only be dismissed in accordance with the general conditions laid down in the statute of magistrates, and the High Council of the Judiciary was the only body in a position to apply any disciplinary sanctions. The Government further submitted that in the context of the penal reform carried out in the last few years, the principle of the specialisation of judges and prosecutors was deemed to be crucial for ensuring fair and rapid proceedings, and that therefore, in accordance with the new Code of Criminal Procedure, military prosecutors were in charge of all investigations of crimes committed by military personnel.",

This involves the carrying out of a thorough, impartial and careful examination of the circumstances surrounding the killings, which is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of results to be achieved, but of means to be employed. The authorities must have taken reasonable steps to secure the evidence concerning the incident. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. Equally, it is necessary for the persons responsible for and carrying out the investigation to be independent from those implicated in the events, which means not only a lack of hierarchical or institutional connection, but also practical independence. Furthermore, a prompt response by the authorities is essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability, in practice as well as in theory (see Association \u201c21 December 1989\u201d and Others, cited above, \u00a7 133-135).",
