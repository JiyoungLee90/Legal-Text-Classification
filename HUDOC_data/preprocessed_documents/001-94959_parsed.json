In addition to the reasons specified in the decisions given during the investigation, the courts vaguely referred to the continuing necessity to obtain further witness evidence. They noted that it was not possible to schedule hearings more often because only one hearing room meeting the relevant safety requirements had been at the disposal of the trial court. However, the Katowice Court of Appeal in its decisions given in 2005 and 2006 extending the applicant's detention acknowledged to a certain degree that the applicant's detention had been excessive, criticised delays in the collection of the evidence and ordered the trial court to speed up the proceedings and discipline the defence lawyers.",

According to the authorities, the likelihood of a severe sentence being imposed on the applicant created a presumption that he would obstruct the proceedings. However, the Court would reiterate that, while the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself justify long periods of detention pending trial (see\u00a0Michta v.\u00a0Poland, no. 13425/02, \u00a7\u00a7 49, 4 May 2006).",

Consequently, in cases where a person is detained pending the determination of a criminal charge against him, the fact of his detention is itself a factor to be considered in assessing whether the requirement of a decision on the merits within a reasonable time has been met (see, for example, Abdoella v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, judgment of 25\u00a0November 1992, Series A no. 248-A, p.\u00a017, \u00a7\u00a024; Jab\u0142o\u0144ski\u00a0v.

However, as stated above, while this element is to be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 and may justify a longer period of detention than in a case concerning an individual offender, a member of an organised criminal group is entitled to the protection against unreasonably lengthy detention afforded by this provision. As in other numerous similar detention cases, the authorities did not justify the applicant's continued detention by relevant and sufficient reasons (see paragraphs 37-42 above). Moreover, as demonstrated by the ever increasing number of judgments in which the Court has found Poland to be in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in respect of applicants involved in organised crime, the present case is by no means an isolated example of the imposition of unjustifiably lengthy detention but a confirmation of a practice found to be contrary to the Convention (see, among many other examples, Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, 4 May 2006; K\u0105kol v.\u00a0Poland, no. 3994/03, 6 September 2007; Malikowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a015154/03, 16 October 2007; and also Hilgartner v. Poland, no.\u00a037976/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046-48, 3 March 2009). Consequently, the Court sees no reason to diverge from its findings made in Kauczor as to the existence of a structural problem and the need for the Polish State to adopt measures to remedy the situation (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62).",
