However, in the Court\u2019s view this did not constitute either an implicit acknowledgment of a breach of the Convention or redress for the period during which the applicants were unable to use their plot of land and the domestic authorities were not proceeding with the expropriation. The Court further considers that there was no acknowledgment, either explicitly or in substance, of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the context of the preceding domestic proceedings. In its decision of 22 October 2009 the Pest County Regional Court held that the dismissal of the applicants\u2019 expropriation request by the Central Hungarian Regional Administration Office was based on an erroneous application of the law and a similarly erroneous assessment of the facts. Accordingly, it ordered the administrative authority to proceed with the expropriation.

Apart from these constraints, the domestic authorities failed to proceed with the expropriation of the property for an excessive length of time, despite their legal obligation to do so. The applicants submitted that the combined effects of these measures had resulted in their property being subject to a measure of control from elsewhere. The applicants did not contest the legitimacy of the establishment of a water protection zone in 2002. Nonetheless, according to them, they had a legitimate reason to believe that their land, subject to a number of restrictions while the measure was in force, would be expropriated shortly afterwards; the authorities\u2019 delay of nine years did not strike a fair balance between the individual and general interests involved. They also maintained that this situation did not give rise to any compensation.",

Furthermore, even in the absence of a formal expropriation, regard must be had to the realities of the situation, that is the de facto expropriation of the applicants\u2019 property with effect from 2002 (see paragraph 31 above).

The decision of the General Directorate of Water Management of 16\u00a0December 2002 informed the applicants that pursuant to section 15 (1) of Government Decree no.\u00a0123/1997(VII.18.) their plot of land should be expropriated with a view to establishing the same ownership over the water reserve and over the land where it was located. The decision did not set a time-limit for the measure (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). It also specified that the applicants could also initiate a transfer of ownership if the authorities failed to do so. Despite the eventual establishment of the water protection zone, the authorities did not expropriate the applicants\u2019 plot of land until 2011, but used it for water management purposes.",

These measures clearly amounted to a measure of control of the use of property, within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01. However, the applicants\u2019 complaint also relates to the authorities\u2019 failure to expropriate their land, despite a legal obligation and their request to do so. As a result, the applicants were not able to get the pecuniary compensation which would have been due in case of expropriation. The Court acknowledges in this respect that, over a long period of time, pending the adoption of the decision on expropriation, the applicants\u2019 right of property was precarious (see Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth, cited above, \u00a7 60). However, until 16\u00a0December\u00a02011, when the decision was taken, the applicants\u2019 ownership right had not disappeared. Thus, contrary to the arguments of the Government, the effects of the measures involved were not such that they could be equivalent to a formal or de facto deprivation of possessions. Although these measures did not all have the same legal effect and had different aims, the Court considers that they must be looked at together in the light of the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article\u00a01\u00a0of\u00a0Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 (see, mutatis mutandis, Matos e Silva, Lda., and Others v.

In similar vein, the applicants\u2019 further offer of 31 October 2007 to sell their property to the State was to no avail (see paragraph 14 above). Finally, even after the confirmation of the administrative authorities\u2019 obligation to conclude the expropriation procedure by a court judgment on 22\u00a0October 2009 (see paragraph\u00a017 above), National Asset Management Inc., the authority designated to conduct the expropriation, took no action for an additional period of two years, when the expropriation was finally enforced by the Pest County Government Office (see paragraph 21 above); the authorities thus took no action for an additional period of time, until 16\u00a0December 2011. Thus, in addition to the detrimental effects of the establishment of a water protection zone on the exercise of their right to property, the applicants were left in a state of uncertainty as to the fate of their plot of land over a long period of time (see, mutatis mutandis, Frendo Randon and Others v. Malta, no.\u00a02226/10, \u00a7\u00a055, 22 November 2011), during which they could neither realistically expect to sell their property at a fair price nor obtain expropriation against compensation.",
