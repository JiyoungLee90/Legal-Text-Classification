However, he did not apply for reinstatement of the time-limit for lodging an appeal against the detention order until 2007. In this connection, the Court cannot agree with the second applicant that the decision delivered on 7 May 2008 by the Supreme Court of Russia restarted the running of the six-month time-limit, since the procedure for reinstatement of a procedural timelimit was not construed for addressing the specific issue of the lawfulness of detention. It cannot therefore be applied to the issue of the lawfulness of the second applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention back in 2002. From the moment the Supreme Court upheld the applicants\u2019 conviction on appeal (8 July 2003), it should have been obvious to him that an appeal against the detention order of 13\u00a0September 2002 had no prospect of success. Moreover, he failed to provide any explanation as to why he had remained passive between 2003 and 2007, without taking any reasonable steps to apply for reinstatement of the time-limit.",
