As regards the applicant\u2019s request for cross-examination of certain witnesses the court submitted that the request had already been granted in part because S.S. and W.D. had been cross-examined. As regards the contradictions in the testimonies given by A.M., the court considered that they had been sufficiently cleared up by A.M. herself when she had given evidence for the second time and there had been no contradictions between her statements and the remaining evidence, so further examination would only lead to an unnecessary extension of the proceedings. As regards the applicant\u2019s arguments concerning the failure on the part of the policemen to follow the relevant procedures, the court found that the procedures relied on by the applicant had to be followed only in a case where there was a suspicion that a crime had been committed: in the present case there had been no evidence that any third person might have been involved in J.K.\u2019s death. The court further held that the same applied to the requirement to secure the scene of the accident; the applicant\u2019s brother, who had been interviewed after the accident, admitted that his clothes had caught fire because of his carelessness (w wyniku nieuwagi). This also demonstrated that the suspicion that a crime had been committed had been ill-founded.",

The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (see, for example, Ramsahai and Others v. the\u00a0Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7\u00a0321, ECHR 2007II).",

The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. The investigation\u2019s conclusions must be based on thorough, objective and impartial analysis of all relevant elements. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its capability of establishing the circumstances of the case or the person responsible is liable to fall foul of the required measure of effectiveness (see, for example, Ramsahai v.\u00a0the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7 321). The State\u2019s obligation under Article 2 of the Convention will not be satisfied if the protection afforded by domestic law exists only in theory: above all, it must also operate effectively in practice and that requires a prompt examination of the case without unnecessary delays (see \u0160ilih v. Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7\u00a0195, 9 April 2009).",

The obligations under Article 2 of the Convention are not confined to cases where it has been established that the death was caused by an agent of the State. On the contrary, the mere fact that the domestic authorities have been informed of the death will give rise ipso facto to an obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances in which it occurred (see, for example, Vas\u00eelca v.\u00a0the\u00a0Republic of Moldova, no. 69527/10, \u00a7 28, 11\u00a0February 2014, Emars v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a022412/08, \u00a7\u00a075, 18 November 2014). What is more, a breach of a procedural obligation under Article 2 has been alleged in the absence of any complaint as to the substantive aspect of Article 2 (see Byrzykowski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 11562/05, \u00a7\u00a7 86 and 94118, 27\u00a0June 2006).",

The investigation must be, inter alia, thorough, impartial and careful. It must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimonies, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of any clinical findings, including the cause of death.

However, in the course of these proceedings the applicant raised complaints concerning the quality of the investigation. In particular, he alleged that the police officers who had arrived at the site of the applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s accident had failed to carry out their professional duties properly.
