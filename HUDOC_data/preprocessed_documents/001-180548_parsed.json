This principle emphasises the fact that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. A review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise and the mere possibility of two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. Departures from that principle are justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see for instance Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR\u00a02003-IX).",

Romania, no. 26105/03, \u00a7 25, 29 July 2008). In any case, the power to conduct an extraordinary review should be exercised by the authorities so as to strike, to the maximum extent possible, a fair balance between the interests at stake (see, mutatis mutandis, Nikitin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a050178/99, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2004-VIII).",
