Turkey, no. 75834/01, \u00a7\u00a7 23-28, 20 May 2008). Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present circumstances. The Court particularly notes that, whilst the numerous requests made by the applicant for the suspension of his appointment might have slightly prolonged the proceedings, the applicant\u2019s conduct may in no way justify their entire length. In any event, the applicant cannot be blamed for making full use of the remedies available to him under domestic law (see, amongst other authorities, Girardi v. Austria, no. 50064/99, \u00a7 56, 11\u00a0December 2003). The Court further observes that the case was before the  alone for five years and ten months pending the appeal and rectification procedures. This delay, which remains unjustified, contributed substantially to the overall length of the proceedings.",
