It recalls, however, that after that moment the trial court was incapable of handling the case with the same efficiency and allowed delays which held the proceedings back for approximately one year and five months. In particular, the Court notes the trial court\u2019s lengthy failure to hold a hearing after resumption of the proceedings and to submit a reasoned judgment to the registry to enable the applicant to lodge her appeal.
