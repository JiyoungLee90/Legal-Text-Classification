They had entered through the roof and sought to find the safe. Various items were stolen and the victims were injured while they were being held face down in the bedroom. According to Mr Z. during the robbery one of the robbers said, \u201cGive us the two buckets of gold you told us you had in your possession\u201d.

                                                "content": "In the first affidavit Mr Z. explained the history and the good relationship he had had with the applicant\u2019s family and how much the Z. family had cared for and trusted the applicant. He stated that at the time of the robbery the Saliba brothers had been working on project D. but works had been stalled; that the applicant\u2019s sisters had gone to his office worried and in fear of the applicant, who they said was clever and armed; Mr Z. explained that a few weeks before the robbery the applicant had been working at the house, including on the roof, and at one point, while distracted, the applicant had fallen off a ladder; Mr Z. explained that on some occasions both the applicant and his brother had had access to the door of his roof and had known how to open it, and had also worked close to the safe. Mr Z. stated that in more recent years it had been only the applicant who had attended to jobs in the house and who had come during the late hours of the night, coming promptly and not charging them, even though he usually charged for all his services, even minor ones \u2013 thus, he had been the only one in the world, and nobody else, who had the knowledge of the house as it would be at night time. Mr Z. related that on one occasion, where payment to the applicant was likely to be delayed, he had reassured the applicant by referring to his (Mr Z.\u2019s) numerous immovable properties and told the applicant precisely to \u201crest assured you have two buckets of gold as guarantee\u201d. Mr Z. noted that he had never used these words with anyone else and that the applicant had appeared to take him literally; he stated that later on the applicant had also admitted to these words having been uttered to him. Mr Z. recounted the robbery: how, while the Z couple had been asleep, they had heard chaos in the entrance of the house and one man had run through the corridor directly towards them and asked him for gold. Another two men had followed and kept the couple in the bedroom in the dark; one of them (who injured his wife while holding her on the ground) had again asked for gold stating that they would go and consume drugs, while the other had repeated \u201cgive us the gold you told us you have\u201d. Mr Z. stated that he had recognised the words on the spot, as those he had once uttered to the applicant. Mr Z. noted that the two people who had held them in the bedroom had appeared to be under the effects of drugs; while they had been asking for gold it had become clear that they had been targeting the safe. Twenty minutes later another voice had called out from the end of the corridor that they could leave and so they had done so. Mr Z. stated that once the robbers had left the bedroom he had followed them and recognised the applicant as one of the six or seven men - \u201cI recognised him with my eyes, after already knowing that he was one of them through my ears\u201d. Mr\u00a0Z. held that the applicant had been the only one to have remained silent. Having known the applicant closely and worked with him for around twelve years, Mr Z. felt that he could recognise his mannerisms, stature, height and behaviour, as well as his movements and head inclinations, which corresponded to what he had seen. Mr Z. continued to explain that it had been natural not to say anything in that moment of shock and fear, but that:",

Mr Z. explained that one of the robbers had exclaimed \u201cthere it is\u201d and they had initially tried to remove the safe, but then they found the key to it in Ms Z.\u2019s purse, which as a habit she regularly kept on the armchair in the sitting room. Confronted with this situation Mr Z. reiterated that on that date the applicant and his brother had been the only two persons who had known about the safe as they had been the only people who had entered that part of the house on multiple occasions since 1991, and the louvres had been always closed. Mr Z. recalled how after the robbery numerous people had come and seen the safe, but not the applicant or his brothers. The applicant had had all the knowledge necessary, including how to open the roof door, where to cut the phone line, where to find the purse, and other useful details to facilitate such a robbery, which had taken place in twenty minutes during the night. Mr Z. continued to explain the situation after the robbery. He stated that the working relationship had ended and that the applicant had gone to the house a couple of hours after the robbery; he had offered no help and had just shown his face; nor had he offered any help when he had gone to visit Ms Z. in hospital, with his wife and daughter who, had not been known to the couple. Mr Z. testified that a few days after the robbery he had gone to buy a bulb from the applicant, who had expressed no sympathy. Mr Z. stated that subsequently the applicant had called him to tell him he would no longer work on project D., and Mr Z. noted that the architect N.S.T. and their caretaker W.B. had said that the applicant had refused to work for Mr Z. any longer as he had no longer had money, and that he had failed to pay the brothers money due for services rendered. It had also been strange that sometime after the robbery, the applicant had sent invoices claiming such fees and had started avoiding Mr Z. Yet in 1995 the applicant had sent the couple a Christmas card and in 1996 invited them to his daughter\u2019s wedding. Mr Z. further referred to various robberies which had taken place in households in the neighbourhood which had been all clients of the applicant. He stated that M.C. had told him that the applicant had been the last person in the room before she had found her jewellery box missing. He reiterated the changed attitude of the applicant towards him following the robbery and had even instituted civil claims in judicial proceedings. The Saliba brothers had also not told him that their father had died, even though he had been the testamentary executor nominated by their late father. According to Mr Z. the applicant had known that had they not been sure of his responsibility, they would not have instituted proceedings against him.",

She reiterated that it had been only the applicant who had had access to the safe and had known the house by night, knowledge which neither his brother nor the domestic help had had. She explained that she had been told that after the incident the applicant had gone to their house and to visit her in hospital with his family; he had also sent a Christmas card and invited the couple to his daughter\u2019s wedding; however he had not wanted to continue working on one of Mr Z.\u2019s projects and had eventually sued them in court without giving them prior notice.

The court admitted that there had been various inconsistencies in the testimony of Mr Z. \u2013 for example statements that the applicant had been silent and yet that the victim had recognised him through his sense of hearing, as well as his statement that someone had told him that it had been the applicant. The court further noted that many of Mr Z.\u2019s arguments indicating that the applicant was implicated had weakened his version. These arguments based the applicant\u2019s guilt on the fact that i) he had fallen off a ladder; ii) that he had invited Mr and Ms Z. to his daughter\u2019s wedding; iii) that he had not informed Mr and Ms Z. about the demise of his father; iv) that he had been paid for work by means of land; v) that he had sent the Z. family a postcard; vi) that the applicant had fallen out with his brothers; and vii) that the applicant had been \u201csilent and absent\u201d. Indeed these repeated arguments had been far-fetched and banal, usually an indication that an individual was not convinced of his statement. The court noted that the only established facts were that the robber had known both the house (allowing him to move comfortably within it and find what he wanted) and Mr Z. (giving the robber a reason to remain silent during the robbery). While the applicant had not been the only one to have had these traits, the applicant had been one of the few who had had them. Furthermore, the robbers had known about the \u201cbuckets of gold\u201d, which Mr Z. had allegedly mentioned to the applicant. In the court\u2019s view the robbers had either known this from the applicant and, if so, the applicant would have had no other reason to share this information apart from bad intentions, or the robber had actually been the applicant himself. The court noted that this unfortunately indicated that Mr Z. had used this factor for the identification of the applicant, and it would have been better to have solely relied on visual identification.",

It noted that for civil proceedings to reach a finding it sufficed for a judge to have a \u201cmoral certainty\u201d, as opposed to proof beyond reasonable doubt as required in criminal proceedings. It was true that a more rigorous test was required when a person was being accused of a crime in the context of civil proceedings, particularly when the issue was the identity of the person. However, Maltese law did not provide what was necessary for identification, only what was not necessary, thus leaving it to the judge to decide according to his discretion. In the present case, the whole case depended on Mr Z.\u2019s identification of the applicant, which the firstinstance court had chosen to believe despite the inconsistencies and contradictions in his and Ms Z.\u2019s testimonies. In this connection one had to bear in mind that the memory of a victim of a violent robbery could suffer psychological effects which may result in inconsistencies. Having examined the acts of the proceedings and the applicant\u2019s submissions, it considered that it need not depart from the first-instance court\u2019s findings because the applicant\u2019s arguments were secondary to the actual identification of the applicant and were therefore not justified.",

Moreover, while basing their decision on the fact that Mr Z. had recognised the applicant, no consideration had been given to the fact that several years before (at the time of the incident) he had been unable to identify the applicant, and thereafter he had kept in contact with the applicant. It was only years later that Mr Z. had given two names to the police, that of the applicant and his brother, as he had been unsure of the different heights and builds of the two brothers, despite the fact that Mr Z. had known both of them well. Mr Z. had also stated that the robbers had been drug addicts, but the applicant had had no such dependency or connection to drugs. The police had never pressed charges against the applicant since there had been no evidence indicating his involvement. Mr\u00a0Z. had said that all the robbers had spoken apart from one whom he had claimed had been the applicant, him having remained silent. There had been consequentially no basis for assuming it had been the applicant. Indeed, twenty years later, Mr Z. accused the applicant\u2019s brother of having participated in the robbery, stating that he had been unsure as to who it had been. The witness testimony in the form of an affidavit of W.B., who had been called by Mr Z. to substantiate his allegations concerning the reference to the \u201cbuckets of gold\u201d, had during cross-examination come across as extremely confused. W.B.\u2019s statements in cross-examination had contradicted his previous statements which had gone to show that a lot of what had been said in the affidavit had been hearsay; W.B. had merely been reporting what Mr Z. had told him. Indeed no evidence had been offered that talk of buckets of gold had only been made by Mr Z. to the applicant  this element had been stretched even further by the gratuitous assumptions of the courts who had considered that \u201cthe only reason for discussing buckets of gold with others would [have] essentially be[en] to get hold of the buckets in an illicit manner\u201d. Similar considerations applied to the cross-examination of another witness, architect N.S.M., where it had turned out that \u2013 unlike what the latter had stated in his affidavit \u2013 the applicant had not been the sole electrician and plumber of the Z. family, since the applicant\u2019s brothers had also worked for Mr and Ms Z.",

Similarly, the fact that a robber had been silent could only have meant that such a robber had known the family, but nothing had indicated that it had indeed been the applicant. Thus, the court\u2019s findings had been based solely on the alleged recognition of the applicant made several years after the robbery by Mr Z., which could not be corroborated by the above arguments.

Ultimately damages had been granted only on the basis of Mr Z.\u2019s mostly unsubstantiated statement (no proof had been submitted in relation to items amounting to EUR 85,376.19 in the claim). Furthermore the burden of proof had been reversed in so far as he had had to prove that the quantification presented by Mr Z. had been incorrect as opposed to Mr Z. proving the actual damage. The applicant argued that he had had no means of proving that the quantification had been incorrect. Indeed Mr Z. had not called to the stand the jeweller who had helped in the quantification of the damage, denying the applicant the possibility to cross-examine him. Nor had the court appointed an independent expert. The applicant considered that since the jeweller had not confirmed under oath the claims presented before the court, according to domestic case-law those documents should not have constituted evidence. The applicant also complained about the refusal of the Court of Appeal to allow the appearance in court of his brother to counter the credibility of the victim\u2019s testimony. Indeed, given that Mr Z. had not been able to distinguish between the applicant and his brother (Mr Z. had originally admitted that he could not be sure which of the two had been involved), it had been important for the Court of Appeal to juxtapose the brothers so that the court would have been able to appreciate the disregard of the first-instance court for the evidence before it.",

The domestic courts\u2019 decisions had given reasons, specifically that if two individuals have known each other for a long time, they recognise each other even if they cannot see each other\u2019s face or hear each other\u2019s voice, recognition being the result of stature, mannerisms, posture and movements of the person concerned. While the domestic court had pointed out the inconsistencies in Mr Z.\u2019s version of events and his arguments, these had been considered trivial and had not weakened his position. Mr Z. had convinced the court that the robbery had been effected by someone who had been familiar with his residence and who had known where valuable objects could have been found. Moreover, the domestic courts had noted that one person had been known to Mr Z., since he had been careful not to utter a single word during the robbery. While the domestic court had noted that the applicant had not been the only person to fulfil these criteria, it had noted that he had surely been one of the few who met them. The Government noted that while the applicant\u2019s brother had also worked for Mr and Ms Z., it had been the applicant who had been a regular visitor to their house. The reference to the buckets of gold had showed that either the applicant had related this to the robbers, or he had indeed been one of them. The domestic courts had given weight to the fact that the only reason why one would have discussed the buckets of gold with others would have been essentially to get hold of such buckets in an illicit manner. The domestic court had also considered as irrelevant and had thus discarded the banal arguments of Mr Z. and his contradictory statements. They had also ascertained the validity of the evidence and considered it to have been produced in accordance with the rules of procedure. The Government also noted that Mr Z. had indicated that some but not all of the robbers had been under the effects of drugs; in consequence the applicant\u2019s argument to this effect had not been relevant. The Government also noted that a party to proceedings cannot make suggestions to witnesses; thus if the applicant had considered that Mr Z. had influenced the evidence of W.B. and N.S.T., he should have raised the matter in the civil proceedings and before the courts at two levels of constitutional jurisdiction.",

Indeed, the firstinstance court had considered in a decree that it had not been necessary not to allow the affidavit in evidence and the applicant had not appealed against that decision. Moreover, that evidence had not been the sole and decisive factor leading to the court\u2019s conclusions. As to F. being denied the opportunity to testify before the Court of Appeal, the Government noted that while the request had been made in passing in the appeal application, it had not been reiterated in the part of the appeal application containing the claims, nor had a separate application to this effect been lodged with the Court of Appeal, nor had one been made orally. As a result, no express pronouncement had been made by the Court of Appeal on the matter. In any event there had been no exceptional reasons to allow such an application at that stage of the proceedings. As to the claim for expenses, the applicant had also made submissions about the content of that affidavit and the supporting documents.

In An\u0111elkovi\u0107, the Court found that the arbitrariness of the domestic court\u2019s decision, which principally had had no legal basis in domestic law and had not contained any connection between the established facts, the applicable law and the outcome of the proceedings, amounted to a \u201cdenial of justice\u201d (see An\u0111elkovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 27).

Indeed it is striking that the first-instance court while highlighting the inconsistencies of Mr Z.\u2019s testimony, gave no reasons as to why it considered that Mr Z.\u2019s statements remained credible and reliable. Nor did it justify those inconsistencies in any way (unlike the Court of Appeal). Such consideration was all the more necessary given that the applicant had originally not been able to identify the assailant back in 1995. The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s name and that of his brother had been mentioned in the investigation only with regard to persons who had had access to the house and could have been familiar with it, but no identification of the brothers or the applicant as robbers had been made at the time. Given the delay in identification, which occurred only, suddenly, five years after the robbery and the fact that the identification was the main evidence on which the first-instance court relied, this evidence required a thorough examination. Nevertheless, the first-instance court in its judgment made no consideration and gave no explanations in respect of the sudden change of heart of Mr Z. which occurred in 2000 only after the applicant had lodged civil proceedings against him, despite the applicant\u2019s highlighting of the matter repeatedly.",

The Court notes that, in certain circumstances, such proceedings may also attract some of the guarantees applicable in criminal cases such as, for example, those of Article 6 \u00a7 2 (see, for example, Vella v. Malta, no. 69122/10, \u00a7 47, 11 February 2014) and that the requirements of a fair hearing are the most strict in the sphere of criminal law (see Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7 43, ECHR\u00a02006XIV). The Court has previously held that, notwithstanding the consideration that a certain gravity attaches to criminal proceedings, which are concerned with the allocation of criminal responsibility and the imposition of a punitive and deterrent sanction, it is self-evident that there are criminal cases which do not carry any significant degree of stigma (ibid.). In the same vein the Court considers that, while civil in nature, cases such as the one in the present case can also carry such stigma. Thus, while all civil cases deserve the protection of Article 6 \u00a7 1, there is no doubt that in this type of case it is imperative that the domestic decisions are based on a thorough assessment of the evidence presented and that they contain adequate reasons (see general principles at paragraph 64-66 above). The present case leaves much to be desired in that connection.",

It reiterates\u00a0that in its assessment of compliance of the procedure in question with the principle of equality of arms, which is a feature of the wider concept of a fair trial, significant importance is attached to appearances and to the increased sensitivity of the public to the fair administration of justice (see Borgers v.

The Court notes that the civil court at first-instance gave no specific reasons in reply to the applicant\u2019s request to expunge Ms Z.\u2019s statement from the record and therefore its decision to accept the testimony despite the applicant not having the opportunity to cross-examine the witness. The courts at two levels of constitutional jurisdiction assumed these reasons, concluding that the judge had acted within his discretion and that no prejudice had been caused to the applicant. The Court considers that even though Ms Z. did not identify the applicant in her testimony, she had been the only other witness present on the day of the robbery. Since her testimony was accepted, the applicant had a real interest in cross-examining her or of having her statement removed from evidence.",

While the Government argued, in line with the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding (see paragraph 33 above), that the applicant had failed to make such an application in the proper way, the Court of Appeal made no finding to that effect, and did not state that the applicant had failed adequately to bring to their attention his intention to call his brother as a witness (compare, mutatis mutandis, Tamminen, cited above, \u00a7 39). It has not been disputed that the appeal application contained such a request including an explanation as to the relevance of the witness (ibid.). Furthermore, while the Government highlighted the exceptional nature of hearing evidence from a witness in appeal proceedings, the Court\u2019s attention has not been brought to any specific procedural impediment which prevented the court from taking cognisance of such a request, and the Court notes that Article 208 of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure (see paragraph 42 above) only refers to witnesses which had not previously testified (and thus did not apply in the present case since F. had already testified during the firstinstance proceedings). Moreover, the intention of the applicant was not to hear the evidence but to juxtapose the witnesses so that the appeal court could see them, allowing it to examine, in its role of appeal court, whether there were compelling reasons which would have made it appropriate to alter the first-instance decision. Nevertheless, no attention was given to this matter by the Court of Appeal.",

The Court cannot speculate as to what would have been the domestic court\u2019s decision had the applicant taken the latter action.
