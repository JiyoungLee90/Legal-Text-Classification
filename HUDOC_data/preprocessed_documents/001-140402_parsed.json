The 2008 report (see paragraph 27 above) demonstrated that the majority of the land could be returned. According to the relevant town planning documents, construction of collective residential buildings was planned for the area concerned. On the basis of the restitution order, he obtained title to the residential apartments that had been confiscated in 1946 and reserved for restoration under the 1996 contract. There were currently seventeen families living in those apartments, which were of extremely poor quality. Since those apartments were not socially owned, the State was not obliged to provide alternative accommodation for those affected by the restitution. In any event, lawful tenants were entitled to seek, under section 70 of the Restitution Act, to be provided with alternative accommodation by the State. The applicant also contested the findings of the domestic authorities that he should have been awarded only one-quarter of the company\u2019s shares. In this connection he submitted that his predecessor was the sole proprietor of the company and that the remaining three individuals named in the confiscation order were not owners or shareholders of the company. In any event, those persons or their heirs had the opportunity to assert their rights, if any, regarding the property, under section 63 of the Restitution Act (see paragraph 41 above). No such persons had claimed any rights, either in restitution proceedings or in civil proceedings against him.",

The Solicitor General, as a party to the proceedings, had sought revocation of the restitution order, which had been impossible to enforce, given the errors noted by the Commission and the Supreme Court. The restitution order of 2000, which had been adopted at a particular political moment and in an extremely short procedure in which State interests were not represented, had disregarded or failed to establish certain relevant facts, namely: the share in the property of the former owners indicated in the 1945 judgment; the property that could have been the subject of restitution, given the fact that the 1999 judgment had concerned only one former shareholder; that the property in question had meanwhile been developed with public funds; and that there were socially owned apartments on the site (referring to the \u201cworkers\u2019\u201d apartments), which accommodated thirty-three families. In this connection they submitted letters that the Restitution Commission had sent on 10 July 2008 to twenty-three individuals, seeking information regarding their tenancies.

The intervention of the Solicitor General can be considered to have been taken in light of his or her right and duty to protect the proprietary rights and interests of the State (see paragraphs 32 and 46 above). The quashing of the order was based on section 267 \u00a7 1 (3) of the Administrative Proceedings Act (see paragraph 44 above), which provided that a final administrative decision could be set aside if it was impossible to enforce. Both the Commission and the Supreme Court referred to this provision in their decisions (see paragraphs 22 and 24 above).

However, the Court is of the opinion that the \u201cmanifest omission\u201d of the Solicitor General in the ordinary restitution proceedings (see paragraph 22 above) cannot be interpreted, in the present case, as a bar to the impugned intervention, the aim of which was to correct fundamental errors. To consider otherwise would be contrary to the principle of the proper administration of justice. Given the particular circumstances of the case, the Court is not convinced that the errors of the Restitution Commission could be neutralised or corrected by any other means than those applied therein.",

In this connection it notes that on the basis of the errors specified above, the case was remitted to the Restitution Commission for a fresh examination and since 2007 the restitution proceedings have been pending before the Restitution Commission. They were suspended in December 2010 when the applicant was instructed to initiate separate civil proceedings in order to establish the share of his late predecessor in the company\u2019s property (see paragraph 28 above). The applicant may therefore recover possession of parts of the property after the restitution proceedings would resume.",

In this respect the Court notes with concern that the new restitution proceedings have been pending since 2007 and that, at present, it is unclear when they will come to an end. In this connection it recalls that there is an effective remedy before the Supreme Court that the applicant can avail himself of regarding the length of the resumed restitution proceedings (see Ad\u017ei-Spirkoska and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), nos. 38914/05 and 17879/05, 3 November 2011). Whereas inactivity on behalf of the national authorities may in future lead the Court to hold otherwise, it does not find that the present situation is such that due to the still pending proceedings a disproportionate burden has been placed on the applicant.",
