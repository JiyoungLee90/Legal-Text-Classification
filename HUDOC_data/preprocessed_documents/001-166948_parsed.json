According to the Government, it was on an unspecified date in 2005, whereas the applicant submitted that such test had been carried out only on 20 February 2007. The only document in support of the Government\u2019s version is a penitentiary official\u2019s letter of 8\u00a0September 2005, which had summarily referred to the matter (see paragraph 59 above). At the same time, the first mentioning of the applicant\u2019s drug susceptibility test in his medical file is dated 20 February 2007. The Court therefore considers that it was on that last-mentioned date when the applicant underwent the test in question for the first time.",

It therefore considers that the applicant\u2019s decision to interrupt the treatment was no more than a legitimate attempt to draw the authorities\u2019 attention to the poor quality of the medical care (see, for a comparable situation, Makshakov, cited above, \u00a7 100).",
