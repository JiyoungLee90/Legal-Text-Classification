Lastly, the committee pointed out that it was not its task to issue an opinion on the origin of the head injury or to attribute it to either of the services. It added that the possibility of a joint police/SUGE operation required the respective competences to be strictly defined. It should be reiterated that the arrival of the police removes the SUGE mandate, immediately placing the operation under the sole authority of the most senior police officer present.

As regards the request for a new expert report, the Investigations Division noted that the first expert report had been drawn up by a panel of four experts with complementary specialities, who had all attended the extremely long and detailed reconstruction organised by the investigating judge, during which they had seen all those involved in the impugned events repeat several times the gestures which they had described, covering all the different versions presented. It held that another expert opinion, for which all this input could not be replicated, would be of no real value for establishing the truth, and that it was neither necessary nor practicable to repeat such a complex reconstruction, which had at no stage been criticised by the various parties involved in the proceedings. The Division added that in medical terms, the civil parties had provided no scientific evidence capable of contradicting the conclusions of the panel of experts, merely affirming that the extremely serious injuries sustained by the first applicant must have originated in the manner of his arrest.",

It nevertheless noted that the operation seemed to have been more \u201crobust\u201d than the SUGE officers had admitted, the latter having spoken of a \u201ctextbook\u201d operation, which evoked a theoretical ideal and seemed \u201ctoo perfect\u201d.

Referring to the reconstruction, the Investigations Division considered that by reprising all the descriptions of the actions by all those involved and taking on board the hypotheses least favourable to the SUGE officers in question, the experts had been able to ascertain that the arrestee\u2019s head had not hit the ground in any of the reconstructed actions, that the blow from the knee, if such a blow had ever actually occurred, would have affected the right craniofacial region, that if it had been struck as described it could only have had a minor impact and that the actions carried out could not explain the intracranial lesions noted, especially the cranial fracture on the left side of the head.

Lastly, it noted that the previous findings concerning the first applicant\u2019s physical state during the afternoon had lent credence to that eventuality.

As regards the third expert opinion, which contradicted the first two, he pointed out that that opinion had been based solely on a reconstruction effected three years after the event, which had drawn exclusively on the information provided by the SUGE and police officers concerned. Moreover, the applicant argued that the length of time between his arrest and his collapse had been underestimated by the experts, given that security cameras had shown that the arrest had taken place at 7.59 p.m. and the fire brigade had been called at 8.14 p.m. Referring to the first expert report, he observed that the doctors had mentioned the great difficulty of accurately determining the timescale of incidents which could have varied between a few minutes and several hours. He concluded that the domestic authorities were indeed responsible for the ill-treatment he had sustained and that the time-lapse between his arrival at Lagny hospital and his transfer to Beaujon hospital had been excessively long.",

The Court reiterates its case-law under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention to the effect that where the events in issue lie within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman, cited above, \u00a7 100; Rupa v.

Subsequently, the authors of an expert report dated 25 April 2005 considered that the applicant\u2019s injuries might have stemmed from his having been forced to the ground, received blows from a knee or fallen heavily during his apprehension by the SUGE officers (see paragraph 50 above). In another report drawn up on 19\u00a0October 2006 the experts observed that according to the sequence of events reported to them, the conditions of the arrest in the railway station had very probably, or indeed certainly, caused the traumatic injuries in question (see paragraph 55 above). Finally, an expert assessment submitted on 9 March 2009 had found that it was very unlikely, or indeed impossible, that the fracture had occurred during the incidents at the railway station or at the police station, specifying that the various statements by persons questioned had been deemed incompatible with the forensic medical findings (see paragraphs 65 and 66 above).

This investigation, as with that under Article 2, should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. If this were not the case, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (see, among many other authorities, Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 102, Reports 1998VIII, and El Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0182).",

They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard.
