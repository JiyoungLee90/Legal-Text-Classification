The search for this balance is inherent in the whole of the Convention and is also reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden, judgment of 23 September 1982, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a052, p.\u00a026, \u00a7\u00a069 and Novoseletskiy v. Ukraine, no.\u00a047148/99, \u00a7\u00a0101, 22 February 2005). Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment of whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it does not impose a disproportionate burden on the applicant. In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference that cannot be justified under Article 1.

Only after such verification of all factors concerning the effects of the motorway construction on the applicants' remaining property, such as the decrease in the value of their estate, the possibility of selling it and the applicants' interest in further use of the remaining estate, would it be possible for the domestic authorities to fix adequate compensation in the expropriation proceedings.",

Thus, on account of the shortcomings in the domestic proceedings, the Court is unable to assess the applicants' claim for pecuniary damage. In this respect the Court specifically refers to the opportunity available to the applicants to request re-opening of the proceedings in accordance with section 428(a) of the Civil Procedure Act, which would allow for a fresh examination of their claims concerning the expropriation of their property. It is now for the applicants to make use of that opportunity.
