He lived in a cell where the toilet was placed in his living space and yet it had no combined automated toilet-flushing system, as admitted by the Government (see paragraph 35 below). He noted that flowing water was only available as of 2017, but not previously. In his view, flushing a toilet with a bucket of water was in this day and age not acceptable. In connection with hygiene, he also noted that while he was given powder to wash his clothes, no fabric conditioner was provided. Inmates were given soap bars, as opposed to shower gel, to wash themselves with, but they had to carry it around with them and therefore it was not the most hygienic option. He also noted that of four showers only two were functional and it was only recently that one of the showers \u2013 which had a broken shower tray and was thus hazardous \u2013 had been replaced. Moreover, in winter only one shower could be used, as hot water finished quickly. The applicant noted that the Government had failed to indicate how many people had to be served, and for how many days, by the three water heaters they mentioned (see paragraph 40 below). The applicant claimed that more often than not he had to wash himself with cold water in winter. After a cold shower he would have to return back to his cold cell. In this connection he noted that Malta had high humidity levels which made indoors unbearable without heating in the winter season. While the applicant admitted that blankets were available, he considered that they were not intended for use throughout the day. As to humidity he highlighted that this also exacerbated the heat in summer. He was of the view that it was not for inmates to provide their own fan.",

As to food, he noted that the list provided by the Government showed that inmates had a healthy meal only on Sundays. He also considered that the portions were small, in fact they were handed out in take-out boxes and had to last an inmate for six hours or more; and that the only fruit was banana and oranges.

Given the similarity of the complaints, as well as the submissions and documentary evidence provided by the parties, the Court refers to its general considerations and findings in those cases concerning each of the issues mentioned by the present applicant and reiterates that seen against the background that inmates were each hosted in a single occupancy cell of 9\u00a0sq. m. and that they were free to move around and access the exercise yard, as well as other recreational facilities, for more than ten hours a day, those overall conditions of detention do not amount to a violation of Article\u00a03 of the Convention (see Yanez Pinon and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 116 and 118).",

Further, he failed to refer to any repercussion which ensued as a result of the defective buzzer and this thirty minute delay for assistance on one occasion, nor has the applicant pointed out to any CPT report commenting on such a repeated practice (contrast Danilczuk v.\u00a0Cyprus, no.\u00a021318/12, \u00a7\u00a7 57 and 59, 3 April 2018, where the practice of switching off cell bells during the night, which had been commented on by the CPT, had resulted in inmates not having access to toilets during those hours).

Indeed it has not been argued, nor is it apparent, that all cells or divisions are adjacent to the kitchen; in consequence, despite any doubts it might have as to the way in which these requests are handled (see Story and Others, cited above, \u00a7 77) the Court considers that, if accepted, a request for a transfer from cell no. 45 to another would probably have alleviated the applicant\u2019s condition in this respect.

In this connection it also notes that what in the applicant\u2019s view are basic needs (such as, bigger portions in relation to his three meals a day; a variety of fruit going beyond oranges and bananas; telephone calls at will, shower gel as opposed to soap bars, and fabric conditioner) are not so, but are if at all, ancillary and secondary needs.",

Therefore, for a person held in such conditions, a remedy capable of rapidly bringing the ongoing violation to an end is of the greatest value and, indeed, indispensable in view of the special importance attached to the right under Article 3. However, once the impugned situation has come to an end because this person has been released or placed in conditions that meet the requirements of Article 3, he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for any breach that has already taken place. In other words, in this domain preventive and compensatory remedies have to be complementary to be considered effective (see Ananyev and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7\u00a7 9698 and\u00a0214, 10 January 2012).

Lastly, claimants should not be required to establish that specific officials have engaged in unlawful conduct. Poor conditions of detention are not necessarily due to failings of individual officials, but often the product of more wide-ranging factors (see Neshkov and Others v.

We cannot ignore the fact that the Court has already heard similar complaints concerning the conditions of detention in the same facility in Malta, namely in the cases of Story and Others v.\u00a0Malta\u00a0(nos. 56854/13, 57005/13 and 57043/13, 29 October 2015), Yanez Pinon and Others v. Malta (nos. 71645/13, 7143/14 and 20342/15, 19\u00a0December 2017), and Pe\u00f1aranda Soto v. Malta (no. 16680/14, 19\u00a0December 2017), and concluded that they did not amount to degrading treatment for the purposes of Article 3. Given the similarity of the complaints in the above-mentioned cases and the present one, we believe that integrity dictates that the Court treat them in the same way.",

The present case is the first concerning Division 2 of the same prison facility. Given the similarity of the complaints, as well as the submissions and documentary evidence provided by the parties, including the CPT report, I cannot but come to the same conclusion that the conditions in the Division 2 of the Corradino Correctional facility are inhuman and degrading.",
