The disputed comments appeared in newspaper coverage of public criminal proceedings in which the plaintiff had been accused of a serious crime. The proceedings were open to the public and to those who wanted to observe, in accordance with the usual practice, and the defendants\u2019 account is in accordance with what was revealed at the proceedings. News reporting of criminal cases being tried before the domestic courts must be considered normal and part of a journalist\u2019s work. It cannot be a requirement that news reporting must await the outcome of a trial before publication. It makes no difference that the plaintiff was later acquitted of the charges. It must therefore be held that the published material, at the time it was published, was relevant to the public and was newsworthy. Although the headline on the front page is sensationalist, it has to be kept in mind that it refers to what was revealed during the testimony of the plaintiff in the criminal case, namely that he did not want to reveal the name of the person on whose behalf he was acting in respect of the charge of importing the drugs, as he feared for his own and his family\u2019s safety. In view of all this, the statements are not considered to have been insulting or hurtful to the plaintiff, as defined in Article 234 of the Penal Code, or to contain an insinuation, as in Article 235 of the same Code.

It is not argued that the narrative was in any way incorrect, with the exception of those statements which are at issue in this case. The material published concerned a serious criminal case, which was being tried at a public hearing. It was therefore not subject to any limitations under Article 10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure no. 19/1991, in force at the time, which would have prevented the media from utilising its freedom [of expression] under Article 73 of the Constitution, to report on the case, including freedom to identify the accused.

However, these two\u00a0assertions were made in the statements which the appellant seeks to have declared null and void, without any reservation being made with reference to the fact that the assertions were based on an indictment which was contested in court. Bearing in mind the outcome of the criminal proceedings that had been instituted by that indictment, the statements in question contained an insinuation against the appellant, and there is no ground for rejecting his request for them to be declared null and void. As regards the other statements which the appellant claims should be declared null and void, it must be held that the word \u2018scared\u2019 in the headline on the front page contained a value judgment, and was also supported by comments made by the appellant and the co-accused during the criminal proceedings. The narrative in the article inside the newspaper, stating that the cocaine had been hidden in the vehicle which the appellant had imported into the country and had taken possession of in February\u00a02007, after the police had confiscated the drugs and replaced them with another substance, was merely a description of facts that were later substantiated during the criminal proceedings.

The statement in the front-page headline and those in the article on page two were linked to such a degree [voru \u00feau tengsl] that the defendants must be ordered jointly to pay compensation for them.

The Printing Act did not rule out compensation being paid jointly and severally. However, as pointed out by the applicant, criminal responsibility for printed material could never be attributed jointly and severally, but that had not been an issue in the present case.

Since no author of the headline on the front page had been identified, the editor was the next in line to be found liable. Although the Printing Act was ambiguous about who should be identified as the author of a statement or material, it was clear that responsibility within the meaning of the Act entailed financial and criminal responsibility which could not, in the applicant\u00b4s view, be joint and several. In other words, she argues that the interference was not prescribed by law. However, the Court sees no reason to question the interpretation and application of national law made by the Supreme Court. It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. The Court\u2019s role is thus confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see, amongst other authorities, P\u00e9rez de Rada Cavanilles v.

It closed by stating that he had been placed in pre-trial detention until 13 July 2007, and that a judgment was expected before that date.

Luxembourg (no. 38432/97, ECHR 2001III), in which the Court had found that a journalist could rely on the contents of official and public documents without having to undertake independent research. It seemed that her main error had been not to distance herself from the impugned sentence which was quoted from the indictment. However, she referred again to Thoma, cited above, in which the Court had held that such a requirement was not reconcilable with the role of the press in providing information on current events, opinions and ideas. Moreover, relying on Verlagsgruppe News GmbH v. Austria (no. 76918/01, 14 December 2006) she argued that such a requirement would be too formalistic to be regarded as proportionate.",

Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas, but the public also has a right to receive them. In addition, the Court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation. In cases such as the present one the national margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of a democratic society in enabling the press to exercise its vital role of \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d in imparting information of serious public concern (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and\u00a0Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 59 and 62, and T\u00f8nsbergs Blad A.S. and\u00a0Haukom v.

On the other hand, reference to subsidiarity is a rather standard or preferred argument of some Governments. For example, in Rubins v. Lithuania (no. 79040/12, \u00a7\u00a066, 13 January 2015) the Latvian Government referred to the principle of subsidiarity allegedly reiterated in the Palomo S\u00e1nchez judgment.
