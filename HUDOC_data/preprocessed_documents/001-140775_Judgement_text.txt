The case originated in an application (no. 30671/08) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Milan Maširević (“the applicant”), on 13 May 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr G. Todorić, a lawyer practising in Beočin. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been unlawfully denied access to the Supreme Court of Serbia.
On 6 January 2011 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Sombor.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 8 July 1998 the applicant, a practising lawyer, filed a civil claim with the Municipal Court in Novi Sad, seeking payment of fees from a private insurance company (“the respondent”) for the service rendered on account of a legal fee agreement concluded in 1995.
On 17 September 1998 the Municipal Court ordered that payment (izdao platni nalog). The respondent objected to this order.
On 27 September 2001, in the course of a hearing, the respondent filed a counter-claim, requesting the Municipal Court to declare the 1995 contract null and void.
On 16 September 2002 the Municipal Court decided to join the proceeding initiated by the claim and the counter-claim.
On 24 November 2003 the Municipal Court quashed the payment order of 17 September 1998, rejected the applicant’s claim, declared a part of the contract void and decided that the other part of the contract remained in force.
On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against this judgment.
On 24 February 2005 the District Court in Novi Sad upheld this judgment on appeal.
On an unspecified date in April 2005, the applicant filed an appeal on points of law (revizija).
On 30 November 2006 the Supreme Court returned the file to the District Court, which had apparently failed to adjudicate a part of the applicant’s appeal.
On 25 April 2007 the District Court adopted a supplementary judgment (dopunska presuda), rejecting that part of the applicant’s appeal.
On 24 October 2007 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law (odbacio reviziju kao nedozvoljenu), stating that the applicant was not entitled to lodge it, given that Article 84 of the Civil Procedure Act 2004 prescribes that an appeal on points of law may only be submitted by an attorney at law, not the plaintiff personally. The Supreme Court specified that, according to this Act, parties to the proceedings had lost the legal capacity to file an appeal on points of law individually, even if they were themselves attorneys at law.
The decision of 24 October 2007 was served on the applicant on 14 January 2008.
On 11 February 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Constitutional Court of Serbia.
On 13 May 2008 the Constitutional Court requested the applicant to specify his complaint.
On 6 June 2008 the applicant filed his amended constitutional appeal.
On 25 March 2009 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as incomplete.
Article 382 § 1 provides that parties to the proceedings shall have the right to file an appeal on points of law (revizija) with the Supreme Court within one month as of the date of receipt of the judgment rendered on appeal.
In accordance with Articles 383 and 394-397, inter alia, the Supreme Court shall, should it accept an appeal on points of law lodged by one of the parties concerned, have the power to overturn the impugned judgment or quash it and order a retrial before the lower courts.
The Civil Procedure Act 2004 (hereinafter “the 2004 Act”) entered into force on 23 February 2005, thereby repealing the Civil Procedure Act 1977 (hereinafter “the 1977 Act”).
Article 84 § 2 provides that a party must be represented by legal counsel in the proceedings initiated on the basis of an appeal on points of law.
Article 401 § 2(2) provides that an appeal on points of law shall be declared inadmissible, inter alia, if it was lodged by an individual who is not a practising lawyer.
Article 491 § 4 provides that “the applicable rules of civil procedure, as regards an appeal on points of law lodged against a decision of a second-instance court, in proceedings which had been initiated before the date on which the current Act had entered into force, shall be those rules which were in force prior to the said date”.
Article 422.10 provides that a case may be reopened if the European Court of Human Rights has in the meantime rendered a judgment in respect of Serbia concerning the same or a similar legal issue.
The Civil Procedure Act 2011 (hereinafter “the 2011 Act”) entered into force on 1 February 2012, thereby repealing the 2004 Act.
Article 85 § 2 provides that a party must be represented by legal counsel in the proceedings initiated on the basis of an extra-ordinary remedy, save if the party is a practising lawyer himself.
Article 426.11 provides that a case may be reopened if a party to civil proceedings gains an opportunity to rely on a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights finding a violation of a human right, which may have precluded a more favourable outcome of the civil proceedings in question.
Finding a violation of the right of access to a court, the Constitutional Court stated, inter alia, that the Supreme Court had erred in applying the 2004 Act, because in all cases which had been brought before 23 February 2005, the applicable legislation, as regards an appeal on points of law, should have been the legislation which was in force prior to that date.
In this case, the appellant, a practising lawyer, challenged the Supreme Court’s dismissal of his appeal on point of law in September 2008 and its finding that, according to Article 84 § 2 of the 2004 Act, the parties to the proceedings had lost the legal capacity to file an appeal on points of law individually, even if they were themselves attorneys at law.
Finding a violation of the right to fair trial, the Constitutional Court, inter alia: (a) found that the Supreme Court’s interpretation of Article 84 § 2 had not had a basis in domestic law; (b) specified, referring to Articles 84 § 2 and 401 § 2(2), that only the parties to the proceedings who were not registered lawyers had lost the capacity to submit an appeal on points of law, while appeals on points of law which had been submitted by registered attorneys could not be declared inadmissible; and (c) quashed the Supreme Court’s decision of September 2008 and ordered a new adjudication of the appeal on points of law in accordance with its findings in the present case.
