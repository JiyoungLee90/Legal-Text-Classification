One particularly welcome outcome of these measures is the reduction of the country\u2019s prisoner population. At the time of the 2007 visit, the total number of prisoners stood at 8,033 (including 1,290 on remand), compared with 10,591 in 2004. This positive trend can be attributed to legislative changes in recent years, including the entry into force of a new Code of Execution of Sentences in July 2005 and the adoption of amendments to the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of conditional early releases, as well as a wider use of alternatives to imprisonment and a more selective application of remand custody by the courts.",

In this connection, the Committee must stress the need for a strategy covering both admission to and release from prison to ensure that imprisonment really is the ultimate remedy. This implies, in the first place, an emphasis on non-custodial measures in the period before the imposition of a sentence and, in the second place, the adoption of measures which facilitate the reintegration into society of persons who have been deprived of their liberty.",

Moldova, \u00a7\u00a7 25-31, cited above, and the case-law cited therein). In the present case, it finds that the applicant did not focus on different aspects of his detention during the first and second periods of detention in Prison no. 13, but rather described those conditions as a whole. Indeed, the case is similar to that of Guliyev v.\u00a0Russia (no. 24650/02, 19\u00a0June 2008), where the Court found that two different periods of detention amounted to a \u201ccontinuous situation\u201d because the main characteristic of both periods of detention had been the severe overcrowding in the cells (see also Haritonov v. Moldova, no. 15868/07, \u00a7 24, 5\u00a0July 2011). In the applicant\u2019s case, the three-week transfer in order to be examined in a psychiatric hospital was rather a relatively short interruption of his detention than two distinct periods of detention warranting to be examined separately. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s objection must be rejected.",

Moldova (no. 7101/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045-46, 13\u00a0November 2008), I.D. v. Moldova, cited above, \u00a7 50, and Rotaru v.\u00a0Moldova (no. 51216/06, \u00a7 47, 15\u00a0February 2011). It also observes that the remedy invoked by the Government could not have a preventive effect in the sense of improving the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention, but only a compensatory effect (see, for instance, Holomiov v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a030649/05, \u00a7 107, 7\u00a0November 2006). Therefore, it is not effective in the case of persons still detained in such conditions at the time of lodging their application with the Court (see, for instance, Oprea v.
