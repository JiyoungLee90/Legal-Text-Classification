The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr L. Höltzl, Agent, Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement.
On 5 October 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings in respect of the second and third applicant. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.

In 1993 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicants and other suspects. In the context of a series of complicated economic offences, they were charged with several counts of aggravated fraud, tax fraud, forgery of documents, bribery, fraudulent bankruptcy and accounting crimes.

Simultaneously, the applicants’ homes were searched. On 10 June 1997 the  changed the decision of 25 November 1996 and extended the freezing measure to include all of the first applicant’s assets.

The first applicant was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment and to the confiscation of his frozen property in the value of 300 million Hungarian forints; the second and the third applicants were sentenced to three and a half years’ and three years’ imprisonment respectively.

For the remainder, it upheld the first-instance judgment.
On 29 December 2000 the second and third applicants filed a petition for review. On 6 March 2002 the Supreme Court acquitted them of the charge of tax fraud and upheld the remainder of the second-instance judgment in their respect.
The first applicant’s repeated requests for a retrial were finally refused on 21 May 2002.
