[The applicant] contends that these injuries were inflicted on 25 December 2002 when one of the police officers hit him on the head with his shoe. It follows from the forensic medical examination of 30 December 2002 that [the applicant] had a wound on the back of his head, bruises on his left temple and his left ear, which could have been caused to him 3-5 days before the examination. In the meantime, it was established at the trial that these injuries could have been inflicted on him only after the hearing held by the Leninskiy District Court of Tomsk on 27 December 2002. On that day the District Court examined the request to place [the applicant] in detention, which was rejected by that court. It follows from the testimony of Ms A., the clerk of the hearing on 27 December 2002, that when [the applicant] was present in the District Court neither [he] nor his defence formulated any complaints regarding his ill-treatment; she remembers that when [the applicant] arrived at the District Court, she did not notice any injuries on his head or his face. These circumstances are confirmed by the hearing record of 27 December 2002 examined at the trial, demonstrating that [the applicant] expressed his readiness to cooperate with the investigation, an element which was taken into account in the court\u2019s refusal to place him in detention. The absence of any injuries on the [the applicant\u2019s] face on the night of 26 December 2002 follows from the video record of his interview carried out in the presence of a lawyer and examined in the courtroom. It follows from a certificate drawn up by the Seversk temporary detention centre (IVS), where Belugin was detained between 25\u00a0and 27 December 2002 before the detention hearing, and submitted to the trial court that he did not have any injuries. It follows from [his] own testimony that after the court [hearing] on 27\u00a0December 2002, he went together with his relatives and his lawyer to the regional prosecutor\u2019s office to sign the undertaking not to leave his place of residence; however, he was arrested again in the investigator\u2019s office. Witnesses Mr G., Mr U., Mr F., police officers, and Mr M., the investigator, testified that in the premises of the regional prosecutor\u2019s office [the applicant] had been arrested again on suspicion of having committed another criminal offence; he actively resisted the arrest and physical force was used against him. In these circumstances, the trial court considers that [the applicant] was not ill-treated by police ... when he made his statements of surrender on 26 December 2002 regarding the circumstances of the attack and murder of Mr\u00a0Kol.; physical force was used against him during his second arrest on 27\u00a0December 2002. The trial court thus considers that his statements of surrender were obtained at the pre-trial investigation stage in accordance with the law.",

In addition to the elements referred to by the trial court, the investigator pointed to the inconsistencies in the applicant\u2019s description regarding the time and place of his alleged ill-treatment.

He further challenged the reliability of the IVS medical records referred to by the trial court when dismissing his allegations of ill-treatment. He referred in this respect to the absence of injuries recorded on 27 December 2002 when he had been placed in the IVS for the second time, notwithstanding the authorities\u2019 acknowledgment that he had been injured in the course of that second arrest. He further argued that he had raised the issue of ill-treatment in his complaint against the prosecutor in September 2005, but that the Sovetskiy District Court had dismissed it. Lastly, he had raised the issue at his trial, but it had also been dismissed as unfounded.

The latter allegations were raised for the first time before the Court in his application form of 31 October 2005. The Court thus considers that this part of the complaint is inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies and in any event falls outside the six-month time-limit (see Trubnikov v.\u00a0Russia (dec.) no. 49790/99, 14 October 2003).",

No such appeal was lodged by the applicant against the prosecutor\u2019s refusal of 30\u00a0January 2003 in the present case. The Court further finds that the decision of 5 June 2012 not to open a criminal investigation appears no more than a mere formality. It was taken more than nine years after the decision of 30 January 2003, and came to the same conclusions (see paragraphs\u00a03638 above).

Bulgaria (dec.), no.\u00a042027/98, 3\u00a0April 2003).

The request made by the applicant\u2019s counsel to admit the forensic report of 30\u00a0December 2002 in evidence cannot be construed as an attempt by the applicant to challenge the prosecutor\u2019s decision (see Radzhab\u00a0Magomedov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 20933/08, \u00a7\u00a067, 20\u00a0December 2016).",

The issue of the weight attached to the self-incriminating statements will be examined below under Article 6; in the present case it is enough to point out that this claim did not address questions of the lawfulness of the detention. Furthermore, the applicant provided no explanation of the reasons why he had waited for almost two and a half years before raising the issue of alleged criminal unlawfulness of this detention (compare and contrast with Rakhimberdiyev v.

Germany [GC], no.\u00a054810/00, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2006IX, and G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7 162, ECHR 2010).

The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the \u201cunlawfulness\u201d in question and, where a violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7 95, and G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0163).",

The Court further reiterates that the use of evidence, allegedly obtained as a result of ill-treatment, always raises serious issues as to the fairness of the proceedings, even if the admission of such evidence was not decisive in securing a conviction (see, for example, \u00d6zcan \u00c7olak v.

In doing so, the trial court referred, among other evidence, to his self-incriminating statements of 25 and 26\u00a0December 2002. All statements were subsequently retracted by the applicant, who claimed that they had been made under duress. He requested that his statements be declared inadmissible by the trial court. In support of this request, he referred to a refusal to open criminal proceedings of 30\u00a0January 2003 seeking to establish that his injuries had been caused to him during his arrest on 25 December 2002, to the forensic medical report of 30 December 2002 (see paragraphs 18 and 25 above) and the statements given by his relatives, namely his mother and his sister, who on 27\u00a0December 2002 prior to the detention hearing, had noticed marks on him left by the beatings (see\u00a0paragraph 31 above).",

It also examined medical evidence, in particular the forensic medical report and the applicant\u2019s medical records from the IVS (see paragraphs 11 and 16 above), as well as other evidence such as video recordings of the applicant\u2019s interview as a suspect. As a result of that examination, the trial court came to the conclusion that the applicant\u2019s injuries had been caused on 27\u00a0December 2002, namely after he had made his confession statements, in the course of his second arrest when the police had had to apply force to overcome his resistence. It therefore declared the applicant\u2019s selfincriminating statements admissible and included them in the body of evidence against him.",

It reiterates in this respect that when dealing with allegations that evidence was obtained as a result of illtreatment, the trial court may be called for to assess the same facts and elements which had previously been subject to the investigative authorities\u2019 examination. However, its task is not to examine individual criminal responsability of the alleged perpetrators but to address through a full, independent and comprehensive review the issue of admissibility and reliability of evidence.

It appears from the case file that on both occasions, the applicant showed resistance, and physical force was used against him (see paragraphs 20 and 31 above). As a result, he sustained a number of injuries, which were notably recorded by a forensic medical expert who examined him on 30 December 2002, that is three days after his second arrest by the police. The forensic expert established that the applicant\u2019s injuries might have been caused between three and five days before the examination (see paragraph 18 above).",

The report thus expressly includes the possibility of the injuries having been incurred before the self-incriminating statements were made. The trial court did not, however, question the way in which the forensic medical examination was carried out, notably by enquiring into whether the forensic medical expert had been provided with full information on the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s arrests, made aware of his allegations of illtreatment and invited to express himself on the degree of consistency between the different versions of the origin of the applicant\u2019s injuries.

Russia, no.\u00a013810/04, \u00a7 133, 30 April 2015) and without any medical examination having been carried out as soon as he had been taken to the police station (see paragraphs\u00a046 and\u00a048 above, Korobov v.

The Court reiterates that this measure would have considerably facilitated the trial court\u2019s examination of the applicant\u2019s allegations that he was also beaten after his arrest, particularly bearing in mind that there had been a scuffle during his arrest (see, inter alia, Parnov v. Moldova, no.\u00a035208/06, \u00a7\u00a030, 13\u00a0July 2010, and T\u00fcrkan v. Turkey, no. 33086/04, \u00a7 42, 18 September 2008). Such a medical examination would not only have ensured that he would have been fit for questioning in police custody, but would have constituted evidence showing whether the injuries were caused before the applicant had been taken to the police station and would have assisted the courts in examining the veracity of his ill-treatment allegations (see Khani\u00a0Kabbara v.
