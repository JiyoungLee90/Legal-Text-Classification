The case originated in an application (no. 43199/98) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Claudio Visintin  (“the applicant”), on 4 June 1998.
The applicant was represented by Mr Pietro Volpe, a lawyer practising in Spinea (Venice). The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, assisted by their Co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of a set of criminal proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 6 April 2000 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicant was born in 1957 and is currently residing in Scorzè (Venice). He is a police officer.
On 16 March 1995 the Venice Public Prosecutor questioned the applicant in relation to the charges of blackmail and receiving stolen goods brought against two of his colleagues, Mr F. and Mr L. Considering that the applicant had made false statements during his examination, the Public Prosecutor commenced criminal proceedings against him.
By an order of 18 March 1995, the Venice Public Prosecutor informed the applicant of the charge against him and requested him to appear on 24 March 1995 in order to be questioned. This order served on the applicant on 20 March 1995.
After the entry into force of law no. 332/95, on 23 August 1995 the proceedings against the applicant were suspended awaiting the outcome of those against Mr F. and Mr L. (hereinafter referred to as “the main set of proceedings”). The law at issue had amended Article 371-bis of the Criminal Code, providing that criminal proceedings for making false statements should be suspended until a first-instance judgment was given in the main set of proceedings or until the charges in those proceedings were discontinued.
On 9 June 1998 the applicant introduced a claim before the Venice investigating judge. He objected that Article 371-bis was unconstitutional, as contrary to the principles of equality of rights, presumption of innocence and fair administration of justice, as well as to the right of an accused person to defend himself (Article 24 of the Constitution).
By an order of 27 October 1998, the investigating judge, observing that the impugned provision was aimed at offering a procedural guarantee to the accused, whose responsibility could be properly ascertained only in the light of the outcome of the main set of proceedings, dismissed the applicant’s claim as being manifestly ill-founded.
On 19 November 1998, the applicant appealed on points of law against this order. By a decision of 28 June 1999, the Court of Cassation declared the applicant’s claim inadmissible and sentenced him to pay a fine of ITL 1 000 000.
The main set of proceedings - in which the date of the preliminary hearing had been fixed at 26 September 1998 and then adjourned to 31 October 1998 - had in the meanwhile been terminated. The trial hearing of the applicant’s proceedings was therefore scheduled for 7 October 1999.
On 15 March 2000 the applicant introduced a claim challenging the constitutionality of another provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The trial was therefore once again suspended awaiting the outcome of the proceedings before the Constitutional Court.
According to the information provided by the Government on 22 May 2000, at that date these proceedings were still pending.
