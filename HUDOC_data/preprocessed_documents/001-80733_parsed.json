The Court observes that the parties did not dispute the medical findings, but put forward different versions as to the cause of injury. However, the Court notes that the applicants were not examined medically upon their arrest which, in the Court's view, would have been the appropriate step to take by the police officers who, the Government assert, had to resort to using force during the arrest. In these circumstances, the Court is not satisfied with the Government's explanations as to the manner in which the injuries found at the end of the detention period were sustained by the applicants (see Yavuz v. Turkey, no. 67137/01, \u00a7 41, 10\u00a0January 2006).",
