The case originated in an application (no. 26846/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Wojciech Ćwiertniak (“the applicant”), on 13 July 2005.
The Polish Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged unfairness of the criminal proceedings in his case.
On 16 November 2006 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3 of the Convention).
The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Zamość.
On 12 September 2003 the Otwock District Court convicted the applicant of having committed a series of robberies acting in an organised criminal group and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment. The applicant appealed against the judgment.
On 21 September 2003 the  partly amended the judgment. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court.
On 30 June 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the cassation appeal as manifestly ill-founded.
On 16 August 2005 the applicant sent his application form to the Court. The envelope in which it was delivered bears several stamps of the Zamość Prison and a handwritten note: censored, D[istrict] C[ourt] [ocenzurowano SR]. Two sides of the envelope had been resealed with sellotape. The envelope itself was delivered in a plastic cover, apparently sealed by the post office.
The relevant domestic law concerning the censorship of prisoners’ correspondence is set out in the Court’s judgment in the case of Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02, §§ 33-39, 4 May 2006.
