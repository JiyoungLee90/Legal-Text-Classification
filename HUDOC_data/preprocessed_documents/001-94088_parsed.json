Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims. In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (see McCann and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 146-50, Series A no. 324, and Andronicou and Constantinou v.
