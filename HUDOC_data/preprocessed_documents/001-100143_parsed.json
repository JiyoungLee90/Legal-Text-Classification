The notion of \u201clawfulness\u201d under paragraph 4 of Article 5 has the same meaning as in paragraph 1, so that the arrested or detained person is entitled to a review of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of his detention in the light not only of the requirements of domestic law but also of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 \u00a7 1. Article 5 \u00a7\u00a04 does not guarantee a right to judicial review of such a scope as to empower the court, on all aspects of the case including questions of pure expediency, to substitute its own discretion for that of the decision-making authority. The review should, however, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which are essential for the \u201clawful\u201d detention of a person according to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see E. v. Norway, 29 August 1990, \u00a7\u00a050, Series A no. 181). The remedies must be made available during a person's detention with a view to that person obtaining speedy judicial review of the lawfulness of his or her detention capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release. The accessibility of a remedy implies, inter alia, that the circumstances voluntarily created by the authorities must be such as to afford applicants a realistic possibility of using the remedy (see \u010conka v.\u00a0, no.\u00a051564/99, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 55, ECHR 2002-I).

The Government have also acknowledged that this was the ordinary interpretation of the relevant domestic courts (see paragraph 35 above). In these circumstances the Court is of the view that the remedy under Article 409A did not provide a review of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention in the light not only of the requirements of domestic law but also of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 \u00a7 1.

Moreover, the Court cannot ignore the fact that, notwithstanding the high number of irregular immigrants arriving on Maltese shores, being detained and taking up this procedure, over recent years the Government have only submitted four cases where the remedy was successful. The Court observes that in each of these cases the individuals making the request were vulnerable, either because of their age, their medical condition or disability, and it was in view of the latter reasons that release was granted on the basis that the length of their detention had become unreasonable. Furthermore, it appears from the applicant's submissions substantiated by the relevant testimony (see paragraph 23 above) that these proceedings take at least one month to be decided and may last as long as three months or more. Indeed, it appears that there have been cases where the decision was not rendered before the actual release date of the detainee according to Government policy, rendering such a remedy devoid of any legal or practical effect (see, mutatis mutandis, Frasik v. , no. 22933/02, \u00a7 66, 5 January 2010). The Government have not denied any of the above evidence or at least brought proof of other cases which were decided promptly by the IAB. It follows that these proceedings cannot be considered to determine requests speedily as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Rehbock v. Slovenia, cited above \u00a7\u00a7 82-86, in which the Court considered that a delay of twenty-three days in deciding on the applicant's claims for immediate release was excessive, Khudyakova v. Russia, no.\u00a013476/04, \u00a7\u00a099, 8 January 2009 and Kadem v. Malta, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-45, where the Court held that periods of fifty-four and seventeen days respectively for examining an appeal against proceedings concerning detention pending extradition had been too long). For all the above reasons the Court considers that the proceedings before the IAB cannot be considered as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",

Consequently, the detention had been lawful. Indeed, according to the Government the twelve-month limit started to run from the date when an individual applied for asylum. Thus, the asylum claim having been decided on 18 July 2007, the decision was taken within the one-year time-limit provided by European law. Therefore, the relevant provisions of the Directive 2003/9EC of 27 January 2003 of the European Union did not apply to the case in question as the applicant had ceased to be an \u201casylum seeker\u201d on 18 July 2007. However, even if this were not the case, the Government argued that access to the labour market did not entail freedom from detention, as both were not incompatible. The Government further submitted that both its policies on detention (mentioned by the applicant above) were reasonable in respect of duration considering the intricate problems involved in the removal of undocumented immigrants. The applicant's allegation of a blanket application of these policies to all immigrants was untrue as  had no desire to keep irregular immigrants in detention on its territory if it could repatriate them.

To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention should be appropriate; and the length of the detention should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], cited above, \u00a7 164).",

However, the delay was not due to the need to wait for the courts to determine a legal challenge, the applicant's asylum claim having been determined before his detention.

The Court notes that the Government have not submitted any details as to the procedures initiated save that the police had attempted to obtain such documents through the intervention of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They have not submitted information about the frequency of such requests or whether any other avenues were explored. The Court considers that while it is true that the Maltese authorities could not compel the issuing of such a document, there is no indication in the Government's observations that they pursued the matter vigorously or endeavoured entering into negotiations with the Algerian authorities with a view to expediting its delivery (see Raza v. Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7 73; Tabesh v. , no.\u00a08256/07, \u00a7 56, 26 November 2009; and, conversely, Agnissan v. Denmark (dec.), no 39964/98, 4 October 2001).",

However, assuming the Government were right in their allegation, the Court considers that it must have become clear quite early on that the attempts to repatriate him were bound to fail as the applicant had refused to cooperate and/or the Algerian authorities had not been prepared to issue him documents. Detention cannot be said to have been effected with a view to his deportation if this was no longer feasible (see Mikolenko v.\u00a0Estonia, no. 10664/05, \u00a7\u00a7 64-65, 8 October 2009).

However, the Court must consider whether Maltese law guaranteed a particular procedure to be followed which could offer safeguards against arbitrariness. The Court primarily notes that the Immigration Act applied no limit to detention and that the Government policies have no legal force. In consequence, the applicant was subject to an indeterminate period of detention (see, mutatis mutandis, Muminov v. Russia, no. 42502/06, \u00a7 122, 11 December 2008). In such circumstances the necessity of procedural safeguards becomes decisive. However, the Court has already established that the applicant did not have any effective remedy by which to contest the lawfulness and length of his detention (see paragraphs 46-47 above), and the Government have not pointed to any other normative or practical safeguard. It follows that the Maltese legal system did not provide for a procedure capable of avoiding the risk of arbitrary detention pending deportation (see, mutatis mutandis, Soldatenko v. Ukraine, no. 2440/07, \u00a7 114, 23\u00a0October\u00a02008).",
