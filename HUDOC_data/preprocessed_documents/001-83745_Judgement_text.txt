The case originated in an application (no. 63468/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr David Nigel Geen (“the applicant”) on 29 September 2000.
The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, .
By a decision of 8 April 2003 the Court declared the application partly admissible.
By a judgment of 25 July 2007 the Court decided, inter alia, to adjourn Mr Geen's complaint about non-entitlement to a Widow's Pension.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Maidenhead.
His wife died on 17 October 1995. There were three children of the marriage, born on 18 November 1987, 22 August 1989 and 22 April 1992. On 30 May 2000 the applicant applied to the Benefits Agency for survivor's benefits. He was refused by a letter dated 5 June 2000. The applicant did not appeal as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under  law.
The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, 25 July 2007.
