The Court also acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider that such an initial risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-81, 26\u00a0July 2001).",

In this regard, the Court considers that the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the alleged criminal activities of the applicant may be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention (see Drabek v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a05270/04, \u00a7\u00a049, 20 June 2006). In this regard, the Court reiterates its case-law according to which in cases concerning organised crime a relatively longer period of detention on remand could be justified given the particular difficulties in dealing with those cases by the trial courts (see Celejewski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a036, 4 May 2006). However, it does not give the authorities unlimited power to prolong this preventive measure (see Pasi\u0144ski v. Poland, no. 6356/04, \u00a7\u00a044, 20 June 2006). Firstly, with the passage of time, the initial grounds for pre-trial detention become less and less relevant and the domestic courts should rely on other \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d grounds to justify the deprivation of liberty (see, among many other authorities, I.A. v. France, judgment of 23\u00a0September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, p.\u00a02979, \u00a7\u00a0102; Labita v.\u00a0Italy [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a0153). Secondly, even if due to the particular circumstances of the case, detention on remand is extended beyond the period generally accepted under the Court's case-law, particularly strong reasons would be required to justify this.",
