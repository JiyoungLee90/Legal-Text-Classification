Even assuming that the \u201ccomplaint about delays\u201d under Article 217a of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1952 (see paragraph 47 above) could have speeded up the examination of the case after that date, it came too late to have a significant effect on the length of the proceedings as a whole (see Djangozov, \u00a7 52; Rachevi, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 67; Dimitrov, \u00a7\u00a7 78 and 79; and Todorov, \u00a7 60, all cited above; as well as Holzinger v.

This procedure does not appear prima facie ineffective, but the Court must have regard to the specific circumstances of each case (see, mutatis mutandis, Stefanova v. , no. 58828/00, \u00a7 69, 11 January 2007). It observes that it is not clear whether after September 2002 the applicant requested the enforcement judge to take further steps to execute the final judgment in his favour and, if so, whether he challenged her inaction before the competent court. In these circumstances, the Court does not consider that the remedy available to the applicant was not effective as such. However, having regard to overall delay accumulated by September 2002, it does not consider that its use could have had a significant impact of the length of the proceedings as a whole (see the cases cited in paragraph 80 in fine above).",
