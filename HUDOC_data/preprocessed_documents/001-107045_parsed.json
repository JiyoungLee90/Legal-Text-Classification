It stated that it was not open to doubt that a defendant faced with a legal-aid lawyer\u2019s refusal had the right to take other measures to seek legal assistance necessary for effective lodging of a cassation appeal (III\u00a0KZ\u00a087/01).

It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of 1 December 1999. The Supreme Court observed that the court could only assign a new legal-aid lawyer to the case if it were shown that the first lawyer had been negligent in his or her task of assessing whether a cassation appeal had any prospects of success. If this were not the case, a court was not obliged to assign a new legalaid lawyer to represent the convicted person and its refusal was not subject to appeal (III\u00a0KZ\u00a0139/99).

In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant should not therefore have been required to embark on further attempts to obtain legal assistance with a view to lodging a cassation appeal for the purposes of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see Seliwiak v.\u00a0Poland, no. 3818/04, \u00a7 47, 21 July 2009). In so far as the Government argued that the applicant should have requested that another legal-aid lawyer be assigned to him, the Court observes, having regard to the case-law of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 15 above), that a refusal of a legal-aid lawyer to prepare a cassation appeal was not a valid ground on which the courts would assign another lawyer to the case. As regards the Government\u2019s argument concerning retrospective leave to appeal out of time, the Court considers that the Government\u2019s preliminary objection under this head is closely linked to the merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint.

                        "content": "4.\u00a0\u00a0In order to obviate some of the difficulties inherent in, and criticisms of, the Polish system of cassation appeals, particularly when convicted prisoners who were represented by legal-aid lawyers were involved, the Polish Supreme Court, in a decision handed down on 26 February 2002, changed its previous position concerning the date from which the time for lodging a cassation appeal commences to run, and held (i) that when a legalaid lawyer refused to file a cassation appeal on behalf of a convicted prisoner because in the lawyer\u2019s view the appeal would offer no prospects of success, the time-limit for lodging the appeal would start to run only from the date on which the prisoner was informed by the Court of Appeal of the legal-aid lawyer\u2019s opinion and not from the earlier date when the judgment of the appellate court was served on the prisoner; moreover (ii) it also held that the Court of Appeal was also specifically to instruct the prisoner of this fact so that if he wanted to he could take other measures to seek the legal assistance necessary for the lodging of a cassation appeal (see, Kulikowsky v. Poland 19 May 2009, \u00a7 27). It is against the backdrop of this specific domestic decision that the instant case (as well as other similar ones where a violation has been found on account of the appellate court not having advised the prisoner about his \u201cprocedural rights\u201d in respect of the cassation appeal, e.g. Jan Zawadzki v. Poland (no. 648/02) 6 July 2010, \u00a7\u00a016)) has to be viewed.",

                        "content": "5.\u00a0\u00a0We are now in the last quarter of the year of Our Lord 2011. More than nine years have passed since the decision of the Supreme Court of Poland which established the \u201cnew\u201d procedure as to the running of the time-limit. In the instant case, the facts mentioned in paragraph 2, supra, occurred between September 2008 and August 2009. Has not enough time passed so that this Court could say that the issue of the time-limit for the filing of a cassation appeal pursuant to the legal-aid lawyer\u2019s refusal to file the same, is now well established judge-made law which must be presumed to be known by one and all? Apparently not. It is important to recall in this connection that not every or any procedural failing \u2013 in the sense of the non-observance of domestic procedure \u2013 will necessarily amount to a breach of Article 6. One possible justification for finding \u2013 notwithstanding the passage of time \u2013 a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) is that a person who is in detention is hardly at liberty to rush headlong into a lawyer\u2019s office to seek his advice upon receipt of the Court of Appeal\u2019s letter, and that therefore this person\u2019s \u201cvulnerable\u201d position makes the requirement that he should be informed of his \u201cprocedural rights\u201d necessary in order to give substance to the said articles. To my mind this argument is not very convincing, since the time-limit is not just a matter of a few days or of a couple of weeks, but of thirty running (calendar) days. What the Court is possibly trying to say in the instant judgment is that the legal-aid lawyer\u2019s refusal to file the appeal somehow engages the State\u2019s additional obligation to provide, free of charge, advice as to the applicant\u2019s \u201cprocedural rights\u201d.",
