Poland (dec.), no. 17519/08, \u00a7\u00a7 18-20, 10\u00a0May 2012). This omission appears to be particularly problematic given that, in the context of an alleged breach by a tribunal of domestic legal provisions relating to the establishment and competence of judicial organs, it is always important for the Court to have knowledge of the domestic courts\u2019 position on the matter (see D\u0101vidsons and Savins v. Latvia, nos.\u00a017574/07 and 25235/07, \u00a7\u00a039, 7\u00a0January 2016; and also Biagioli\u00a0v.\u00a0San\u00a0Marino\u00a0(dec.), no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a075, 8\u00a0July 2014).
