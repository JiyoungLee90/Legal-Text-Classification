These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2012, and Benediksd\u00f3ttir v.\u00a0Iceland (dec.), no.\u00a038079/06, 16\u00a0June\u00a02009).

In the light of its accessibility and capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information, the Internet also plays an important role in enhancing the public\u2019s access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general. Along the same line of reasoning, the French Constitutional Council has affirmed that \u201cin the current state of means of communication and given the generalised development of public online communication services and the importance of the latter for the participation in democracy and the expression of ideas and opinions, this right (to freedom of expression) implies freedom to access such services.\u201d Thus, States have a positive obligation to promote and facilitate universal Internet access, including the creation of the infrastructure necessary for Internet connectivity. In the case of private communications on the Internet, the obligation to promote freedom of expression is coupled with the obligation to protect the right to respect for private life. States cannot ensure that individuals are able to freely seek and receive information or express themselves without also respecting, protecting and promoting their right to privacy. At the same time, the risk of harm posed by Internet communications to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms, particularly the right to respect for private life, is certainly higher than that posed by the press. For example, States should counter racial or religious discrimination or hate speech over the Internet. In other words, situations may emerge where the freedom of expression of the content provider, protected by Article 10, may collide with the right to respect for private life of others enshrined in Article 8, or where both the freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life of those involved in Internet communications may conflict with the rights and freedoms of others. The present case pertains to this second type of situation.",

This protection includes not only the content of the communications, but also the metadata resulting from the collection and retention of communications data, which may provide an insight into an individual\u2019s way of life, religious beliefs, political convictions, private preferences and social relations. In the absence of a warning from the employer that communications are being monitored, the employee has a \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d. Any interference by the employer with the employee\u2019s right to respect for private life and freedom of expression, including the mere storing of personal data related to the employee\u2019s private life, must be justified in a democratic society by the protection of certain specific interests covered by the Convention, namely the protection of the rights and freedoms of the employer or other employees (Article 8 \u00a7 2) or the protection of the reputation or rights of the employer or other employees and the prevention of the disclosure of information received by the employee in confidence (Article 10 \u00a7 2).

The central piece of EU legislation is Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. Employment relations are specifically referred to only in the context of the processing of sensitive data. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 lays down the same rights and obligations at the level of the EC institutions and bodies. It also establishes an independent supervisory authority with the task of ensuring that the Regulation is complied with. Directive 2002/58/EC concerns the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector, regulating issues like confidentiality, billing and traffic data and spam. The confidentiality of communications is protected by Article 5 of the Directive, which imposes on Member States an obligation to ensure the confidentiality of communications and the related traffic data by means of a public communications network and publicly available electronic communications services, through national legislation. In particular they are to prohibit listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communications and the related traffic data by persons other than users, without the consent of the users concerned, except when legally authorised to do so. The interception of communications over private networks, including e-mails, instant messaging services, and phone calls, and generally private communications, are not covered, as the Directive refers to publicly available electronic communications services in public communication networks. Also relevant is Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market, which specifies that Member States may not impose general monitoring obligations on providers of internet/email services, because such an obligation would constitute an infringement of freedom of information as well as of the confidentiality of correspondence (Article\u00a015). Within the former third pillar of the EU, Framework Decision\u00a02008/977/JHA dealt with the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. Finally, Article 29 Working Party Opinion 8/2001 on the processing of personal data in the employment context, adopted on 13 September 2001, the Working Document on the surveillance and the monitoring of electronic communications in the workplace, adopted on 29 May 2002, the Working Document on a common interpretation of Article 26(1) of Directive 95/46/EC, adopted on 25 November 2005, and Article 29 Working Party Opinion 2/2006 on privacy issues related to the provision of email screening services, adopted on 21 February 2006, are also important for setting the standards of data protection applicable to employees in the EU. In its 2005 annual report, the Working Party affirmed that \u201c[i]t is not disputed that an e-mail address assigned by a company to its employees constitutes personal data if it enables an individual to be identified\u201d.",

Unconsented collection, access and analysis of the employee\u2019s communications, including metadata, may be permitted only exceptionally, with judicial authorisation, since employees suspected of policy breaches in disciplinary or civil proceedings must not be treated less fairly than presumed offenders in criminal procedure.

Moreover, the termination of the applicant\u2019s employment contract can hardly be said to be proportionate in itself, bearing in mind that it was not proven that the applicant had caused actual damage to his employer, or that he had adopted the same pattern of behaviour for a considerable period of time.",

A human-rights centred approach to Internet usage in the workplace warrants a transparent internal regulatory framework, a consistent implementation policy and a proportionate enforcement strategy by employers. Such a regulatory framework, policy and strategy were totally absent in the present case. The interference with the applicant\u2019s right to privacy was the result of a dismissal decision taken on the basis of an ad hoc Internet surveillance measure by the applicant\u2019s employer, with drastic spill-over effects on the applicant\u2019s social life. The employee\u2019s disciplinary punishment was subsequently confirmed by the domestic courts, on the basis of the same evidence gathered by the above-mentioned contested surveillance measure. The clear impression arising from the file is that the local courts willingly condoned the employer\u2019s seizure upon the Internet abuse as an opportunistic justification for removal of an unwanted employee whom the company was unable to dismiss by lawful means.",

This is an obligation of result, not merely an obligation of means. The domestic courts did not meet this obligation in the present case when assessing the legality of the employer\u2019s dismissal decision, adopted in the disciplinary proceedings against the employee. Although they could have remedied the violation of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for private life, they opted to confirm that violation. This Court did not provide the necessary relief either. For that reason, I dissent.",
