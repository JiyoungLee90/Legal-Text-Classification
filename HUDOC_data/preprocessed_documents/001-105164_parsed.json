It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim\u2019s behaviour (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV). However, to fall under Article\u00a03 of the Convention, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Vala\u0161inas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a7 100-01, ECHR 2001-VIII). When a person is held in detention the State must ensure that he is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Vala\u0161inas, cited above, \u00a7 102, and Kud\u0142a v.  [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7\u00a094, ECHR\u00a02000XI). When assessing conditions of detention, one must consider their cumulative effects as well as the applicant\u2019s specific allegations (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2001II). The duration of the detention is also a relevant factor.",

The Court further observes that, even assuming that the original prison documentation was no longer available, the Government had at their disposal statements by the inmates detained with the applicant in cell no.\u00a051 (see paragraph 51 above).

The Court also notes that the domestic authorities, using the same formula, simultaneously extended the detention of the applicant and his co-defendants. In the Court\u2019s view, this approach is incompatible, in itself, with the guarantees enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in so far as it permits the continued detention of a group of persons without a casebycase assessment of the grounds for detention or of compliance with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement in respect of each individual member of the group (see Gubkin, cited above, \u00a7 144; Aleksey Makarov v.

The case was under investigation for one year, one month and six days. The length of the trial was due to repeated adjournments of the hearings caused by the frequent absences of counsel, victims and witnesses, and other reasons beyond the domestic authorities\u2019 control (almost two years). A short delay (eleven days) was caused by the applicant\u2019s request to be provided with a copy of the indictment act in the Tyvan language (notwithstanding the applicant\u2019s alleged proficiency in Russian) and, as a consequence, the necessity to read out the indictment act in both languages during the trial. In addition, a rather long delay (almost seven months) was caused by the referral of the case for additional investigation on 13\u00a0June 2002 following the defendants\u2019 requests. Some minor delay occurred on account of the illness of the presiding judge and his involvement in the examination of other unrelated criminal cases (over a month). The Government further submitted that the domestic court had made diligent attempts to expedite the proceedings by ensuring, inter alia, the attendance of witnesses and the replacement of counsel. They further stressed that the overall length of the proceedings was justified by the particular complexity of the case, and the need to study the thirty-five volumes of the case file and to obtain the attendance of sixteen victims, sixty-six witnesses, twelve defendants, twelve counsel and three lawyers. Having regard to the foregoing, the Government concluded that the length of the proceedings in the present case did not breach the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement set out in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

The Court is mindful of the Government\u2019s argument that the domestic authorities made certain efforts to expedite the proceedings.
