This meant that he was dependent on the intervention of a third party, which situation did not make it possible for him to pursue the main proceedings at the time and in the manner which he considered to be the most appropriate, to have the benefit of the assistance of counsel of his choice, to ensure that the action was well \"targeted\", to institute subsidiary actions and to claim compensation. He was able to participate in person in the proceedings only for the purpose of supporting the T.E.E.\u2019s arguments and did not therefore have effective control of them. The aim of the disputed Royal Decree was, he argued, in reality the \"violation of engineers\u2019 right of access to a court and the unlawful withholding and exploitation of their fees\"; even supposing that it pursued a legitimate aim, there was a flagrant disproportion between that aim and the means employed.",

Furthermore, the means employed were consistent with that objective. The notion of rights being subrogated to a third party, which had very deep roots in Greek law, was introduced in this area at the express request of engineers, who wished for a more effective and vigorous protection of their rights: in the event of non-payment of their fees, they would be reluctant to sue their clients; in any case, they were paid their fees more easily and more rapidly as a result of the deposit of the amount owed with a professional association responsible for paying them over at a later stage.",
