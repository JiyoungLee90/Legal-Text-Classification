By that decision the applicant church\u2019s request to be granted the property was refused, because, according to the Wroc\u0142aw Governor, it did not satisfy the requirements laid down in sections 39 and\u00a040 of the 1995 Act (see paragraphs 49 and 50 above). The Court considers that the legislative change was justified by the compelling grounds since it was aimed at harmonisation of the legal situation of all churches (see paragraph 78 above). What is more, it was made at the early stage of the proceedings (see, by contrast, Papageorgiou v. Greece, 22\u00a0October 1997, \u00a7\u00a038, Reports 1997VI) which distinguishes the case from other cases dealt with by the Court in which the legislative changes altered the course of proceedings which had been pending for years and in which an enforceable judgment had been adopted (see Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v. Greece, 9 December 1994, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 301B; and Tarbuk v. Croatia, no. 31360/10, \u00a7 54, 11 December 2012). Furthermore, as noted above (see paragraph 72), the legislative amendment did not deprive the applicant church of any \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d to acquire property, because that expectation had not been generated even under the original wording of the 1995 Act. The present case must be distinguished from the circumstances in the case of Scordino v.\u00a0Italy (no 1) (cited above) where the legislative amendment extinguished, with retrospective effect, an essential part of claims for compensation, in very large amounts, that owners of expropriated land could have claimed from the expropriating authorities. The Court agrees with the Government\u2019s submission that in these circumstances the applicant church was not deprived of any \u201cassets\u201d.",
