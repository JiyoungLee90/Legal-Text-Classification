The Court observes that, when an application for state registration of T.\u2019s title to the flat and its subsequent sale to M. was lodged with the state registration authorities, it was encumbered on the latter to check the authenticity of the judgment confirming T.\u2019s title to the flat and the legitimacy of each subsequent transaction with the flat (compare Pchelintseva and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a047724/07 and 4 others, \u00a7\u00a098, 17 November 2016). The Government, however, did not proffer any explanation, as to why the state registration authorities had failed to detect the fraud, had accepted the forged judgment as authentic and had approved the ensuing transactions with the flat. In such circumstances, the Court cannot accept the argument advanced by the national judicial authorities that the applicant could not be considered a bona fide purchaser of the flat for her failure to have doubts as to the authenticity of the judgment checked and accepted by the state registration authorities. Nor did the Government or the domestic courts explain why the frequency of the transactions with the flat and its purchase price should have been a red flag for the applicant.",

The Court reiterates that mistakes or errors on the part of State authorities should serve to benefit the persons affected. In other words, the consequences of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Stolyarova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a049). The Court therefore concludes that the forfeiture of the title to the flat by the applicant, in the circumstances of the case, placed a disproportionate and excessive burden on her.

Belgium (Article\u00a050), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85; Tchitchinadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a018156/05, \u00a7 69, 27 May 2010; Fener Rum Patrikli\u011fi (Ecumenical Patriarchy) v.

Consequently, having due regard to its findings in the instant case and to the fact that the applicant did not receive compensation for loss of title to the flat in the domestic proceedings, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to restore her title to the flat and to annul the eviction order. Thus, the applicant would be put as far as possible in a situation equivalent to the one in which she would have been had there not been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (compare, Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106).",
