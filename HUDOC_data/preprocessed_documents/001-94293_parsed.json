Firstly, the Court observes certain periods of inactivity on the part of the investigating authorities. For instance, a delay of almost two months was caused by the transfer of the file from the investigating authorities to the  (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). Furthermore, the Court reiterates the Government\u2019s acknowledgement that an aggregate delay of over nine months was attributed to the Regional Court\u2019s failure to schedule the first trial hearing (see paragraph 19 above). Another delay of two months resulted from the transfer of the case from the  to the Supreme Court for the examination on appeal (see paragraphs 26 and 28 above). In this respect, the Court reiterates that Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v.  (No. 2), no. 72159/01, \u00a7 57, 4 March 2004). Nor can the Court overlook the fact that the case was pending for more than eight months before the Supreme Court without any apparent progress.

As the requirements of paragraph 3 of Article 6 are to be seen as particular aspects of the right to a fair trial guaranteed by paragraph 1, the Court will examine the complaints under both provisions taken together (see, among other authorities, Poitrimol v. France, 23 November 1993, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 277A). The Court further reiterates that the compliance with the requirements of fair trial must be examined in each case having regard to the development of the proceedings as a whole and not on the basis of the isolated consideration of one particular aspect or one particular incident (see, among other authorities, Moiseyev v. Russia, no. 62936/00, \u00a7 201, 9\u00a0October 2008), although it cannot be ruled out that a specific factor may be so decisive as to enable the fairness of the trial to be assessed at an earlier stage in the proceedings (see, inter alia, Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8\u00a0June\u00a01976, \u00a7 91, Series A no. 22; Luedicke, Belkacem and Ko\u00e7 v.

This principle holds true not only for the application of the concept of fair trial as such, as laid down in paragraph 1 of Article 6, but also for the application of the specific guarantees laid down in paragraph 3 (see Can v. Austria, no.\u00a09300/81, Commission\u2019s report of 12\u00a0July 1984, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 96). The Court thus considers that in order to determine whether the defence rights were respected in the criminal proceedings against the applicant, it firstly has to examine the issue of the applicant\u2019s access to a lawyer at the stage of the pre-trial investigation, in particular, the first few days after his arrest. It will then proceed to the examination of the manner in which the legal aid lawyer, Ms Ya., exercised her duties during the applicant\u2019s trial, and to the issue of the availability of legal aid for the applicant at the appeal stage.",

Thus, Article\u00a06 - especially paragraph 3 - may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions (see Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 275). As the Court has already held in its previous judgments, the right set out in paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 of the Convention is one element, amongst others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in paragraph 1 (see Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 37, and Brennan v. the United Kingdom, no. 39846/98, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2001X).",

Nevertheless, Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) does not specify the manner of exercising this right. It thus leaves to the Contracting States the choice of the means of ensuring that it is secured in their judicial systems, the Court\u2019s task being only to ascertain whether the method they have chosen is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial. In this respect, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to \u201cguarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective\u201d and that assigning counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused (see Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

At the same time, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself. This right indeed presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2006-..., and Kolu v. Turkey, no. 35811/97, \u00a7 51, 2 August 2005). Early access to a lawyer is part of the procedural safeguards to which the Court will have particular regard when examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination (see, mutatis mutandis, Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7 101).",

Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction - whatever its justification - must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6 (see, mutatis mutandis, Magee, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044). The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz v.

On 15 December 1998 the applicant was arrested. A police investigator notified him that he had been arrested on a robbery charge and apprised him of his rights as an accused within the meaning of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure, including the rights not to make self-incriminating statements and to be assisted by counsel.

The applicant stressed that he had asked the investigator to contact Mr L. and had provided him with necessary contact information, including Mr L.\u2019s telephone number and home address. The Court, however, does not find it necessary to resolve the difference of opinion between the applicant and the Government. It suffices to note that the applicant made his intention to be assisted by counsel sufficiently clear to make it imperative for the investigating authorities to give him the benefit of legal assistance, unless there existed compelling reasons justifying the denial to the applicant of access to a lawyer (see Panovits v. Cyprus, no.\u00a04268/04, \u00a7 66, 11 December 2008). It therefore remains to be ascertained whether the domestic authorities allowed the applicant to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer and, if not, whether the restriction on the applicant\u2019s defence rights was justified and whether, if so, that restriction prejudiced the overall fairness of the proceedings (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a052).",

Without accepting the veracity of the Government\u2019s argument which was formulated in a very ambiguous and equivocal manner and was not supported by any evidence (a statement from Mr L., copies of summonses, a record of a telephone call, for example), the Court observes that, in the event that Mr L. was unavailable, the investigating authorities should have offered the applicant the possibility to retain another counsel or appointed a lawyer from the local Bar Association to assist the applicant.

In fact, there is no evidence showing that the applicant had even been informed about the investigator\u2019s allegedly unsuccessful attempts to contact Mr L. As it follows from the parties\u2019 submissions, having finished drawing up the arrest record, the investigator proceeded to question the applicant despite the latter\u2019s pending request for legal assistance. As a result, the applicant made a statement, confessing to a robbery. On the following day, 16\u00a0December\u00a01998, the investigator continued interrogating the applicant, without furnishing him counsel. The interrogation led to yet another confession, this time to a number of criminal offences, including a murder, kidnapping, hijacking and unlawful possession of weapons. The applicant submitted that, prior to the interrogation, he had repeated his request for legal assistance. The Court observes that the Government did not comment on the applicant\u2019s assertion. They merely noted that the applicant had refused legal assistance during a number of subsequent investigative actions, the earliest one being conducted on 17 December 1998. In addition, the Court notes that in order to be able to assess the merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the absence of legal assistance, it asked the respondent Government to produce copies of records of all investigative actions performed before 30 December 1998. The Government, without giving any reasons, failed to produce copies of the interrogation records drawn up on 15\u00a0and 16\u00a0December 1998. In these circumstances, the Court considers that it can draw inferences from the Government\u2019s conduct and finds it established that on 15 and 16\u00a0December 1998 the applicant did not have access to a lawyer when he made his statements to the investigating authorities.",

In particular, they emphasised that, at least prior to his questioning on 15 December 1998, the applicant had been apprised of his constitutional right not to make self-incriminating statements. The Government implied that the applicant\u2019s decision to confess his guilt to the investigator during the interrogations on 15 and 16\u00a0December 1998 constituted an implicit waiver of his right to counsel.",

Italy (dec.), no. 52868/99, 30 November 2000). However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, a waiver of the right must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see Sejdovic v.

A waiver of the right, once invoked, must not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right. Before an accused can be said to have implicitly, through his conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be (see Talat Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 32432/96, 27\u00a0March 2007, \u00a7\u00a059, and Jones v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 30900/02, 9 September 2003).",

It is not to be ruled out that, after initially being advised of his rights, an accused may himself validly waive his rights and respond to interrogation. However, the Court strongly indicates that additional safeguards are necessary when the accused asks for counsel because if an accused has no lawyer, he has less chance of being informed of his rights and, as a consequence, there is less chance that they will be respected.",

The Court firstly reiterates its finding in the case of Salduz v. Turkey (cited above, \u00a7 59) that no inferences could be drawn from the mere fact that the applicant had been reminded of his right to remain silent and signed the form stating his rights. A caution given by the investigating authorities informing an accused of the right to silence is a minimum recognition of the right, and as administered it barely meets the minimum aim of acquainting the accused with the rights which the law confirms on him (see, for similar finding, Panovits, cited above, \u00a7 74). In the Court\u2019s view, when an accused has invoked his right to be assisted by counsel during interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights. Moreover, the Court is of the opinion that an accused such as the applicant in the present case, who had expressed his desire to participate in investigative steps only through counsel, should not be subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police or prosecution.",

The fact that the police proceeded to questioning the applicant in the absence of counsel occurred neither at the applicant\u2019s suggestion nor at his request. There is no evidence that the confessions made by the applicant during those interrogations were initiated by him. Furthermore, the Court does not rule out that, in a situation when his request for assistance by counsel had been left without adequate response, the applicant who, as it follows from the case file, had had no previous encounters with the police, did not understand what was required to stop the interrogation. The Court is mindful that the applicant may not have had sufficient knowledge, experience, or even sufficient self-confidence to make the best choice without the advice and support of a lawyer. It is possible that he did not object to further questioning in the absence of legal assistance, seeing the confession (true or not) as the only way to end the interrogation. Given the lack of legal assistance the Court considers it also unlikely that the applicant could reasonably have appreciated the consequences of his proceeding to be questioned without the assistance of counsel in a criminal case concerning the investigation of a number of particularly grave criminal offences (see Talat Tun\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7 60). The Court therefore does not find that the applicant\u2019s statements, made without having had access to counsel, amounted to a valid waiver of his right.",

Poland, nos. 27715/95 and 30209/96, \u00a7 77, 20 June 2002). However, the Court finds it necessary to address the following argument raised by the Government, which is closely linked to the issue of the nature of the detriment the applicant suffered due to the breach of his defence rights. In particular the Government, relying on extracts from records of various investigative steps, submitted that during each investigative action, including each interrogation performed after 16 December 1998, the authorities had offered the applicant the possibility to benefit from assistance by legal aid counsel. However, the latter had refused legal services during the majority of those investigative steps. The Government attributed specific weight to the fact that on 17 December 1998 the applicant had explicitly waived his right to counsel and had willingly participated in the investigative experiment conducted by the prosecution authorities. During that experiment, in the presence of attesting witnesses, he had confirmed his previous statements made during the interrogations on 15 and 16\u00a0December 1998. It appears that, in the Government\u2019s view, the fact that the applicant had voluntarily repeated his confessions nullified all possible deficiencies which had occurred during those two previous interrogations.",

This assertion is confirmed by the extracts from the investigative records presented by the Government. Although there is no evidence that the applicant\u2019s refusals had not been made voluntarily and knowingly, the Court finds it unexplainable that during purely formal procedural investigative steps the applicant was always assisted by legal aid counsel, while he usually refused legal assistance when he had to answer the investigators\u2019 questions (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above). The Court also does not lose sight of the Regional Court\u2019s finding, pertaining to statements made by the applicant\u2019s co-defendants while in police custody.

The Court also considers that the nature of the detriment he suffered because of the breach of due process at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings was such that neither effective assistance provided subsequently by a lawyer nor the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings, in which the applicant\u2019s statements to the police were used for his conviction, could remedy the defects which had occurred in police custody (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 58, and Panovits, cited above, \u00a7 75). The Court therefore considers it unnecessary to examine separately whether the fairness of the proceedings was also breached by the manner in which counsel, Ms Ya. had rendered legal assistance to the applicant and because the applicant had not been assisted by counsel during the appeal proceedings (see Komanick\u00fd v. , no.\u00a032106/96, \u00a7\u00a056, 4\u00a0June 2002 and Vladimir Romanov v.
