The case originated in an application (no. 77831/01) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mrs I.P. (“the applicant”), on 27 July 2000.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs.
On 19 November 2002 the Fourth Section declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. The President of the Chamber further decided to authorise the anonymity of the applicant (Rule 47 § 3 of the Rules of Court).
The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Ciechanów, Poland.
In August 1992 the applicant, at that time thirty-years-old, underwent gynaecological surgery. A few days later, due to postoperative complications, the applicant had to undergo another operation during which her uterus and one ovary were removed.
In October 1992 the applicant requested the prosecution service to initiate criminal proceedings against the doctors and the hospital. On 15 February 1996 the proceedings were finally discontinued.
On 29 April 1993 the applicant lodged with the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki w Warszawie) a civil action for compensation against the hospital. She claimed that she was a victim of medical malpractice which deprived her of a possibility of having more children and caused enormous psychological suffering. She requested compensation of PLN 50,000.
On 4 May 1993 the Warsaw Regional Court exempted the applicant from the court fees.
On 5 July 1994 the court held the first hearing at which the applicant was heard. The court requested from the prosecution service the casefile concerning the criminal case against the doctors.
On 25 January 1995 the trial court stayed the proceedings because the prosecution service refused to provide the file of the criminal case while the criminal proceedings were pending.
On 21 June 1996 the trial court resumed the civil proceedings.
On 23 August 1996 the court held a hearing which had to be adjourned because of the absence of the defendant’s representative.
On 27 November 1996, 15 January and 12 February 1997 the trial court held hearings at which it heard witnesses.
On 2 April 1997 the court, sitting in camera, ordered an expert opinion. The opinion was prepared on 17 July 1997.
At the hearing which was held on 26 September 1997 the court heard an expert witness.
On 21 October 1997 the applicant requested the court to order the preparation of another expert opinion.
In February 1998 the applicant dismissed her lawyer because she could not any longer afford this expense. It appears that she applied for a courtappointed lawyer but her application was not examined.
On 13 March 1998 the court, sitting in camera, allowed the applicant’s application for a second expert opinion. Subsequently, the applicant informed the court that she wished to cross-examine the expert witnesses.
On 15 July 1998 the court, sitting in camera, dismissed the applicant’s request to exempt her from the costs of the expert opinion.
On 30 September 1998 the applicant received the expert opinion and again requested the court to hear expert witnesses.
In May 1999 the court asked the applicant to designate the defendant because after the administrative reform the Mazowsze Governor had become a competent authority to represent the State Treasury. The applicant complied with this order. She also asked the trial court to call as a codefendant the doctor who performed the surgery, but on 8 December 1999 the court refused her application.
Between 27 September 1997 and 6 February 2000 no hearings were held.
On 7 February 2000 the court held a hearing. The applicant was informed that the court had lost her application to hear expert witnesses and her questions to them. The new date for cross-examination was set for 29 June 2000 before the Kraków Regional Court.
The applicant went to Kraków to take part in the hearing scheduled for 29 June 2000, however, it was adjourned because the expert witnesses were not properly notified.
On 19 October and 16 November 2000 the expert witnesses were heard before the Kraków District Court. The applicant who could not attend that hearing, submitted her questions in writing.
On 8 January 2001 the trial court held the last hearing.
On 5 February 2001 the Warsaw Regional Court gave judgment. It found no negligence on the part of doctors. Nevertheless, the applicant was awarded PLN 10,000 as compensation for her suffering.
In April 2001 the applicant lodged an appeal against this judgment.
On 28 February 2002 the applicant’s appeal was rejected by the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) as lodged out of time. The applicant appealed against it and on 20 May 2002 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, sitting in camera, partly exempted her from the court fees in the appeal procedure.
On 11 October 2002 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) dismissed her appeal against the Court of Appeal’s decision of 28 February 2002.
