In its reasoning for quashing that part of the decision, the court first relied on the discrepancy in the number of bottles mentioned in the search-and-seizure report of 6 and 7 January 2005 and the quantity referred to in the decision of 23 December 2005. According to the documentary evidence presented, 53,857 bottles had been referred to in the criminal proceedings, whereas administrative proceedings had been brought against the applicant company for storing 54,181 bottles without the required stamps. The Regional Court found that this was a manifest discrepancy, which the lower court had failed to identify in assessing the evidence gathered. Further, the court noted that according to the documentary evidence in the file, the excise duty in relation to the impugned merchandise had been paid by the importing company D.B., which had initially sold the bottles to the applicant company. That company had received the mandatory excise duty stamps and its subcontractors had started to apply them to the bottles. It was true that the process of application of those duty stamps had not been completed on time and this constituted an administrative offence. However, that offence had preceded the moment when the applicant company had bought the merchandise. At the time of the inspection, the bottles had still been treated as merchandise in the process of importation and had been stored for that purpose at a warehouse. The mandatory duty stamps had been placed in the safe of the warehouse. In light of those elements, the Regional Court found that the offence, subject to the administrative proceedings, had not been committed by the applicant company.",

In that decision, the prosecutor referred to the applicant company\u2019s merchandise as having been seized in the course of the criminal proceedings against the first group of third parties. She also noted that no ruling had been made concerning the bottles in either the judgment of the Varna District Court of 7 November 2005 or the judgment of the Varna Regional Court of 17 April 2006 which ended that set of criminal proceedings (see paragraph 7 above).

The Varna regional tax office replied on 17 August 2006, again stating that it was not competent to rule on the return of the bottles as the appeal proceedings against the decision of 23 December 2005 on the administrative sanctions against the applicant company were pending before the Varna District Court. The Varna tax authority argued that that court was the competent authority to rule on the return of the merchandise, which had been adduced as evidence to the case pending before it.

That court found that the facts of the case did not concern a failure to perform actions required by law but rather the failure to enforce a final judicial decision.

That report had indicated, with respect to the bottles cited in the search-and-seizure report of 6 and 7\u00a0January 2005 (see paragraph 6 above), among other things, that the applicant company had spent, according to the available purchase invoices, a total of BGN 466,159.96 Bulgarian levs (BGN) (238,343.80 euros (EUR)) to acquire 25,748 bottles of Baileys cream liqueur. The report added that the shelf life of those beverages had expired in September and October 2006. The statutory default interest on that amount was BGN 196,429.71 (EUR\u00a0100,432.92) for the period between 7 January 2005 and 17 March 2008, BGN 140,480.68 (EUR 71,826.63) for the period between 1 January 2006 and 17 March 2008, and BGN 82,923.52 (EUR 42,398.12) for the period between 18 December 2006 and 17 March 2008. Further, the judgment mentioned that the expert report had shown that the market price at the moment of the seizure of those beverages (7 January 2005) was higher than their purchase price, the difference between them being evaluated in the amount of BGN 134,527,70 (EUR 68,782.92). Without referring to precise figures, the judgment indicated that the expert report had calculated statutory default interest on that amount also. Finally, that report had also indicated three different amounts corresponding to statutory default interest for the retention of bottles which did not have an expiry date and could be marketed after their return. The number of those beverages was not indicated in the judgment. The three different amounts for statutory default interest referred to three periods and three different market estimations of the bottles\u2019 price, without giving more detailed information, as follows: a)\u00a0BGN 111,926.24 (EUR 57,226.98) for the period between 7 January 2005 and 30 March 2007 with respect to a sum of BGN 396,896.86 (EUR\u00a0202,930.14); b) BGN 69,694.98 (EUR 35,634.48) for the period between 1 January 2006 and 30 March 2007 with respect to a sum of BGN\u00a0430,263.26 (EUR 219,990.11); and c) BGN 14,338.36 (EUR\u00a07,331.08) for the period between 18 December 2006 and 30 March 2007 with respect to a sum of BGN 372,314.72 (EUR 190,361.49). The court observed that the expert\u2019s conclusions were not disputed by the parties. It considered the report to be well-founded and corresponding to the rest of the evidence in the case. The expert report itself had not been submitted before the Court within the time-limits set in the present procedure.",

On one hand, its claims were related to the retention of objects seized as evidence in the course of criminal proceedings, issues normally subject to the general rules of tort under the Contracts and Obligations Act (see Posevini, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 46). On the other hand, they concerned the specific issue of a delay in enforcing, or a failure to enforce, a final judicial decision, a situation in which State bodies\u2019 liability was to be examined under the SMRDA (see Dimitar Yanakiev, cited above, \u00a7 37). It is not for the Court to determine the nature of the relationship between the provisions of those Acts. In that connection, it is in principle sufficient to note that the Bulgarian courts apparently regard the two as autonomous in the sense that either of them can serve as a basis for a tort claim against the authorities (see First Sofia Commodities EOOD and Paragh v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 14397/04, \u00a7 35 in fine, 25\u00a0January 2011).",

Malta [GC], no.\u00a025642/94, \u00a7 39, ECHR 1999-III). When a remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, \u00a7 58, 15 October 2009). In the present case, the applicant company used one of the potentially available remedies \u2013 namely, a claim under the SMRDA (contrast First Sofia Commodities EOOD and Paragh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035 in fine). In the context of the conflicting practice in the relevant domestic case-law before 2015, and taking into account the factual complexity of the situation, the Court finds that it was not necessary for the applicant company to have also submitted a tort claim under the Contract and Obligations Act in order to comply with the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

The Government referred to the administrative offence report issued against the applicant company on that same date by the Varna regional tax office which pointed to the search-and-seizure report of 6 and 7 January 2005.

In applying the measure, the authorities had acted with a reasonable degree of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved.

It further notes that the seizure was the result of the investigative authorities\u2019 exercising their powers under Article 108 of the 1974 Code and Article\u00a0111 of the 2005 Code, as well as of the tax authorities exercising their powers under the 1969 Act (see paragraphs 34, 39 and 40 above). Thus, the interference with property rights in the present case can be examined as a constituent element of the procedure for controlling the use of goods subject to excise duty (see, mutatis mutandis, AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24\u00a0October 1986, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 108, and Bowler International Unit v.\u00a0France, no. 1946/06, \u00a7 41, 23 July 2009), as a measure for securing the payment of taxes or penalties (see, mutatis mutandis, Gasus Dosier- und F\u00f6rdertechnik GmbH v. the Netherlands, 23 February 1995, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 306B) and as a measure for securing physical evidence in ongoing administrative and criminal proceedings (see Atanasov and Ovcharov v.

However, the decision of 23\u00a0December 2005 made no mention of the applicant company\u2019s merchandise being used as evidence, but referred only to the searchandseizure report of 6 and 7 January 2005 in order to identify it. As required by domestic law, when a case file is transferred from one body to another, custody of the physical evidence adduced to it is also transferred (see paragraph 36 above). The Court notes that no document showing that merchandise belonging to the applicant company was transferred to the tax authorities as part of the evidence in the administrative proceedings has been presented.",

(see paragraph\u00a015 above). Taking into account the lack of clear legal ground on the basis of which the bottles were retained after 7 December 2005, the Court does not find the steps undertaken by the applicant company in that respect deficient. The applicant company did address the authority having actual possession of those bottles (see paragraph 16 above) and later addressed the Varna tax authority with the same request (see paragraph\u00a017 above). As to the criminal proceedings against the second set of third parties, the Court refers to its finding that no decision with respect to the beverages was taken in these proceedings (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above) and thus sees no reason for the applicant company to have used that procedural route for recovering its merchandise.",

They again argued that the applicant company could have sought damages under the Contracts and Obligations Act instead of submitting a claim under the SMRDA (see paragraphs 43-57 above).",
