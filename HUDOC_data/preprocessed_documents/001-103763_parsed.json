They were thus treated differently from those who had stayed in what is today the Federation during the war. The Human Rights Chamber considered that difference in treatment to be discriminatory and an obstacle to the return of displaced persons to their pre-war homes (RS Fund pensions were normally lower than FBH Fund pensions, and the cost of living was normally higher in the Federation). Furthermore, it held that the situation complained of had racist connotations (given the nature of the war, the population that had moved from what is today the Federation to what is today the Republika Srpska during the war had primarily been Serbs, and those who had stayed were mostly Bosniacs and Croats). The Human Rights Chamber ordered the Federation: (a) to take all necessary legislative and administrative actions by 10\u00a0July\u00a02003 to ensure that the applicants were no longer discriminated against, particularly in comparison to those pensioners who had remained in what is today the Federation during the war; and (b) to compensate the applicants for the difference between their RS Fund pensions and the amount they would have received from the FBH Fund from the date of their application to the Human Rights Chamber until the date of the Federation\u2019s compliance with the order under (a) above.",

In order to determine the amount due, on 23 June and 22\u00a0July 2008 the FBH Fund asked the RS Fund to indicate the sums actually paid to Ms Pa\u0161ali\u0107. The RS Fund failed to respond. On 3 July and 28 August 2008 the FBH Fund sent letters to Ms Pa\u0161ali\u0107 (one to an address in Sarajevo and the other to an address in Belgrade), but they were returned as undeliverable (addressee unknown).

It also held that the fact that the disparity between the pensions paid by each of the funds had become smaller after the adoption of the domestic decision in issue was of no relevance to the obligation of the respondent State to enforce it. The Constitutional Court later came to the same conclusion in the present applicant\u2019s case: despite the fact that the FBH Fund had agreed to pay Mr\u00a0\u0160ekerovi\u0107 the difference between his current pension and what he would have received as a pension from the FBH Fund and to continue paying any such difference in the future, the Constitutional Court held that Mr\u00a0\u0160ekerovi\u0107 should instead be granted an FBH Fund pension (see paragraph 14 above).

Turning to the merits of this complaint, it is noted that the domestic Human Rights Chamber held that the applicant and other pensioners returning from the Republika Srpska to the Federation after the war were discriminated against in comparison to pensioners who had stayed in what is today the Federation during the war in the absence of any objective and reasonable justification for such differential treatment (see paragraph 9 above). The Court does not see any reason to depart from that ruling. Having regard to its finding that the measures indicated in that domestic decision have not yet been implemented (see paragraph 31 above), the Court considers that the applicant continues to be discriminated against solely on account of her status as a formerly internally displaced person.

It ordered some individual measures (including the transfer of the applicant\u2019s pension entitlement to the FBH Fund), but left it to the respondent State to select, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general measures to be adopted to put an end to the violation found by the Court. After the Karanovi\u0107 judgment, the respondent State has decided to enforce other similar domestic decisions (four decisions in total concerning nineteen individuals, including the present applicants) by paying any difference between the sums which they receive from the RS Fund and those which they would receive from the FBH Fund (see paragraphs 12-13 above).

Furthermore, while it is true that only nineteen people have so far obtained such a judgment in their favour, many others could do so in the future according to the figures provided by the Government. Since the general measures ordered by the Constitutional Court in a similar case (see paragraph 19 above) have not yet been implemented, there would appear to be no basis for rejecting any future similar case simply because the applicant has not complained to the Constitutional Court (see Halilovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 23968/05, \u00a7 22, 24 November 2009, where the Court rejected the Government\u2019s objection that the applicant had failed to properly complain to the Constitutional Court, because general measures ordered by that court in a similar case had not been implemented).

It must be emphasised that this order does not apply to those who did not return to the Federation after the war (see paragraph 20 above). That being said, those who are granted FBH Fund pensions after their return from the Republika Srpska should, just as any other FBH Fund pensioner, keep their pension entitlements even if they later move abroad (such as Ms Pa\u0161ali\u0107, who moved to Serbia after the Human Rights Chamber had rendered a decision in her favour).",
