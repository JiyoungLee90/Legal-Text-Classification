Instead, as noted above, they proved reluctant to assist the applicants and even chose, for many years, to actively oppose their attempts to bring about the completion of the compensation procedure. This undoubtedly left the applicants in a state of uncertainty as to whether and when they would receive the compensation to which they were entitled. To this must be added the lack of effective domestic remedies for rectifying the situation. The above means that the authorities failed to strike a fair balance between the general interest and the applicants\u2019 rights, as required under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Kirilova and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 121 and 123; Antonovi, \u00a7 30; and Dichev, \u00a7 30, all cited above).",
