All these factors taken together led the Court to the conclusion that the lack of standing before a court of the biological father in proceedings to have his biological paternity recognised in law were in breach of Article 72 of the Constitution, providing for protection of the children\u2019s rights as a constitutional principle. It was further stated that this was also in breach of the father\u2019s right to respect for his private and family life, guaranteed by Article 47 of the Constitution.

In particular, the latter considered that the necessity of the mother\u2019s consent for the recognition of paternity, on the one hand, and the lack of standing before the court to have one\u2019s paternity recognised in law on the other resulted in a situation in which, in the absence of such a consent, a biological father would be deprived of any possibility of creating legal ties between himself and his child. It further emphasised that a decision of the authorities to institute proceedings with a view to creating such ties was left entirely to their discretion. All these factors taken together led that Court to the conclusion that relevant provisions were in breach of the putative father\u2019s right to respect for his private and family life, guaranteed by the Constitution.",

While the Court acknowledges that it can be surmised that that the authorities, when giving their decisions after the child had been recognised by J.

Thirdly, the Court considered the perfunctory manner in which the authorities exercised their powers when dealing with the applicant\u2019s requests to challenge this paternity (see \u00a7 77 above). Having examined the manner in which all these elements taken together affected the applicant\u2019s situation, the Court concludes that, even having regard to the margin of appreciation left to the State, it failed to secure to the applicant the respect for his family life to which he is entitled under the Convention (Mizzi v.\u00a0Malta, no. 26111/02 \u00a7 114, mutatis mutandis).",

While it is true that, under both the European Convention and the Polish Constitution, a putative father should not be deprived of access to the courts to raise his paternity claim, it is also true that such access need not be unlimited. Where there is a loving and loyal union between man and woman, the mother has no reason to refuse consent for recognition of paternity. Refusal of consent presupposes a conflict and it is the child, and not the putative father, who should be protected in such a situation. There is always a risk that paternity claims might be raised in a frivolous or vexatious way and be used to harass mother and child. That could have a disastrous effect upon the psychological development of the child. Hence, the legislature can and should establish such limitations and restrictions as are necessary for protection of the welfare of the child.

In January 1995 he lodged a motion with the District Court to have a guardian appointed for the purposes of the paternity proceedings. Almost simultaneously, he requested the Public Prosecutor to institute the paternity proceedings on his behalf. In May 1995 he was advised by the Prosecutor that it was unwise to pursue two parallel sets of proceedings in the same matter. Six months later the applicant withdrew his motion before the District Court. Later he focused on futile attempts to institute a criminal investigation against the mother. It must not be forgotten that, in March 1996, another putative father claimed paternity and that his claim was confirmed by the mother. All those facts lead us to the conclusion that the applicant\u2019s paternity request was not a clear and convincing one, nor did he show the required degree of diligence in pursuing his case.",

The existing remedies may have not been perfect, but they were in place and did work in the case of the second candidate to paternity, and it is not for the Court to speculate on how they would have worked in the case of the applicant. The applicant was a victim of his own indecisiveness. The State cannot be held responsible for his lack of action.",
