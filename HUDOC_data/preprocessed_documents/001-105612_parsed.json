Owing to the sensitivity of the intelligence material upon which the applicant\u2019s arrest and detention had been based, only two members of the DIRC were permitted to examine it. Their recommendations were passed to the Commander of the Coalition\u2019s Multinational Division (South-East) (\u201cthe Commander\u201d), who himself examined the intelligence file on the applicant and took the decision to continue the internment. Between January and July 2005 a monthly review was carried out by the Commander, on the basis of the recommendations of the DIRC. Between July 2005 and December 2007 the decision to intern the applicant was taken by the DIRC itself, which, during this period, included as members the Commander together with members of the legal, intelligence and other army staffs. There was no procedure for disclosure of evidence or for an oral hearing, but representations could be made by the internee in writing which were considered by the legal branch and put before the DIRC for consideration. The two Commanders who authorised the applicant\u2019s internment in 2005 and 2006 gave evidence to the domestic courts that there was a substantial weight of intelligence material indicating that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting the applicant of the matters alleged against him.",

The Secretary of State accepted that the applicant\u2019s detention within a British military facility brought him within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom under Article 1 of the Convention. He also accepted that the detention did not fall within any of the permitted cases set out in Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. However, the Secretary of State contended that Article 5 \u00a7 1 did not apply to the applicant because his detention was authorised by United Nations Security Council Resolution\u00a01546 (see paragraph 35 below) and that, as a matter of international law, the effect of the Resolution was to displace Article 5 \u00a7 1. He also denied that his refusal to return the applicant to the United Kingdom was unreasonable. It was argued on behalf of the applicant that Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations (see paragraph 46 below) had no application since, inter alia, Resolution 1546 placed no obligation on the United Kingdom and/or since the Charter of the United Nations placed an obligation on member States to protect human rights.",

By the practice of the member States of the United Nations, a State which acted under such an authority was treated as having agreed to carry out the Resolution for the purposes of Article 25 of the Charter of the United Nations and as being bound by it for the purposes of Article 103 (see paragraph 46 below). The United Kingdom\u2019s obligation under Resolution 1546 therefore took precedence over its obligations under the Convention. The Court of Appeal also held that, under section 11 of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995, since the applicant was detained in Iraq, the law governing his claim for damages for false imprisonment was Iraqi law (see R.

The CPA [Coalition Provisional Authority] was established by the Coalition States, notably the US, not the UN. When the Coalition States became Occupying Powers in Iraq they had no UN mandate. Thus when the case of Mr Mousa reached the House [of Lords] as one of those considered in R. (Al-Skeini and Others) v. Secretary of State for Defence) (The Redress Trust intervening) [2007] UKHL 26, [2007] 3 WLR 33 the Secretary of State accepted that the UK was liable under the European Convention for any ill-treatment Mr Mousa suffered, while unsuccessfully denying liability under the Human Rights Act 1998. It has not, to my knowledge, been suggested that the treatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib was attributable to the UN rather than the US. Following UNSCR [United Nations Security Council Resolution] 1483 in May 2003 the role of the UN was a limited one focused on humanitarian relief and reconstruction, a role strengthened but not fundamentally altered by UNSCR 1511 in October 2003. By UNSCR 1511, and again by UNSCR 1546 in June 2004, the UN gave the Multinational Force express authority to take steps to promote security and stability in Iraq, but (adopting the distinction formulated by the European Court in paragraph\u00a043 of its judgment in Behrami and Saramati) the Security Council was not delegating its power by empowering the UK to exercise its function but was authorising the UK to carry out functions it could not perform itself. At no time did the US or the UK disclaim responsibility for the conduct of their forces or the UN accept it. It cannot realistically be said that US and UK forces were under the effective command and control of the UN, or that UK forces were under such command and control when they detained the appellant.",

The Multinational Force in Iraq was not established at the behest of the UN, was not mandated to operate under UN auspices and was not a subsidiary organ of the UN. There was no delegation of UN power in Iraq. It is quite true that duties to report were imposed in Iraq as in Kosovo. But the UN\u2019s proper concern for the protection of human rights and observance of humanitarian law called for no less, and it is one thing to receive reports, another to exercise effective command and control.

The United Nations made submissions to the European Court of Human Rights in Behrami v. France, Saramati v. France, Germany and Norway ... concerning the respective roles of UNMIK [United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo] and KFOR [NATO-led Kosovo Force] in clearing mines, which was the subject of the Behrami [and Saramati] case. It did not deny that these were UN operations for which the UN might be responsible. It seems to me unlikely in the extreme that the United Nations would accept that the acts of the [Multinational Force] were in any way attributable to the UN. My noble and learned friend, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, has put his finger on the essential distinction. The UN\u2019s own role in Iraq was completely different from its role in Kosovo. Its concern in Iraq was for the protection of human rights and the observance of humanitarian law as well [as] to protect its own humanitarian operations there. It looked to others to restore the peace and security which had broken down in the aftermath of events for which those others were responsible.\u201d",

By \u2018authorising\u2019 the [Multinational Force] to take the measures required to fulfil its \u2018mandate\u2019, the Council was asserting and exercising control over the [Multinational Force] and was prescribing the mission that it was to carry out.

One example is UNSCR 820 (1993), considered by the European Court (with reference to an EC regulation giving effect to it) in Bosphorus Hava Yollar\u0131 Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v. Ireland [[GC], no.\u00a045036/98, ECHR 2005-VI] (2005) 42 EHRR 1, which decided in paragraph 24 that \u2018all States shall impound all vessels, freight vehicles, rolling stock and aircraft in their territories ...\u2019. Such provisions cause no difficulty in principle, since member States can comply with them within their own borders and are bound by Article 25 of the UN Charter to comply. But language of this kind cannot be used in relation to military or security operations overseas, since the UN and the Security Council have no standing forces at their own disposal and have concluded no agreements under Article\u00a043 of the Charter which entitle them to call on member States to provide them. Thus in practice the Security Council can do little more than give its authorisation to member States which are willing to conduct such tasks, and this is what (as I understand) it has done for some years past. Even in UNSCR 1244 (1999) relating to Kosovo, when (as I have concluded) the operations were very clearly conducted under UN auspices, the language of authorisation was used. There is, however, a strong and to my mind persuasive body of academic opinion which would treat Article 103 as applicable where conduct is authorised by the Security Council as where it is required: see, for example, Goodrich, Hambro and Simons (eds.), Charter of the United Nations: Commentary and Documents, 3rd edn. (1969), pp. 615-16; Yearbook of the International Law Commission (1979), Vol. II, Part One, paragraph 14; Sarooshi, The United Nations and the Development of Collective Security (1999), pp. 150-51.

The importance of maintaining peace and security in the world can scarcely be exaggerated, and that (as evident from the Articles of the Charter quoted above) is the mission of the UN. Its involvement in Iraq was directed to that end, following repeated determinations that the situation in Iraq continued to constitute a threat to international peace and security. As is well known, a large majority of States chose not to contribute to the Multinational Force, but those which did (including the UK) became bound by Articles 2 and 25 to carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the Charter so as to achieve its lawful objectives. It is of course true that the UK did not become specifically bound to detain the appellant in particular.

The decision of the International Court of Justice (Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention Arising from the Aerial incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v.\u00a0United Kingdom) [1992] ICJ Reports 3, paragraph 39, and Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide [1993] ICJ Reports\u00a0325, 43940, paragraphs 99-100 per Judge ad hoc Lauterpacht) give no warrant for drawing any distinction save where an obligation is jus cogens and according to Judge Bernhardt it now seems to be generally recognised in practice that binding Security Council decisions taken under Chapter VII supersede all other treaty commitments (The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary, 2nd edn., ed Simma, [2002,] pp. 1299300).\u201d",

How are these to be reconciled? There is in my opinion only one way in which they can be reconciled: by ruling that the UK may lawfully, where it is necessary for imperative reasons of security, exercise the power to detain authorised by UNSCR [United Nations Security Council Resolution] 1546 and successive resolutions, but must ensure that the detainee\u2019s rights under Article 5 are not infringed to any greater extent than is inherent in such detention.

There is no doubt that prolonged detention in the hands of the military is not permitted by the laws of the United Kingdom. Nor could it be permitted without derogation from our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 of the Convention provides that deprivation of liberty is only lawful in defined circumstances which do not include these. The drafters of the Convention had a choice between a general prohibition of \u2018arbitrary\u2019 detention, as provided in Article\u00a09 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a list of permitted grounds for detention. They deliberately chose the latter. They were well aware of Churchill\u2019s view that the internment even of enemy aliens in war time was \u2018in the highest degree odious\u2019. They would not have contemplated the indefinite detention without trial of British citizens in peacetime. I do not accept that this is less of a problem if people are suspected of very grave crimes. The graver the crime of which a person is suspected, the more difficult it will be for him to secure his release on the grounds that he is not a risk. The longer therefore he is likely to be incarcerated and the less substantial the evidence which will be relied upon to prove suspicion. These are the people most in need of the protection of the rule of law, rather than the small fry in whom the authorities will soon lose interest.\u201d",

The \u2018broad range of tasks\u2019 were listed by Secretary of State Powell as including \u2018combat operations against members of these groups [seeking to influence Iraq\u2019s political future through violence], internment where this is necessary for imperative reasons of security, and the continued search for and securing of weapons that threaten Iraq\u2019s security\u2019.

Even if the UNSC Resolution can be read in this way, it is not immediately obvious why the prolonged detention of this person in Iraq is necessary, given that any problem he presents in Iraq could be solved by repatriating him to this country and dealing with him here.

There are, regrettably, circumstances in which the threat to the necessary stability of the State is so great that in order to maintain that stability the use of internment is unavoidable. The Secretary of State\u2019s contention is that such circumstances exist now in Iraq and have existed there since the conclusion of hostilities in 2003. If the intelligence concerning the danger posed by such persons is correct, \u2013 as to which your Lordships are not in a position to make any judgment and do not do so \u2013 they pose a real danger to stability and progress in Iraq. If sufficient evidence cannot be produced in criminal proceedings \u2013 which again the House [of Lords] has not been asked to and cannot judge \u2013 such persons may have to be detained without trial. Article 42 of the Fourth Geneva Convention permits the ordering of internment of protected persons \u2018only if the security of the Detaining Power makes it absolutely necessary\u2019, and under Article 78 the Occupying Power must consider that step necessary \u2018for imperative reasons of security\u2019. Neither of these provisions applies directly to the appellant, who is not a protected person, but the degree of necessity which should exist before the Secretary of State detains persons in his position \u2013 if he has power to do so, as in my opinion he has \u2013 is substantially the same. I would only express the opinion that where a State can lawfully intern people, it is important that it adopt certain safeguards: the compilation of intelligence about such persons which is as accurate and reliable as possible, the regular review of the continuing need to detain each person and a system whereby that need and the underlying evidence can be checked and challenged by representatives on behalf of the detained persons, so far as is practicable and consistent with the needs of national security and the safety of other persons.\u201d",

In particular, I am persuaded by State practice and the clear statements of authoritative academic opinion \u2013 recognised sources of international law \u2013 that expressions in Security Council resolutions which appear on their face to confer no more than authority or power to carry out measures may take effect as imposing obligations, because of the fact that the United Nations have no standing forces at their own disposal and have concluded no agreements under Article 43 of the Charter which would entitle them to call on member States to provide them.",

Over time, the procedures in force have resulted in prolonged detention without trial, with many security internees held for several years with minimal access to the evidence against them and without their defence counsel having access to such evidence. While the current review process is based on procedures contained in the Fourth Geneva Convention, UNAMI notes that, irrespective of the legal qualification of the conflict, both in situations of international and internal armed conflict the Geneva Conventions are not of exclusive application to persons deprived of their liberty in connection with the conflict. Alongside common Article 3 to the four Geneva Conventions and customary international law, international human rights law also applies. Accordingly, detainees during an internal armed conflict must be treated in accordance with international human rights law. As such, persons who are deprived of their liberty are entitled to be informed of the reasons for their arrest; to be brought promptly before a judge if held on a criminal charge, and to challenge the lawfulness of their detention.\u201d",

The most important case is that of Article 25 that obliges member States to accept and carry out resolutions of the Security Council that have been adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter. Even if the primacy of Security Council decisions under Article 103 is not expressly spelled out in the Charter, it has been widely accepted in practice as well as in doctrine. The question has sometimes been raised whether also [Security] Council resolutions adopted ultra vires prevail by virtue of Article 103. Since obligations for member States of the United Nations can only derive out of such resolutions that are taken within the limits of its powers, decisions ultra vires do not give rise to any obligations to begin with. Hence no conflict exists. The issue is similar with regard to non-binding resolutions adopted by United Nations organs, including the Security Council. These are not covered by Article 103.",

The United Nations Security Council had been acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations when it authorised the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR). Similarly, in its resolutions authorising the Multinational Force in Iraq (Resolutions 1511 and 1546; see paragraphs 31 and 35 above), the Security Council referred expressly to Chapter VII, made the necessary identification of a threat to international peace and security and, in response to this threat, authorised a Multinational Force under unified command to take \u201call necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability of Iraq\u201d.",

The Court had further identified (ibid., \u00a7 134) five factors which established that the United Nations had retained \u201cultimate authority and control\u201d over KFOR. In the Government\u2019s submission, the five factors applied equally in respect of the United Nations Security Council\u2019s authorisation of the Multinational Force to use force in Iraq. Firstly, Chapter VII of the Charter allowed the United Nations Security Council to delegate its powers under Chapter VII to an international security presence made up of forces from willing member States. Secondly, the relevant power, conferred by Chapter VII, was a delegable power. Thirdly, the delegation to the Multinational Force was not presumed or implicit, but prior and explicit in Resolutions 1511, 1546 and subsequent resolutions. The applicant was detained several months after the adoption of Resolution 1546. Fourthly, Resolution 1546 fixed the mandate with adequate precision, setting out the tasks to be undertaken by the Multinational Force. Resolution 1546 in fact defined the tasks to be carried out by the authorised international force with greater precision than Resolution 1244. Fifthly, the Multinational Force, through the United States of America, was required to report to the Security Council on a quarterly basis. Further, the mandate for the Multinational Force was subject to review and control by the Security Council by reason of the requirement that the mandate be reviewed by the Security Council after no less than twelve months and that it expire after certain specified events. The Security Council therefore retained greater control over the Multinational Force than it did over KFOR under Resolution\u00a01244.",

In the present case, the Government submitted, the applicant\u2019s detention was effected and authorised throughout by Multinational Force personnel acting as such, including United Kingdom forces. The \u201cstructural\u201d involvement of the United Kingdom in retaining some authority over its troops, as did all troop-contributing nations, was compatible with the effectiveness of the unified command and control exercised over the Multinational Force. There was no evidence that the United Kingdom interfered with respect to the applicant\u2019s detention in such a way that the acts of the United Kingdom troops in detaining him were detached from the Security Council mandate. In the Government\u2019s view, no relevant distinction could be drawn between the operational chain of command in the Multinational Force and that which operated in the case of KFOR (see Behrami and Saramati, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0135). In the Government\u2019s submission, the continued detention of the applicant after June 2006 was required to be authorised by the co-chairs of the Joint Detention Committee, namely the Prime Minister of Iraq and the General Officer Commanding Multinational Force (a United States General), and was in fact so authorised. That authorisation was in accordance with applicable Iraqi law and the United Nations mandate conferred by Resolution 1546, which recorded that the Multinational Force was present in Iraq at the request of the government of Iraq and which expressly referred to arrangements put in place for a \u201csecurity partnership\u201d between the Iraqi government and the Multinational Force.

It would have impaired the effectiveness of the Multinational Force in its operations, which ranged from combat operations conducted together with Iraqi forces to the arrest of suspected criminals and terrorists. It would also have given rise to intractable issues as to how the Convention would apply to operations conducted jointly by forces from Contracting and non-Contracting States including, for example, questions as to what degree of involvement of personnel in joint actions would be required to engage the responsibility of the Contracting State. Moreover, in addition to United Nations peacekeeping forces (which were subsidiary organs of the United Nations) there were currently seven international military forces which had been authorised by the United Nations Security Council to contribute to the maintenance of security in foreign States, including the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. To conclude that the acts of United Kingdom troops deployed as part of the Multinational Force in Iraq were attributable to the United Kingdom would introduce real uncertainty about the operation of the Convention to United Nations mandated operations and would risk in future deterring Contracting Parties from contributing troops to forces authorised by the United Nations Security Council, to the detriment of its mission to secure international peace and security.",

The applicant underlined that, until the proceedings before the House of Lords, the Government had never argued in any case that the detention of individuals held in the custody of United Kingdom forces in Iraq was attributable to any entity other than the United Kingdom. The Court should therefore treat with some scepticism the Government\u2019s argument that attributing the detention to the United Kingdom would \u201cintroduce serious operational difficulties\u201d. In any event, the problems adverted to by the Government were far from intractable.

The respective roles and responsibilities of the Coalition Forces and the United Nations in Iraq were defined as early as 8\u00a0May 2003, in a letter from the Permanent Representatives of the United States of America and the United Kingdom to the President of the Security Council (see paragraph 27 above). The Coalition Forces would work through the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), which they had created, to provide for security in Iraq. The role of the United Nations was recognised as being vital in \u201cproviding humanitarian relief, in supporting the reconstruction of Iraq, and in helping in the formation of an Iraqi interim authority\u201d. Those respective roles and responsibilities were repeated in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 (see paragraph 29 above).

Paragraph 1 of Resolution 1511 recognised that the CPA, and not the United Nations, would continue to exercise authority and control until a representative government could be established. Paragraph 8 resolved that the United Nations would strengthen its vital role, by reference to the tasks outlined in Resolution 1483, namely humanitarian relief, reconstruction, and working towards the establishment of a representative government. Had the United Nations intended fundamentally to alter the legal position by assuming ultimate control and authority for the Coalition Forces in Iraq it was, in the applicant\u2019s view, inconceivable that it would not have referred to this when expressly addressing the need to strengthen its role in Iraq. At paragraph 13 of Resolution 1511, where the United Nations Security Council authorised a Multinational Force under unified command to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of peace and security, this was a simple authorisation and not a delegation. There was no seizing of effective, or even ultimate, control and authority by the United Nations Security Council. The unified command over the Multinational Force was, as it had always been, under the control and authority of the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Similarly, Resolution 1546 drew a clear distinction between the respective roles of the United Nations and the Multinational Force. Moreover, the wording of the letter from the US Secretary of State to the President of the United Nations Security Council, annexed to Resolution\u00a01546, entirely undermined any suggestion that the Multinational Force was, or was soon to be, under United Nations authority and control.",

At the time of the invasion, there was no United Nations Security Council resolution providing for the allocation of roles in Iraq in the event that the existing regime was displaced. Major combat operations were declared to be complete by 1 May 2003 and the United States of America and the United Kingdom became Occupying Powers within the meaning of Article 42 of the Hague Regulations (see paragraph 42 above). As explained in the letter dated 8\u00a0May 2003 sent jointly by the Permanent Representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States of America to the President of the United Nations Security Council (see paragraph 27 above), the United States of America and the United Kingdom, having displaced the previous regime, created the CPA \u201cto exercise powers of government temporarily\u201d. One of the powers of government specifically referred to in the letter of 8 May 2003 to be exercised by the United States of America and the United Kingdom through the CPA was the provision of security in Iraq. The letter further stated that \u201c[t]he United States, the United Kingdom and Coalition partners, working through the Coalition Provisional Authority, shall, inter alia, provide for security in and for the provisional administration of Iraq, including by ... assuming immediate control of Iraqi institutions responsible for military and security matters\u201d. The letter acknowledged that the United Nations had \u201ca vital role to play in providing humanitarian relief, in supporting the reconstruction of Iraq, and in helping in the formation of an Iraqi interim authority\u201d and stated that the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Coalition partners were ready to work closely with representatives of the United Nations and its specialised agencies and would also welcome the support and contributions of member States, international and regional organisations, and other entities, \u201cunder appropriate coordination arrangements with the Coalition Provisional Authority\u201d. In its first legislative act, CPA Regulation No. 1 of 16 May 2003, the CPA declared that it would \u201cexercise powers of government temporarily in order to provide for the effective administration of Iraq during the period of transitional administration, to restore conditions of security and stability\u201d (see paragraph 28 above).",

The Security Council noted further that other States that were not Occupying Powers were working or might in the future work under the CPA, and welcomed the willingness of member States to contribute to stability and security in Iraq by contributing personnel, equipment and other resources \u201cunder the Authority\u201d.

The United Kingdom and the United States of America were encouraged \u201cto inform the Council at regular intervals of their efforts under this Resolution\u201d.

The comparison is relevant, since in its decision in Behrami and Saramati (cited above) the Court concluded, inter alia, that Mr Saramati\u2019s detention was attributable to the United Nations and not to any of the respondent States. It is to be recalled that the international security presence in Kosovo was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution\u00a01244, adopted on 10 June 1999, in which, \u201cdetermined to resolve the grave humanitarian situation in Kosovo\u201d, the Security Council \u201cdecide[d] on the deployment in Kosovo, under United Nations auspices, of international civil and security presences\u201d. The Security Council therefore authorised \u201cmember States and relevant international organisations to establish the international security presence in Kosovo\u201d and directed that there should be \u201csubstantial North Atlantic Treaty Organization participation\u201d in the Force, which \u201cmust be deployed under unified command and control\u201d. In addition, Resolution 1244 authorised the Secretary-General of the United Nations to establish an international civil presence in Kosovo in order to provide an interim administration for Kosovo. The United Nations, through a Special Representative appointed by the Secretary-General in consultation with the Security Council, was to control the implementation of the international civil presence and coordinate closely with the international security presence (see Behrami and Saramati, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4 and 41).

They emphasised that between 22 May 2003 and 28\u00a0June 2004, British forces operated in Iraq under a legal regime derived from the law of belligerent occupation, as modified by the United Nations Security Council in Resolutions 1483 and 1511 (see paragraphs 29 and 31 above). Thus, the Preamble to Resolution 1483 in terms recognised the \u201cspecific authorities, responsibilities and obligations\u201d of the Occupying Powers, including those under the Geneva Conventions of 1949. In the Government\u2019s submission, customary international law, as reflected in Article\u00a043 of the Hague Regulations (see paragraph 42 above), required the Occupying Power to \u201ctake all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety\u201d in the occupied territory. In its judgment in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) v. Uganda, the International Court of Justice described this as including a duty \u201cto protect the inhabitants of the occupied territory against acts of violence, and not to tolerate such violence by any third party\u201d (see paragraph 50 above). In addition, Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention placed a responsibility on the Occupying Power to take steps to protect the civilian population \u201cagainst all acts of violence or threats thereof\u201d and Article 64 referred to a general obligation to ensure the \u201corderly government\u201d of the occupied territory (see paragraph 43 above). The Occupying Power could also protect its forces and administration from acts of violence. It had broad powers of compulsion and restraint over the population of the occupied territory. Article 78 of the Fourth Geneva Convention recognised the power to detain where \u201cthe Occupying Power considers it necessary, for imperative reasons of security, to take safety measures concerning protected persons\u201d. In the Government\u2019s submission, the \u201cspecific authorities, responsibilities and obligations\u201d of an Occupying Power, as recognised in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483, included the power to detain persons in an occupied territory on security grounds. This power was derived from the duty of governance imposed upon an Occupying Power by customary international law. It was also derived from the domestic law of the occupied territory as modified by the Occupying Power (as, for example, in CPA Memorandum No. 3 (Revised): see paragraph 36 above).",

Resolution 1546 reaffirmed the mandate of the Multinational Force, having regard to the request from the Prime Minister of the Iraqi interim government for the Multinational Force to remain in Iraq after the end of the occupation (see paragraph 35 above). Paragraph 10 of Resolution 1546 specifically provided the Multinational Force with \u201cauthority to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq in accordance with the letters annexed to this Resolution\u201d. It was clear from the text of Resolution\u00a01546 that the annexed letters were integral to it and defined the scope of the powers conferred by the Security Council. The letter from US Secretary of State Colin Powell expressly referred to internment as one of the tasks which the Multinational Force was to continue to perform. In the Government\u2019s view, therefore, Resolution 1546 could not have been clearer in terms of authorising the Multinational Force to use preventive detention where \u201cnecessary for imperative reasons of security in Iraq\u201d. It was also clear from Resolution\u00a01546 and the letters annexed thereto that what was authorised by the Security Council was a regime of detention modelled on the \u201cspecific authorities, responsibilities and obligations\u201d that had existed during the period of occupation. This was also the view taken by Lord Bingham in the House of Lords when he considered the Resolution (see paragraph 20 above). By participating in the Multinational Force and thus taking up the authorisation conferred by the Security Council, the United Kingdom agreed to assist in the achievement of the specific objectives to maintain security and stability in Iraq set out in Resolution 1546. As Lord Bingham put it, the United Kingdom was \u201cbound to exercise its power of detention where this was necessary for imperative reasons of security\u201d. The facts of the applicant\u2019s case, and in particular the findings of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission with regard to the applicant\u2019s involvement in attacks against Coalition Forces (see paragraph 15 above), demonstrated the importance of such an obligation.",

The effect of Article\u00a0103 of the Charter was that the obligation under Article 25 had to prevail over obligations under other international treaties (see paragraph 46 above). This was confirmed by the decision of the International Court of Justice in the Lockerbie case (see paragraph 48 above). As Lord Bingham pointed out, it was also confirmed by leading commentators such as Judges Simma, Bernhardt and Higgins (see paragraph 35 of the House of Lords judgment, at paragraph 20 above). As a matter of principle, the primacy accorded by Article 103 of the Charter was unsurprising: one of the core objectives of the United Nations was to maintain and restore international peace and security and Article 103 was central to the Security Council\u2019s ability to give practical effect to the measures it had decided upon.",

It also applied to the decisions of the Security Council authorising action. The practice of the Security Council, at least since the early 1990s, had been to seek to achieve its aims, and to discharge its responsibility, in respect of the maintenance of international peace and security by authorising military action by States and organisations such as NATO. As the Court had mentioned in its decision in Behrami and Saramati (cited above, \u00a7 132), no agreements had ever been made under Article 43 of the Charter of the United Nations by member States undertaking to make troops available to the United Nations. In the absence of any such agreement, no State could be required to take military action. Unless the Security Council could proceed by authorisation, it would be unable to take military measures at all, thus frustrating an important part of the Chapter\u00a0VII machinery. However, if a resolution authorising military action did not engage Article 103 of the Charter, the result would be that any State acting under that authorisation would breach any conflicting treaty obligations, which would fatally undermine the whole system of the Charter for the protection of international peace and security. It was plain that this was not the way that States had regarded the legal position under any of the numerous resolutions issued by the Security Council authorising military action. It had also been the view of the most authoritative commentators; as Lord Bingham observed at paragraph 33 of the House of Lords judgment, there is \u201ca strong and to my mind persuasive body of academic opinion which would treat Article\u00a0103 as applicable where conduct is authorised by the Security Council as where it is required\u201d.",

The Convention was a part of international law and derived its normative force from international law. It was concluded only five years after the Charter of the United Nations and if there had been any intention to seek to disapply Article 103 to the provisions of the Convention, this would have been clearly stated. Moreover, the Court had never suggested in its case-law that it considered that Article 103 did not apply to displace obligations under the Convention which were incompatible with an obligation under a United Nations Security Council resolution. On the contrary, in Behrami and Saramati (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0147 and 149), the Grand Chamber explicitly recognised that the Convention should not be applied in such a way as to undermine or conflict with actions taken under Chapter VII by the Security Council.",

As the International Court of Justice stated in the Namibia case, \u201cthe language of a resolution of the Security Council should be carefully analysed before a conclusion can be made as to its binding effect\u201d (see paragraph 49 above). Where appropriate, the Security Council could require States to take specific action. It did so in the resolutions under consideration in the Kadi and Bosphorus cases (cited above), where States were required, \u201cwith no autonomous discretion\u201d, respectively to freeze the assets of designated persons or to impound aircraft operating from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In contrast, the language of Resolution 1546 and the letters annexed thereto made it clear that the Security Council was asked to provide, and did provide, an authorisation to the Multinational Force to take the measures that it considered necessary to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq. It did not require a State to take action incompatible with its human rights obligations, but instead left a discretion to the State as to whether, when and how to contribute to the maintenance of security. Respect for human rights was one of the paramount principles of the Charter of the United Nations and if the Security Council had intended to impose an obligation on British forces to act in breach of the United Kingdom\u2019s international human rights obligations, it would have used clear and unequivocal language. It followed that the rule of priority under Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations did not come into effect.",

This review concerned the internal lawfulness of such measures under Community law and not the lawfulness of the United Nations Security Council resolutions to which they were intended to give effect. The same principles applied in the present case since, in the applicant\u2019s submission, member States acting under United Nations Security Council Resolution\u00a01546 had a \u201cfree choice\u201d as to the \u201cprocedure applicable\u201d, which meant that the procedure had to be lawful. The essence of the judgment in Kadi was that obligations arising from United Nations Security Council resolutions do not displace the requirements of human rights as guaranteed in Community law. It was true that the European Court of Justice examined the validity of a Community regulation and did not examine directly any member State action implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions.

It would introduce a general, blanket derogation from all Convention rights. Article 15 permitted a State to derogate from certain Convention rights, including Article 5, but only in times of war or public emergency and under strict conditions, subject to the Court\u2019s review. Moreover, it would be clearly incompatible with the principle of effectiveness to exclude a priori the application of the Convention in relation to all action undertaken by a Contracting Party pursuant to a United Nations Security Council resolution. If it were accepted that international law obligations displaced substantive provisions of the Convention, the scope of application of the Convention would be substantially reduced and protection would be denied in some cases where it was most needed.

As well as the purpose of maintaining international peace and security, set out in the first sub-paragraph of Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations, the third sub-paragraph provides that the United Nations was established to \u201cachieve international cooperation in ... promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms\u201d.

Against this background, the Court considers that, in interpreting its resolutions, there must be a presumption that the Security Council does not intend to impose any obligation on member States to breach fundamental principles of human rights.

The Government have argued that the effect of the authorisations in paragraphs 9 and 10 of Resolution 1546 was that the Multinational Force continued to exercise the \u201cspecific authorities, responsibilities and obligations\u201d that had vested in the United States of America and the United Kingdom as Occupying Powers under international humanitarian law and that these \u201cobligations\u201d included the obligation to use internment where necessary to protect the inhabitants of the occupied territory against acts of violence. Some support for this submission can be derived from the findings of the domestic courts (see, for example, Lord Bingham at paragraph 32 of the House of Lords judgment; see paragraph 20 above). The Court notes in this respect that paragraph 2 of Resolution 1546 clearly stated that the occupation was to end by 30 June 2004. However, even assuming that the effect of Resolution 1546 was to maintain, after the transfer of authority from the CPA to the interim government of Iraq, the position under international humanitarian law which had previously applied, the Court does not find it established that international humanitarian law places an obligation on an Occupying Power to use indefinite internment without trial. Article 43 of the Hague Regulations requires an Occupying Power to take \u201call the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country\u201d (see paragraph 42 above). While the International Court of Justice in its judgment Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) v. Uganda) interpreted this obligation to include the duty to protect the inhabitants of the occupied territory from violence, including violence by third parties, it did not rule that this placed an obligation on the Occupying Power to use internment; indeed, it also found that Uganda, as an Occupying Power, was under a duty to secure respect for the applicable rules of international human rights law, including the provisions of the International Covenant for the Protection of Civil and Political Rights, to which it was a signatory (see paragraph 50 above). In the Court\u2019s view, it would appear from the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention that under international humanitarian law internment is to be viewed not as an obligation on the Occupying Power but as a measure of last resort (see paragraph 43 above).",

However, such an agreement could not override the binding obligations under the Convention. In this respect, the Court recalls its case-law to the effect that a Contracting State is considered to retain Convention liability in respect of treaty commitments and other agreements between States subsequent to the entry into force of the Convention (see, for example, Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012628).",

Its non-pecuniary awards serve to give recognition to the fact that moral damage occurred as a result of a breach of a fundamental human right and reflect in the broadest of terms the severity of the damage (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, \u00a7 224, ECHR 2009, and the cases cited therein). In the present case, the Court has regard to the factors raised by the Government. Nonetheless, it considers that, in view of the very long period of time during which the applicant was detained, monetary compensation should be awarded, in the sum of EUR\u00a025,000.",

The Security Council can, therefore, only authorise States to use military force. As Lord Bingham also concluded, the primacy clause in Article 103 of the Charter must also apply where a member State chooses to take up such an authorisation and contribute to an international peacekeeping operation under a Security Council mandate. To conclude otherwise would seriously undermine the effectiveness of the United Nations\u2019 role in securing world peace and would also run contrary to State practice.

I consider that it is unrealistic to expect the Security Council to spell out in advance, in detail, every measure which a military force might be required to use to contribute to peace and security under its mandate. Internment is a frequently used measure in conflict situations, well established under international humanitarian law, and was, moreover, expressly referred to in the letter of Colin Powell annexed to Resolution 1546. I consider that it is clear from the text of the Resolution, and from the context where the Multinational Force was already present and using internment in Iraq, that member States were authorised to continue interning individuals where necessary.",
