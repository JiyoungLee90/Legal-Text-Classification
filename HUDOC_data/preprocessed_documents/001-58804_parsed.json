They further point out, inter alia, that the applicant\u2019s uncertainty and anxiety were expressly taken into account by the Court of Appeal and served to reduce the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed; that the fact that he had already completed his community service was similarly taken into account, and that as the Court of Appeal later found the sentence to be obviously wrong, the applicant must have known that there was a real possibility of an increased sentence from the lodging of the reference at the latest.",

However, by the time the first instance proceedings had ended, the issues in the case had been aired at trial, and the transcripts were ready.
