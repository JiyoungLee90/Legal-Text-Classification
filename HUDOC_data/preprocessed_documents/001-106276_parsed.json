What is, however, clear to the Court is that the applicant\u2019s lawyer had not been allowed to examine the investigation file at that point (see paragraph 8 above), which would seriously hamper her ability to provide any sort of meaningful legal advice to the applicant. The Court further notes that it is undisputed between the Parties that the applicant had no legal assistance at the time of making his police statement or during the interrogation before the public prosecutor. In this connection, the Court recalls that in its Salduz judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 54-55), it underlined the importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of the criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the trial. In order for the right to a fair hearing to remain sufficiently \u201cpractical and effective\u201d, Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires, as a rule, access to a lawyer as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the specific circumstances of the particular case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Having regard to the foregoing, and bearing in mind that at the time of the applicant\u2019s detention in police custody the restriction imposed concerning access to a lawyer was systemic, pursuant to section 31 of Law no. 3842, and applied to anyone held in police custody in connection with an offence falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts, the Court concludes that although the applicant met his lawyer during police custody for a brief period, this meeting cannot be considered to have been sufficient by Convention standards (see for similar cases, Fatma Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey (no. 2), no.\u00a018532/05, \u00a7 14, 13 October 2009; H\u00fcseyin Habip Ta\u015fk\u0131n v. , no. 5289/06, \u00a7 21, 1 February 2011).",
