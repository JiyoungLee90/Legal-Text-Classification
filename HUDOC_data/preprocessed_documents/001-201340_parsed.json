In this context, the Court observes at the outset that the crime of incitement to suicide is subject to public prosecution and that a complaint lodged by the victim is therefore not a prerequisite to instituting criminal proceedings into this criminal offence (see paragraph 50 above). This is also confirmed in the present case by the fact that the investigating authorities had opened a criminal investigation in connection with T.M.\u2019s attempt to commit suicide following the incident and before he lodged a formal complaint implicating the applicant (see paragraph 17 above).

Nor is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or taken before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or dispelling the suspicions which provide the grounds for the detention. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see Ilgar\u00a0Mammadov,\u00a0cited above, \u00a7 87).",

However, the situation in the present case is different.

In this context, the Court finds striking similarities between the present case and the cases of Rasul Jafarov and Mammadli (both cited above) where the applicants, well-known NGO activists, were charged with exactly the same criminal offences, but in relation to their NGO activities, while the charges against the applicant in the present case mainly related to her activities as head of the Baku bureau of Azadliq Radio.

In the present case, the offences with which the applicant was charged stemmed from the fact that she allegedly continued the broadcasting services of Azadliq Radio without the required State licence and exercised journalistic activities without having the necessary accreditation from the relevant authorities. In the prosecuting authorities\u2019 view, such failures resulted in the applicant being involved in a de facto commercial activity for which she had failed to pay profit tax. The Court, for its part, finds that the manner the prosecuting authorities construed the relevant facts was not sustainable for the following reasons. Firstly, the prosecution did not demonstrate why the applicant, as an employee of RFE/RL or as the head of its Baku bureau, had to bear individual criminal responsibility for the alleged failure of RFE/RL to carry out its broadcasting services without the required licence. Secondly, the Court notes that the Government failed to refer to any provisions of domestic law which criminalised the alleged irregularities in question, namely, the lack of a radio broadcasting licence and lack of accreditation of a foreign journalist. For example, the Court observes that a breach of licensing rules in the field of television and radio broadcasting was punishable by an administrative fine (see paragraph 51 above). Lastly and most importantly, the Court notes that domestic law provided clear definitions of commercial and noncommercial activities, with the differentiating factor being whether or not the purpose of the activities was to generate profit. Non-commercial activity was not subject to profit tax or value-added tax (see Rasul Jafarov, cited above, \u00a7 126). As in the case of non-registered grants (ibid., 128), it has not been demonstrated by the Government that the mere lack of a broadcasting licence or accreditation could automatically transform an activity of a non-commercial organisation into a commercial one. Apart from the above-mentioned alleged administrative irregularities, the assumption that the applicant\u2019s activities were aimed at generating profit was not supported by any other information. In such circumstances, the Court finds that the applicant could not have been reasonably suspected of having committed the criminal offence of \u201cillegal entrepreneurship\u201d, because there were no facts, information or evidence showing that she had engaged in commercial activity or the offence of \u201ctax evasion\u201d, as in the absence of such commercial activity there could be no taxable profit (ibid., \u00a7 130).",

Firstly, the Court notes that there was no evidence showing that those allegedly illegal contracts were signed by the applicant. The Government argued that this allegation was supported by the fact that she had been responsible for recruiting and managing staff in accordance with her employment contract. However, the applicant submitted a copy of a service contract between RFE/RL and a freelance journalist concluded at the time she was head of the Baku bureau. This contract was not signed by the applicant herself, but rather by an official representative of RFE/RL in Azerbaijan, who had actually also signed one of the employment contracts concluded with the applicant (see paragraph 9 above). The authenticity of this document was not disputed by the Government. Accordingly, the Court finds that the above information alone, as relied on by the Government, is not sufficient to reasonably suspect that the applicant illegally recruited staff to work at the Baku bureau of Azadliq Radio and therefore was engaged in embezzlement or abuse of power.",

Specifically, the title of the impugned statement in the present case indicated that the applicant\u2019s \u201cillegal acts had been unmasked\u201d, which amounted to a clear declaration of her guilt (see paragraph 47 above). Furthermore, it was noted in the text that \u201cthe investigation ha[d] established that T.M. attempted to commit suicide as a result of threats and pressure used by the applicant\u201d. The Court would stress in this regard that a fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question (see Farhad Aliyev, \u00a7\u00a0218).",

However, this duty to inform the public cannot justify all possible choices of words, but has to be carried out with a view to respecting the right of the suspects to be presumed innocent (see Pe\u0161a v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 40523/08, \u00a7 142, 8 April 2010). As regards the fact that the statement ended by referring to the existence of a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to charge the applicant, as highlighted by the Government, the Court notes that this wording was negated by the title of the statement and the remark mentioned above, which represented as an established fact, without any qualification or reservation, the applicant\u2019s involvement in the commission of that crime (see, mutatis mutandis, Ilgar Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 127). Moreover, the reference to the existence of a suspicion against the applicant was placed at the end of the statement, that is, when the reader may have already formed the view that the applicant had committed a crime. Thus, the overall manner in which the statement was presented left no doubt for the external reader that the applicant had committed the crime with which she was charged. Accordingly, the Court finds that the statement must have led the public to believe that the applicant was guilty before she had been proved guilty according to law.",
