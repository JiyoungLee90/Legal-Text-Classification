Since the applicant attempts to bend down, three police officers hold his hands behind his back while another one holds his head up. Subsequently, another police officer joins the other four. Another police officer approaches the applicant and checks the pockets of his trousers. The applicant is splashed with beer and water, apparently in an attempt to calm him down, and one of the police officers restraining him comments that he is attempting to bend down.

After approximately twenty seconds the same person kicks the applicant twice in the posterior. Another police officer approaches the applicant and does something to him; however, only his back can be seen. Later the applicant, who continues to struggle, is splashed with beer and water, apparently in an attempt to calm him down. One of the police officers restraining him comments that he is attempting to bend down. After being forcibly seated on a chair, the applicant calms down and a police officer examines his hands with a special lamp to detect the presence of a special dust with which the bribe money has apparently been treated. Subsequently, his pockets are examined and USD 4,000 is extracted from the pocket of his shirt. The money appears to have been marked with a special dust and every banknote bears the inscription \u201cBribe Savitchi 2000\u201d. The applicant claims that the money is not his and that he has no idea how it got into his pocket. He argues that in that pocket he had documents and a pen which mysteriously appeared on the table.",

France [GC], no. 47287/99, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2004I). A corollary of this obligation of the courts is their duty to give reasons in their judgments (see, among other authorities, Hirvisaari v.

The bribers testified that the applicant had requested a bribe and a video of the applicant\u2019s arrest clearly showed him dipping his fingers in a mug of beer, apparently attempting to wash away traces of the powder used to mark the banknotes handed over to him; the video also showed the applicant trying to bend down, apparently in an attempt to expel something from the pocket of his shirt. This turned out to be the USD 4,000 which had been powder-marked. It appears clearly from the first video (see paragraph 7 above) that the man who obscured the image of the applicant during his arrest (see paragraph 8 above), only checked the pockets of the applicant\u2019s trousers and did not do anything to the pocket of his shirt. In the presence of such evidence, it is difficult to imagine that even if all the issues raised by the applicant had been addressed and accepted by the courts, their conclusion would have been different.
