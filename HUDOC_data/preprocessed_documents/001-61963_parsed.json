No investigation was opened into the allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the security forces. It was only after the present application had been communicated to the respondent Government that an investigation was initiated into the failure of two officers to ensure that an autopsy was carried out (see paragraphs\u00a035 and\u00a038 above).",

More specifically, it said that the information provided by the applicant \u201cdid not lead the authorities to broaden the scope of their investigation so as to investigate the possible involvement of members of the security forces in the killing\u201d and \u201c[n]o investigation was opened into the allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the security forces\u201d (ibid., paragraph\u00a081). It also noted: \u201c... neither a post-mortem nor a ballistics examination was carried out by the public prosecutor\u201d, while at the same time recognising that, \u201c... had a proper post-mortem examination (which is also required by Article 79 of the Turkish Code on Criminal Procedure) been carried out it could have provided valuable information...\u201d and that the same applied to a ballistics examination (ibid., paragraph 83). In these circumstances, finding that \u201cthe domestic authorities did not conduct a prompt and adequate investigation\u201d and \u201cdisregarded their essential responsibilities in this respect\u201d (ibid., paragraph 85), the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention owing to the inadequacy of the investigation.",

Procedural review must continue to complement substantive review, and not become a substitute for it. Otherwise, there is a danger that, in order to avoid being found to be in breach of a substantive obligation, domestic authorities will simply neglect to hold an investigation, preferring the less serious \u2013 in their view \u2013 finding of a procedural violation.",
