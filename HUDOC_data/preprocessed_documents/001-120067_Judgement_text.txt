The case originated in 90 applications against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Ukrainian nationals, one Russian national (application no. 56464/07) and companies based in Ukraine. Their details are specified in the appended tables (“the applicants”).
In applications nos. 35771/07, 28061/08, 28071/08, 46953/08, 25260/09, 26397/09, 20032/10, 22620/10, 25288/10 the applicants died in course of the proceedings before the Court. Their next-of-kin expressed a wish to pursue the applications.
Mr Andriy Salnikov (application no. 28061/08) and Ms Diana Salnikova (application no. 28071/08) are brother and sister. They are both heirs of their deceased father and challenge the lengthy non-enforcement of the same judgment adopted in favour of their father.
The Government are represented by their Agent, Mr Nazar Kulchytskyy.
The applications listed in Appendices 1 and 2 were communicated to the Government on various dates in 2003-2011.
The Russian Government, having been informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings in respect of the applicant in application no. 56464/07 (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 of the Rules of Court), indicated that they did not wish to exercise that right.
On the dates set out in the appended tables domestic courts and labour disputes commissions delivered decisions according to which the applicants were entitled to various pecuniary amounts or to have certain actions taken in their favour. The decisions became enforceable. However, the applicants were unable to obtain the enforcement of the decisions in due time.
Some of the applicants also made submissions concerning factual and legal matters unrelated to the above non-enforcement issues.
