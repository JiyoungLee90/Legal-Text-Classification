In determining whether a necessity within the meaning of Article\u00a011 \u00a7 2 exists, the Contracting States have only a limited margin of appreciation, which goes hand in hand with rigorous European supervision (see Socialist Party and Others v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, \u00a7 50, Reports 1998III). While freedom of expression is important for everybody, it is especially so for an elected representative of the people. He represents his electorate, draws attention to their preoccupations and defends their interests. Accordingly, interferences with the freedom of expression of an opposition member of parliament call for the closest scrutiny on the part of the Court (see Castells v. , 23 April 1992, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 236).",

It follows from that finding that a genuine and effective respect for freedom of association and assembly cannot be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere; a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the purpose of Article 11 nor with that of the Convention in general. There may thus be positive obligations to secure the effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of association and assembly (see Wilson, National Union of Journalists and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 30668/96, 30671/96 and 30678/96, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2002-V) even in the sphere of relations between individuals (see Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d, cited above, \u00a7 32). Accordingly, it is incumbent upon public authorities to guarantee the proper functioning of a political party, even when it shocks or gives offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote. Their members must be able to hold meetings without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents. Such a fear would be liable to deter other associations or political parties from openly expressing their opinions on highly controversial issues affecting the community.",

The interference concerned a demonstration in which the applicant party intended to protest against alleged anti-democratic abuses committed by the Government and against the Russian military presence in the break-away Transdniestrian region of Moldova. Given the public interest in free expression in respect of such topics and the fact that the applicant party was an opposition parliamentary political party, the Court considers that the State\u2019s margin of appreciation was correspondingly narrow and that only very compelling reasons would have justified the interference with the CDPP\u2019s right to freedom of expression and assembly.",

The Court recalls that even such forms of protest as active physical obstruction of hunting were held to be an expression of an opinion (see Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, \u00a7 92, Reports 1998VII; Hashman and Harrup v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a025594/94, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999VIII). In the present case also the Court finds that the applicant party\u2019s slogans, even if accompanied by the burning of flags and pictures, was a form of expressing an opinion in respect of an issue of major public interest, namely the presence of Russian troops on the territory of Moldova. The Court recalls in this context that the freedom of expression refers not only to \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cideas\u201d that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb (see Jersild v.\u00a0Denmark, 23 September 1994, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 298).
