Therefore the applicant could not have been guilty of receiving the assets that Mr A. had acquired through debtor\u2019s fraud, as indicated in the charges. There were no other charges against him.

Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances.
