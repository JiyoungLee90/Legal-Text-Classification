According to that letter, at the time the applicant was being detained in prison no. 13 in cells corresponding to the legal requirements and which were well lit and ventilated, with sufficient heating and access to tap water and a toilet separated from the rest of the cell. The applicant had been given medical assistance; the list of various medical check-ups and interventions spanned more than five pages. Special attention was given by the prison doctors to verifying whether the applicant\u2019s tuberculosis had reoccurred. To that end, tests specifically aimed at discovering the presence of active tuberculosis, including X-ray examinations, had been carried out upon his arrival at prison no. 13 on 7\u00a0September 2006 and every day between 26 and 29\u00a0October 2006, then on 30\u00a0November and 1 December 2006, 26\u00a0February 2007 and on a regular basis thereafter. On none of these occasions had there been a confirmation of the diagnosis of active tuberculosis. The tests showed only the presence of the remaining traces of the tuberculosis from which the applicant had suffered in 2001 in . For that reason the applicant was not registered in the national Information System for the Monitoring of Tuberculosis. The letter contained annexes with medical certificates confirming the description detailed above. The applicant did not submit evidence contradicting the above.",

It notes that in the present case, aside from the complaint about medical treatment, there were no common characteristics in the description given by the applicant regarding the conditions of his detention in various detention facilities, the applicant having failed to give any detail in respect of all such facilities other than the Ungheni police station. It finds that the applicant\u2019s failure to describe the conditions of his detention after his transfer from the Ungheni police station prevents the Court from examining the entire period of his detention as a \u201ccontinuous situation\u201d (see I.D. v.\u00a0Moldova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a030). Therefore, his detention at the Ungheni police station, which ended on 5 April 2007 at the latest (see paragraph 22 above), is to be considered as separate from his subsequent detention at various other facilities. The applicant lodged his complaint on 10 June 2009 and there is nothing to suggest that he was in any way prevented by the authorities from complaining before that date. Consequently, in so far as it refers to the period of detention at the Ungheni police station ending on 5\u00a0April 2007, the applicant\u2019s complaint has been lodged more than six months after the alleged breach took place and must be declared inadmissible under Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",
