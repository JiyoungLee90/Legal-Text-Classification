However, a Ministry assessment board decided that the applicant\u2019s situation was such that he could not be appointed to a post abroad. Having regard to the evidence on file and, in particular, the decisions of the administrative courts, the Court observes that the refusal to appoint the applicant was based on the findings of a security enquiry which had disclosed information on the applicant\u2019s private life, such as his lifestyle and his wife\u2019s mode of attire.

Moreover, the Attorney General with the Council of State twice criticised this failure to give reasons (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above). The Court further notes that the administrative authorities also failed to explain how the information obtained by means of the security enquiry was such as to debar per se the applicant from discharging his duties abroad.",

Of course, the Court does not rule out the possibility that under certain circumstances specific civil-service requirements necessitate taking into account the findings of security enquiries. Nevertheless, it is difficult to understand how, in the present case, the applicant\u2019s mode of conduct at home and the fact of his wife wearing a headscarf (see paragraph 7 above) \u2013 which matters fall within the ambit of private life \u2013 could possibly interfere with public-interest requirements or the needs of the educational services. It further notes that the applicant\u2019s previous arrest had not led to any criminal prosecution, nor had it impeded his access to the teaching profession.",
