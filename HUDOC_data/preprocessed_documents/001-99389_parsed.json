Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.

Moreover, the applicant complained under Article 4 of Protocol No.\u00a07 that the criminal proceedings conducted against him included a retrial, which in his view had been unjustified in the circumstances. In this connection, the Court observes that the criminal proceedings ended in 2002, i.e. more than six months before the date of introduction.
