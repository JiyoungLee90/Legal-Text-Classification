The affected water areas were owned by the respective fishing co-operatives or associations for joint ownership which appear as co-applicants before the Court. The Government had misrepresented domestic law in so far as it purported to afford to the State a general right to fish salmon. On the contrary, this fishing right had always belonged to the owner or other lawful beneficiary of a water area, just like the right to fish any other species. It was true that pursuant to section 6, subsection 3, and section 12, of the Fishing Act the State enjoyed a right to fish salmon in certain designated areas such as the Simo river, as confirmed by the Supreme Court in its decision of 3 February 1983 (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d). Those areas \u2013 which were normally leased out to fishermen \u2013 were not in issue in the applicants' case.

On the Finnish side of the Tornio River area and most other rivers and some sea areas, the salmon and sea trout as well as the right to fish them belonged to the State on the basis of a restricted right in rem (regaalioikeus, regale). This right was independent of the ownership of water areas and belonged to the State on the basis of public law. The restricted right in rem had been introduced into Finnish legislation and case-law already in the 1540s. Taxes were levied by the State on all salmon caught and over the centuries this transformed into a right to collect rent on fishing areas. The State's right to fish remained in force where it continuously used its rights, notably and publicly. This requirement was satisfied where it leased out its right or issued temporary fishing permits for payment. There was accordingly a prohibition on the fishing of salmon or sea trout without a specific permission by the State to do so. Landowners of river areas could not sell or lease fishing rights for those fish.",

Nor was a complete prohibition required by the Frontier Rivers Agreement. The restrictions imposed on the Swedish side and particularly in the Kalix river, while not as lengthy and far-reaching as those imposed on the applicants' waters, had successfully ensured the fish stocks without placing an excessive burden on the holders of the fishing. The restrictions on the fishing of salmon and trout were likewise excessive with a view to safeguarding the stocks.

The applicants' water areas were the only ones in the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia to be governed by a system of complete prohibition of salmon fishing as opposed to a quota system.

The waters were covered by ice during seven other months of the year, when fishing was difficult. Accordingly, even though the restrictions lasted only a few months, their impact was severe in that most of the applicants' potential catches would otherwise occur during that period. By contrast, the owners of the waters adjacent to those owned by the applicants were allowed to fish other species than salmon throughout the year and thus able to fish most of their potential catches.",

They were especially necessary for the protection of salmon and sea trout in the conditions at hand. In order to implement such protection, the legislature must have a wide margin of appreciation in determining whether the problem warranted measures of control and in choosing how to implement such measures. The decision of the Frontier Rivers Commission sought to safeguard the future stocks of salmon and sea trout. In the Government's view the aforesaid aim of the interference undoubtedly served the general interest, even if the fishing restrictions targeted private fishermen. Nor was the interference based on manifestly unreasonable grounds. The protection of salmon and sea trout in the sea and in the Tornio river fishing area and the restriction of the use of harmful fishing equipment was necessary in order to ensure the existence of natural stocks of salmon and sea trout. Due to the strict control of the fishing of salmon, the number of fish moving up the Tornio river has significantly increased in the past few years. The fact that the restrictions concerned different periods of time for different areas was based on the migration of the salmon. The idea was not to prohibit all fishing, only the use of such fishing equipment that caught salmon too efficiently.",

Were the Court to have another view, the Government questioned whether the fishermen in adjacent waters were in such a similar position that their treatment could be compared with that afforded to the applicants. At any rate, it was necessary to restrict the fishing of salmon in order to safeguard the relevant wild salmon stocks. The differences between the restrictions imposed were justified by fishery-related reasons indicated by the Frontier Rivers Commission. There was an objective and reasonable justification to restrict fishing more in the coastal waters, estuaries and rivers than, for example, in the open sea. The impugned restrictions were of a short duration. Taking also the State's margin of appreciation into account, there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised, and the applicants were not discriminated against in the enjoyment of their assumed property rights.",

Finland, cited above, \u00a7 177). Noting the margin of appreciation accorded to Contracting States in such matters, it has no reason to doubt that the state of fish stocks required conservation measures and that the timing and application of the measures were geared to local conditions. Moreover, the interference did not completely extinguish the applicants' right to fish in the relevant waters. Professional fishermen, whose livelihood was affected by the ban, were provided with the possibility of applying for compensation for economic losses and the applicants at paragraph 10(x.) above made use of this. While the applicants complain that this would not provide a full measure of compensation for their purported losses, they do not deny that such compensation is available. Insofar as compensation was not available as such for loss of leisure or sporting possibilities, the Court has previously stated that the national authorities must enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining not only the necessity of the measure of control concerned but also the types of loss resulting from the measure for which compensation will be made; the legislature's judgment in this connection will in principle be respected unless it is manifestly arbitrary or unreasonable (see Lithgow v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, p. 51, \u00a7 122, and Chassagnou and Others v.

For the purposes of Article 14 a difference in treatment between persons in analogous or relevantly similar positions is discriminatory if it is based on personal characteristics such as race or association with a national minority and if it has no objective and reasonable justification, that is if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. Moreover, the Contracting States enjoy a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (see Camp and Bourimi v. the Netherlands, no. 28369/95, ECHR 2000-X, \u00a7 37).",

However, on the material submitted, it finds no reason to doubt that there was sufficient justification for the different timing of restrictions applied in the various water areas as well as for differing prohibitions of fishing gear in particular locations, namely to take into account the spawning routes of the salmon and the more confined nature of coastal, estuary and river waters. To the extent therefore that the applicants have been treated differently from those with fishing rights in other areas, the Court considers that it may be regarded as having objective and reasonable justification. For the reasons given above under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the principle of proportionality has also been respected.",
