In this respect the Court sees no reason to depart from the conclusion of the national courts, which acknowledged the violation of this Article. The Court shares this opinion and does not consider it necessary to re-examine the merits of this complaint. The Court also notes that the domestic courts, and the Government, awarded the applicants compensation for nonpecuniary damage. It thus considers that the principal issue is whether the award made was proportionate to the damage the applicants sustained. It recalls in this latter respect that the level of compensation must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (see Burdov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, \u00a7 99, ECHR\u00a02009). Where, as in the present case, the victim status and therefore, the existence of a violation, is linked with the monetary redress afforded at domestic level, the Court\u2019s assessment necessarily involves comparison between the actual award and the amount that the Court would award in similar cases (see, mutatis mutandis, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 181 and 202, ECHR 2006V, and Holzinger v. Austria (no.\u00a01), no. 23459/94, \u00a7 21, ECHR\u00a02001I).",
