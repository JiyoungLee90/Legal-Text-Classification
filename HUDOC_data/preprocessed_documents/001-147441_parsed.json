There was no other documentation showing that the police had taken any additional preliminary investigative steps. Thus, it appears that the police proceeded to conduct the undercover operation on 20\u00a0November 2007 immediately upon receipt of the incriminating information, without due confirmation, and that the applicant was subsequently indicted in relation to it. The fact that the charges relating to that episode were eventually dropped is irrelevant because the court still admitted as evidence the banknotes and the recording from 20\u00a0November\u00a02007 when convicting the applicant in relation to the episode on 23\u00a0November 2007. Hence, the operation that took place on 20\u00a0November\u00a02007 was not a preliminary inquiry and did not serve the purpose of investigating possible criminal activity but appears to have been a deliberate and calculated move to build up a criminal case against the applicant.",

The deficiencies in procedure are admittedly due to the lack of appropriate legislative regulation in place (see Veselov, cited above, \u00a7 111) but this does not release the police from the duty to carry out their investigation in good faith using the instruments that the legislator has made available to them, as was the case in Bannikova (cited above), for instance. Moreover, while the Court emphasises that the most appropriate safeguard for an undercover operation would be judicial supervision, it also refers to the possibility of supervision by a prosecutor (see Bannikova, cited above, \u00a7 50) and it notes that the Russian law at the time provided for the prosecutor\u2019s discretionary power to review criminal case files and operational materials (see paragraph 26 above).",

While the Court has recognised that judicial supervision would be an adequate safeguard for undercover operations, it notes that in order to exercise judicial control in practice the courts need access to sufficient factual material clarifying the circumstances leading to the conduct of an undercover operation. The Court is mindful of the burden placed on Russian courts to examine pleas of entrapment on the basis of the limited evidence provided to them at the discretion of the bodies that carry out undercover operations. However, it continues to stress that in the fight against drug trafficking, corruption and other criminal offences, considerations of procedural economy and efficiency cannot be allowed to stand in the way of an individual\u2019s fundamental right to a fair trial, especially in the light of the successful efforts made by other European countries in this area (see paragraph 35 above and Veselov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 50-63).",
