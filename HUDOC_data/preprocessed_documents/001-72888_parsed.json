Those concerned must expect those rules to be applied. However, the rules in question, or the application of them, should not prevent litigants from making use of an available remedy (see the P\u00e9rez de Rada Cavanilles v.\u00a0Spain judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, p. 3255, \u00a7 45). The Court underlines that, since the issue concerns the principle of legal certainty, it raises not only a problem of the interpretation of a legal provision in the usual way, but of an unreasonable construction of a procedural requirement which may prevent a claim being examined on the merits, thereby entailing a breach of the right to the effective protection of the courts (see, mutatis mutandis, the Miragall Escolano and others v.\u00a0Spain judgment, no. 38366/97, \u00a7 37, ECHR 2001-I; Zvolsk\u00fd and Zvolsk\u00e1 v.\u00a0the Czech Republic judgment, no. 46129/99, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2002-IX).",

The Court considers that such a deadline was foreseeable for the applicant, as she would still have had a month to lodge her appeal after the amendments had been promulgated, even though this new deadline curtailed the original time-limit under the old provisions of the CCP (i.e.\u00a027\u00a0May\u00a02002, three months after the decision of the Vinnitsa Court of Appeal, against which the cassation appeal was made).",

This suggests that the provisions of the latter were to be applied retroactively in the applicant\u2019s case, requiring her to have lodged a cassation appeal within a month of the court of appeal decision (i.e. on 27 March 2002) even before the Amendment Law had come into force.

Nevertheless, where the issue of an effective remedy is concerned, the remedy in question must already exist with a sufficient degree of certainty (see, Vorobyeva v.\u00a0Ukraine, cited above). In this regard, the Court takes the view that the retroactive application of civil procedural law would undermine the principle of legal certainty and would be contrary to the rule of law when it deprives a person of access to a remedy which is deemed to be effective for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
