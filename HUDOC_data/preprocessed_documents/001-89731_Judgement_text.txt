The case originated in an application (no. 39888/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Rasim Renatovich Shakirzyanov (“the applicant”), on 26 September 2002.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by Mr P. Laptev, the former Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights, and subsequently by their Representative, Ms V. Milinchuk.
On 14 March 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in the village Shakhterskiy of the Tula Region.
The applicant is a former serviceman. Upon his dismissal certain pecuniary benefits were not paid to him. He instituted civil proceedings for their recovery against military unit no. 23132.
He had a military rank of junior sergeant in reserve at the material time.
On 6 August 2001 the  granted the applicant’s claim. The court established that from 24 March 2000 to 4 November 2000 the applicant had performed military service in the North Caucasus Region and from 24 March 2000 to 1 May 2000 participated in the military operations in that region. The court found that the applicant was entitled to monetary compensation and the failure to pay it to him in good time constituted a violation of his rights. In its analysis the domestic court referred, inter alia, to the Law on the Status of Military Servicemen (see paragraph 19 below) which provides for entitlement of certain categories of military servicemen to additional monetary compensation, and to Decree of the Federal Government of 20 August 1999 no. 930-54 establishing the amounts of compensation due to military personnel of different ranks for their participation in the military operations on the territory of Dagestan. The court ordered the commander of the military unit concerned to pay the applicant remuneration for his participation in the military operations between 24 March and 1 May 2000 and pecuniary benefits for his service in the North Caucasus Region. An exact amount to be paid was not specified in the operative part of the judgment.
The judgment entered into force on 17 September 2001.
On 9 October 2001 and 5 April 2002 the  invited the commander of the military unit to report whether the judgment of 6 August 2001 had been executed and notified him of his responsibility for non-execution of the judgment. By letter of 5 April 2002 the court also advised the applicant of his right to ask for a writ of execution to be issued in respect of the judgment.
At some point the applicant complied with the instruction and asked for a writ. On 7 May 2002 the  issued the writ of execution, and the enforcement proceedings were opened in respect of the judgment.
Since the respondent military unit was based in Shali, Chechnya, on 19 June 2002 the Bailiffs’ Office of the  forwarded the writ to the Chief Bailiff of the Shali District of Chechnya.
In their observations dated 14 July 2006 the Government submitted that the judgment of 6 August 2001 had not been enforced.
In their further observations of 25 May 2007 the Government informed the Court that the amounts of 25,110 Russian roubles (RUB) and RUB 74,520 of pecuniary benefits for the applicant’s participation in the military operations in the North Caucasus Region were paid to the applicant by the command of the military unit no. 23132 on an unspecified date at his discharge from the military service. They did not submit any documents in this respect.
Section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997 provides that a bailiff’s order on the institution of enforcement proceedings must fix a time-limit for the defendant’s voluntary compliance with a writ of execution. The time-limit may not exceed five days. The bailiff must also warn the defendant that coercive action will follow, should the defendant fail to comply with the time-limit.
Under section 13 of the Law, the enforcement proceedings should be completed within two months of the receipt of the writ of enforcement by the bailiff.
Under special rules governing enforcement of execution writs against the recipients of allocations from the federal budget, adopted by the Federal Government on 22 February 2001 (Decree No. 143, as in force at the relevant time), a creditor is to apply to a relevant branch of the Federal Treasury holding debtor’s accounts (Sections 1 to 4).
Within the next five days the branch examines the application and notifies the debtor of the writ, compelling the latter to abide by the respective court decisions (Sections 7 to 12). In case of the debtor’s failure to comply within two months, the branch may temporarily freeze the debtor’s accounts (Section 13).
Articles 12 and 13 of the Federal Law on the Status of Military Servicemen (no. 76-FZ of 27 May 1998, as in force at the relevant time) provide for the entitlement of the military servicemen to additional payments. Article 13 of the Law stipulates that the amount of the compensation should be determined by the Federal Government.
The Decree of the Federal Government of 20 August 1999 no. 930-54 (as in force at the relevant time), established, with reference to Article 13 of the Law on the Status of Military Servicemen, the amounts of compensation the military personnel was entitled to on account of their participation in the military operations in the Republic of Dagestan, to be paid as from 1 August 1999. In particular, military personnel performing contractual military service in the rank of soldiers, were entitled to additional monetary compensation in the amount of RUB 810 per day of participation in the military activities, sergeants were entitled to RUB 830 per day, etc.
