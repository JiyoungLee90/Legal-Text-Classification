The Court notes that the applicants\u2019 allegation of their relative\u2019s having been ill-treated in detention is supported only by the first applicant\u2019s statement that he had heard his son screaming in a nearby tent.

According to the transcripts, in the course of the questioning the first applicant stated that he had not applied to the Court directly, but that he had applied to human rights\u2019 organisations. The fifth applicant stated that she had not personally applied to any organisations, including the Court, since the search for her brother was carried out by the first applicant. The Court observes that the interpretation of the applicants\u2019 replies may be twofold. They might have meant to deny the fact of their application before the Court, possibly because they did not want the authorities to be aware of it at that stage. Their answers may also be interpreted as clarifying that they did not apply to the Court personally, but through a representative. However, the Court does not find it necessary to decide on particular interpretation of the applicants\u2019 replies since, in any event, the materials available disclose no evidence that the first and fifth applicants received any threats or were subjected to any other forms of pressure in connection with their application before the Court.",
