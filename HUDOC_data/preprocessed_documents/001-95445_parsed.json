Having regard to its above conclusions, it finds that there is a direct causal link between the violation of Article\u00a02 in respect of the applicants' family member and the loss by the applicants of the financial support which he could have provided. The Court further finds that it is reasonable to assume that Kazbek Vakhayev would eventually have had some earnings from which the applicants would have benefited (see, among other authorities, Imakayeva cited above, \u00a7\u00a0213). Having regard to the applicants' submissions and, in particular, the fact that they failed to corroborate the amount of his earnings, the Court awards EUR\u00a07,000 to the second to seventh applicants jointly in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
