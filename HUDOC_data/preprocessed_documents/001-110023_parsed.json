The fact that this deprivation had enduring effects did not produce a continuing situation. The Government distinguished the present case from that of Sovtransavto Holding v. Ukraine (no. 48553/99, \u00a7\u00a7 54 et seq., ECHR 2002VII), where the Court established that the loss of control of a company was a protracted process, creating a continuing situation. In the present case the applicant\u2019s complaint concerned a single act of distribution of the bank\u2019s assets on 13\u00a0March 1996. No new bank assets were discovered after that date. The subsequent decisions of the commercial courts (taken after 5 May 1998) did not violate the applicant\u2019s rights. When the Russian courts ordered that the violation of the applicant\u2019s rights be redressed, it was too late, since by that time the debtor no longer had any assets. Thus there were objective reasons for the failure to enforce the 1998 judgment. In support of this argument the Government referred to the cases of Ble\u010di\u0107 v. Croatia ([GC], no. 59532/00, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2006III) and Kopeck\u00fd v. Slovakia ([GC], no. 44912/98, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2004-IX).

Those possibilities were not in any way precluded by the debtor\u2019s lack of funds. In fact, the continued absence of assets was caused precisely by the liquidator\u2019s unlawful actions and his failure to comply with the terms of the court order to rectify the situation (assuming that the bank indeed had no assets).",

However, in the Court\u2019s opinion, the present case must be distinguished from Ble\u010di\u0107 and Kopeck\u00fd, for the following reasons. As acknowledged by the Government, under Russian law the applicant was entitled to claim damages from the liquidator for the latter\u2019s wrongful acts. Legally speaking, the applicant had a valid tort claim at the time when the Convention entered into force in respect of . It became sufficiently established even later, with the final judgment of 12 November 1998, when the courts recognised that the liquidator had acted unlawfully and ordered him to provide the applicant with redress. The Court observes that in Plechanow v. Poland (no. 22279/04, \u00a7\u00a7 76 et seq., 7 July 2009) it dismissed the Government\u2019s objection ratione temporis and distinguished between the original confiscation of property and the compensation proceedings. In Broniowski v. Poland ((dec.) [GC] no. 31443/96, \u00a7\u00a7 74 et seq., ECHR 2002X) the Grand Chamber drew a similar distinction. It held that \u201cthe applicant did not complain of being deprived of the original property\u201d in the 1940s, but rather complained about the \u201calleged failure to satisfy an entitlement to a compensatory measure which was vested in him under Polish law on the date of the Protocol\u2019s entry in force\u201d. The Court will follow this line of reasoning in the present case. As in Broniowski, the applicant, when the Convention entered into force in respect of , had a defendable tort claim which outlived the original tort. Thus, the central question is why the applicant\u2019s attempt to restore his rights failed, first in 1998 and then in 1999, that is, after the entry into force of the Convention. The Court concludes that it has temporal jurisdiction to examine whether the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention were properly secured in the proceedings of 1998 and 1999.",

The Court concluded in that case that \u201cthe State [could] not absolve itself from responsibility by delegating its obligations to private bodies or individuals\u201d. A similar approach was adopted in the context of the position of advocates in the case of Van der Mussele v. Belgium (23 November 1983, Series A no.\u00a070), and with regard to the status of the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation in Wo\u015b v.

The applicant concluded that, in view of the Court\u2019s case-law, the actions of the liquidator in the present case engaged the responsibility of the State. Even if the liquidator was not a government official, the  retained a positive obligation under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to protect the applicant, as one of the bank\u2019s creditors, from unlawful actions by the liquidator. The nature and scope of such an obligation would consist (at the very least) in ensuring that the liquidator\u2019s actions were compliant with domestic law. The obligation would also extend to remedying any misconduct by the liquidator. In the present circumstances, the appropriate remedy would have entailed the payment of compensation to the applicant as provided for by domestic law, and the enforcement of such award. The applicant in the present case took every opportunity to challenge both the unlawful distribution of the assets by the liquidator and the failure to enforce the decision of the commercial courts. The domestic courts confirmed the liquidator\u2019s unlawful distribution of the assets in 1998 and during further proceedings in 1999, but in spite of those rulings, the insolvency procedure was closed on 17 June 1999 on the grounds of insufficient funds.",

As the Court has repeatedly held, \u201cwhen the debtor is a private actor, ... the State is not, as a general rule, directly liable for debts of private actors and its obligations are limited to providing the necessary assistance to the creditor in the enforcement of the respective court awards, for example, through a bailiff service or bankruptcy procedures\u201d (see, for example, Shestakov v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a048757/99, 18\u00a0June 2002; Krivonogova v. Russia (dec.), no. 74694/01, 1\u00a0April 2004; and Kesyan v. Russia, no. 36496/02, 19 October 2006; see also Scollo v. Italy, 28 September 1995, Series A no. 315-C, \u00a7 44, and Fuklev v. Ukraine, no. 71186/01, \u00a7 84, 7 June 2005). Nonetheless, such pecuniary claims may also be characterised as \u201cpossessions\u201d. In the case at hand the bank\u2019s assets before their distribution by the liquidator were sufficient to meet at least a substantial proportion of the applicant\u2019s claims. Therefore, the 1995 court award was at least partly recoverable. The applicant was a creditor of the first class and the bank\u2019s obligations towards him should have been honoured accordingly. However, the money collected was distributed by the liquidator mostly amongst the \u201cprivileged\u201d creditors, in breach of the law. As a result of that unlawful action, a significant part of the original award was lost for the applicant. Such was the conclusion of the Chamber (see paragraph 53 of the judgment), to which both parties fully subscribed, and the Grand Chamber does not see any reason to depart from that conclusion. It follows that the applicant has been deprived of his possessions by an unlawful act of the liquidator.",

His functions therefore bear some similarity to those of a court bailiff, who is undoubtedly a public authority. Indeed, in most European countries public authorities are involved in the enforcement proceedings and help successful claimants to recover court awards by employing court bailiffs, policemen or other similar officials. The Court has held on numerous occasions that Articles 6 \u00a7 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention provide for a positive obligation on the State to assist private persons in the enforcement of court judgments against other private persons (see Fuklev v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a084 and 91; Scollo v. Italy, cited above, \u00a7 44; Fociac v. Romania, no.\u00a02577/02, \u00a7 70, 3 February 2005; and Kesyan v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a079 and 80, 19 October 2006). However, those similarities would not appear decisive in the light of the significant differences between the functions of bailiff and those of a liquidator. Firstly, whereas bailiffs have to execute court orders, liquidators deal with several kinds of claims, including those which have not been made enforceable by a court. Secondly and most importantly, unlike liquidators, bailiffs are entrusted with coercive powers, in addition to being appointed, paid and closely supervised by a competent State authority. Thus, in the context of insolvency procedures the respondent State left the management of the insolvent company in the hands of its creditors and of liquidators appointed by them, whereas in the context of enforcement proceedings it chose to operate through its own officials and to bear direct responsibility for their actions.",

The requirement is not merely that there should exist a legislative framework but that there should be a degree of clarity and coherence in the law and procedures to be followed in order to avoid, in so far as possible, any legal uncertainty and ambiguity for the litigants concerned. In the Sovtransavto case itself, it was the difference of approach to the application and interpretation of domestic law between the various levels of jurisdiction, which made possible the repeated re-opening of the proceedings in issue and which created permanent uncertainty as to the lawfulness of the decisions in question, that led in part to the Court\u2019s finding that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 had been violated.

In the present case the interference with the applicant\u2019s \u201cpossessions\u201d took place in 1996, when the liquidator took the money destined for the applicant and paid it to creditors who had no right to it. It was an instantaneous act, which occurred before the Convention entered into force in respect of  (5 May 1998). It is probable that the applicant, in such circumstances, was allowed to claim compensation from the liquidator personally. I admit that such a claim existed in Russian law at that time \u2013 at least, this is what the Government acknowledged in their observations. However, having read the judgments of 1999 I was left with the impression that the domestic courts had not been certain whether such a right really existed. It follows that the crux of the present case is not the proceedings which took place in 1999, but rather the substantive legislation in force at the time of the interference, namely in 1996. That legislation was probably not sufficiently clear and the applicant\u2019s action against the liquidator in 1999 was thus doomed to fail. Be that as it may, the question of the alleged deficiency of the substantive rules of law which existed in 1996 escapes the Court\u2019s jurisdiction ratione temporis.",

Apart from the fact that none of the commercial courts indicated that the applicant could or should have sued the liquidator before the courts of general jurisdiction, the \u201cdouble recovery\u201d argument was not the only one relied upon by the commercial courts. The Government themselves acknowledged that there had been other reasons for dismissing the applicant\u2019s tort claim. Thus the judgment of 31 March 1999 (on appeal) stated that the Insolvency Act did not allow claims of creditors to be satisfied if they had not come into existence when the bank was operating but only during the insolvency procedure. The court of appeal thus did not make a distinction between the bank\u2019s original debt and the liquidator\u2019s personal liability in tort. In so doing it rendered the liquidator immune from any liability for his conduct, even if the law, as explained by the Government, provided for such liability. Even though in its judgment of 9\u00a0June 1999 the court of cassation relied on the \u201cdouble recovery\u201d argument, it upheld the judgment of the court of appeal in full, stating explicitly that there was no reason to modify it. Under these circumstances and having regard to the unclear legal situation at the time, the applicant was entitled to believe that his claim had been dismissed on the merits rather than as being premature and that his case had thus been closed. This is, in our opinion, further confirmed by the fact that it was only after the complaint to the Court had been communicated that it was established that the commercial courts had no jurisdiction to hear the claim against the liquidator.",
