The National Bank\u2019s assertion that Landsbr\u00e9f was not the holder of the mortgage notes was implausible. The single most decisive detail regarding the identity of the holder was the public registration of the mortgage; the certificates of title specified Landsbr\u00e9f as the claimant.

The brokerage relating to the mortgage instruments had taken place in such a manner that they were issued only when a purchaser had been found. So the relevant debt instruments were never in Landsbr\u00e9f\u2019s ownership. This was a typical way of proceeding for a securities company receiving debt instruments issued in its name for sale to a third party.

According to the relevant national law, the original registration of a creditor was not to be changed when an instrument had been traded in the securities market. The purpose of registration was not to provide information on the identity of the creditor but only to record liens on the property. The original registration of Landsbr\u00e9f as mortgagee therefore remained unchanged, but, as was usual in the case of transferable debt certificates generally, this provided no reliable indication of their actual owner. Therefore, the registration of an original mortgagee in the real estate records, referring to a debt instrument that was subject to public trade, constituted no proof of a contractual relationship between the mortgagee and the owner of the mortgaged property. The Government therefore rejected the applicant\u2019s suggestion that the registration in the real estate records was a decisive factor excluding the judge\u2019s participation.",

The size of those debts is disputed between the Government and the applicant.

The Committee of Ministers has urged all Contracting States to introduce into their national legislation the possibility of reopening proceedings in cases where a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights establishes a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1, especially where \u201cthe violation found is based on procedural errors or shortcomings of such gravity that a serious doubt is cast on the outcome of the domestic proceedings complained of\u201d (see Recommendation Rec (2000) 2 of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, adopted 19 January 2000). I think that that is true of this case. The applicant has already asked for the reopening of the proceedings and has failed, and Icelandic law does not apparently provide for any further possibility of reopening the proceedings (see paragraph 25 of the judgment).

Furthermore, the fact that his wife was a Supreme Court judge made it socially desirable both for him and for her that the debt should be settled in an acceptable manner. It is appreciated that the spouses kept their financial dealings separate, so that Mrs Justice Gu\u00f0r\u00fan\u00a0Erlendsd\u00f3ttir was in no way financially responsible for the guarantee made by her husband.",

Among them, with the second largest claim, was the National Bank of Iceland. Mr\u00a0\u00d6rn Clausen was released from further liabilities by being able to pay 25% of the debt which he had guaranteed, the creditors thereby agreeing not to seek from him the remaining 75% of that very debt. However, the creditors still had both Mr Edvard L\u00f6vdal \u2013 the person primarily liable for the entire debt \u2013 and a minimum of two other guarantors to hold responsible for that remaining part of Mr Edvard L\u00f6vdal\u2019s debt. Being insolvent means being at the material time unable to honour all one\u2019s obligations. That, however, is different from being unable to honour part of one\u2019s obligations. Most insolvent debtors are able to honour some parts of their obligations; the extent to which they are able to do so varies. It would have been an extraordinary situation \u2013 a situation that this Court could expect to be documented if it existed \u2013 if neither Mr Edvard L\u00f6vdal nor any of the \u201cother guarantors\u201d had been able to pay the creditors anything.",

That Mrs Justice Gu\u00f0r\u00fan Erlendsd\u00f3ttir made a debt cancellation vis-\u00e0-vis her husband a precondition for her offering security was in my opinion not remarkable under the circumstances; it was simply prudent.

A loan against security is commonplace and the size of the loan was not so large as to prevent Mr \u00d6rn Clausen from later regaining a sound financial situation. If Mr \u00d6rn Clausen had been declared bankrupt, he would obviously not have been able or willing, or both, to get a loan of this size to pay the creditors 25% of Mr Edvard L\u00f6vdal\u2019s debt in respect of which he had acted as guarantor. The sheer size of the loan is not compatible with the inference that the creditors would have gained financially by declaring Mr\u00a0\u00d6rn\u00a0Clausen bankrupt.",
