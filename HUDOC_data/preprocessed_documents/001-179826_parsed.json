While noting that the investigation was not necessarily promptly initiated (see, for instance, Hilal Mammadov v. Azerbaijan, no. 81553/12, \u00a7\u00a092, 4\u00a0February\u00a02016), the Court however accepts that the authorities did react to the complaints of the applicant. In this connection, the Court notes that the police officers from the Bucharest General Police Headquarters, who arguably belonged to the same structure as the police officers who were involved in the incident, were delegated to conduct all relevant investigations (see paragraph 16 above). Nevertheless, the Court also notes that the investigation was conducted in accordance with statutory requirements, under the authority of a prosecutor, whose decision was subsequently contested before a criminal court (see paragraph 25 above). The Court cannot but conclude that the investigation was under the control of an independent authority (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7 127 and by way of contrast, Mocanu and Others v.

However, in examining the circumstances of the case, the domestic authorities did not effectively consider the question of the proportionality of the force used by the police officers (see Petru\u015f Iacob v. Romania, no. 13524/05, \u00a7\u00a049, 4\u00a0December\u00a02012), especially in view of the fact that the case file contained no substantiation of any violence or physical aggression directed against the police officers, nor any state of inebriety on the part of the applicant on the day of the incident. The Court considers that the prosecutor\u2019s general remarks in connection with the applicant\u2019s allegedly widely known violent behavior and constant state of inebriation cannot constitute appropriate confirmation of the proportionality of the measures applied by the police officers on 11 December 2011.",
