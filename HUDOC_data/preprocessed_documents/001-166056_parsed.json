It, too, considered that the applicant should be penalised for the delay (of twenty years since coming into possession of the property) in instituting proceedings, as had been done in other domestic cases. It noted that, according to European Court of Human Rights case-law, State control over levels of rent may often cause significant reductions in the amount of rent chargeable; in the circumstances of the present case it was therefore not appropriate to make awards in accordance with market values. It considered that the firstinstance court had been free to make an award equitably, and correct to make no award for the time prior to 1988, the date when the applicant had become the owner of the property (sic.) and before which he had had no ties with it. The Constitutional Court also refused to annul the order, given that it had been issued lawfully and had pursued a legitimate aim. It considered that in such circumstances it was not appropriate (mhux indikat) to release the property and to evict the tenant (as also held in previous cases, namely Carmen Cassar vs Director of Social Accommodation, Constitutional Court judgment of 12 July 2011 and Gatt vs Attorney General, Constitutional Court judgment of 5 July 2011), nor could it impose a higher rent for the future, when such rent was not provided for by law (as also held in Cassar, cited above). It reiterated that its role was limited to awarding compensation for the violation found. The same had also been held by the European Court of Human Rights. Compensation in cases of a constitutional nature was not equivalent to civil damage, which could be pursued before the courts of ordinary jurisdiction.",

Normally, the latter type of damage is requested by means of an ordinary remedy before courts of ordinary jurisdiction. This is so because as explained in the case of Emanuel\u00a0Ciantar, vs\u00a0Commissioner of Police, Constitutional Court, judgment of 2\u00a0November 2001: \u2018The principle is always that constitutional and civil jurisdictions should remain separate and distinct, even because an application to a particular jurisdiction is regulated by the specific procedures and the aim of the remedy is not always the same\u2019. Nevertheless, it is not excluded, in appropriate cases, that a person may request both types of damage from the courts of constitutional jurisdiction, and that these may be awarded by the said courts, if the proof of the loss is brought before it (see comment of the Constitutional Court in Fenech vs Commissioner of Land of 20\u00a0February 2009). Indeed, as held by this Court in Vella vs Commissioner of Police et, decided in 1991 \u2018when the object of the case is complex \u2013 and related to matters some of which have a remedy in some other law and other which only have a constitutional remedy, the latter action shall prevail\u2019.\u201d",

In particular, in his constitutional application of 20 October 2009 (to the first-instance court) the applicant had requested the court to \u201cannul all requisition order\u201d issued on the property (see paragraph 11). Indeed, the first-instance court had even taken into consideration, in awarding compensation, that the property had been first requisitioned in 1976. However, it had erroneously referred to the fact that the applicant had only started to be affected from 1988  despite the fact that he had become sole owner in 1980 following a deed of partition between the heirs. According to the applicant, under Article 946 of the Civil Code, however, the deed had retrospective effect, and thus he had been the owner since 1976.

Moreover, he considered that it should be for the State to safeguard human rights, irrespective of the bringing of proceedings. Indeed, as the years had gone by, he had not been paid rent and nothing had changed in the law to date, so the point in time when he had actually instituted proceedings had been irrelevant.

Thus, despite the wide powers of the courts of constitutional jurisdiction in relation to redressing Convention violations, in practice no remedy had been given to put an end to a continuing violation which had persisted over time. This practice had become systemic, as evidenced by the various Court judgments, which continued to find that applicants in similar cases were still victims of the Convention, despite the domestic findings in their favour. In this connection, the applicant referred to Azzopardi v. Malta (no.\u00a028177/12, 6\u00a0November 2014), Schembri and Others v.

Italy, nos.\u00a018766/11 and 36030/11, \u00a7 78, 21 July 2015). The redress afforded must be appropriate and sufficient.

In this connection, the Court notes, first and foremost, that domestic law does not impose a time-limit for the institution of constitutional redress proceedings. The legislator leaves the choice of timing to the applicant. Moreover, in circumstances such as those of the present case, the violation complained of is a continuing one. The Court thus finds that such reasoning is questionable in the light of the circumstances of the case and the domestic legal framework, which appears to give great latitude to individuals seeking redress for human rights violations.",

Although the scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint, the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law. The \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the \u201cauthority\u201d referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Furthermore, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7 157, ECHR 2000XI, and Ali\u0161i\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Bosnia\u00a0and\u00a0Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and the former\u00a0Yugoslav\u00a0Republic\u00a0of Macedonia [GC], no. 60642/08, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2014).",

Nevertheless, it is clear from the case-law relied on by the domestic court and that submitted by the applicant that in situations such as those of the present case, namely where a lawful requisition has imposed an excessive burden on an applicant leading to a violation, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction, and in particular the Constitutional Court on appeal, do not take such action. Indeed, the Government have not provided one such example, despite having been requested to do so, and despite the fact that thousands of requisition orders have been in place in the past decades. It follows that, despite having the power to do so, in practice, the Constitutional Court has repeatedly failed to take the required action which would bring the violation to an end.",
