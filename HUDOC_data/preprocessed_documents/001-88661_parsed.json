The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, but not that recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, pp. 2275-76, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a051-52, and Akd\u0131var and Others v.

Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means in particular that the Court must take realistic account, not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned, but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7 69, and Ya\u015fa v.

The Court reached this conclusion on the following grounds: (i) the applicant himself had raised the issue of ill-treatment in the context of admissibility of evidence only; (ii) he had not alleged before the trial court that the investigation into his complaints of ill-treatment had been inadequate; and (iii) the applicant had not complained about the ill-treatment to the doctor who had examined him several hours after his arrest when he had allegedly been beaten by policemen, and the complaint had only been brought to the attention of the authorities two months after the alleged event.",

In particular, the court questioned the alleged perpetrator L., requested the results of the prosecutor\u2019s preliminary inquiry and dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegations as unfounded; (ii) the applicant could not have alleged before the trial court that the investigation into his complaints of ill-treatment had been inadequate because he only became aware of the results of the preliminary inquiry at the trial; (iii) the applicant did complain about the ill-treatment to the doctor who examined him shortly after the events complained of, and the issue was promptly brought to the attention of the authorities.",

The institution of criminal proceedings was subsequently again refused, and that decision was also reversed on 28 January 2004 as superficial, the higher prosecutor having indicated particular flaws in the investigation that had to be rectified. In the circumstances, where the allegations of ill-treatment had already been brought before and addressed in substance by the trial court, and where the decisions to continue the investigation were taken by the prosecuting authorities themselves, an appeal to a court does not appear to be able to offer the applicant any different outcome. Accordingly, the Court considers that in the circumstances of the present case, raising the ill-treatment complaint before the trial court and lodging an appeal before a higher prosecutor was sufficient to comply with the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies.

However, the prosecuting authorities had conspicuously disregarded the instructions of the higher prosecutor and failed to investigate properly the applicant\u2019s allegations. In the Court\u2019s view, the requirement to appeal yet again against such a refusal would be over-formalistic and place an excessive burden on the applicant. Furthermore, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative steps that ought to have been carried out much earlier, such as an expert medical examination and inspection of the scene of the events, could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, another reversal of the refusal to open criminal proceedings would not constitute an effective remedy in the present case. Accordingly, the Court considers that in these circumstances the applicant should be dispensed from the requirement to appeal against the refusal to open criminal proceedings of 5\u00a0March\u00a02004.",

Where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused (see Ribitsch v. Austria, judgment of 4 December 1995, Series A no. 336, \u00a7 34; see also, mutatis mutandis, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII). In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, pp. 64-65, \u00a7 161). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch v. Austria, judgment of 4 December 1995, Series A no. 336, \u00a7 34, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII).",

It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. The Court has previously had before it cases in which it has found that there has been treatment which could only be described as torture (see Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18\u00a0December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, p. 2279, \u00a7\u00a064; Ayd\u0131n v.

In any event, the Court reiterates that, in respect of persons deprived of their liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by their own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7\u00a099).",
