If the head of the school considered that the child had not the ability to profit from the instruction in the language designated, the head of the family might appeal to the inspectorate. Thanks to fairly broad interpretation of the text, some Dutch-speaking parents had their children educated in French. In some parts of Flanders there were, in addition to Dutch-language primary schools, State and private French-language primary schools, whilst secondary education was provided sometimes in French, sometimes half in French and half in Dutch (paragraphs 138 and 345 of the Report).",

In this connection, they invoked the spirit and letter of the Convention as well as the reservations and declarations made by several signatory States. They also based their arguments on Articles 17 and 23 of the Belgian Constitution, cited above, and also on Article 6 which guarantees the equality of all Belgians in the eyes of the law. They furthermore emphasised that education in  is both compulsory up to the age of fourteen (Act of 19th May 1914) and free at the nursery, primary and secondary stages in official and subsidised schools (Act of 29th May 1959). Therefore, a modern State like  cannot claim \"that it is not obliged to take measures to ensure the free exercise, in this field, of rights which are embodied in, inter alia, its Constitution and the Convention\". Admittedly, Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2) does not oblige the Contracting States to provide or finance education; nor does it prevent them issuing regulations governing admission to the educational facilities which they provide or subsidise, for such regulations can be \"justified by perfectly valid reasons\". The Applicants however expressed the opinion that once a State undertakes to provide or subsidise a particular type of education, it must \"refrain from any discriminatory measure\", as otherwise it violates Article 2 (P1-2). In their opinion this text must be interpreted \"in good faith and in all fairness\", and its Application may \"vary from one State to another depending on the special circumstances peculiar to each State\". In particular, the \"cultural\" right to education, guaranteed by the first sentence, means, on analysis, a \"right to the performance of a service\", a \"right to have the State take action\". No doubt Article 2 (P1-2) states this in a negative way but the abandonment of the positive formula which was originally contemplated, does not have the significance which is attributed to it by the respondent Government. \"To make existing teaching available to all\": this is the service",

                                        "content": "According to the Belgian Government the Convention and the Protocol (P1) are inspired on the whole by the classic conception of freedoms, in contrast to rights, differing in this respect from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and from the European Social Charter. The individual freedoms place purely negative duties on the governmental authorities (pouvoirs publics) (negative status, status libertatis). The commitments undertaken by the States by virtue of the Convention and the Protocol possess therefore an essentially negative character. This is the case, in particular, with the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2): it obliges the State \"not to prevent persons within its jurisdiction from obtaining education\" but does not require it to provide itself \"education and teaching for its citizens\"; in short, it gives rise \"above-all\" to a \"prohibition against prohibition\". In effect, the right to education is stated in negative terms (\"No person shall be denied ...\"), whereas the Consultative Assembly had advocated in August 1950 a positive formula (\"Everyone has the right to ...\"). This alteration, introduced in 1951 by the governmental experts, was far from being fortuitous; it shows that the States did not intend to bind themselves \"to take positive steps\" in the matter. In this respect the \"preparatory work\" confirms very clearly the conclusions drawn from the text itself; furthermore, the declarations made by the  (20th March 1952) and by the Federal Republic of Germany (13th February 1957) concerning Article 2 (P1-2) point in the same direction. Consequently the first sentence of Article 2 (P1-2) does not oblige the Contracting States to take any beneficial measures such as the opening or subsidising of schools and official recognition of school-leaving certificates. Nor does it safeguard the right of each person to receive an education in conformity with his cultural and linguistic preferences; these are in no way protected by the second sentence of Article 2 (P1-2), which is limited to demanding respect for \"religious and philosophical convictions\"; they are, a fortiori, outside the scope of the first sentence. It follows that Article 2 (P1-2) in no wise condemns \"a unilingual policy\" in the sphere of education; it also leaves to a \"bilingual country\" the opportunity of deciding that \"in order to meet their scholastic obligations parents must arrange for their children to receive a complete education in the language of the region\". On this point, as on others, it is much less generous than Article 17 of the Belgian Constitution. The prohibition of the refusal to anyone of the right to education signifies, for example, that \"in the absence of primary education\", \"the State would not be permitted to oppose the establishment of schools by individuals\" and that \"individuals would be able\", \"in certain circumstances at least\", \"to organise specialised technical education for which the State was unable or unwilling to assume responsibility\". As for the idea advanced by the Commission of a right to education the context of which \"may vary according to circumstances\", the Belgian Government contests its \"legal orthodoxy\"; it considers that \"the right must mean the same thing for all persons under the jurisdiction of the High Contracting Parties\".",

In its view the rights recognised by the Convention are not all \"negative\": \"one must examine each question\" and \"each provision in its own right without being led astray\" by a legal theory of \"some antiquity\" - the classic doctrine of individual freedoms - which \"may still have a certain philosophical value\" but which \"is in no way normative\". What is the position in this respect, of the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2)? It \"prohibits States from taking any action that might prevent persons under their jurisdiction from educating themselves\". On the other hand, it entails \"no positive obligation\", \"in the sense that they have to make any material provision\". This conclusion is to be drawn from the text which \"uses a negative formula\". It is based furthermore on the \"preparatory work\": in removing the \"positive formula\" adopted by the Assembly of the Council of Europe in August 1950, the signatory States intended to ensure that the first sentence of Article 2 (P1-2) \"could not be interpreted as placing an obligation on Governments to take effective steps to enable everyone to receive the education he desired\". Moreover, if the object of the Protocol had been to oblige States either to provide education themselves or to subsidise private education, such an obligation should have been embodied in rules, even if only approximate. Neither are the Contracting Parties obliged to respect \"parents' preferences for a particular language\". The Commission emphasises however that \"the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2), despite its negative wording, embodies the right of everyone to education\". It is a right \"whose scope is not defined or specified in the Convention\" and whose content varies \"from one time or place to another\", according to \"economic and social circumstances\". Belgium being \"a highly developed country\", the right to education, \"for the purpose of considering the present case\", \"includes entry to nursery, primary, secondary and higher education\"; it implies also \"the right to draw the full benefit from the education received\", for, \"in Belgium's present economic and social circumstances, as indeed in those of the other countries that have signed the Protocol\", one cannot imagine that Article 2 (P1-2) is limited to the safeguarding of the right to a purely humanist education or to education \"purely for the love of it\". In other respects \"the exact scope\" of the first sentence of Article 2 (P1-2) may be disputed; \"it may be asked, for example, whether once it has set up a system of public education, a State may abandon the entire system and throw the burden on to private enterprise\".",

According to the Applicants of Antwerp, Ghent and Vilvorde, moreover, the second sentence of Article 2 (P1-2) does not concern the education and teaching organised by the parents themselves but applies to \"that in relation to which the State assumes functions\"; it concerns therefore \"official teaching and independent teaching subsidised, regulated and controlled\" by the public authorities.

A study of the \"preparatory work\" furthermore proves that \"the European organs concerned never thought about linguistic problems\", but \"simply about conflicts on ideological and denominational matters\". Consequently, the cultural and linguistic preferences of parents are in no way comprised within \"religious and philosophical convictions\" so that the second sentence of Article 2 (P1-2) does not safeguard \"the right of parents to have their children taught in the language of their choice\". Here too Article 17 of the Belgian Constitution shows itself more generous for it \"proclaims the freedom of all education without distinguishing between the motives or convictions that might inspire such education\".",

It also emphasises that the \"Danish Delegation proposed that the text should state the right of parents to send their children to recognised schools where the language of instruction was not that of the country in question\"; however \"this proposal, for which there was no majority support, was withdrawn\". In December 1951 two members of the Consultative Assembly also suggested that \"language rights should be recognised\", but \"no action was taken on these suggestions\".

Besides, the rights of parents in the sphere of education and teaching are defined exclusively by Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2). Article 8 (art. 8) consequently in no way enshrines rights such as that of the head of the family to \"choose freely in what language his children shall be taught\". Therefore, legislation concerning schooling cannot violate Article 8 (art. 8): the Belgian Government, modifying slightly its earlier reasoning, \"absolutely disputes\" before the Court the possibility of any \"link\" whatsoever \"between Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention and the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2)\".",

The Commission deduces from this that \"even if it is accepted\" that those three provisions might, \"in certain circumstances\", \"be applied jointly or in conjunction\", one must beware of interpreting any one of them in a way which would involve an extension of the \"rights recognised by the other two\". In particular, \"it is not conceivable that Article 8 (art. 8) should encroach on the sphere of Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2) or even less that it should add something to that Article\". Any such result would, moreover, \"be contrary to the intention of the Contracting Parties as is clearly revealed\" by the \"preparatory work\". The object then of Article 8 (art. 8) \"is not to guarantee the right to education, considered as a corollary of the freedom of private life, or the rights of parents with regard to their children's education, considered as a consequence of the right to respect for private and family life\". It is not, however, \"impossible for educational measures\" to infringe Article 8 (art. 8). Thus, \"any school system which, without disregarding parents' rights to educate and bring up their children in accordance with their religious and philosophical convictions\", sought \"to separate parents and children might violate Article 8 (art. 8)\". \"Similarly, provisions relating to the language of instruction may\", \"under certain conditions\", be considered \"incompatible with Article 8 (art. 8)\" if they \"entail grave disturbances in private or family life\", this incompatibility not being due \"to the State's failure to respect parents' wishes with regard to the language of education but to the grave and unjustified disturbances caused in private or family life\". Consequently, the Belgian Government is \"in error in affirming that the Article has nothing to do with the dispute brought before the Court\".",

In the first place they expressed the opinion that the word \"secured\" implies the existence of obligations upon the Contracting States to take action and not simply a duty to abstain from action. Moreover they admitted that Article 14 (art. 14), despite the categorical words of the French version (\"sans distinction aucune\"), only forbids distinctions of a \"discriminatory\" character, a discrimination consisting \"of an act or omission attributable to the public authorities\" and introducing an inequality of treatment of an arbitrary nature. A distinction designed \"to re-establish rather than to destroy equality\" or based on \"valid reasons\" is therefore completely \"legitimate\". However a \"legitimate distinction\" sometimes turns in the long run into a \"wrongful discrimination\" having survived the achievement of its initial aim. Certain discriminations, the gravest ones, derive from the \"deliberate will of governments\" (\"active\" discriminations); others have their \"origin in factors of an economic, social or political nature\" or in \"historical circumstances\" (\"static\" discriminations). On this point, the Applicants have cited extracts from a report of Mr. Charles Ammoun () drawn up in 1956 for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. They also referred many times to the Convention and the Recommendation \"against discrimination in education\" adopted on 14th December 1960 by the General Conference of UNESCO.",

                                        "content": "The Belgian Government had submitted, before the Commission, that \"a violation of Article 14 (art. 14) without simultaneous violation of another Article of the Convention is legally impossible\"; it based its argument on the words \"rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention\" and on the decisions of the Commission. Since then there has been a change in its views on this matter. During the first phase of the proceedings before the Court (preliminary objection), the Belgian Government emphasised that Article 14 (art. 14) does not form part of the enumeration of rights and freedoms in Articles 2-13 of the Convention (art. 2, art. 3, art. 4, art. 5, art. 6, art. 7, art. 8, art. 9, art. 10, art. 11, art. 12, art. 13) and Articles 1-3 of the Protocol (P1-1, P1-2, P1-3), for it does no more than prohibit any discrimination in the enjoyment of these rights and freedoms. Article 14 (art. 14) is not, therefore, either separately or in conjunction with other Articles of the Convention or the Protocol, the source of any rights not enshrined in the Convention and the Protocol; equally it does not transform the negative obligations resulting from these instruments into duties to provide something. In reality its function is to determine the exact sphere of Application ratione personae of the rights and freedoms safeguarded. Consequently, a breach of Article 14 (art. 14) is inconceivable without a simultaneous violation of an Article protecting a right or freedom unless that Article imposes positive obligations. However, the Articles invoked by the Applicants in conjunction with Article 14 - Article 8 (art. 14+8) of the Convention and Article 2 of the Protocol (art. 14P1-2) - give rise purely to obligations of non-interference. After the judgment of 9th February 1967, the Belgian Government completed and slightly modified its argument on the point in question. In its opinion, the first decisions of the Commission seemed to indicate that Article 14 (art. 14) \"served no practical legal purpose and that its presence in the Convention was purely psychological in intention\". More recently the Commission has sought to \"reconcile two at first sight incompatible principles, firstly that Article 14 (art. 14) should serve a practical legal purpose\", and secondly that it \"relates only to the rights and freedoms safeguarded\". The Belgian Government does not dispute \"the merits\" of such an \"attempted legal analysis\"; however, the solution adopted by the Commission does not seem to it to \"pay sufficient regard to the second principle\". For in its opinion \"the practical effect of Article 14 (art. 14)\" is limited to two cases: \"where the provisions of the Convention and Protocol place on the High Contracting Parties positive obligations, compliance with which necessitates action by the authorities of these States\" (e.g. Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention and Article 3 of the Protocol (P1-3)) and where they create \"negative or self-executing obligations\" but \"exceptionally allow\" the States to \"derogate from these obligations in certain circumstances\" (e.g. Articles 2-5 of the Convention (art. 2, art. 3, art. 4, art. 5) and paragraph 2 of Articles 8-11 (art. 8-2, art. 9-2, art. 10-2, art. 11-2)). This does not hold good in a third situation, that of an Article which \"places on States a mere duty to refrain from action but contains no general stipulation concerning exceptions or derogations\" (e.g. Article 2 of the Protocol) (P1-2). Article 14 (art. 14) does not apply to \"positive benefits\" and \"favours\" that a State may, without being bound to do so by the Convention, \"grant\" in order to \"facilitate the exercise\" of a freedom safeguarded by an Article of this kind: to accept the contrary view is to \"turn a negative obligation into a positive one\", \"in certain circumstances\", an act which is in no way authorised by the Convention and the Protocol.",

It considers, as do the Applicants and the Commission, that Article 14 (art. 14) does not prohibit every inequality of treatment in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms safeguarded. What then is to be understood by a \"discrimination\" as opposed to a \"distinction\" or a legitimate \"differentiation\"? According to the Belgian Government the Court is empowered to decide \"what constitutes discrimination\", but its power \"conflicts to some extent with the functions of the State\". The general and specific objects which a Government seeks to achieve, and the means it uses for the purpose, are within its own jurisdiction; \"in case of doubt it must be presumed\" that these objects and means are \"reasonable\"; quite exceptional cases excluded, it is enough, for a State to justify its action, to invoke \"a legitimate and avowable motive\". The European jurisdictions would be acting outside the limits of their attributed powers if they were to review the legitimacy, the equity and the desirability of the actions of States; they would \"inevitably\" be led \"to take up political attitudes in their decisions\", a result not \"in accordance with the intention of the High Contracting Parties\". There would be a veritable \"political tutelage\" of democratic Parliaments, which are the only judges of the requirements of the national sentiment. The distinction, proposed by the Commission, between \"privileges\" and \"hardships\", lacks clarity; \"the only correct way of stating the problem\" consists, in the present case, in asking whether \"by conferring certain privileges solely on education given in the regional language\" the Belgian legislation \"deprives\" education given in some other language \"of a right safeguarded by the Convention or Protocol\".",

In the view of the Commission \"such a restrictive application\" would conflict with the principle of effectiveness established by the case law of the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice, for the discrimination would be limited to the aggravation \"of the violation of another provision of the Convention\". The Commission is, moreover, of the opinion that such an interpretation would be in ill accord \"with the wording of Article 14 (art. 14)\": in its opinion the word \"secured\" implies the placing of \"an obligation which is not simply negative\" on the Contracting States. Article 14 (art. 14) \"is of particular importance in relation to those clauses\" which \"do not precisely define the rights\" which they enshrine, but \"leave States a certain margin of appreciation with regard to the fulfilment of their obligation\", \"authorise restrictions on, or exceptions to the rights guaranteed\" or \"up to a point leave it to the States to choose the appropriate means to guarantee a right\".

Thus, Article 6 (art. 6) requires States \"to set up tribunals\" to determine civil cases and \"any criminal charge\"; it does not however require them \"to set up Courts of Appeal\". A State which does set up such courts, would consequently go beyond its positive obligations derived from Article 6 (art. 6); it would, however, be bound by virtue of Article 14 (art. 14) and not Article 6 (art. 6) to make such courts available to all, and the Belgian Government has moreover admitted this. Article 14 (art. 14) applies also \"to the guaranteeing of rights and freedoms which only impose on States a duty to refrain from action\", \"without conferring on them any power to intervene\". Such is the case in relation to the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2). \"Despite its negative wording\", it embodies \"the right of everyone to education\". The Commission deduces from this that \"the enjoyment of that right must be secured to everyone in the Contracting States without discrimination\": \"if a country has education organised by the public authorities, that education cannot be denied to anyone\", without opening the door \"to all kinds of discrimination in education\". For there to be a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 2 of the Protocol (art. 14+P1-2), it is enough for the discrimination in issue to \"touch the enjoyment of a specific right or freedom already comprised within the right to education\". In short, it is necessary for Article 2 (P1-2) to be read \"as though Article 14 (art. 14) were its third paragraph, so to speak\". Article 14 (art. 14) gives rise therefore to obligations \"in addition to\", \"independent of the nature\" of those, whether positive or negative, which result from \"the rest of the Convention\". The effect of the Commission's thesis is in no way to transform duties \"to refrain from interfering\" into duties \"to provide something\": it means that when a State \"without being under any obligation to do so\", takes positive action with regard to the rights laid down in the Convention, it must do so without discrimination. In the sphere of education, \"the obligation not to discriminate\" is neither \"positive\" nor \"negative\" but \"conditional\": \"If the State assumes\", quite freely, \"functions\" in this sphere, it \"must carry them out in a non-discriminatory manner\".",

Article 14 (art. 14) condemns only \"discrimination\", and the Commission makes a point of stating precisely how it understands this word. In its opinion a State does not discriminate if it limits itself to conferring an \"advantage\", a \"privilege\" or a \"favour\" on a particular group or individual which it denies to others. The question of a possible discrimination arises only if the difference in treatment in issue amounts to a \"hardship\" inflicted on certain people. Further it is necessary that the so termed \"hardship\" should not be justified by \"considerations based on the general interest\" and, in particular, by \"administrative or financial\" needs. The \"motives\" and the \"philosophy\" which have inspired the Government are to be taken into account in this context but it is likewise necessary to see whether such motives and philosophy as are regarded as \"legitimate\" have inspired measures which are incompatible with the rights and freedoms safeguarded including \"the right to non-discrimination\". \"The appraisal\" of the \"public interest\" is not \"exempt from review by the organs\" established \"for the implementation of the Convention\". \"Several Articles\" of the Convention, for example, Articles 8-11 (art. 8, art. 9, art. 10, art. 11), and Article 15 (art. 15) \"are worded in such a way as to require what might be called political judgments\"; however, \"the Commission has constantly taken the view, with which the Court agreed in the Lawless case\", that the organs set up to ensure respect for the Convention are empowered to make \"such judgments\"; if this were not so, \"the international protection of human rights\" would lose \"its effectiveness\" and \"its very meaning\". The position is the same with respect to Article 14 (art. 14): if it is accepted \"that certain differentiations may be justified on reasonable and legitimate grounds\", the idea of \"international review\" requires that the Commission and the Court \"attempt to verify the motives of the legislative body as well as the aims and effects of the legislation\". To examine whether those motives are \"reasonable\", those aims \"legitimate\" and those effects \"justifiable\", in no way amounts to placing under \"tutelage\" the Contracting States, to which the Commission in any case reserves a \"certain margin of discretion\".",

Several members of the Committee believed that it concerned an aspect of the problem of ethnic minorities and that it consequently fell outside the scope of the Convention (see Doc.

The existence of such a justification must be assessed in relation to the aim and effects of the measure under consideration, regard being had to the principles which normally prevail in democratic societies. A difference of treatment in the exercise of a right laid down in the Convention must not only pursue a legitimate aim: Article 14 (art. 14) is likewise violated when it is clearly established that there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised.",

The object of these two Articles (art. 14+P1-2), read in conjunction, is more limited: it is to ensure that the right to education shall be secured by each Contracting Party to everyone within its jurisdiction without discrimination on the ground, for instance, of language. This is the natural and ordinary meaning of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 2 (art. 14+P1-2).

The \"parallelism\" established by the law between the two main regions of the country is \"more apparent than real\"; moreover, it cannot redress the discriminations committed, in Flanders as well as in Wallonia, to the detriment of those speaking a different language, for the Convention proclaims \"equality between men and not between inorganic communities\".

The Commission recalls however that in the opinion of five of its members, the first sentence of Article 2 (P1-2) gives rise to duties to take positive steps. Two of these members nevertheless arrive at the same conclusion as the majority; for the other three, however, \"the refusal (...) to organise or subsidise French education at the compulsory primary level in the Flemish areas cannot be reconciled with Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2)\".",

Certainly it is possible to imagine that they affect the \"private and family life\" of the Applicants, causing it \"grave and unjustified disturbances\" (cf. supra). The question arises however only in relation to primary education, which is the only compulsory education in . Some of the various solutions open to the Applicants, namely having their children taught at home, sending them to school abroad, or sending them to a private school in Flanders providing education in French, are out of the question for \"the immense majority of heads of families\" by reason of their \"high cost\". There remain therefore recourse to \"scholastic emigration\", and sending the children to a Dutch-language school. Scholastic emigration - daily \"commuting\" or boarding out - presents \"very serious hardships\", but these hardships are \"not dictated by the Act itself\", \"otherwise they would represent a violation of Article 8 (art. 8)\": they result from the \"wishes of the parents\" who are able to \"avoid them by enrolling their children in local Flemish-speaking establishments\". \"The need to send children to a Flemish school\" does not constitute \"an interference in private or family life\". Although the abolition of transmutation classes and special language classes (Act of 30th July 1963) seems \"regrettable\" in its view, the Commission thinks that \"French-speaking parents will generally have the opportunity to react in their homes against the 'depersonalisation' or 'flemicisation' of their children\", as the pupils \"will usually after a short transitional period, be able to follow with profit the instruction they receive in Dutch\" and the majority of parents \"will be able to supervise their children's education\": \"it is difficult to imagine that people living permanently in the region will be totally ignorant of its language\" which is \"one of the national languages of Belgium\". It may no doubt happen that \"children may encounter serious difficulty in learning Dutch and that their parents may be totally ignorant of the language\", but the Applicants have not cited \"any case of this kind\". Two members of the Commission are of the opinion that \"the legislation in dispute\" has \"effects contrary to Article 8 (art. 8)\", but \"the Commission has not sufficient information to be able to judge in concreto whether the Applicants, or some of them at least, are victims of these effects\"; the Commission draws the attention of the Court to their dissenting opinions.",

After emphasising that \"a language system for education, organised on a territorial basis\", is not necessarily contrary to the Convention, as it \"might be justified\" by \"administrative, financial or other considerations\", it examines in detail the legislation criticised by the Applicants with a view to discovering its \"general effect\". In its view, this study shows that the legislation in dispute \"has neither the object nor the effect of ensuring the qualifications thought necessary for the exercise of certain functions or professions, nor indeed of ensuring linguistic knowledge\". It proves also that \"the language reforms\" aimed \"initially at removing the abuses which had occurred in the nineteenth century under the system of absolute linguistic freedom, the whole brunt of which had been borne by the Dutch-speaking population\", but that the Acts of 1932 and 1963 had \"reversed the position\". \"The parallelism established between the Flemish and Walloon regions\" is \"not complete, at least under the 1963 Acts\"; further still it operates in practice \"against French-speaking people living in the Flemish region\" while \"it hardly affects the Flemish population of Wallonia\". \"In so far as it is real\" it further has the effect of \"introducing distinctions in each of the two regions\" which \"are not affected by their reciprocal character\". \"The loopholes provided for the French-speaking population\", in particular scholastic emigration, entail \"inconvenience and dangers\" which make them \"ineffective\". \"What is more, certain provisions in the Acts concerned\" exceed their official purpose: \"they can only be explained by a desire to halt the spread of the French language in the Flemish zone\", indeed to assimilate the \"French-speaking population of Flanders\", against their will, \"into the sphere of the language of the region\". Although \"The Commission readily understands the attachment of the Flemish population to their language and culture and their desire to preserve and develop them\", and although \"a policy which reflects such aspirations therefore appears quite legitimate in itself\", it cannot consequently \"find it illegitimate that French-speaking people living in Flanders should seek to protect their own language\" which \"has been established there for centuries\". Without disputing the fact that the Belgian Government is \"entitled to refrain from positive action to meet the wishes of the French-speaking population\", the Commission questions \"the result of a policy which thwarts them by measures of compulsion and by penalties\". Is not such a policy in danger of \"producing wrongs similar to those\" which existed in the past, but \"with the difference that this time it is the French-speaking population which would suffer\"? \"In any event\" a reading of the documents shows \"clearly, in the view of the majority of the Commission, the intention of the Belgian Government and of the Belgian legislature to place the French speaking population in the Flemish region at a disadvantage in relation to the Dutch-speaking inhabitants\"; the 1932 legislation created \"numerous inequalities which have been markedly aggravated by the 1963 legislation to the detriment of the former and the benefit of the latter\".",

Despite the fact that the Belgian Government has not shown the necessity for \"these inequalities and disadvantages\", that \"a double system of education, both Dutch and French\", would certainly be sufficient to remove the wrongs which existed in the past, that unilingualism is not based on \"financial, technical or administrative\" requirements, and that no account is taken of the \"number or degree of French-speaking persons\" living in Flanders, five members of the Commission \"hesitate to consider\" the system \"discriminatory\". They recall that the Convention and the Protocol do not oblige States to establish or to subsidise any education at all; from this they infer that the Belgian State, \"in encouraging education in Dutch\" and \"discouraging education in French\" grants \"a privilege\" to the Flemish-speaking inhabitants without inflicting \"hardships\" on French-speaking inhabitants. They add that the Contracting States \"are generally content to provide or give support to education in their national language\" and to throw it open to \"all their inhabitants\" on equal conditions; the Belgian State has not departed from this rule \"of international conduct\": \"it has simply adapted it, certainly in a summary manner, to the fact that there are several linguistic groups in Belgium\". This being so, the five members concerned \"do not feel it necessary to dwell on criticisms made by the Applicants of certain matters of detail in the legislation\", for example the rule relating to the teaching of the second national language: if \"the State's refusal to establish or subsidise schools\" does not constitute a discrimination \"it necessarily follows that the State enjoys a (...) margin of discretion with regard to the organisation of curricula in official or subsidised education\". Four other members also arrive, although for different reasons, at the conclusion that the system of language regulation in education in the unilingual regions is \"not incompatible with the Convention\". On the other hand, three members of the Commission do not accept this conclusion. Two of them in substance hold the opinion that \"the refusal to organise or subsidise French education in localities where there is a sufficient number of French-speaking persons\" is also covered by Article 14 (art. 14).",

This provision does not apply to the Dutch-speaking region, but the circulars of 9th and 29th August 1963 lead, according to the better view, to the same results: they require the establishments concerned to close down their French classes, or to split into two. At , the Institut St Joseph des Filles de Marie and the Coll\u00e8ge Marie-Jos\u00e9 (amalgamated with the High School) have chosen the second solution. They have erected a wall between the two sections. In the opinion of the Applicants, the construction of such a wall \"hurts the feelings of the child who is thus liable to develop a complex\" and to be the victim of \"a humiliating segregation\". The establishments concerned are moreover doomed sooner or later to close down as a result of the cumulative effect of legal measures and other pressures; already several of them have ceased all instruction in French after the entry into force of the 1963 legislation.",

The Belgian Government finds it \"difficult to detect any difference between privileges granted to the Dutch-speaking population and disadvantages for the French-speaking population\", and consequently also between the refusal to grant subsidies and their withdrawal. In endeavouring to show that this last measure does not constitute a discrimination, it emphasises that \"one of the guiding principles of Belgian legislation\" consists in subjecting \"subsidised private education\" to the \"same rules\" as \"official education\" and in preventing \"evasion of the law\". The \"Dutch-language schools which created French-language sections\" frequently resorted to \"expedients, the smartness of which was sometimes very questionable, to enable the French-language sections to benefit, despite everything, from the grants\" allotted \"for Dutch-language education\". According to the Belgian Government, the heads of these establishments moreover managed \"in nearly all cases\" to \"create a French-language section solely because they were in charge of subsidised and recognised Dutch-language schools\". Consequently, the French language sections were generally not \"viable except as annexes of Dutch-language schools\", and it was possible to have \"serious reservations as to the quality of the education\" they provided. Certain establishments had stopped all French-language education since 1963-1964. \"A few French-language sections, large enough to be independently viable\", had however \"survived by converting themselves into independent schools\". Moreover, the Convention, less generous in this respect than the Belgian Constitution, does not enshrine the right to follow \"a linguistic policy not in conformity with that of the national authorities\", and the linguistic policy of the Belgian State is pursuing a \"legitimate objective\" the evaluation of which is not within the competence of the Commission and the Court; this objective is to ensure the formation of Dutch-speaking \u00e9lites in Flanders by struggling against the \"phenomenon of francisation\" which once existed there.",

It considers, in effect, on the basis of its interpretation of Article 14 (art. 14) mentioned above (\"scope\" and \"concept of discrimination\": cf. supra), that the withdrawal of subsidies amounts to an \"unjustifiable hardship\": going far beyond the encouragement, \"in either region, of the local language and culture\", it tends to \"prevent the spread, if not the maintenance even, in one region, of the language and culture of the other region\" and to \"assimilate minorities into the language of their surroundings\". In this connection, the Commission states that the withdrawal of subsidies \"is entailed even in the maintenance of nursery classes which do not conform to the legislation in issue\"; that it applies to schools which \"from the technical and academic points of view\" meet \"in full the requirements of the law\" since they benefited from subsidies before the entry into force of the 1963 Acts; that it in actual fact concerns only establishments situated in Flanders as there do not seem to be comparable establishments situated in Wallonia; that it \"bears hard on French-speaking children, without giving any advantage to Dutch-speaking children\" and that it \"takes the form of a punitive sanction whose victims, incidentally, are not the educational establishments affected but the French-speaking inhabitants\" of the Dutch-speaking region and more precisely, in this case, \"all the signatories of the six Applications\" referred to the Court.",

The last linguistic census which took place in 1947, showed that 47 % of the population were French-speaking. According to the signatories of Application No. 1677/62, an \"indirect linguistic census\" was taken in Kraainem on 31 December 1961 despite the Act of 24th July 1961: the commune administration, having distributed bilingual forms to the population, ascertained that 61.18 % of the population was French-speaking, and today it is 65 %.

This protection, moreover, is still highly insufficient; it merely provides \"facilities of little value\", wrongly described as \"large concessions\". First, Section 7 (3) (B) of the Act of 2nd August 1963 concerns only nursery and primary education; the secondary and technical schools at Wemmel, Wezembeek-Oppem and Rhode-St. Gen\u00e8se follow the Flemish unilingual regime, as would those which would be opened at Kraainem, Drogenbos and Linkebeek. Even in the sphere of nursery and primary education, Section 7 (3) (B) is not satisfactory: it adopts the criterion of the maternal or usual language, which does not fully ensure freedom of choice for the parents and the severity of which is increased by a strict linguistic control. Moreover, local authorities often \"drag their feet\" in the opening of French classes in the six communes. Further still, Article 7 (3) (B) requires, for those classes, the teaching of Dutch for four hours a week in the second form at the primary level and eight hours in the third and fourth forms; \"teaching of the second language\" thus \"takes up more time\" than that of the first language, \"since only six hours of French\" are \"foreseen in Belgian primary school curricula\". This situation is the more \"extraordinary\" as teaching of French in the Dutch classes at Kraainem is optional (Section 7 (3) (A) of the Act of 2nd August 1963). In short, the Belgian Parliament is seeking to make the children \"comply\" with \"the demands of the ground\". Compelled to respect \"certain acquired rights which are strikingly obvious and of great importance\", it tolerates them only \"provisionally\" in order to \"do away with them as soon as possible\". In the final analysis, the French classes in Kraainem are nothing but \"instruments of depersonalisation\", \"intensive transmutation classes\". Accordingly the Applicants refuse to send their children to them; to benefit from \"a decent education in French\", the latter make \"long and expensive daily journeys to one of the 19 communes of Brussels\", at the cost of \"disruption in their private and family life\" and in that of their parents.",

The complaint based on the intensive teaching of Dutch in the French schools at Kraainem is also unjustified: the Commission finds it \"natural that a bilingual State such as Belgium should take steps, especially in bilingual areas, to ensure that its inhabitants know the country's two languages\"; \"at the most one might\", according to the Commission, \"find it surprising that, in the Dutch schools\" in Kraainem, \"the teaching of French is optional\". The obligation to learn \"the second language of the country\" is not an \"attack\" on the \"pupils personality and private life\": \"general education is given in French\" and parents in most cases have \"the means to ensure that their children acquire a good knowledge of their maternal language\". \"In any event\", the Applicants have not \"informed the Commission of any case in which there is no such possibility\".",

Certain rules relating to the status in issue seem to it to reflect \"the Belgian State's desire to ensure the maintenance of the Dutch-language\", indeed to assimilate \"minorities, against their wish, into the sphere of the regional language\". Eleven members of the Commission, however, believe that this does not result in any discrimination incompatible with Article 14 (art. 14). Seven of them consider it to be \"quite proper that the Act should enforce the teaching of Dutch in communes in which the Dutch language is spoken by a large proportion of the inhabitants, sometimes a majority\". As regards the absence, at Kraainem, of \"official or subsidised French education at secondary level\", this does not seem to these members of the Commission to be incompatible with Article 14 (art. 14): \"if it is agreed that the State's refusal to establish or subsidise primary education in French\" is not of a discriminatory nature, the same conclusion applies, a fortiori, \"to secondary education\". It is true that the State draws a distinction, in this respect, in a way detrimental to French-speaking pupils; this, however, represents \"a favour granted by the law to Flemish-speaking inhabitants\" and \"not a hardship interfering with enjoyment by the French-speaking population of the rights guaranteed by the Convention\". \"According to the information received by the Commission\", moreover, there is Dutch secondary education only in three of the communes referred to in Section 7 (1) of the Act of 2nd August 1963, namely, Wemmel, Wezembeek-Oppem and Rhode-St. Gen\u00e8se. Dutch-speaking parents living at Kraainem must also therefore send their children \"to schools at some distance\" if they wish them to receive secondary education; this situation does not in any way depend \"on the language question\". Four other members of the Commission likewise conclude, on different grounds, that the system in the six communes on the outskirts of  is not incompatible with the Convention. On the other hand, one member does not accept this conclusion. He is substantially of the opinion that the Kraainem Applicants remain \"although to a much lesser extent than before 1963\", \"victims of discrimination incompatible with Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention\". The Commission draws the attention of the Court to these different individual opinions.",

In so doing, the Act does not go outside limits drawn according to objective criteria and is based on a public interest. Furthermore, the establishment and maintenance of education conducted in French is possible in the communes concerned.

Before the Commission, the Belgian Government maintained that Section 17 of the Act of 30th July 1963, and in particular its fourth paragraph, violates neither Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2) nor Articles 8 and 14 (art. 8, art. 14) of the Convention. While its principal argument was that the Articles (P1-2, art. 8, art. 14) were totally inapplicable (cf. supra), it presented a series of subsidiary arguments. It observed, in the first place, that the criterion of the maternal or usual language is much more simple, flexible and liberal than the Applicants contend. A child whose language is French runs no risk of being denied admission to the French classes of Greater Brussels, even if he has begun his schooling in Flanders and in Dutch. In this respect, the Act of 30th July 1963 differs from that of 14th July 1932 on one point only: it creates \"two legal presumptions\" based respectively on \"the language in which the child was previously taught\" (second paragraph of Section 17) and on the language of the region where his parents live (fourth paragraph). These presumptions may, however, be \"rebutted by a declaration by the father of a family\". As regards the language inspectorate, it does not function with the strictness alleged by the Applicants; its objectivity is further guaranteed through the appeals provided for by the legislation in force (Section 18 of the Act of 30th July 1963, Royal Decree of 30th November 1966, on the functioning of the language inspectorate and Act of 23rd December 1946 creating a Conseil d'\u00c9tat in Belgium). Consequently abuses ascribable to \"punctilious officials\" occur only rarely. Moreover, the Applicants are not entitled to complain thereof to the Commission until they have \"sought a remedy\" before the competent \"national tribunal\".",

Moreover it emphasised that children whose mother tongue or usual language is, for example, German, rather than French or Dutch, \"can enrol in a French-language school in the Greater Brussels district as well as in a Dutch-language school\". It added that \"schools in the Greater Brussels district that provide some special education\" given in one language only may admit pupils whose mother tongue is not the language of instruction, even if their parents reside outside the district. It is sufficient, in such a case, that it is impossible for them to receive \"the education in question in their own linguistic region\" (Ministerial circular of 10th October 1963).",

The Commission, confirming before the Court the unanimous opinion formulated by it in this matter in its Report, considers that Section 17 of the Act of 30th July 1963 does not infringe any of the three Articles (P1-2, art. 8, art. 14) invoked by the Applicants. As far as concerns Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2) and Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, viewed in isolation, its opinion is based on considerations summarised above. Neither does the Commission think that Section 17 of the Act of 30th July 1963 involves, in this case, a discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 2 of the Protocol (art. 14+P1-2) or Article 8 (art. 14+8) of the Convention. It is true that it observes that the Dutch-speaking parents in Wallonia do not seem to send their children to the Greater Brussels district as frequently as French-speaking parents in Flanders; it sees here one of the proofs of the relative nature of the \"parallelism\" established by law between the two large linguistic areas. The fact that Dutch-speaking children \"are not admitted to French schools in \", and the existence of linguistic control, seem to the Commission to reflect \"the Belgian State's desire to ensure the maintenance of the Dutch language\". The Commission observes, however, that the Applicants including those of Vilvorde nowhere assert \"that any of their children have not been admitted to the French schools in \"; it concludes from this that \"they cannot claim to be victims of a discriminatory measure\".",

The Commission wonders whether the result is a simple \"legitimate distinction\" or in actual fact a \"discrimination\" incompatible with Article 14 (art. 14). Nevertheless the question does not seem to it \"to arise in specific terms in the cases before the Court, since the Applicants claim to be French-speaking and want their children to be instructed in French\".",

However the French section of the University was \"very nearly\" abolished in 1963 in the name of \"the principle of the absolute integrity of Flemish territory\"; this idea is said to have been given up only for practical and financial reasons and action aiming at the \"expulsion\" of the French section to Wallonia is now being pursued. The Applicants furthermore emphasise that at  and Heverlee there formerly existed a series of French classes including transmutation classes. The entry into force of the Act of 30th July 1963 brought about the disappearance of the majority of these classes.

They declare that they are almost all resident at , Heverlee or in other communes in the unilingual Flemish region, that they are not employees, students or professors at the  and that they are of Belgian nationality. They admit therefore that they do not comply with the various requirements laid down in Section 7 in fine of the Act of 30th July 1963. The language inspectorate carefully verifies the fulfilment of these conditions; one of the Applicants had personal experience of this. Consequently, Section 7 in fine of the Act of 30th July 1963 runs counter to the \"wishes of the Applicants\" from , \"to give their children a French education\". It brings about a situation \"all the more open to criticism since the Applicants\" use \"the French language\" exclusively or principally, and since \"they live in a region with a large French-speaking minority where a French school still exists to which they are denied access\". This last circumstance shows that it matters little, in this case, whether or not Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2) creates a positive obligation. In order to give their children the opportunity of pursuing their education in French, the Applicants are obliged either to engage in \"scholastic emigration\" or to leave ; the result is an infraction of the rights guaranteed by Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention. By opening French classes at  and Heverlee to certain foreign children and to those of the employees, students and professors of the University, the legislature has established \"schools for castes and privileged persons\". In general, Section 7 in fine of the Act of 30th July 1963 introduces a series of discriminations based not only on residence but also on sex (Institut du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur at Heverlee), language, belonging to a national or linguistic minority, nationality and profession. The  and Ghent Applicants (Applications Nos. 1691/62 and 1769/63) likewise complain that they cannot send their children to the French classes in the  urban area.",

It is true that it in no way prejudices the signatories of Application No. 1677/62 since they live at Kraainem; the Commission and the Belgian Government have not failed to make this point. In fact these Applicants above all attack other aspects of the system applicable to Drogenbos, Kraainem, Linkebeek, Rhode-St. Gen\u00e8se, Wemmel and Wezembeek-Oppem (cf. supra); nevertheless, they consider as abnormal a \"strictly territorialist\" provision which \"prevents children living on the other side of the street, that happens to lie within the administrative area of another commune\", from attending the schools in question. The Applicants from Alsemberg, Beersel, , ,  and Vilvorde are more directly affected. Thus the son of one of the counsel representing the Applicants from ,  and Vilvorde (Applications Nos. 1691/62, 1769/63 and 2126/64) lives at Tervueren, which is situated in the Dutch-language area but which is contiguous with Wezembeek-Oppem; the entry into force of the Act of 2nd August 1963 obliged him to withdraw his children from a French school at Wezembeek-Oppem, situated 150 metres from his home, and to send them every day to Brussels, about a dozen kilometres away. The Applicants consider that in this respect they are victims of violations of Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2) and Articles 8 and 14 (art. 8, art. 14) of the Convention, and in particular of a discrimination based on residence.",

While its principal argument was that the Articles were totally inapplicable (cf. supra), it presents several subsidiary arguments. It emphasises, in substance, that Section 7 in fine of the Act of 30th July 1963 and Section 7 \u00a7 3-B of the Act of 2nd August 1963 depart from the territorial principle only for very special reasons: namely to respond to the \"needs of the bilingual University of Louvain in the matter of teacher's training\" and to provide in the six communes assigned \"a special status\", certain facilities for the \"fairly large French-speaking minority\" which exists there. These justifications explain at the same time the restrictions to which the exceptions are subject. Why should the legislature permit the \"concessions\" made to French-speaking persons at Louvain and in the communes on the outskirts of Brussels to become \"the starting point for francisation of the Flemish populations in these and neighbouring communes\", when its \"avowable\" and \"legitimate\" purpose consists precisely in ensuring in Flanders the formation of Dutch-speaking \u00e9lites? The problems that arise in this matter are \"problems of degree\" and \"how far those exceptions should be extended is a question not of law but of policy\".  The opinion of the Commission is somewhat \"illogical and paradoxical\" as the violation found by the majority \"would disappear if the  simply withdrew the concessions\" mentioned above.",

Two members of the Commission reach the same conclusion by different reasoning while three others consider it \"incompatible with the first sentence of Article 2 (P1-2) (...) that the Belgian State should not allow French-speaking persons resident either in the unilingual Flemish region or in the area of the Brussels linguistic boundary to send their children to French schools in the vicinity\".

The latter would be \"entitled\" and \"prepared\" to \"admit pupils without taking their parents' place of residence into consideration at all\" but for the language legislation and the risk of losing their right to State subsidies. As regards the official schools, \"one can of course conceive that they might be reserved\", \"for administrative or financial reasons\", \"to children living in one of the communes\" where they exist. \"The information supplied both by the Applicants and by the Belgian Government\", however, shows the absence of such reasons. The \"residence conditions\" in question \"can only be explained by a desire to prevent\", in the Flemish region, \"the spread or continuance of the French language and culture\" if not to bring about even the assimilation of \"minorities into the language or their surroundings\". This intention is \"particularly manifest in the case of the French schools at Louvain and Heverlee\" where they admit \"children from Wallonia\" even though they refuse \"the children of French-speaking persons living\" on the spot. Consequently, it \"matters little that neither the Convention nor the Protocol obliges the State to establish or subsidise any education whatsoever\": \"in this case such education exists and, where it is private, it is subsidised\". The exclusion of the Applicants' children is, on analysis, a \"hardship\" and the Dutch-speaking children derive from it \"no advantage\". Would the simple abolition of French-language classes at , Heverlee, Drogenbos, Kraainem, Linkebeek, Rhode-St. Gen\u00e8se, Wemmel and Wezembeek-Oppem remove the discrimination in question? The Commission does not think it need consider this possibility, one of the effects of which would be to deprive the locality of Kraainem of a French school, a locality \"which has a French-speaking majority\": \"what may happen as the result of a change in legislation in the near or distant future\" does not concern the Commission. In any case it seems to the Commission \"rather unlikely that the Belgian Government would consider adopting such a radical solution\", which would probably be \"difficult\" to adopt in practice.",

From this the second paragraph draws a first set of consequences: it provides in substance that the six communes concerned enjoy a bilingual system \"in administrative matters\". As to the third paragraph, the compatibility of which with Articles 8 and 14 (art. 8, art. 14) of the Convention and with Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2) is contested by the Applicants, it applies to \"educational matters\". It provides that the language of instruction is Dutch in the six communes; it requires nevertheless, the organisation, for the benefit of children whose maternal or usual language is French, of official or subsidised education in French at the nursery and primary levels, on condition that it is asked for by sixteen heads of family. However, this education is not available to children whose parents live outside the communes under consideration. The Dutch classes in the same communes, on the other hand, in principle accept all children, whatever their maternal or usual language and place of residence of their parents.

Hence there are among those who appear before the Board, in addition to pupils who have completed their studies without conforming to the language laws, \"many persons, who are self-taught, have received an irregular education or have followed a correspondence course\".

The Applicants are of the opinion that although the provisions in force prior to the legislation of 1932 (Act of 12th May 1910) were \"eminently fair\" in this matter, the Act of 15th July 1932 violated and Section 19 of the Act of 30th July 1963 violates, on the point under consideration, Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2) and Articles 8 and 14 (art. 8, art. 14) of the Convention. In their view the refusal of homologation renders \"illusory\" and a \"hoax\" the sending of children to private French-language schools situated in Flanders as these schools deliver only \"a mere piece of parchment of no practical use\". It is true that employers are sometimes \"at a pinch\" satisfied with such a certificate; it also sometimes happens that pupils \"at boarding schools for girls\" are less concerned with getting a legally valid diploma than with acquiring \"a good education\". These are, however, \"extremely rare\" cases. \"In official organisations, the civil service, and local government\", only the legally recognised diploma counts, and this is \"an essential document\" in the career of everyone in . The Applicants do not dispute that the possession of a certificate without homologation is sufficient to allow access to \"non-recognised degrees\" as opposed to \"legally recognised\" or \"academic\" degrees. However the very existence of these two distinct degrees implies a difference in their value. The non-recognised degrees are of interest to almost no-one but foreigners. They are divided into two categories, the first comprising 118 degrees corresponding to certain of the 3469 legally recognised degrees, and the second \"degrees awarded for courses not covered by law\". The holder of a non-homologated certificate is not, in principle, admitted to technical education, higher level secondary commercial education and higher commercial studies, or \"the most attractive professions\", such as Bench and Bar, in general the civil service and local government, the medical and para-medical professions, etc. To the Belgian Government's objection that the Convention does not guarantee the right to exercise a profession, the Applicants replied that they are not invoking such a right but rather \"the freedom of the father of the family, the right to education, the right to respect for family life\" and the principle of non-discrimination. In their opinion, the refusal of homologation amounts to a \"penalty\" in disguise, to a \"punitive\" measure which condemns the \"dissident\" establishments to close down. It is not based on administrative or technical considerations relating, for example, to the \"value of the teaching\" or \"its conformity with the curriculum\", but is to be explained only by a deliberate wish to \"stamp out\" French in Flanders and to \"dutchify\"  and its surroundings. It thus assumes an arbitrary and discriminatory character. Effectively it condemns anyone who has \"received a French education in Flanders or a Flemish education in Wallonia\", to be a \"second class citizen\". \"The most flagrant\" discrimination is to be found \"at the international level\" for Belgium recognises the equivalence of secondary school leaving certificates conferred in a number of States with which it has concluded bilateral or multilateral agreements.",

The first may then \"obtain a legally recognised degree\", whereas the latter, even if he successfully pursues the \"same studies\" at university must be satisfied with a non-recognised (\"scientifique\") degree, unless \"he has passed a full examination before the Central Board in the language of his choice\". It is true that these rules apply equally to \"schooling completed in the Dutch language in an establishment in Wallonia\".

According to the Commission, this refusal also involves \"discrimination contrary to Article 14 (art. 14)\": \"there would be no serious administrative or financial difficulty in arranging for the inspection of schools in Dutch-speaking areas which provide education in French\" or of \"Flemish schools in the Walloon area\".

This is not a right of a group or a minority. It is a subjective right of every individual regardless of nationality, race, sex, language. In consequence, it is misleading to formulate the question, which the Court in this case has to decide as a question \"if the French in Flanders or the Flemish population in Wallonia have the right to claim education in their national language\". All languages hold the same position in regard to the freedom to education. That is expressly said in Article 14 (art. 14). The question before the Court is therefore in fact the following: has every individual person in  the right to claim education in his own national language \u2013 a Chinese, a Japanese, an American, a Portuguese? Or, if we accept the majority interpretation of the concept \"right to education\" as a \"right to access\": has every person on Belgian territory the same individual human right to access to all Belgian schools and educational institutions in the country, has a Chinese, a Japanese, an American, a Portuguese the same rights of access as the Belgian nationals themselves? Of course not. The fact that the beneficiaries of the right to education granted by the Convention are, so to say, every person on the earth, and the fact that the right is bestowed on all without distinction on any ground, must be taken seriously into consideration when deciding what the content of the \"right to education\" in the meaning of Article 2 (P1-2) really is. It goes almost without saying that this right cannot go further than to a freedom for the individual to choose the education he wants without interference by the State.

We must not forget that Europe, at the time when the Convention was adopted, had just gone through years of suppression of the freedom of the peoples, where governments used all sorts of means and pressure to nazify the youth, especially through the schools and youth organisations. It was an important aim of the Convention that this should not be repeated and that the freedom of education should be protected.

This shows that the majority view goes outside the scope of the Convention. The human rights granted are absolute rights, which cannot be the object of regulation by the separate States except where this is expressly stated in the Convention and under the conditions the Convention itself has laid down. In regard to the right to education the Convention has no such provision. It would also be a very dangerous road to embark upon if the articles of the Convention were to be interpreted in such a way as to allow the member States to regulate the human rights \"according to the needs and resources of the community\". Such an interpretation cannot be accepted. And even worse is the interpretation by the majority that the Convention \"implies a just balance between the protection of the general interest of the community and the respect due to fundamental human rights\".

This shows that if it really had been the meaning to introduce a positive obligation on the Contracting Parties, there necessarily must have been adopted some rules of regulation and limitation. Further, these rules must have been the same for all Parties to the Convention. But such rules were not even discussed. The reason is simple. The scholastic system of the member States is the internal, national concern of each of them: it is entirely outside the scope of the Convention. It was also during the Preparatory Works expressly pointed out that the Convention should not affect the internal scholastic organisation of States. This case also shows how meaningless it would be if the , referring only to Article 2 (P1-2) in its present form, should have competence to interfere with the organisation of the scholastic system of , which was adopted by the Belgian Parliament by a large majority of all groups of the country.

It follows that the concept of \"discrimination\" must be interpreted in the same way for all European States. We must find a \"European\" interpretation. It is for the Court after having interpreted the concept of discrimination in the Convention then to decide if in the concrete case a discrimination has taken place. This decision must be based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each separate case. It is of little help in this context to refer to \"the principles which normally prevail in democratic societies\" or to \"reasonable relationship of proportionality\" between means and aims. The decisive factor must always be the content of the Human Right in question. This right everyone shall enjoy in full \"without discrimination on any ground\".
