Germany, cited above). They were classified in domestic law as \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (mesures de s\u00fbret\u00e9) and the entire legislative history of the provisions showed that this term had been used from the outset. The Constitutional Council and the Court of Cassation had also confirmed that these measures did not have the nature of a sanction ... Moreover, in the Government\u2019s opinion, this classification corresponded to the purpose and nature of the measures. They sought to \u201cimprove the medical and judicial treatment of offenders suffering from mental disorders or presenting a danger\u201d (National Assembly, report in respect of the draft Law on preventive detention and declarations of criminal insanity, 12 December 2007), to guarantee the safety of others and to prevent disorder. The Government pointed out that, unlike a penalty, the measures did not have a punitive function but were preventive and remedial, a purpose that could be clearly seen from the very wording of Article 706-135 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thus, in the present case, the compulsory hospitalisation had been ordered in the light of two psychiatric assessments showing the applicant\u2019s impaired discernment and the Investigation Division had justified the measure by his mental disorders which \u201crepresented a risk for the safety of others and required long-term care in hospital\u201d. Those measures sought not to punish but to prevent a new offence from being committed and to protect society \u2013 this being, in the Government\u2019s submission, a Convention imperative reiterated on several occasions (they cited Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, ECHR\u00a02002VIII).

Unlike the situation in the case of M. v. Germany, the present case thus did not concern a prison sentence of unlimited duration. Admission to a specialised institution, like the other measures covered by Article 706-36, were strictly regulated. In contrast to penalties, they were temporary in nature and could be altered or lifted in the course of their implementation if the underlying reasons had disappeared. The lifting of such measures was conditional upon the result of a psychiatric assessment, thus demonstrating their remedial and preventive purpose. Lastly, the Government emphasised that any failure to fulfil the obligations resulting from these measures did not entail the activation of a suspended sentence, as in the case of a penalty, but would constitute a separate offence.",

In that connection the Court notes at the outset that these measures were ordered by the Investigation Division after that court had declared the applicant criminally insane. While the Court has previously found that a lack of criminal liability declared by an Assize Court did not prevent the person concerned from relying on his victim status to assert his right to a fair trial under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see G. v. France, no. 27244/09, \u00a7 46, 23\u00a0February 2012), it should be pointed out that, under Article 7 \u00a7 1, the existence of a penalty will depend on whether the measure has been imposed after a criminal conviction. In the present case, the Court observes that the Investigation Division delivered a judgment in which it declared, first, that there was sufficient evidence that the applicant had committed the offences as charged and, secondly, that he lacked criminal liability by reason of a mental disorder which had impaired his discernment and his ability to control his actions. That court went on to explain that \u201c[t]he declaration of the existence of sufficient evidence that the person ha[d] committed the offence as charged [did] not constitute a conviction but a finding that there [was] a factual situation which could have legal consequences ...\u201d (see paragraph 12 above). The Constitutional Council had previously considered that a \u201cdeclaration of the existence of sufficient evidence that the person ha[d] committed the offence as charged\u201d did not constitute an \u201cassessment as to the commission of the offence\u201d and that \u201cthe decision to declare a person criminally insane could not be characterised as a sanction\u201d (... unlike the measure of preventive detention \u201cfollowing conviction by a court\u201d, ..., and contrast, for example, the case of Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, ECHR 2006IV, where the applicant had alleged that his conviction for repeat offending was based on a retrospective application of the criminal legislation, contrary to Article 7 of the Convention).",

The measure was thus imposed in the present case to enable the applicant, who was admitted to a specialised hospital and not an ordinary prison (contrast M. v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012729, where the Court observed that such care in specialised institutions served the purpose of crime prevention) to receive treatment and at the same time to prevent him from reoffending. The Court further notes that, as indicated in Articles\u00a0706135, D. 47-29-1 and D. 47-29-3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the mechanism of compulsory hospitalisation is identical to that of admission to psychiatric treatment on the decision of the State\u2019s representative in a given d\u00e9partement (see, for example, Patoux v.\u00a0France, no. 35079/06, \u00a7 45, 14 April 2011). It also observes that a request for the lifting of the hospitalisation measure may be submitted at any time to the liberties and detention judge, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Health Code (Article D. 4729-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, ...). That judge will then give a ruling based on the opinion of a board made up of two psychiatrists and a representative of the hospital staff treating the patient and after receiving two psychiatric assessment reports. The Court infers from the above that the measure of compulsory hospitalisation, for a duration that is not pre-determined, has a preventive and remedial function, without being punitive in nature, and that this measure does not constitute a sanction. The Court has not noted, in this connection, any indication on the part of the applicant which could persuade it to regard such a measure as a penalty. Merely from the letter sent by the Prefect to the doctors of the hospital in which he was placed (see paragraph 16 above) it can be seen, in particular, that his condition had evolved and that the danger he presented was being assessed regularly. Moreover, the applicant failed to show that he had applied to the liberties and detention judge for the lifting of the measure.",

The Court notes that, under Article D. 47-29-6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, those measures can be ordered only if they are necessary to prevent the person declared criminally insane from reoffending, to ensure the protection of that person or of the victim or the victim\u2019s family, or to put an end to any public disorder ... Such measures are decided following a psychiatric assessment and must not prevent the person concerned from continuing to receive treatment. The Court further notes that while these measures are limited in time \u2013 thus making them penalties according to the applicant \u2013 the person concerned is entitled to apply to the liberties and detention judge for the measures to be lifted or altered and the decision will be taken on the basis of a psychiatric assessment (Article 706-137 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, ...). The Court is thus persuaded that the ordering of the impugned measures and the judicial review of their application had a preventive function. The applicant has not, moreover, adduced any concrete evidence to indicate that those measures served the purpose of punishing him. He did not show that he had applied to the judge, nor therefore that the judge had refused to take account of the evolution in his mental health and to draw the requisite conclusions. Lastly, the Court notes that, while the applicant would be liable for a two-year prison sentence and a fine in the event of non-compliance with the impugned measures, fresh proceedings would then have to be brought (see, mutatis mutandis, Gardel, cited above, \u00a7 44) and the sanctions would apply, under Article 706-139 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, \u201csubject to the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 122-1 of the Criminal Code\u201d, in other words they would only be applicable to persons who, at the time of their failure to comply with the prohibitions, were criminally liable for their actions ...",

In the case at hand, likewise, the State pretends that the indefinite forced incarceration in a mental hospital is for the benefit of the applicant. The gist of this beneficial assistance (parens patriae) theory is that there is no conflict between the interests of the State and the interests of the person \u201cbenefitting\u201d from this incarceration. In my opinion, the Court should look behind these appearances. These cases also make it patent that the boundary between the act and the being of the actor is fuzzy.",

There are a number of cases in our jurisprudence that testify to this (see for example the recent case of Zaichenko v. Ukraine (no. 2), no.\u00a045797/09, 26 February 2015). On top of that, the duration of this incarceration is, in contradistinction to ordinary penal imprisonment, without the time-limit that otherwise applies to every criminal penalty.
