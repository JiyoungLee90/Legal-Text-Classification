There is no explicit right in the Convention to a clean and quiet environment, but where an individual is directly and seriously affected by noise or other pollution, an issue may arise under Article 8 (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a036022/97, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2003VIII; Kyrtatos v. Greece, no.\u00a041666/98, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR 2003VI; and Fadeyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a055723/00, \u00a7\u00a068, ECHR\u00a02005IV).\u00a0Furthermore, the adverse effects of the environmental pollution must attain a certain minimum level if they are to fall within the scope of Article 8 (see, among other authorities, L\u00f3pez Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 303C). The assessment of that minimum is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance, and its physical or psychological effects.\u00a0There would be no arguable claim under Article 8 if the detriment complained of was negligible in comparison to the environmental hazards inherent to life in every modern city (see Dzemyuk v. Ukraine, no. 42488/02, \u00a7 78, 4\u00a0September 2014). Conversely, severe environmental pollution may affect individuals\u2019 well-being and prevent them from enjoying their homes in such a way as to affect their private and family life adversely, without, however, seriously endangering their health (see L\u00f3pez Ostra, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051, and T\u0103tar v.

The same concerns possible worsening of the quality of life caused by the industrial pollution. \u201cQuality of life\u201d is a subjective characteristic which hardly lends itself to a precise definition (see Ledyayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 53157/99, 53247/99, 53695/00 and 56850/00, \u00a7\u00a090, 26 October 2006, and Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine, no.\u00a030499/03, \u00a7\u00a079, 10 February 2011). It follows that, taking into consideration the evidentiary difficulties involved, the Court will have regard primarily, although not exclusively, to the findings of the domestic courts and other competent authorities in establishing the factual circumstances of the case. As a basis for the analysis it may use, among other things, individual decisions taken by the authorities with respect to the applicants\u2019 particular situation and the environmental studies commissioned by the authorities (see Dubetska and Others, cited above, \u00a7 107, with further references). However, the Court cannot rely blindly on the decisions of the domestic authorities, especially if they are obviously inconsistent or contradict each other. In such situations it has to assess the evidence in its entirety (see Ledyayeva and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7 90).",

The Court observes that this complaint was not included in the initial application but was raised in the applicants\u2019 observations of 26 November 2007 and refers to correspondence with the relevant authorities from 26 September 2007 onwards, more than two years after they had lodged their application. Consequently, the Court considers that this complaint was not specified or elaborated early enough to allow for an exchange of observations between the parties on the subject. It finds that, in the circumstances of the case, it is not appropriate to examine the matter separately at this stage in the proceedings (see Nuray \u015een v. Turkey (no. 2), no. 25354/94, \u00a7\u00a0200, 30\u00a0March 2004).",

The Court further reiterates that in the absence of any additional financial documents confirming that the relevant financial transaction has actually, truly occurred, mere billing requests from lawyers cannot normally be taken as a proof that the legal costs and expenses claimed have \u201cactually and necessarily\u201d been incurred by the applicants themselves (see Tchankotadze v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 15256/05, \u00a7\u00a0134, 21 June 2016). In the present case, however, the Court takes note of the detailed and credible itemisation of the hours spent by the respective lawyers from GYLA and EHRAC, and further observes that in a number of Georgian cases it has found that the teamwork of the lawyers from these two NGOs in proceedings before the Court could not be left uncompensated and that similar evidence of the lawyers\u2019 work was acceptable proof of the expenses incurred by the applicants\u2019 representatives (see Klaus and Iouri Kiladz\u00e9 v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 7975/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09194, 2 February 2010, and Tsintsabadze v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 35403/06, \u00a7\u00a0105, 15\u00a0February 2011).
