A State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes. It follows from the independence of the legal profession from the State that the conduct of the defence is essentially a matter between a defendant and his counsel, whether appointed under a legal-aid scheme or financed privately. The relevant national authorities are required under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a03 (c) to intervene only if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective legal assistance is manifest, or is brought sufficiently to their attention in another way (ibid).",

If a lawyer is unable to confer with his client and receive confidential instructions from him without such surveillance, his assistance loses much of its usefulness, whereas the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective (see Sakhnovskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a097). Restrictions may be imposed on contact between an accused and his lawyer if good cause exists (see \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a046221/99, \u00a7 133, ECHR 2005IV). The Court reiterates that there are inherent time and place constraints on meetings between a detained person and his lawyer. Any limitation on relations between clients and lawyers, whether inherent or express, should not thwart the effective legal assistance to which a defendant is entitled (see Orlov v. , no. 29652/04, \u00a7 106, 21 June 2011).",

Under the commonly recognised rules of court procedure, such an error of law (a most serious procedural omission) itself constitutes a basis for annulment of the lower court\u2019s decision, without any additional conditions.
