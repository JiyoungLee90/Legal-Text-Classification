However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody or in the army, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention or service. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see, among many other authorities, Anguelova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a038361/97, \u00a7\u00a7 109-11, ECHR 2002-IV).",

Moreover, the applicant did not claim that Z.B. had been suffering from any mental troubles or psychological illness. It was also confirmed by post-mortem psychiatric and psychological report no. 19 dated 1 February 2010 that Z.B. had not suffered from any mental disorder, but that he had probably been in a state of depression before his death.",

The Court also points out that under Rule 60 of the Rules of Court any claim for just satisfaction must be itemised and submitted in writing together with the relevant supporting documents or vouchers, failing which the Chamber may reject the claim in whole or in part. However, in the present case the applicant failed to produce any documentary evidence showing that the costs of legal representation claimed were actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. Moreover, unlike the cases in which the applicants were able to produce a contract for legal services, according to which, the amounts due were to be paid in the event that the Court found a violation of the applicants\u2019 rights (see Pirali Orujov v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a08460/07, \u00a7\u00a7 72-75, 3 February 2011, and Rizvanov v.
