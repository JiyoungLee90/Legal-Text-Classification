He noted that it transpired from their statements and other material in the file that their allegations did not correspond to the reality.

As regards the overseer who had been responsible for the shots, it took the view that he had not intended to kill those who were attacked in the incident and that he had been trying to make them move away so that the newly recruited workers would not be approached by them. As to N.V., it acquitted him on the ground that it had not been established that he was one of the workers\u2019 employers (and therefore that he was obliged to pay them their wages) or that he had been involved as an instigator of the armed attack against them.

The Assize Court also noted that it transpired from the testimony of the workers that, during their free time, they were able to move freely around the region, do their shopping in shops which operated by agreement with the defendants, play cricket and take part in an association set up by their compatriots. It added that it had not been shown that T.A. had, under false pretences and by means of promises, coerced the workers into agreeing to work for him by taking advantage of their situation of vulnerability, especially as it found that they were not in such a situation.",

On that point, it explained that the conditions had not led the complainants to live in a state of exclusion from the outside world, without any possibility for them to abandon this relationship and look for another job. It further noted that the workers had been in a position to negotiate their conditions of employment at the time of their recruitment and that their unlawful presence in Greece had not been used by their employers as a means of coercion to force them to continue working.",

It added that the victim would be exploited, as a result of his vulnerability, if he unconditionally submitted himself to the offender and was cut off from the outside world, which in the court\u2019s view was not the case here since: (a) the relations between the workers and their employers had been governed by a binding employment relationship, and (b) its conditions were not intended to trap the workers or to lead to their domination by the employers, such that the workers might be cut off from the outside world and find it impossible to withdraw from the employment relationship and find another job.

The fact of fearing for their lives would have prevailed over any other consideration (such as: their unpaid wage demands; their need to earn a living, which allegedly could not have been satisfied in view of the objective inability to find another job; and all the other arguments that the workers had put forward to justify the fact that they had continued to work).",

The Court of Cassation held that acts of unlawful violence, threats, blackmail and forcible confinement constituted the means of committing the crime of trafficking in human beings, and that the principle whereby such acts are subsumed under that crime prevailed over the principle of the concurrence of offences. As to the mental element of the offence, the Court of Cassation held that the perpetrator must have acted with malicious intent. It stated that the existence of that intent stemmed from the knowledge and willingness of the perpetrator to recruit, transport, take away, assist or unlawfully confine a person by means of the use of force or threats, and for the purpose of exploiting that person\u2019s work. In its view, such exploitation obtained where the victim provided his work either directly for the benefit of the perpetrator of the offence or for the benefit of third parties who would remunerate the latter, and recklessness was not sufficient.",

The work of the ILO supervisory bodies has served to clarify both of these elements. The penalty does not need to be in the form of penal sanctions, but may also take the form of a loss of rights and privileges. Moreover, the menace of a penalty can take many different forms. Arguably, its most extreme form involves physical violence or restraint, or even death threats addressed to the victim or relatives. There can also be subtler forms of menace, sometimes of a psychological nature. Situations examined by the ILO have included threats to denounce victims to the police or immigration authorities when their employment status is illegal, or denunciation to village elders in the case of girls forced to prostitute themselves in distant cities. Other penalties can be of a financial nature, including economic penalties linked to debts. Employers sometimes also require workers to hand over their identity papers, and may use the threat of confiscation of these documents in order to exact forced labour.",

Here too, there can be many subtle forms of coercion. Many victims enter forced labour situations initially out of their own choice, albeit through fraud and deception, only to discover later that they are not free to withdraw their labour, owing to legal, physical or psychological coercion.

In particular it observed that, in certain circumstances, a service \u2018could not be treated as having been voluntarily accepted beforehand\u2019. It therefore held that consent of the person concerned was not sufficient to rule out forced labour.

However, while someone may wish employment, and possibly be willing to engage in prostitution, that does not mean that they consent to be subjected to abuse of all kinds. For that reason Article 4(b) provides that there is trafficking in human beings whether or not the victim consents to be exploited.\u201d",

In order for a positive obligation to take operational measures to arise in the circumstances of a particular case, it must be demonstrated that the State authorities were aware, or ought to have been aware, of circumstances giving rise to a credible suspicion that an identified individual had been, or was at real and immediate risk of being, trafficked or exploited within the meaning of Article 3 (a) of the Palermo Protocol and Article 4 (a) of the Anti-Trafficking Convention.

To be effective, the investigation must be independent from those implicated in the events. It must also be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in all cases, but where it is possible to remove the individual concerned from a harmful situation, the investigation must be carried out as a matter of urgency.

It refers to its relevant case-law in which it has already accepted that human trafficking falls within the scope of Article 4 of the Convention (see, in particular, Rantsev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 272-82). Admittedly, the present case does not concern sexual exploitation as in the Rantsev case. However, exploitation through work also constitutes an aspect of human trafficking and the Greek courts examined the case from this perspective. This aspect can be clearly seen from Article\u00a04 (a) of the Council of Europe\u2019s Anti-Trafficking Convention, which provides in particular that \u201c[e]xploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs\u201d (see paragraph 42 above). In other words, exploitation through work is one of the forms of exploitation covered by the definition of human trafficking, and this highlights the intrinsic relationship between forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking (see also paragraphs 85-86 and 89-90 of the Explanatory Report accompanying the Anti-Trafficking Convention, paragraph 43 above). The same idea is clearly reflected in Article\u00a0323A of the Criminal Code, which was applied in the present case (see paragraph 33 above).",

However, the Court takes the view that restriction of freedom of movement is not a prerequisite for a situation to be characterised as forced labour or even human trafficking.

On this point the Court reiterates its finding that Patras Assize Court adopted a narrow interpretation of the concept of trafficking, relying on elements specific to servitude in order to avoid characterising the applicants\u2019 situation as trafficking (see paragraph 100 above).

They considered that the unpaid wages had a causal link with the alleged violation of Article 4 of the Convention: in their view, the human trafficking and forced labour suffered by them were linked to a failure by the State to take preventive measures in this regard and that the lack of compensation was linked to a failure by the State to ensure punishment for forced labour and to protect the victims.",

They added that they had been targeted by gunfire during the above-mentioned incident and, for some, had been injured on that occasion, as well as being deprived of their wages and any effective protection.

The Court has no doubt that the applicants sustained pecuniary damage as a result of the non-payment of their wages by their employers and the decision of Patras Assize Court not to find them guilty of trafficking. The Court therefore considers it appropriate to grant them compensation in this connection. However, as the case stands, the Court is unable to determine a specific sum to be awarded to each of them. Ruling on an equitable basis, the Court awards to each of the applicants who participated in the Assize Court proceedings, in respect of the pecuniary and non-pecuniary sustained by them, the sum of EUR 16,000, and to each of the other applicants EUR 12,000, plus any tax that may be chargeable.",
