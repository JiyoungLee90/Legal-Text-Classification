The case originated in an application (no. 76607/13) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Greek national, Mr Konstantinos Bikas (“the applicant”), on 28 November 2013.
The applicant was represented by Mr W.L. Weh, a lawyer practising in Bregenz (Austria). The German Government (“the Government”) were represented by one of their Agents, Mrs K. Behr, of the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection.
The applicant alleged that the presumption of innocence under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention had been breached in the criminal proceedings against him, in which the courts, when setting his sentence, had taken into consideration as an aggravating element further offences of which he had not been convicted.
On 21 March 2016 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government of the Hellenic Republic were informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 of the Rules of Court) but they did not indicate that they wished to exercise that right.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Leipzig.
On 30 October 2009 the Munich II Public Prosecution Office charged the applicant with coercion to engage in sexual activity in at least 300 cases and with sexual coercion in another eighteen cases.
On 20 July 2012 the Munich II Regional Court, after taking evidence at seventeen days of hearing, issued a decision limiting the prosecution to charges concerning four incidents which had taken place between 19 and 25 August 2007. The court provisionally discontinued the proceedings in respect of all the other offences the applicant had been charged with (see paragraph 7 above), in accordance with Article 154 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 17 below), in view of the penalty the applicant could expect for the four remaining incidents. The applicant was further informed that if he was convicted the court could take into account findings made in respect of the other incidents when setting his sentence.
In a judgment delivered on the same day, the Regional Court convicted the applicant of four counts of coercion to engage in sexual activity, committed between 19 and 25 August 2007, and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment.
In its findings of fact, the Regional Court stated that between January 2001 and October 2007 the applicant had forced P., aged between 29 and 35 at the relevant time and suffering from a moderate mental disorder and an autistic and speech disorder, to satisfy him manually or orally on at least fifty further occasions (out of the at least 300 offences the applicant had initially been charged with, see paragraph 7 above). The court had regard to P.’s extensive description of different incidents, which happened either in the house the applicant and P. were both living in or in the applicant’s car. P. had notably explained how the applicant had regularly, when his wife and son were absent, brought her into his apartment or in the basement boiler room, had undressed himself and had instructed her how to satisfy him, partly while playing pornographic films. The applicant had systematically threatened P. that she would have to return to a home for the disabled if she did not comply with his requests. From 19 to 25 August 2007, when the applicant’s wife and son were on holiday, the applicant had forced P. to satisfy him orally at least twice and to satisfy him manually on two further occasions in their house or in the basement boiler room. The veracity of P.´s consistent statements was confirmed by further witnesses and three psychological expert opinions on P.´s credibility and ability to testify.
The Regional Court explained that it had restricted the conviction to the four events that had taken place between 19 and 25 August 2007. It had discontinued the proceedings in respect of the at least 300 further charges under Article 154 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but was convinced that in at least fifty cases there had been incidents comparable to the four of which the applicant was formally convicted. It had simply been impossible to determine their exact time and place due to the victim’s speech disorder.
In the impugned passages of the judgment, the Regional Court found as follows:
“The chamber is convinced on the basis of the credible statement by the injured party that in addition to the four cases between January 2001 and October 2007 on which judgment was passed, at least 50 other comparable cases occurred. The injured party herself said that the applicant had coerced her to perform sexual acts from as early as 2001. From 2003, the frequency of these incidents had increased and the applicant had demanded sexual gratification from her approximately every 1½ weeks. Even if one were to disregard the years 2001 and 2002 and August and October 2007 in favour of the applicant and also to presume that from 2003 onwards, such incidents occurred only once a month there are 56 cases. Following the deduction of a further safety margin the chamber assumes that there were at least 50 more, comparable cases during the total period from January 2001 to October 2007.
...
On the other hand, the chamber considers as an aggravating element that it is convinced that, in addition to the four incidents in August 2007 which the accused has been convicted of, there have been at least 50 comparable incidents since January 2001. A conviction for those events was only made impossible by the victim’s incapacity to substantiate them in terms of the time and the place where they happened in a manner making it possible to define them as procedural offences (offences in the procedural sense). As it could no longer be determined with certainty in which cases the accused, by his threats, made the victim satisfy him orally or manually, the chamber will proceed on the basis that there were 50 further cases of manual satisfaction.”
(“Die Kammer ist aufgrund der glaubhaften Aussage der Geschädigten davon überzeugt, dass es neben den vier abgeurteilten Taten im Zeitraum Januar 2001 bis Oktober 2007 zu mindestens 50 weiteren, vergleichbaren Fällen kam. Die Geschädigte selbst gab an, der Angeklagte habe sie bereits ab dem Jahr 2001 zu sexuellen Handlungen genötigt. Ab dem Jahr 2003 sei die Frequenz dieser Vorfälle gestiegen und der Angeklagte habe ungefähr alle 1 ½ Wochen sexuelle Befriedigung von ihr verlangt. Selbst wenn man zugunsten des Angeklagten die Jahr 2001 und 2002 sowie den August und Oktober 2007 unberücksichtigt lässt und zudem davon ausgeht, dass es ab dem Jahr 2003 lediglich einmal im Monat zu derartigen Vorfällen kam, so ergeben sich 56 Fälle. Nach Abzug eines weiteren Sicherheitsabschlags geht die Kammer von mindestens 50 weiteren, vergleichbaren Fällen im gesamten Zeitraum von Januar 2001 bis Oktober 2007 aus.
...
Andererseits wertet die Kammer zu Lasten des Angeklagten den Umstand, dass es nach Überzeugung der Kammer neben den verurteilten vier Vorfällen im August 2007 bereits ab Januar 2001 zu mindestens 50 vergleichbaren Vorfällen gekommen war. Eine Verurteilung dieser Vorfälle scheiterte lediglich an der mangelnden Fähigkeit der Geschädigten, die Vorfälle zeitlich und örtlich so zu konkretisieren, dass diese als prozessuale Taten abgrenzbar waren. Da sich nicht mehr mit Sicherheit aufklären ließ, in welchen Fällen der Angeklagte die Geschädigte durch seine Drohung zu einer oralen und in welchen zu einer manuellen Befriedigung brachte, geht die Kammer insoweit von 50 weiteren Fällen der manuellen Befriedigung aus.”)
In an appeal on points of law to the Federal Court of Justice, the applicant complained that the Regional Court had breached the presumption of innocence guaranteed by Article 6 § 2 of the Convention by taking fifty unproven incidents into account as an aggravating factor meriting a more severe sentence, despite the fact that the proceedings in relation to them had been discontinued under Article 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The Federal Public Prosecutor General argued that the Regional Court had been entitled to take account of the sexual offences committed previously by the applicant as an aggravating element as part of his previous history (Vorleben) and thus as one of the elements in setting his sentence under Article 46 § 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 18 below). In accordance with the Federal Court of Justice’s case-law, the Regional Court had made sufficient findings of fact establishing a minimum level of guilt in respect to those offences.
On 6 February 2013 the Federal Court of Justice dismissed the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded, without giving specific reasons.
In a decision of 16 May 2013, which was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 28 May 2013, the Federal Constitutional Court, without giving reasons, declined to consider a constitutional complaint by the applicant, in which he had again complained of a breach of the presumption of innocence (file no. 2 BvR 575/13).
Article 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure contains rules on the partial termination of a prosecution in cases in which several offences are at issue. The provision, which serves to simplify and speed up criminal proceedings (compare, inter alia, Federal Court of Justice, file no. 2 StR 271/05, decision of 11 October 2006, § 8) reads, in so far as relevant:
“(1)  The public prosecution office may dispense with prosecuting an offence:
if the penalty ... which might result from the prosecution is not particularly significant in addition to any penalty ... imposed upon the accused in a final decision for another offence or which he can expect for another offence, or
...
(2)  If charges have already been preferred, the court, upon an application by the public prosecution office, may provisionally discontinue the proceedings at any stage.
...
(4)  If the proceedings have been provisionally discontinued on account of a penalty ... which is to be expected for another offence, the proceedings may be resumed, unless barred by limitation in the meantime, within three months of the judgment imposed for the other offence becoming final.
(5)  If the court has provisionally discontinued the proceedings, a court order shall be required for their resumption.”
Article 46 of the Criminal Code on the principles of sentencing, in so far as relevant, provides:
“(2)  When sentencing, the court shall weigh the circumstances in favour of and against the offender. Consideration shall in particular be given to
...
the offender’s previous history (Vorleben), his personal and financial circumstances;
...”
Under well-established Federal Court of Justice case-law the criminal courts can take into account offences for which proceedings have been discontinued under Article 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as an aggravating element in the sentencing process. That can happen on condition that the existence of the offences has been established at trial to the satisfaction of the court in accordance with the law on criminal procedure (see file no. 2 StR 230/90, judgment of 30 November 1990, §§ 11-12; file no. 1 StR 631/94, decision of 10 November 1994, § 2; file no. 2 StR 118/95, decision of 7 April 1995, § 16; file no. 5 StR 143/00, decision of 2 August 2000, § 4; and file no. 5 StR 425/12, decision of 12 September 2012, § 3). This means that, even if it is not required to make findings of fact which are as precise as the findings in relation to the offences of which the person concerned is convicted, the further incidents must have been established in a sufficiently precise manner which allows for their gravity to be assessed. The sentencing may not be based on a mere suspicion that further criminal offences have been committed (see file no. 3 StR 179/95, decision of 12 May 1995, § 3; 3 StR 251/09, decision of 2 July 2009, § 3; and file no. 5 StR 425/12, cited above, § 3).
Having regard also to the Court’s case-law, the Federal Constitutional Court has reiterated that the presumption of innocence, which derives from the principle of the rule of law, prohibits the taking of measures against a defendant in criminal proceedings which amounts to treating him as guilty without that guilt having been proved in a procedure prescribed by law (see file nos. 2 BvR 589/79, 2 BvR 740/81 and 2 BvR 284/85, decision of 26 March 1987, § 36; file no. 2 BvR 254/88 and 2 BvR 1343/88, decision of 29 May 1990, §§ 33 and 41; and file no. 2 BvR 366/10, decision of 5 April 2010, § 6). Once a defendant has properly been proved guilty of a particular criminal offence, the presumption of innocence no longer applies in relation to allegations about the accused’s character as part of the sentencing process when having regard to the accused’s previous history for the purposes of Article 46 § 2 of the Criminal Code, unless the allegations are of such a nature and degree as to amount to the bringing of a new charge within the autonomous meaning of that notion in the European Convention on Human Rights (see file no. 2 BvR 366/10, cited above, §§ 7 and 9).
According to the Federal Constitutional Court, the reasoning of a criminal court’s decision may breach the presumption of innocence, particularly if proceedings for an offence have been discontinued but the defendant has nevertheless been considered guilty of the offence without the proceedings prescribed by law to establish his or her guilt having been conducted (see file nos. 2 BvR 589/79 and others, cited above, § 42 with further references; for a summary of that decision see also Englert v. Germany, 25 August 1987, § 22, Series A no. 123; and file no. 2 BvR 254/88 and 2 BvR 1343/88, cited above, §§ 39 and 51). However, if a trial has been conducted and has reached the stage at which a verdict can be delivered (Schuldspruchreife), the criminal court, if it considers it established that the defendant is guilty, is not precluded from making a statement to that effect in a decision discontinuing proceedings in respect of the offence in question (see file nos. 2 BvR 589/79 and others, cited above, § 43, and file no. 2 BvR 254/88 and 2 BvR 1343/88, cited above, § 40).
Under the Federal Constitutional Court’s case-law, it is essential for rebutting the presumption of innocence in respect of criminal offences that the accused’s defence rights as laid down in the Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention were respected in the criminal proceedings with regard to these offences, that is, that the accused was informed of the nature of the accusations in this respect (Article 6 § 3 (a)), had adequate time and facilities to prepare his defence (Article 6 § 3 (b)) and that the principle against self-incrimination under Article 6 was respected (see file no. 2 BvR 366/10, cited above, §§ 10-13). Once this has been done and the criminal court is persuaded that the accused committed the acts in question in proceedings which reached the stage at which a verdict can be delivered, the presumption of innocence is considered as rebutted. The accused is then considered as having “properly been proved guilty” of the criminal offences in question, as required by the European Court of Human Rights (reference was made to Böhmer v. Germany, no. 37568/97, § 55, 3 October 2002), even if he or she was not (and in certain circumstances could not be) convicted of these offences under domestic law in the proceedings at issue (compare file nos. 2 BvR 589/79 and others, cited above, §§ 42-43 –proceedings discontinued on account of insignificant guilt; and file no. 2 BvR 366/10, cited above, §§ 7, 8 and 10 et seq. – acts committed prior to the offences with which the accused was charged in the proceedings taken into account in the sentencing process).
Following a leading decision of 3 May 1994 of the Federal Court of Justice (Grand Chamber, file nos. GSSt 2/93 and GSSt 3, 93, published in the official reports, BGHSt, volume 40, pp. 138-168), serial offences, in particular sexual offences, committed repeatedly in a similar manner in accordance with the perpetrator’s intention, could in practice no longer be prosecuted as one continuous offence (fortgesetztes Delikt). The Federal Court of Justice found that, in particular, considerations of procedural economy were not sufficient to justify that several acts, each of which constituted an offence, should be considered as only one – continuous – act and offence.
The Federal Court of Justice found that notably in the context of repeated sexual offences, it was not sufficient for convicting a person to estimate the minimum number of comparable offences based on the victim’s statement on the average frequency of these offences, despite the recurring difficulties in making sufficiently concrete findings in respect of such offences. It was necessary for the trial court to be convinced of each individual offence in a series of offences. This criterion would be met if the court was convinced that in a specific period of time there had been a certain minimum number of individualised offences (see file no. 3 StR 518/95, decision of 27 March 1996, BGHSt, volume 42, pp. 107112, and file no. 5 StR 169/08, decision of 9 June 2008, NSTZ-RR 2008, p. 338 with further references).
