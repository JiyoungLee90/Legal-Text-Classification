In the present context, it is therefore more pertinent to recall the Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that mistakes solely attributable to State authorities should in principle not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned, especially where no other conflicting private interest is at stake (see, mutatis mutandis, Platakou v.
