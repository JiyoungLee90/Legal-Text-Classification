To this end, the wound-up company (or its appointed manager) must capitalise the funds needed for compensating the damage in future and transfer it to State social security. The Law on Insolvency (bankruptcy) states: 'On the individual's consent, his claim to the debtor in the amount of capitalised instalments passes to the State. In this case, the claim is also paid first' (article 135, part 3 of the Law). Hence, when the enforcement proceedings were discontinued on 20 May 2003, the applicant's rights were protected by domestic means.
