In rebutting this argument the Court refers to section 276 of the Criminal Procedure Law (see paragraph\u00a022 above) which provides a competence of the national court to decide on the detention upon its own initiative. Notwithstanding the applicant\u2019s earlier requests to change the preventive measure it does not appear that the national courts had acted in compliance with the respective provision of the CPL with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see Mooren, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072). As a consequence, observing that the alleged violation resulted from interpretation of a legal provision which, in its content, is not unconstitutional, the procedure of an individual constitutional complaint therefore cannot serve as an effective remedy (see Savi\u010ds v. Latvia, no.\u00a017892/03, \u00a7\u00a0113, 27 November 2012, and Liep\u0101jnieks v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a037586/06, \u00a7\u00a073, 2\u00a0November\u00a02010). In addition, noting that the Government has suggested that several provisions, both from the old Code of Criminal Procedure and the Criminal Procedure Law could be subjected to a constitutional review, the Court has already ruled that a constitutional review of broad range of legal provisions cannot be considered an effective remedy (Taraneks v. Latvia, no. 3082/06, \u00a7\u00a084, 2 December 2014). In the light of the above, the Court dismisses the Government\u2019s objection in relation to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

In this respect the Court refers to its well established case-law according to which the persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices (Estrikh v. Latvia, no. 73819/01, \u00a7\u00a0120, 18 January 2007).
