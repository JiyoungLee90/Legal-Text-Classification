The case originated in an application (no. 36079/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Azerbaijani nationals, Mr Safarali Jafarli, Ms Valida Baghirzade and Mr Elchin Jafarov (“the applicants”), on 8 August 2006.
The applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mr M. Mustafayev and Mr A. Huseynov, lawyers practising in . The Azerbaijani Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Ç. Asgarov.
The applicants alleged, in particular, that the delay in the execution of the judgment of 9 July 2002 had violated their right to a fair trial and their property rights, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
On 14 March 2007 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 1).
The applicants are Azerbaijani nationals who were born in 1951, 1956 and 1978 respectively and live in .
The applicants were members of a cooperative (“Əlincə” Kooperativi – “the Cooperative”) incorporated in Nakhchivan. The Cooperative was created by a decision of a general meeting of 5 April 1989 and was initially composed of five members, including the first applicant.
The Cooperative's charter was officially registered on 19 September 1994 by the Ministry of Justice of the . According to this charter, the Cooperative was to be liquidated, inter alia, if the number of its members dropped to less than three.
According to the minutes of the Cooperative's general meetings available in the case file, there were subsequently some changes in the membership of the Cooperative. Following the departure of four members of the Cooperative, on 18 December 1996 the second and third applicants became its new members and the total number of the members amounted to three. In all these documents the first applicant was mentioned as the chairman of the Cooperative.
Pursuant to a number of contracts concluded in the period from 1997 to 2000, the Cooperative supplied one of the units of the Chief Department of Border Troops of the Ministry of National Security (“the Department of Border Troops”) with various foodstuffs.
Although the Cooperative had fulfilled its contractual obligations, it was not fully paid.
On an unspecified date the Cooperative brought an action against the Department of Border Troops and Border Troops Unit No. 2006, asking for payment of an accrued debt in the amount of 290,167,334 old Azerbaijani manats (AZM) plus 10% interest, as stipulated by the contract.
On 9 July 2002 Local Economic Court No. 1 dismissed the claim against the Department of Border Troops. However, Local Economic Court No. 1 upheld the claim against Border Troops Unit No. 2006 and ordered the latter to pay AZM 319,183,067 in total to the Cooperative. This amount included the principal debt of AZM 290,167,334 and the penalty charge of AZM 29,016,733.
No appeals were lodged against that judgment and, pursuant to the domestic law, it became enforceable within one month of its delivery.
On 21 October 2002 Local Economic Court No. 1 issued a writ of execution of the judgment. However, Border Troops Unit No. 2006 refused to comply with the judgment and, despite the applicants' complaints to various authorities, it was not enforced.
In the meantime the Department of Border Troops was reorganised and renamed as the State Border Service.
The documents in the case file show that, on the basis of a request by the Cooperative dated 9 March 2004, signed by the first applicant, the Cooperative's activity as a taxpayer was ceased and this fact was recorded by the Ministry of Taxes.
On an unspecified date in 2005 the Cooperative brought an action against the State Border Service and the Ministry of Finance complaining about the non-enforcement of the judgment of 9 July 2002. The Cooperative claimed AZM 58,033,446 for lost earnings, AZM 649,900,896 for material damage and AZM 300,000,000 for non-pecuniary damage.
On 7 November 2005 Local Economic Court No. 1 dismissed the claim, finding that neither of the defendants could be held responsible for the non-enforcement of the judgment, because the amount awarded to the Cooperative by the judgment of 9 July 2002 had not been paid due to the refusal of the State Treasury to allocate state funds for this purpose.
On 6 February 2006 the Economic Court and on 16 June 2006 the Supreme Court upheld the first-instance court's judgment.
In the period from March to August 2006, the judgment of 9 July 2002 was fully executed and the total amount of AZM 319,183,067 was paid into the bank account that the Cooperative held at the Kapital Bank.
By a decision of 1 May 2007 the Economic Court of the  terminated the enforcement proceedings owing to the execution of the judgment of 9 July 2002.
