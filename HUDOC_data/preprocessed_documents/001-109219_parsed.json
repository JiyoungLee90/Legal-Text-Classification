The second expert found that it was not possible to say for sure that the applicant's behaviour was the result of his mental illness, and that there was no way of telling whether, at the material time, he had been suffering from a psychological or neuropsychological disorder which destroyed, affected, or diminished his discernment or his ability to control his actions within the meaning of Article 122-1 of the Criminal Code, and that he would require specialised care even after his release.",

As stated in 2006 in the opinion of the National Ethics Advisory Committee concerning health and medicine in prison, incarceration can aggravate the mental condition of certain detainees as a result of the combined effects of the aforementioned shortcomings in the treatment dispensed and the living conditions in prisons (overcrowding, difficulty sleeping ...). This state of affairs puts the people concerned in danger, as they may harm themselves (self-mutilation, suicide) or the prison staff or other detainees...\u201d",

La D\u00e9couverte, 2012) stated in a chapter on \u201cPsychiatry\u201d that over 20% of detainees suffered from some form of psychosis, and 7.3% of detainees suffered from schizophrenia. It stressed the confusion between punishment and treatment, which is all the more problematic if one considers, \u201clike a Senate information report in 2010, that prison is no place for treatment\u201d. As the Inspector General of prisons observed, \u201cthat we actually contemplate treating mental illnesses in prison is in itself disturbing\u201d ... Hence the finding \u2013 difficult for the authorities to accept \u2013 of the Senate's rapporteur on the draft Prisons Act in 2009 that \u201cfor many people suffering from mental disorders prison makes no sense \u2013 they waste away in the prison environment, complicating the lives of the other prisoners and the prison staff without receiving proper care\u201d. The report shows the limits of treatment in prison (lack of staff, conditions in the RPUs). Concerning the RPU in Marseilles, it notes that \u201cthe general state of the RPU premises is run-down, dilapidated, deplorable (mouldy)\u201d. It quotes a psychiatrist as explaining that \u201cRPUs are not strictly speaking places where people should be hospitalised for treatment; they are places where people are taken care of, generally on a part-time basis, in a prison, subject to the imperatives of prison life ... They are not equipped for intensive care ... They are insanitary places where it is difficult to imagine that certain cells are supposed to offer appeasement, protection and hope\u201d when in fact they are \u201cquite frightening in terms of their appearance and the conditions of hygiene and comfort they offer.\u201d The report also addresses the question of compulsory hospitalisation: \u201cIn fact, the time prisoners spend in compulsory treatment does not always allow the requisite treatment to be dispensed. Often reduced to a matter of days, at best it only serves to treat a phase of acute decompensation, but never properly to treat the pathology\u201d. Lastly, the creation of specially equipped hospital units (Unit\u00e9s hospitali\u00e8res sp\u00e9cialement am\u00e9nag\u00e9es \u2013 UHSAs) is mentioned. Initially nine UHSAs were to open between 2008 and 2011. Another eight were to be created from 2011 onwards. Because of delays, however, only one unit had opened to date.",

The context of his incarceration in 2005 is significant in so far as, although the applicant was asking to be admitted to hospital, the hospital staff called in the police. The problem of dealing with difficult patients was raised immediately and the administrative shortcomings were confirmed. These patients needed constant supervision, because the treatment administered would lead to an improvement, so the treatment would be stopped and the patient would suffer a relapse. While imprisonment might be a satisfactory solution as far as public opinion was concerned, being less costly and more flexible, it had not been satisfactory for the applicant. In addition to the lack of treatment, which was a source of suffering in itself, incarceration and the sporadic nature of the treatment that went with it created a danger. Counsel for the applicant explained that his client had often been the victim of his illness, but also that of his fellow prisoners and the prison staff (see paragraph 20 above). The only reaction had been to lock him away in a solitary confinement cell in the RPU.",

The assessment of this minimum is, in the nature of things, relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some instances, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a091, ECHR 2000-XI, and Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2001-III). Although the question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a factor to be taken into account, the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of violation of Article 3 (see Peers, cited above, \u00a7 74). The Court also refers to the general principles concerning the States' responsibility in respect of health care dispensed to people in detention, as set out in the S\u0142awomir Musia\u0142 v. Poland judgment, for example (no. 28300/06, \u00a7\u00a7 85-88, 20 January 2009). In that judgment it found, in respect of a detainee suffering from serious, chronic mental disorders, including schizophrenia, that while maintaining the detention measure was not, in itself, incompatible with the applicant's state of health, detaining him in establishments not suitable for incarceration of the mentally-ill, raised a serious issue under the Convention. It also noted that the detainee had not been given specialised treatment, particularly constant psychiatric supervision, and that the cumulative effects of the inadequate medical care and inappropriate conditions in which the applicant was held clearly had a detrimental effect on his health and well-being and amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment (\u00a7\u00a097).",

Greece, no. 39780/06, \u00a7 50, 12 June 2008).

In fact, he was admitted to the unit on more than twelve occasions for periods of a few weeks at a time, alternating with spells as an ordinary prisoner in Les Baumettes prison (see paragraphs 11, 18, 22, 26 and 29 above).

The decisions to admit the applicant to hospital under Article D. 398 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in 2007, 2008 and 2009 were taken whenever his state of health was incompatible with detention. He would then return either to the prison's psychiatric unit or to an ordinary cell until his health declined again. In these conditions no purpose was served by alternating periods in the psychiatric hospital, which were too short and haphazard, with periods in prison, which were incomprehensible to and distressing for the applicant, particularly as he presented a danger to himself and to others (see paragraphs 38 and 40 above).
