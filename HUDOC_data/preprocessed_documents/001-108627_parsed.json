They maintained in this connection that he could have sought compensation under Article 141 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure (Law no.\u00a05271) for his allegedly unlawful detention. In the alternative, he could have brought an administrative action for the annulment of the administrative act that he complained of, in accordance with Article 125 of the Constitution. The Government also argued that if the applicant had considered that there were no effective remedies in respect of his complaints under Article 5 of the Convention, he should have lodged his application with the Court much earlier than 22\u00a0April 2010. They argued that the applicant had thus failed to comply with the six-month rule fixed by Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1.",

Following the Court\u2019s application of the interim measure on 1 August 2008, however, the respondent Government could not have removed the applicant to Iran without being in breach of their obligation under Article 34 of the Convention, and any deportation proceedings carried out in respect of the applicant would therefore have had to be suspended (Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v. France, no.\u00a025389/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a073 and 74, ECHR 2007V). The Court recalls in that respect that the fact that expulsion proceedings are provisionally suspended as a result of the application of an interim measure does not in itself render the detention of the person concerned unlawful, provided that the authorities still envisage expulsion at a later stage, so that \u201caction is being taken\u201d although the proceedings are suspended, and on condition that that the detention must not be unreasonably prolonged (see S.P. v. Belgium (dec.), no.\u00a012572/08, 14\u00a0June 2011). In the present case, however, the applicant\u2019s detention continued for many months after the interim measure was applied and during that time no steps were taken to find alternative solutions. What is more, the Court clearly declared in the judgment of Keshmiri (cited above) that the applicant\u2019s deportation to Iran or  would entail a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. While it is true that the applicant could be sent to a different country, the Court notes that the Government have not made any submission to this effect either.
