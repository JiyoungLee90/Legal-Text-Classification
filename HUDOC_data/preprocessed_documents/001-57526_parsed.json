The Government then reviewed the proposed compensation terms (including the choice of the valuation reference period) in the light of representations received, but decided not to change them, notably on account of the uncertainty which this would have created, of the extent of share dealings that had taken place on the basis of the terms already announced and of the fact that in the alternative reference periods canvassed share prices were likely to have been distorted by the commitment to nationalisation.",

If the transaction had been entered into between 28 February 1974 and the Safeguarding Date - or in certain cases the \"Initial Date\" (31 July 1974 for the shipbuilding industry or 4 November 1974 for the aerospace industry) -, the net loss caused thereby to the relevant public corporation fell, under section 39, to be deducted from the compensation payable for shares under section 35; if the transaction had been entered into after the Safeguarding Date - or the Initial Date - and before Vesting Day, that corporation could institute proceedings before the Arbitration Tribunal (see paragraphs 29-32 below) to recover from the directors or the parties to the transaction the loss caused thereby and, in the case of an \"onerous transaction\", to have the same declared void (sections 30 and 31).",

The report took no account of a revaluation of fixed assets, effected after the end of the Reference Period. Memoranda were exchanged between the Department and the Stockholders\u2019 Representative in August 1978 and formal negotiations then began.

The Department indicated in their memorandum that they valued Vosper Thornycroft at \u00a33,757,000, without taking into account deductions which they considered fell to be made under section 39 in respect of dividends paid for the year 1973-1974 in excess of the permissible maximum and in respect of the 1976-1977 group reorganisation, which was alleged to constitute a \"material transaction\" (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). In view of the uncertainty as to the amount of the deductions, they deferred making an offer of compensation.

The valuation method employed was to consider what a single willing buyer, obtaining 100% control, would have paid. Two alternative approaches were used: the first involved estimating the maintainable post-tax profit level and capitalising it by the application of a price/earnings multiplier, giving a value of \u00a316,320,000; the second involved applying a price/earnings multiplier to the latest reported after-tax earnings, giving a value of \u00a315,750,000. The report commented that \"the net asset value of a company which is carrying on business as a going concern is generally not a major determinant in valuing its shares. The purchaser does not normally buy the shares in the expectation that its assets are to be sold, but expects them to be used in the business to earn profits\".",

It was based on the stock market capitalisation of the parent company, Yarrow, during the Reference Period. This was not only because the major part of Yarrow\u2019s activity was carried on by Yarrow Shipbuilders (see paragraph 36 (b) above) but also because the accountants considered that \"without the financial backing of Yarrow and being unable to pay dividends under the terms of the [Ministry of Defence] loan, a purely nominal value for [Yarrow Shipbuilders] might result\". They also took the view that Yarrow Shipbuilders could not be valued on the normal criteria of earnings, dividend yield or asset backing, and noted that the stringent dividend restrictions \"affected the standing and worth\" of both the subsidiary and the parent.",

The method laid down by the 1977 Act for valuing unlisted shares (the hypothetical Stock Exchange valuation) involved estimating what price the shares would have had on the Stock Exchange had they been listed during the Reference Period. The estimate would be made by reference to the price of any comparable quoted shares and account would be taken of all information about the company that would have been available to Stock Exchange investors during that period. Thus, Messrs. Whinney Murray & Co. based their valuations primarily on data appearing in the companies\u2019 latest published accounts, which covered periods prior to the Reference Period, but they also made certain assumptions as to the interim - and more up-to-date - statements that would have been supplied to the stock market if the companies\u2019 shares had been listed. However, questions might arise concerning the precise information that would have been available to investors and the extent to which they might have foreseen an undertaking\u2019s future performance (see, for example, paragraph 57 above). Furthermore, it is implicit in this method that the company\u2019s shares would be held by a number of different persons; accordingly, when valuing a wholly-owned subsidiary on this basis, hypothetical assumptions may have to be made as to what its business policies would have been if its shares had been more widely owned.",

An alternative method is to consider what a single willing buyer would pay a willing seller (or sellers) for the whole of the shares in question. Here again, account would be taken of all the information that would be available to a buyer at the relevant time and an estimate would be made by reference to comparable quoted shares. However, this method could differ from the hypothetical Stock Exchange valuation method in three respects. Firstly, it might be assumed that a single buyer in takeover negotiations might have more complete information than a Stock Exchange investor. Secondly, it would not be necessary to assume that the ownership of the shares was different from the reality or to make consequent assumptions as to the company\u2019s business policies. Thirdly, the price payable by a single buyer gaining control of a company would normally be materially higher than the Stock Exchange price, since the latter merely represents what would be paid for a small parcel of shares and does not reflect the market value of a controlling shareholding; guidance as to the additional amount (the \"control premium\") may be obtained from the premiums over previous market prices paid on successful takeover bids which, according to the applicants, averaged 34% in the first half of 1977.",

In its judgment of 23 September 1982 in the case of Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth, the Court analysed Article 1 (P1-1) as comprising \"three distinct rules\": the first rule, set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property; the second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions; the third rule, stated in the second paragraph, is concerned, amongst other things, with the right of a State to control the use of property (Series A no. 52, p. 24, para. 61). However, the Court made it clear in its James and Others judgment of 21 February 1986 that the three rules are not \"distinct\" in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (Series A no. 98, p. 30, para. 37 in fine).",

It referred to the restrictions, which were already operative during the Reference Period, imposed by the terms of the Ministry of Defence loan on the payment of dividends by the subsidiary to the parent (see paragraph 70 above). As a result of those restrictions, Yarrow was deprived of income with which to pay dividends to its own shareholders and the price of its shares was therefore depressed. A valuation of Yarrow Shipbuilders based on that price therefore failed to reflect its profitability and prospects, factors which at the time were unknown to the stock market. The effect of this valuation method was that the compensation comprised no allowance for profits totalling \u00a39,400,000 which Yarrow Shipbuilders had been obliged to retain as a result of the dividend restrictions (see paragraph 71 (a) above).",

Accordingly, the Yarrow Shipbuilders Stockholders\u2019 Representative could have argued in the negotiations that too much weight was being attached to this factor and too little to the subsidiary\u2019s earnings, prospects and retained profits. Indeed, the Court notes that in the Parliamentary debates it was stated on behalf of the Government that the effects of the Ministry of Defence loan terms on the valuation of the nationalised concern would be covered by the phrase \"all relevant factors\" (Official Report, 16 March 1976, cols. 1789-1792, 25 October 1976, cols. 198-199, and 5 November 1976, cols. 1659-1664).

That full allowance may not have been made for these items is, in the Court\u2019s view, justified by the fact that Yarrow Shipbuilders was particularly dependent on Government financial assistance, in the form either of the Ministry of Defence loan itself or of shipbuilding grants (see paragraph 71 (a) above).",

Again, the period between September 1979 and September 1980 is accounted for by the fact that the Vickers Shipbuilding Stockholders\u2019 Representative had instituted proceedings before the Arbitration Tribunal (see paragraph 81 above). In these circumstances and having regard to the size of the nationalised undertaking, the Court does not find that the overall period - of which some fifteen months were devoted to negotiations - was unreasonable.",

As regards the present case, although two members of the Arbitration Tribunal were nominated by the Secretary of State, the appointments could not be made without prior consultation of the Stockholders\u2019 Representatives (see paragraph 29 above). In fact, criteria for the selection of members of the Tribunal were worked out jointly (ibid.) and it does not appear that any dispute arose regarding the nominations. What is more, the Arbitration Tribunal was in no way bound by the amount of compensation offered by the Government in the negotiations (see paragraph 19 above), as is evidenced by the awards copies of which were supplied to the Court (Scott Lithgow Drydocks Ltd. case - 29 September 1981; Cammell Laird Shipbuilders Ltd. case - 23 October 1981).

Even if these remedies were not directly available to Sir William Lithgow himself (see paragraphs 30 and 195 above), he did have the benefit of the collective system established by the Act. The Court has found this system not to be in breach of the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see paragraphs 193-197 above), an Article whose requirements are stricter than those of Article 13 (art. 13) (see the above-mentioned Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth judgment, Series A no. 52, p. 32, para. 88).

But even supposing that an aim of this kind can be regarded as reasonable, it cannot be taken as sufficient to justify the suppression - and, in our view, it was not a matter of a mere restriction, especially as Sir William Lithgow held a relative majority (that is, a \"blocking minority\") of the shares - of a fundamental entitlement and, hence, the impairment of the very essence of the right in question.",

This reasoning also does not appear to us persuasive since, unless he established that the Representative had acted fraudulently or negligently, a shareholder could derive no advantage from this remedy. In any event, even if he had exercised it, Sir William Lithgow would at the most have obtained a finding of responsibility on the part of the Representative, something that was clearly not his objective.",
