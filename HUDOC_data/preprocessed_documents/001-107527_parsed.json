In considering whether there were any exceptional circumstances which justified dispensing with an oral hearing on the applicant\u2019s compensation claim, the Court held that the applicant should have been afforded an opportunity to explain orally to the first-instance court the moral damage which his detention had entailed for him in terms of distress and anxiety. According to the Court, the administration of justice and the accountability of the State would have been better served by affording the applicant the right to explain his personal situation at a hearing before the domestic court subject to public scrutiny.
