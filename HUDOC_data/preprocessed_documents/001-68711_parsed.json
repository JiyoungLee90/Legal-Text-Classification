The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (the Aydin v. Turkey judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports 1997-VI, pp.\u00a01895-96, \u00a7 103, and the Kaya v. Turkey judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports\u00a01998-I, pp. 329-30, \u00a7 106). The Court further reiterates that where an individual has an arguable claim that he has been subjected to serious ill-treatment by the State, the notion of an \u201ceffective remedy\u201d entails, inter alia, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible, and includes effective access for the complainant to the investigation procedure (see the Tekin v.\u00a0Turkey judgment of 9\u00a0June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1517, \u00a7\u00a052).",

They took the negation of the police officers at face-value and refused to institute criminal proceedings against them, despite the applicant\u2019s statements and his undisputed bodily injuries. The criminal proceedings and the investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations commenced more than a year after the alleged events. The Court agrees with the applicant that the omissions at the initial stage of consideration of his complaint substantially affected the subsequent course of the overall investigation. Many of the witnesses were only questioned after a significant lapse of time (May-November 2001) and could not testify clearly about events in March\u00a02000. The Court further notes that on two occasions the domestic courts established that there had been serious omissions on the part of the authorities during the investigation: most of the witnesses were interrogated only after a lengthy delay, whereas several others were not interrogated at all. In the Court\u2019s opinion those omissions, taken alone, provide a sufficient basis for the conclusion that the State authorities fell short of their obligations under Article 13 of the Convention.",

However, such a claim must be lodged against a particular person or persons. The remedy becomes futile if the offender is not identified and prosecuted. Therefore the absence of any outcome for the main criminal proceedings also prevented the applicant from effective recourse to these remedies, since in practice a civil claim for compensation would not be examined prior to a final determination of the facts in pending criminal proceedings.",
