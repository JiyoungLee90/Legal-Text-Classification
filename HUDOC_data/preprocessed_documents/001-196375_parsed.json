His repeated requests to call those witnesses had been dismissed by the District Court without giving any reasons, while the Court of Appeal, in reasoning its dismissal, relied on the testimony of the same police officers. By giving priority to the police officers\u2019 testimony without good reasons the courts had put into doubt the impartiality of their judgments, taking into account that the police had been party to the conflict. Moreover, there had been contradictions and ambiguities in the police officers\u2019 statements which the courts had failed to make any effort to clarify. In particular, while initially reporting that he had been arrested at Freedom Square, the police officers had later changed their story and indicated the intersection of Northern Avenue and Abovyan Street as the location of his arrest. Furthermore, it was unclear why he had been stopped in the street in the first place and based on what suspicions the police officers had wanted to \u201cinvite\u201d him to a police station. Lastly, as regards his admission of guilt, the applicant submitted that, since the case against him had been a political one and he had been told by the investigator that he would be convicted in any case, making the confession, upon the investigator\u2019s offer, had been the price that he had had to pay in order to have the charge against him changed to a less severe one, as he was the sole breadwinner for his family and could not afford to spend years in prison.",

In determining whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, regard must also be had to whether the rights of the defence have been respected and whether the applicant was given the opportunity to challenge the authenticity of the evidence and to oppose its use. In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. As a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce. Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses, in the \u201cautonomous\u201d sense given to that word in the Convention system. In the context of taking evidence, the Court has paid particular attention to compliance with the principle of equality of arms, which is one of the fundamental aspects of a fair hearing and which implies that the applicant must be \u201cafforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent\u201d. Therefore, even though it is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to call a witness, there might be exceptional circumstances which could prompt the Court to conclude that the failure do so was incompatible with Article 6. When a request by a defendant to examine witnesses is not vexatious, is sufficiently reasoned, is relevant to the subject matter of the accusation and could arguably have strengthened the position of the defence or even led to his acquittal, the domestic authorities must provide relevant reasons for dismissing such a request (see, among other authorities, Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0202-204, and Murtazaliyeva v. Russia [GC], no. 36658/05, \u00a7\u00a7 139-159, 18\u00a0December 2018).",

It held that in the dispute over the key facts underlying the charges where the only witnesses for the prosecution were the police officers who had played an active role in the contested events, it was indispensable for the courts to use every reasonable opportunity to check their incriminating statements (see Kasparov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 64; Navalnyy and Yashin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 76204/11, \u00a7 83, 4 December 2014; and Frumkin v. Russia, no.\u00a074568/12, \u00a7 165, ECHR 2016 (extracts)). A similar situation was examined by the Court in a case against Armenia, in which a violation of Article 6 was found and which, moreover, concerned the same events as in the present case (see Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 200-211).",

The criminal case against the applicant, who was, as the applicant in the above case, facing charges for certain acts allegedly committed by him at Freedom Square, was built entirely on the testimony of two police officers who had been actively involved in the contested events and whose statements, moreover, appear to have contained inconsistencies, including regarding the location of the applicant\u2019s arrest. The applicant\u2019s request to call witnesses, which was sufficiently substantiated and of direct relevance to the charges against him, was dismissed by the trial court with very brief and unconvincing reasoning (see paragraph 27 above). While the appeal court, when dismissing a similar request, reasoned that the persons whom the applicant sought to call had not witnessed his arrest, that finding was based on the testimony of the very police officers whose statements the applicant sought to challenge by calling the witnesses in question (see paragraph 31 above). The Court therefore considers that the domestic courts, in a dispute over the key facts underlying the charges which, moreover, were based on conflicting evidence, failed to use every reasonable opportunity to verify the incriminating statements of the police officers who were the only witnesses for the prosecution and had played an active role in the contested events. Their unreserved endorsement of the police version of events, failure to address properly the applicant\u2019s submissions and refusal to examine the defence witnesses without proper regard to the relevance of their statements can be said to have led to a limitation of the defence rights incompatible with the guarantees of a fair hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, Mushegh Saghatelyan, \u00a7 210).",

While the charges against him had concerned only non-dangerous violence against a police officer, he had nevertheless been prosecuted within the scope of the criminal case instituted against the leaders and supporters of the opposition in connection with the mass disorder which had allegedly taken place later that day in Yerevan and during the investigation he had been questioned repeatedly about his role in organising the protests, including his relation to Mr Ter-Petrosyan. His eventual conviction had been based solely on the statements of the two arresting police officers, who had moreover been actively involved in the contested events and had used excessive force against the demonstrators, while the court judgments had not been well-reasoned due to the pressure put on the judges by the executive. The fact that politically motivated charges had often been used in criminal cases related to the events of 1\u00a0March 2008 had been confirmed and criticised by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

The applicant had put up resistance during his arrest and had later been prosecuted for that and had, moreover, admitted his guilt. Thus, since the applicant had been indicted for assaulting a police officer during his arrest, his conviction had had nothing to do with the assembly at Freedom Square and therefore did not interfere with his rights guaranteed by Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. However, even assuming that there had been an interference, the interference had been prescribed by law and had pursued a legitimate name, namely the dispersal of the unlawful assembly and the confiscation of illegal arms and ammunition. The assembly at Freedom Square had not been authorised as required by law and had disturbed public order and the peace and calm of life in the capital.

The applicant in the present case was similarly an active supporter of the opposition and was also regularly present at the demonstrations, including during the police operation of 1 March 2008. While the applicant appears to have been eventually arrested for allegedly putting up resistance to the arresting police officers, it is unclear on what grounds the officers, who had approached the applicant at a considerable distance from Freedom Square, assumed, in the first place, that he had participated in the assembly and had, moreover, committed anything illegal. This similarly suggests that the officers either knew the applicant as an active demonstrator or at the very least were carrying out random arrests. The applicant was subsequently charged under the same Articles of the CC as in the Mushegh Saghatelyan case and the charges were similarly couched in very general and abstract terms, without any specific evidence or factual details being provided for the acts allegedly committed by the applicant, namely the alleged incitement to disobedience and the alleged life and health-threatening assault on police officers (see paragraph 18 above). All of those charges were similarly subsequently dropped for lack of evidence, while the applicant\u2019s eventual conviction for a non-life and healththreatening assault on the arresting police officers was a mere recapitulation of the charges against him, lacking details and full of ambiguities, completely leaving out such important facts as the circumstances of the clashes between the demonstrators and the police at Freedom Square (see paragraph 28 above). The Court therefore considers that the domestic courts in the present case similarly failed to carry out a thorough and objective establishment of the facts underlying the charges against the applicant and to demonstrate the rigour and scrutiny which, in the particular circumstances of the case and given the overall context, were required of them in order to ensure an effective implementation of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly guaranteed by Article 11. In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the reasons adduced by the domestic courts to justify the interference were genuinely \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d or that the courts based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts. The Court therefore concludes that the measures in question were not necessary in a democratic society (see, mutatis mutandis, Musegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 249-254).",
