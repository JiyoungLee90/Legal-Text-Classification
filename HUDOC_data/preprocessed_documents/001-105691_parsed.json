Danijel came to me complaining that his nose hurt and told me that L.R. had hit him hard. He made it quite clear that the blow had been unintentional, which other pupils who witnessed the incident confirmed.

As an example of his typical behaviour, the pupils mentioned Danijel\u2019s kicking of pupils in passing. He would bend his knee and kick them with a sudden backwards movement of his leg.

Croatia, no. 46423/06, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2009... (extracts), with further references). In this connection Article 3 requires States to put in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against personal integrity, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions (see, mutatis mutandis, A. v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, \u00a7 22, Reports 1998VI, and Nachova and Others\u00a0v. Bulgaria [GC], nos.\u00a043577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a096, ECHR 2005-VII), and this requirement also extends to ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see \u0160e\u010di\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 53). On the other hand, it goes without saying that the obligation on the State under Article 1 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as requiring the State to guarantee through its legal system that inhuman or degrading treatment is never inflicted by one individual on another or that, if it is, criminal proceedings should necessarily lead to a particular sanction. In order that a State may be held responsible it must in the view of the Court be shown that the domestic legal system, and in particular the criminal law applicable in the circumstances of the case, fails to provide practical and effective protection of the rights guaranteed by Article 3 (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26\u00a0March 1985, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 91, and A. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, opinion of the Commission, \u00a7 48).",

Slovenia, no. 1926/03, \u00a7 79, 23\u00a0June 2009), having been informed of the criminal complaint the State Attorney was under a duty to ensure that the preliminary investigation was carried out, that the evidence was obtained and that, if the evidence against the alleged perpetuators was sufficient, criminal proceedings were pursued against them. The Court therefore sees no reason to require the applicants to pursue the prosecution of the accused officers on their own by pressing charges, this being the responsibility of the State Attorney, who is certainly better placed, if not exclusively competent, in that respect (see Matko, \u00a7\u00a090, and Stojn\u0161ek, \u00a7 79, both cited above). It accordingly concludes that by lodging a criminal complaint the applicant afforded the State an opportunity to put matters right by instituting an effective official investigation (see H.D. v. Poland (dec.), no. 33310/96, 7\u00a0June 2001). The Court will assess on the merits of the case whether such an investigation was in fact carried out.",

The Court confirms that a civil action is not capable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any findings as to the identity of the perpetrators, much less of establishing their responsibility. Furthermore, a Contracting State\u2019s obligation under Article 3 of the Convention to conduct an investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible in cases of ill-treatment might be rendered illusory if, in respect of complaints under that Article, an applicant were required to exhaust an action leading only to an award of damages (see, Parlak and Others v.
