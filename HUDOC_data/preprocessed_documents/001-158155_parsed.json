It acknowledged that pursuant to section 44(2) of the Bar Act the remuneration to be paid to a court-appointed defence counsel had to be indicated in the order for his or her appointment and that it ought not be lower than the minimum provided for in the Remuneration Ordinance. However, the court found that it was only possible to determine the exact amount of remuneration to be paid at the end of the proceedings. The reason for this was that the Remuneration Ordinance provided for a lower amount in case of termination of the criminal proceedings by way of a plea bargain (see paragraph 28 below). The court could not predict the outcome of the proceedings at their outset. Therefore, the applicant\u2019s insistence on a prior determination of his fee was contrary to section 44 of the Bar Act. The applicant had thus caused an unjustified adjournment and had rightly been fined under Article 269 \u00a7 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

These included, among others, a situation where the accused wished to be legally represented and there was another accused with conflicting interests who had already retained counsel (Article\u00a070 \u00a7 1 (5) in relation to Article 70 \u00a7 2 of the 1974 CCP).

Russia (dec.), no. , 1 July 2010). Inspired by the general principle de\u00a0minimis non curat praetor, this admissibility criterion rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Korolev, cited above). In other words, the absence of any significant disadvantage can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant (see Adrian Mihai Ionescu, cited above). The Court observes in this connection that it has previously considered the pecuniary loss of some EUR\u00a090 allegedly sustained by the applicant in the case of Adrian Mihai Ionescu (cited above) as not attaining the required level of significance. It\u00a0has also assessed as negligible a pecuniary loss of some EUR\u00a00.5 allegedly sustained by the applicant in the case of Korolev, cited above.",

Neither party submitted information about the applicant\u2019s financial situation. The Court observes that, according to a study commissioned by the European Observatory of Working Life (a European Union agency), the minimum monthly salary in Bulgaria at the time of the facts was equivalent to about EUR 61.

Under those circumstances the applicant must have been fully aware of the ultimate responsibility of the judge presiding the judicial proceedings for their proper conduct. The applicant was instructed in no unclear terms by the domestic court that he was appointed as defense counsel, before he was fined for choosing to leave the court hearing.

In the present case, causing the postponement of the hearing without a valid reason, as established by the national courts, represented an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the justice system; courts are called upon to ensure the latter. The issue of whether the conduct leading to that obstacle should be punished by a financial sanction with a deterrent effect, such as the fine in the present case, comes within the margin of appreciation of the State. That margin is a wide one (see paragraph 56 above).",

Finland, no.\u00a031611/96, \u00a7\u00a7 29-56, ECHR 2002II; see, more recently, Morice v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7 174, 23 April 2015). In Nikula and Morice, both cited above, the applicants were convicted for having criticised respectively a prosecutor and a judge in a manner which the domestic courts found defaming. The Court held that the issue concerned the applicants\u2019 freedom of expression; in Morice specifically it was part of a debate on a matter of public interest about the functioning of the justice system and in the context of a case which had received wide media coverage from the outset. In the present case, the applicant was sanctioned with a fine for having abandoned his duty to represent the accused; that duty stemmed from the fact that the court had appointed the applicant defence counsel and no objective reasons rendered the discharge of his legal representation duties impossible (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above).",
