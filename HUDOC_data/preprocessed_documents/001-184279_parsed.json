This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate.

Moreover, the Court notes that the criminal investigation is still ongoing after twenty-eight years, and that the applicants\u2019 complaints focus, inter alia, on the duration, in their view excessive, of that investigation. The Government have not alleged, let alone shown, that any of the internal remedies could have brought a substantial speediness of the domestic proceedings (see AnamariaLoredana Or\u0103\u0219anu and Others v.\u00a0Romania ([Committee], nos. 43629/13 and 74 others, \u00a7\u00a044, 7 November 2017, with further references).
