This is all the more so that in the instant case the \u201celection\u201d of the applicant had been flawed because it had not been the result of a democratic procedure and the applicant had been used by the local Muslim MPs for party political purposes. Moreover, given that there were two Muftis in Xanthi at the time and that the applicant had questioned the legality of the acts of the lawful mufti, the courts had to convict the spurious one in order not to create tension among the Moslems, between the Moslems and Christians and between Turkey and Greece. In any event, the State had to protect the office of the mufti and, even if there had not existed a lawfully appointed mufti, the applicant would have had to be punished. In this respect, the Government submit that the Court of Cassation did not convict the applicant simply because he appeared as the Mufti.

Although the Court recognises that it is possible that tension is created in situations where a religious or any other community becomes divided, it considers that this is one of the unavoidable consequences of pluralism. The role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see, mutatis mutandis, the Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d v.\u00a0Austria judgment of 21 June 1988, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0139, p.\u00a012, \u00a7\u00a032). In this connection, the Court notes that, apart from a general reference to the creation of tension, the Government did not make any allusion to disturbances among the Muslims in Xanthi that had actually been or could have been caused by the existence of two religious leaders. Moreover, the Court considers that nothing was adduced that could warrant qualifying the risk of tension between the Muslims and Christians or between Greece and Turkey as anything more than a very remote possibility.",
