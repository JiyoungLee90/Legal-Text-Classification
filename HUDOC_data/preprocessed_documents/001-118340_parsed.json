It analysed the relevant caselaw of the administrative courts and noted that the manner in which the beginning of the time-limit for lodging cassation appeals was determined had led to divergent results. It held that it was necessary to determine the relevant time in a manner compatible with effective access to the highest administrative court and which ensured equal treatment for parties represented by lawyers appointed under the legalaid scheme and by privately hired lawyers. The court held that the time-limit for a legally-aided party started to run only on the day when a legal-aid lawyer had a genuine possibility of lodging the cassation appeal and not when he or she was informed of his or her assignment to the case. The court was of the view that the latter approach was far too rigid and rendered the effective enjoyment of legal assistance granted under the legal-aid system illusory. In any event, the cassation appeal had to be lodged within thirty days from the day on which the party was informed of the appointment of the legal-aid lawyer (I FZ 569/06 of 8\u00a0December 2006; I FZ 667/06 of 15 January 2007; I\u00a0FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2007; II FZ 177/08 of 25 June 2008; II OZ 513/08 of 27\u00a0May 2008; I OZ 376/08 of 13 June 2008; I FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2009; II\u00a0OZ 1093/09 of 9\u00a0December 2009; I FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2009).",

A lawyer subsequently assigned to the case had therefore less time to examine the case and decide, still within the timelimit, whether a cassation appeal offered prospects of success and to prepare an appeal. This may lead to a situation where lawyers subsequently assigned to the case only learned about their appointment after the timelimit for lodging the cassation appeal had expired.",

As a result, a body of case-law has developed to the effect that in situations where a legal-aid lawyer has been appointed after the time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal had expired and he or she is willing to prepare an appeal, the administrative courts could grant leave to submit a cassation appeal out of time. Under the caselaw of the Supreme Administrative Court the day on which the impediment to lodging the cassation appeal ceased to exist is defined as the day on which the lawyer has had a genuine possibility to prepare an appeal. Thus, the sevenday timelimit begins to run only after the legal-aid lawyer has had sufficient time to study the file.",

The Court is of the opinion that this jurisprudential approach resulted from the administrative courts\u2019 concern about the difficulties encountered by legally-aided parties and can be said to be compatible with Convention standards as regards ensuring fair access to the cassation procedure. However, this approach does not address entirely situations where a lawyer refuses to seek retrospective leave to lodge a cassation appeal after the expiry of the timelimit (see Subicka v.\u00a0Poland, referred to above, \u00a7\u00a7 4748).",

Others try to apply the legal rules less strictly in different ways, for instance by applying the thirty day time-limit to run only from the day when the party was informed about the appointment of the legal-aid lawyer.",

The Court has held that this approach is compatible with Convention standards (Subicka v.  (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 58 ff). Since in the present case the applicant failed to provide the Court with any arguments that the time-limit had expired on another day, the Court will follow the method of calculating the time-limit applied in Subicka v.\u00a0Poland (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 59-71.",

Poland, no. 23987/05, 11 October 2011, it found no violation when the applicant still had nine days within which to avail herself of the possibility of seeking leave to appeal out of time (in effect seven working days if Saturday and Sunday are discounted). In the instant case if Saturday 25 and Sunday 26 December are discounted (which were public holidays) the applicant was still left with nine working days. It is true that in the Christmas period more people tend to be on holiday than in certain other periods of the year. But the applicant has submitted no real evidence to suggest that it was practically impossible, as opposed to simply more difficult, for him to find a new lawyer. It cannot, therefore, be said that the applicant was put in a position where his effective access to a court was restricted in breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.
