The case originated in an application (no. 17253/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Dimitar Dinkov Shopov (“the applicant”), on 20 March 2007.
The applicant was represented first by Mr E. Ganchev and then by Ms S. Stefanova and Mr M. Ekimdzhiev, lawyers practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms R. Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the authorities had failed to effectively investigate an assault against him by private individuals.
On 16 May 2011 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Ovchepoltsi.
On the evening of 1 May 1991 the applicant was involved in a fight between several people in the . During the fight he was stabbed with a knife in the stomach. Some members of the public came to his aid and took him to hospital.
On the same day the applicant was admitted as an in-patient, and underwent an urgent operation. He was discharged on 13 May 1991 and was given thirty days’ sick leave.
On 1 May 1991 the investigating authorities inspected the site where the fight had taken place. They took photos and seized a wooden stick stained with blood.
On 1 and 2 May 1991 several witnesses were questioned.
On 2 May 1991 criminal proceedings were opened against two of the participants in the fight: T.S. and P.S. They were charged with attempted murder and questioned.
On 12 May 1992 the case investigator commissioned a medical expert report to establish the extent of the victim’s injuries. The report relied on the medical records from the applicant’s stay in hospital and established that he had suffered a 3 cm knife wound in the abdominal cavity which resulted in an injury to the great omentum and to the large intestine. The applicant had also suffered a combination of other injuries: large bruises on the face and on the right leg, and a broken rib.
Between 18 May and 8 June 1992 several witnesses were questioned.
It appears that between 1991 and 1994 the applicant’s mother wrote several times to the prosecuting authorities, complaining of inactivity on the part of the investigator in charge of the case. In response, the supervising prosecutor wrote to the investigator on several occasions requesting that the investigation be completed; for example in a letter of 19 August 1994 the prosecutor requested that the investigation be completed “without delay”.
On 17 June 1996 the attempted murder charge against T.S. was changed to a charge of having caused intermediate bodily harm and he was questioned in this connection.
On 11 September 1996 the attempted murder charge against P.S. was also changed to a charge of having caused intermediate bodily harm and he too was questioned.
Between 25 August 2000 and 1 July 2002 some of the witnesses were recalled for further questioning.
On 18 July 2003, following a complaint by the applicant’s lawyer in relation to the length of the investigation and inactivity on the part of the investigator in charge of the case, the supervising prosecutor removed the investigator and gave instructions to the investigating authorities to commission a new medical expert report and to conclude the investigation within thirty days. The Court has not been informed by either party of what substantive investigative steps, if any, were undertaken after that date.
On 5 June 2006 the public prosecutor terminated the proceedings on the ground that the relevant statutory limitation period for bringing a prosecution had lapsed.
On 13 July 2006 the applicant appealed against the order terminating the proceedings. In a decision of 17 July 2006 the  (“the ”) ruled that the assailants remained charged with attempted murder and therefore the statutory limitation period for prosecution had not lapsed. The court remitted the case to the prosecutor’s office, instructing it to continue with the investigation.
T.S. and P.S. appealed against the decision of the . In a final decision of 27 September 2006 the Plovdiv Court of Appeal ruled that the assailants had remained charged only with having caused intermediate bodily harm. The court quashed the Regional Court’s decision and upheld the prosecutor’s order terminating the proceedings.
The Criminal Code 1968 defines intermediate bodily harm (средна телесна повреда) as, inter alia, injuries penetrating the skull, the chest and the abdominal cavity (Article 129 § 2). At the relevant time the wilful infliction of intermediate bodily harm was an offence punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment (Article 129 § 1). It is subject to public prosecution (Article 161).
Article 93 § 7 provides that offences punishable by more than five years’ imprisonment are to be considered “serious” for the purposes of the Code.
The limitation period for prosecuting offences under Article 129 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is ten years (Article 80 § 1 (3) of the Code). Each act of criminal prosecution carried out by the competent authorities in relation to the alleged offender interrupts the limitation period and restarts the running of time (Article 81 § 2). Such interruptions notwithstanding, the alleged offender can no longer be prosecuted if the limitation period has been exceeded by one half (Article 81 § 3), which means that an offence under Article 129 of the Code cannot be prosecuted if more than fifteen years have elapsed after its alleged commission.
Under section 1 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act 1988 (hereafter “the State Responsibility Act”) the State is liable, in particular, for damage suffered by individuals as a result of unlawful decisions, acts or omissions by its bodies and civil servants, committed in the course of or in connection with the performance of administrative duties. The Supreme Court of Cassation’s case-law provides that the functions of the investigative and the prosecuting authorities in the context of a criminal investigation do not amount to administrative duties and those authorities are not liable under section 1 of the Act (тълк. реш. № 3 от 22 април 2005 г. на ВКС по тълк. д. № 3/2004 г., ОСГК).
Persons who have suffered damage from a publicly prosecutable criminal offence have a choice of either bringing an action against the alleged tortfeasor in the civil courts, with the result that the proceedings will be stayed in anticipation of the outcome of the pending criminal investigation against the tortfeasor (Article 182 § 1 (d) of the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure, superseded by Article 229 § 1 (5) of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure), or making a civil claim in the context of the criminal proceedings instituted by the prosecuting authorities (Article 60 § 1 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, superseded by Article 84 § 1 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure). Until June 2003 a civil claim could be made even during a preliminary investigation, before the case had gone to trial (Article 60 § 1 of the 1974 Code, as in force until June 2003).
The general limitation period for bringing a tort claim is five years (section 110 of the 1951 Obligations and Contracts Act). By section 115(1)(g) of the Act, time ceases to run during the “pendency of the judicial proceedings relating to the [tort] claim”. According to interpretative decision of 5 April 2006 adopted by the General Assembly of the Civil and the Commercial Chambers of the Supreme Court of Cassation time stops running under section 115(1)(g) of the Act only when the victim brings a claim against the tortfeasor, whether in the context of the criminal proceedings or in separate civil proceedings (тълк. реш. № 5 от 5 април 2006 г. по тълк. д. № 5/2005 г., ОСГК и ОСТК на ВКС).
