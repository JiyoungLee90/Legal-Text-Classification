It has not been claimed that the courts acted outside their competences or that there was a fundamental defect in the proceedings before them. The fact that the Presidium disagreed with the assessment made by the first-instance and appeal courts was not, in itself, an exceptional circumstance warranting the quashing of a binding and enforceable judgment and re-opening of the proceedings on the applicant's claim.",

The Court has to have regard, inter alia, to the complexity of the factual or legal issues raised by the case, to the conduct of the applicants and the competent authorities and to what was at stake for the former (see Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 2000-VII). In addition, only delays attributable to the State may justify a finding of a failure to comply with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark, no. 49017/99, \u00a7\u00a044, 19 June 2003).The Court first needs to determine the period to be considered. According to the information available to the Court, the applicant first took his case to court on 30 November 2000, and the action was granted in a final decision of 20\u00a0January 2003. The proceedings resumed on 26\u00a0June\u00a02003 after the decision of the supervisory-review authority to re-open the case. After a fresh examination, the case ended with a judgment of 7\u00a0August 2003. Consequently, the proceedings lasted 2 years and 3 months. This period excludes the time between the decision of 20 January 2003 and the supervisory review of 26\u00a0June\u00a02003, because no proceedings were pending then (see Markin\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a059502/00, 16\u00a0September 2004). During this time the merits of the case were examined four times, and there do not appear to be any substantial periods of inactivity of the domestic courts. In these circumstances the Court finds that the complaint does not disclose any appearance of a violation of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement set out in Article 6 of the Convention.",
