Russia (dec.), no.\u00a068798/01, 5\u00a0February\u00a02004). At the same time, the analysis of Articles 113, 115 and 116 of the CCP suggests that, whichever specific form of the parties\u2019 notification is chosen, the domestic courts should be in possession of evidence confirming the receipt of such notification by the addressee (see paragraph 10 above). However, the Government adduced no evidence of receipt by the applicant of the notification about the appeal hearing (compare Prokopenko v. Russia, no.\u00a08630/03, \u00a7\u00a018, 3\u00a0May 2007).
