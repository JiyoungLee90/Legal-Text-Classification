He feared, in particular, that if he stayed in Uzbekistan, he would face persecution from the State authorities, and would eventually be imprisoned and tortured like some of his fellow Muslim friends. In support of his allegation of the risk of ill-treatment in Uzbekistan, the applicant submitted a copy of a list of persons who had been charged with offences against the State. The list had been prepared by the Human Rights Centre \u201cMemorial\u201d, a non-governmental organisation based in Moscow, and included the applicant\u2019s name. According to this document, the applicant was charged under Article 159 \u00a7 4 of the Uzbekistan Criminal Code (attempting to violently overthrow the State\u2019s constitutional order). At the top of the document, it was explained that the list had been compiled on the basis of the \u201cBulletin on the Search for Criminals\u201d prepared by the criminal investigation and counter-terrorism department of the Ministry of the Interior of Uzbekistan and published in Tashkent in May 2003.",

However, expulsion by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if deported, faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3.

Turkey. The Court notes that the applicant was removed to Iran on 12 September 2008 along with twenty-eight other persons of Uzbek and Afghan origin (see paragraphs 15 and 27 above). The above-cited case of Ghorbanov and Others was brought by nineteen of those Uzbek nationals who had been deported to Iran at the same time as the applicant. In the partial decision in that case, the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 3 that they had risked deportation from Iran to Uzbekistan was declared inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. The decision, in so far as it concerned the deportation which had taken place on 12\u00a0September 2008, was based on the fact that those applicants were refugees recognised by the UNHCR in Iran and had lived in that country prior to their arrival in Turkey. In this regard, the Court stresses that it does not share the Government\u2019s view that Iran was considered to be a \u201csafe third country\u201d in that decision. Such an assessment is nowhere to be found in the Court\u2019s decision in the case of Ghorbanov and Others. Besides, the applicant in the present application lived in Iran for approximately two and a half years as an asylum seeker, whereas the adults among the applicants in the case of Ghorbanov and Others lived in the same country for six years as refugees. Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, the present application has to be distinguished from the case of Ghorbanov and Others. In any case, the Court finds that the central question to be answered in the present case is not whether the applicant ran a real risk of ill-treatment in Iran or in Uzbekistan as such but whether the Turkish authorities carried out an adequate assessment of the applicant\u2019s claim that he would be at risk of ill-treatment in case of deportation to Iran with refoulement to Uzbekistan before he was deported from Turkey to Iran on 12 September 2008 (see M.D. and M.A., cited above, \u00a7 58). Therefore, the Court\u2019s examination will be limited to ascertaining whether the State authorities had fulfilled their procedural obligations under Article 3 of the Convention (see F.G. v. Sweden [GC], no.\u00a043611/11, \u00a7 117, 23 March 2016).",

Also, the applicant\u2019s claim that on 12 September 2008 he had gone to the police station for signature as part of his weekly routine (see paragraph 15 above) was not contested by the Government. The Court therefore finds it established that the applicant was an asylum seeker who was residing legally in Turkey on the day of his deportation.",

Having regard to the information and documents provided by the applicant, the Court finds that the applicant adduced evidence capable of proving that there were substantial grounds for believing that, if he was deported to Iran with the risk of refoulement to Uzbekistan, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article\u00a03 of the Convention. Therefore, the Turkish authorities were under an obligation to address the applicant\u2019s arguments and carefully assess the risk of ill-treatment if the applicant was to be deported to Iran with the risk of refoulement to Uzbekistan, in order to dispel any doubts about possible illtreatment (see, inter alia, M\u00fcslim v.

Turkey ([GC], no. 24014/05, \u00a7\u00a7 122-124, 14 April 2015), the Grand Chamber held that any plea of inadmissibility, including lack of victim status as was the plea in that case, should in so far as its character and the circumstances permit, be raised by the respondent Contracting Party in its written or oral observations on the admissibility of an application, unless the events which were alleged to have deprived the applicant of his or her victim status had occurred after the decision on admissibility, or where the objection concerned a matter which went to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction rather than a question of admissibility in the narrow sense of that term. In the present case, the issue of victim status was raised by the Court on 7 April 2015, when the Court invited the parties to submit further written observations on the admissibility and merits of the case, including on the question of victim status. Furthermore, the issue of victim status and the risk of deportation are closely linked to the new Foreigners and International Protection Act which entered into force on 11 April 2014 and which has been invoked by the Government in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Therefore, the Court finds that the issue of victim status calls for consideration by the Court.",

In the Court\u2019s view, the same principle applies in the assessment of an applicant\u2019s victim status, that is to say, the assessment of the existence of the risk of expulsion or extradition from a country, in cases of expulsion and extradition where the applicant has not been removed at the time of the examination of the case by the Court.",

In the absence of such a deportation order, the Court finds that the applicant does not currently appear to face an imminent risk of removal from Turkey.",

The Court found that the complaints under Articles 2, 3, 8 and 14 of the Convention were manifestly ill-founded. In particular, the applicants\u2019 complaints that they had been taken hostage by people-smugglers, that they had run the risk of being shot by border patrol officers and that they had been ill-treated by police officers during the two deportation incidents were considered to be unsubstantiated due to the fact that the applicants had not provided any evidence or detailed information. The Court considered therefore that the applicants had not laid the basis of an arguable claim in respect of these complaints. The Court further held that, since Turkey had not ratified Protocols Nos. 4 and 7, the complaints under Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 were incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention.",
