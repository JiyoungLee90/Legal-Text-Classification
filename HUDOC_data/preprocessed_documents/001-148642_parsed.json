It was not in doubt that the two children had been subjected to gross ill-treatment by adults but concluded that it was not possible from the evidence taken from the defendants and witnesses in the case to identify one or more perpetrators. The statements given had been contradictory to such a degree that this could not be explained as being due to misunderstandings. Several of the statements ought to be considered as untrue leaving no possibility to distinguish between lies and truth on different points. On the other hand the City Court found it established that the damage to the children had mainly occurred while the children had been in the flat. It was further proven that the accused Mr U.A. had been present in the tiny flat occupied by the family while the ill-treatment occurred, as had also been the case of the applicant. The City Court also found it proven that each of the parents had aided and abetted in the commission of the violence by not having interfered or sought to prevent the acts of violence carried out against the children in regard to whom they had a duty of care. The parents were ordered to pay the children 300,000 and 100,000 Norwegian kroner (NOK) (approximately 36,000 and 12,000 euros (EUR)) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.",

The test is normally the balance of probabilities and the burden of proof lies with the claimant. However, in a landmark ruling of 1996 concerning civil liability for forced sexual intercourse (Rt. 1996, p. 864, at p. 876; Ringvold v. Norway, no.\u00a034964/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a016-19, ECHR 2003II) the Norwegian Supreme Court held that the requirement as to the strength of the evidence had to be stricter than that which applied to the test of the balance of probabilities, bearing in mind the burden which an allegation of reprehensible conduct might have for the defendant and the serious consequences it might have for his or her reputation. In a case of the kind under consideration, the test had to be whether on the balance of probabilities it was clearly probable that the alleged abuse had been committed (\u201cklar sannsynlighetsovervekt\u201d). This burden was heavier where liability may have serious consequences for the respondent\u2019s reputation, though it was less than for criminal liability.",

The two systems also supplement one another in important respects.

It may serve the interests of economy of procedure, and also psychological stress may be saved by treating criminal charges and compensation claims in joint proceedings. In comparison with civil proceedings, such joint proceedings were cheap both for the accused and for the victim who would be able to benefit from free legal aid for the handling of the civil claims. If the compensation proceedings had to await a final outcome in the criminal case (at three levels of jurisdiction), it could take years before they could start. For the victim, and also for the acquitted, this could involve a considerable extra psychological burden. Moreover, in joint proceedings, the demands for thoroughness that were inherent in the criminal process would contribute to increasing the quality of the examination of the civil claim. Furthermore, the exonerating effect of an acquittal was not likely to be greater in split proceedings than in joint ones. On the contrary, in view of the problems related to examining the criminal evidence twice, the effect would tend to be more consistent under the latter. Finally, in criminal cases giving rise to more than one civil claim, deciding them all at the same time in connection with the criminal process would ensure a greater degree of \u201cprocedural equality\u201d and coherence (ibid., Chapter 6, sub-chapter 6.3.1 and 6.3.2).",

Since it was in the nature of things that an Article 219 offence could not occur by accident or without intent by the perpetrator, the ensuing reasoning took on criminal law features. Moreover, the High Court had stated that the injuries suffered by the children had been inflicted with \u201crepeated violence\u201d and \u201csevere violence\u201d \u2013 typically criminal-law terms \u2013 and that the injuries were not compatible with accidents but showed that they had been inflicted by \u201csevere violence\u201d.

Nor can the fact that evidence from the criminal trial is used to determine the civil-law consequences of the act warrant such a characterisation. Otherwise, as rightly pointed out by the Government, Article 6 \u00a7 2 would give a criminal acquittal the undesirable effect of pre-empting the victim\u2019s possibilities of claiming compensation under the civil law of tort, entailing an arbitrary and disproportionate limitation on his or her right of access to a court under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

As in other types of situations where the Court has ascertained the circumstances in which Article 6 \u00a7 2 will be violated in the context of proceedings which follow the conclusion of criminal proceedings, the language used by the decision-maker will be of critical importance in assessing the compatibility of the decision and its reasoning with this provision (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 123, 125 and 126). What the Court has to assess is whether, in the light of the nature of the task that the domestic court was required to carry out, and in the context of the decision to acquit the applicant (see paragraph 8 above), the language it employed was compatible with the presumption of innocence (see Allen, \u00a7 129).",

As can be seen from the general principles of the Court\u2019s case-law quoted at paragraph 40 above (and summarised in Allen, cited above, \u00a7 123), this category of cases has previously been dealt with on a different approach from that that applied in cases relating to decisions on an acquitted person\u2019s compensation claim for detention on remand, where even the voicing of suspicion regarding the accused\u2019s innocence has been deemed incompatible with the presumption of innocence embodied in Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (ibid. \u00a7 122, with further references). In contrast, as already mentioned, the question in the present type of context is whether the national decision of compensation were to contain a statement imputing criminal liability to the respondent party (ibid. \u00a7 123, with further references, and the second sub-paragraph of \u00a7 38 of Ringvold, quoted at paragraph 40 above).",

Norway and Reeves, both cited above). It is also to be observed that in two clearly distinct parts of its judgment, the High Court dealt respectively with the criminal charges against the applicant, ending in a conclusion of acquittal (a non-guilty verdict by the jury approved by the professional judges, see paragraph 8 above), and with the compensation claim made on the children\u2019s behalf (without the participation of any members of the jury), in respect of which it ordered the applicant to pay them compensation (see paragraph 9 above).",

In this context it referred to the European Court\u2019s case-law. The High Court further reiterated that under the relevant national standard a condition for compensation was that it was clearly probable that the damage had been caused by intent or by gross negligence (see paragraphs 9 and 23 above). Finally, in its conclusion, the High Court considered that its decision on the civil claim had been based on a less strict burden of proof than that which applied in criminal proceedings and did not undermine the correctness of the acquittal (see paragraph 9 above).",

It appears that the High Court deliberately strived to distance its reasoning on compensation from the criminal case, so as to avoid bringing the matter into the criminal sphere outside the bounds of the civil forum. That said, even if presented with such cautionary statements as mentioned above, the reasoning in a decision on compensation may raise an issue under this provision if, as already mentioned above, it involves statements imputing criminal liability to the respondent party (see Orr, cited above, \u00a7 53 and, mutatis mutandis, Hammern v.

It is also noteworthy that the High Court\u2019s reasoning left open the identity of the person or persons who had inflicted the damage and thus did not single out the applicant as the perpetrator. The present case is therefore distinguishable from Ringvold, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a019 and 39; Reeves and Lundkvist, all cited above, where the Court found no violation; and from Y., \u00a7 44, and Orr, \u00a7\u00a7 51 to 55, both cited above, where the Court found a violation).

In the Court\u2019s view this does not in itself present a problem, as the expression is not reserved for the criminal-law sphere but is equally used in the civil law of tort. More problematic was the use of the terms \u201cviolence\u201d (\u201cvold\u201d) and \u201cill-treatment\u201d (\u201cmishandling\u201d). In Orr, cited above, \u00a7 51 the Chamber concluded in that particular context that the concept of \u201cviolence\u201d overstepped the bounds of the civil forum. However, the factual circumstances of that case were different, as it related to a specific event of alleged rape involving two persons. Furthermore, the concept of \u201cviolence\u201d is not exclusively criminal in nature (ibid.). As for \u201cill-treatment\u201d, it should be recalled that in Ringvold, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 19 and 41, the expression \u201csexual abuse\u201d used by the relevant national court did not lead to the finding of a violation by the Court. Furthermore, the Court\u2019s case-law provides some examples of instances where no violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 2 has been found even though the language used by domestic authorities and courts was criticised. It should be reiterated that when regard is had to the nature and context of the particular proceedings at issue, even the use of some unfortunate language may not be decisive (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0126, with further references). Read in context of the judgment as a whole, the use of the said expressions by the High Court in the instant case cannot reasonably be read as an affirmation imputing criminal liability on the part of the applicant.",

Also, the outcome of the criminal case was not decisive for the issue of compensation; the situation was the reverse: despite the applicant\u2019s acquittal it was legally feasible to award compensation.
