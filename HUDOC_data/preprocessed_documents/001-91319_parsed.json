Furthermore, in cases involving disappearances, the Court finds it particularly regrettable that there should have been no thorough investigation of the relevant facts by the domestic prosecutors or courts. The few documents submitted by the Government from the investigation files opened by the district prosecutor do not suggest that any progress has been made for several years and, if anything, show the incomplete and inadequate nature of those proceedings. Moreover, the stance taken by the prosecutor\u2019s office and the other law-enforcement authorities after the news of the abductions was communicated to them by the applicants contributed significantly to the likelihood of their relatives\u2019 disappearance, as no necessary steps were taken in the crucial first days and weeks after the arrests.
