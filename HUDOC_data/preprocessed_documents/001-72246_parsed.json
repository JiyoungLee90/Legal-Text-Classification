The claim was for compensation for nonpecuniary damage suffered by the [applicant]. However, apart from proof about the general state of the hygiene in the detention facility at the time of the [applicant\u2019s] stay there, there is no proof about the specific damage suffered by him. The finding that the detention facility was in a poor hygienic condition does not per se lead to the conclusion that [the applicant] has suffered real moral, nonpecuniary damage, because the objective fact of the hygiene and the regime in the detention facility has a subjective and very individual impact on persons with different mentalities and social status. Due to the lack of evidence about the specific effects which the conditions in the detention facility had on the [applicant], as averred in the statement of claim, the claim remains unsubstantiated. The nongathering of evidence about this is the result of the inactivity of the [applicant] alone. The witness called by him and questioned by the firstinstance court did not testify about the applicant\u2019s condition during his stay in custody, and the other two witnesses for whom leave was given by the firstinstance court and the third witness for whom leave was given by this court were not actually called by the [applicant] without him specifying good reasons for this omission. In view of this the [court] considers that the [applicant\u2019s] lack of procedural activity is tendentious and seeks to surmount the admissibility criteria for lodging an application with European Court of Human Rights...\u201d",

It was moreover incumbent on the detainee to prove the existence of such exceptional circumstances, failing which he or she was bound to remain in detention throughout the proceedings (see paragraphs 75 above).

Bulgaria (no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 8487, 26 July 2001) and in a number of subsequent cases against , the Court found that this practice was at odds with Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3.",

The possibility to prove the impact of these conditions on the applicant had therefore become pointless. For this reason he had not brought witnesses, hoping that the Supreme Court of Cassation would consider the refusals of the courts below to order an inspection and an expert report serious breaches of the rules of procedure and remit the case. However, because of the legislative changes in November 2002 the proceedings before the Supreme Court of Cassation had been discontinued, thus excluding this possibility. In the applicant\u2019s view, the particular requirements of the State Responsibility for Damage Act, coupled with the stance of the courts and the impossibility to have an appeal on points of law examined by the Supreme Court of Cassation had rendered the action under the Act an ineffective remedy against the alleged violation of Article 3 of the Convention. On the other hand, it was not open to the applicant to make a claim under the general tort law, because of the rule of section 8 of the Act.",

Their holding was apparently based on the underlying proposition that nonpecuniary damage such as pain, stress, frustration and anxiety was only provable through formal, external evidence (in the particular case, witness testimony, which the applicant had failed to adduce). They did not consider that the evidence establishing the poor conditions in the detention facility \u2013 which were amply proven \u2013 could also serve, together with the applicant\u2019s averments, as proof that he had endured mental anguish and suffering on account of these conditions. Instead, they required separate proof of the nonpecuniary damage sustained by the applicant. Bearing in mind the subjectmatter of the applicant\u2019s claim, this approach seems unduly formalistic and allowing a large number of cases, such as the applicant\u2019s, where these facts do not lend themselves to such objective, extrinsic proof \u2013 that is, most cases in which poor conditions of detention cause emotional distress, but do not result in physical injury or illness \u2013, to be dismissed as unsubstantiated and result in lack of compensation for conditions of detention which are violative of Article 3. Thus, as a result of that stance of the courts, the remedy under the State Responsibility for Damage Act lost much of its remedial efficacy.",
