In order to ensure that each payment of interest formed the basis of an assessment to tax, transitional regulations were introduced which deemed payments falling into the \u201cgap period\u201d to have been made in a later accounting period, with the result that they formed the basis for an assessment to tax under the new \u201cactual-year\u201d arrangements. In the view of the Government the legislative intention was to ensure that the same amount of tax was collected as would have been collected if the previous arrangements had continued and that the building societies did not receive an undeserved windfall in respect of the gap period.",

They considered that the effect of Regulations 3 and 11 was to impose tax again on interest they had paid in 1985/86, a fiscal year for which liability on their investors\u2019 interest had already been discharged (see paragraph\u00a014 above). For the applicants this had the result that, for twenty-four months\u2019 interest paid to its investors in the two fiscal years 1986/87 and 1987/88, a society like the Leeds, with a 30\u00a0September year-end, was required to pay tax on thirty months\u2019 interest.

One has only to look at the circumstances. The Regulations of 1986 had been made and had been objected to. They were made the subject of a direct challenge in legal proceedings, the evidence in support of which clearly adumbrated the arguments advanced before the judge and the Court of Appeal.

It may be \u2013 I do not know \u2013 that the legislature did not appreciate fully that the effect of the arrangements made in 1985 was to discharge all liability for tax on interest paid in the year of assessment 1985/86, including tax on interest paid after the end of a society\u2019s accounting year, and that, accordingly, to tax those sums again in a subsequent year was, in a sense, to tax them twice.

This legislation had been anticipated as from 7\u00a0May 1992 when the Financial Secretary in a reply to a parliamentary question noted that his Government intended to introduce legislation to validate retrospectively the impugned Treasury Orders. Section\u00a064 provided, with retrospective effect, that the Treasury Orders \u201cshall be taken to be and always to have been effective\u201d. The Government acknowledged during the parliamentary debates on section\u00a064 that the measure was intended to pre-empt the legal proceedings launched by the applicants to challenge the validity of the Treasury Orders and that it would result in the Woolwich being treated more favourably. However, they pointed out that the challenge to the composite rate for CRT in the fiscal years 1986/87 to 1989/90 threw into doubt the lawfulness of the collection of all sums from building societies, banks and other deposit institutions in the periods in question. While there was no doubt as to the lawfulness of the collection in respect of the vast majority of those sums, the effect of impugning the rates set would have been to render the collection of all sums unlawful.

The Woolwich was able to litigate (twice) the whole way to the House of Lords and to recover all the monies it had paid to the Inland Revenue. Even the Government minister during the parliamentary debates on section 64 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992 acknowledged that there had been undoubted disparity of treatment between the Woolwich and the other building societies.",

In conclusion, I find that there was insufficient objective and reasonable justification for the discrimination suffered by the applicants in the enjoyment of their rights set forth in Article 6 of the Convention, given that the legal proceedings for restitution initiated by the applicants following the Woolwich 1 and 2 decisions were effectively stifled by the legislative action.",
