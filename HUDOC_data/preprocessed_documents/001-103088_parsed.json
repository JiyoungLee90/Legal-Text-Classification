In particular, section III of the Regulation sets out the procedure for initial steps to be taken by medical personnel of a detention facility on admission of a detainee. On arrival at a temporary detention facility all detainees must be subjected to preliminary medical examination before they are placed in cells shared by other inmates. The examination is performed with the aim of identifying individuals suffering from contagious diseases or in need of urgent medical assistance. Particular attention must be paid to individuals suffering from contagious conditions. No later than three days after the detainee's arrival at the detention facility, he should receive an in-depth medical examination, including fluorography. During the in-depth examination a prison doctor should record the detainee's complaints, study his medical and personal history, record injuries if present, and recent tattoos, and schedule additional medical procedures if necessary.

Primarily restating the European Prison Rules and CPT standards, the Recommendation went beyond reiteration of the principles in some aspects to include more specific discussion of the management of certain common problems including transmissible diseases. In particular, in respect of cases of tuberculosis, the Committee of Ministers stressed that all necessary measures should be applied to prevent the propagation of this infection, in accordance with relevant legislation in this area. Therapeutic intervention should be of a standard equal to that outside prison. The medical services of the local chest physician should be requested in order to obtain the long-term advice that is required for this condition, as is practised in the community, in accordance with relevant legislation (Section 41).",

This was due to a combination of factors, including: (i)\u00a0increased poverty, (ii) under-funding of TB services and health services in general, (iii) diagnostic and therapeutic approaches that were designed for a centralized command-and-control TB system, but were unable to cope with the social mobility and relative freedom of the post-Soviet era, and (iv) technical inadequacies and outdated equipment. Migration of populations from ex-Soviet republics with high TB burdens also increased the problem. Prevalence rates were many times higher in the prison system than in the general population. Treatment included lengthy hospitalizations, variations among clinicians and patients in the therapeutic regimen, and frequent recourse to surgery. A shrinking health budget resulted in an erratic supply of anti-TB drugs and laboratory supplies, reduced quality control in TB dispensaries and laboratories, and inadequate treatment. The social conditions favouring the spread of TB, combined with inadequate systems for diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance, as well as increased drug resistance, produced a serious public health problem.",

The Court also does not lose sight of the applicant's argument, supported by written statements of other inmates, that the windows in the cells were covered with metal shutters. In these circumstances the Court is not convinced by the Government's argument that the windows had given access to natural light and air. The metal construction on the windows, as described by the applicant, significantly reduced the amount of daylight that could penetrate into the cell, and cut off fresh air. It therefore appears that for almost two and a half years, between 30 January 2002 and 16 July 2004, the applicant had to spend a considerable part of each day in the facility in a cramped cell with no window in the proper sense of the word (compare Peers v.

However, for the Government to argue effectively that the applicant was infected with Koch's bacillus even before his arrest, it would have been necessary for the authorities to perform the Mantoux test on the applicant upon his admission to the detention facility and in addition to conduct a fluorography examination, or a special tuberculosis blood test which would have indicated the presence of the latent infection. However, as is apparent from the parties' submissions, apart from fluorography examinations Russian custodial facilities did not use any other method of screening for the presence of MBT in detainees at the time of their admission. The possibility that the applicant might never have been exposed to the infection prior to his arrest and that he only contracted tuberculosis during his detention cannot therefore be ruled out, particularly as the severe overcrowding, unsatisfactory access to fresh air and poor sanitary conditions in which the applicant found himself in facility no. IZ-18/1 (see paragraphs 85-91 above) constitute a recognised setting for the transmission of tuberculosis (see Ghavtadze v. Georgia, no. 23204/07, \u00a7 86, 3 March 2009, and, most recently, Pakhomov v. , no. 44917/08, 30 September 2009, \u00a7 64). Nor does the Court lose sight of the statistical estimations that place Russia among one of the twenty-two high-burden countries for tuberculosis in the world, it having recorded a dramatic increase in the incidence of the disease in the 1990s, with some reports indicating that TB is twenty times more prevalent in Russian prisons than in the country in general (see paragraph 79 above). With all these considerations in mind, added to the fact that the first five fluorography tests performed between January 2002 and June 2004 showed no disease in the applicant's lungs, the Court considers it most probable that the applicant contracted tuberculosis in detention facility no. IZ-18/1 (see Staykov v. , no. 49438/99, \u00a7 81, 12 October 2006; Yakovenko v.

A lack of or inadequate treatment for tuberculosis, particularly when the disease has been contracted in detention, is most certainly a matter of concern for the Court. Its ordinary task in such cases is therefore to assess the quality of medical services rendered to applicants and, if they have been deprived of adequate medical assistance, to ascertain whether this amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see Sarban v. , no. 3456/05, \u00a7 78, 4\u00a0October 2005).",

In this connection, the Court observes that no evidence before it corroborates the applicant's claims as to belated screening for the illness. In fact, the applicant did not provide any explanation in support of his argument, merely noting a general deterioration of his health preceding the discovery of the disease during the medical check-up on 20 June 2004. At the same time the Court does not detect any delay on the part of the prison authorities in responding to the applicant's health complaints. In particular, the Court notes that the applicant was promptly seen by an attending prison doctor, who studied his medical history, recorded the complaints and scheduled an X-ray examination. As the applicant's medical history shows, on 20 June 2004, that is merely four months after the previous chest fluorography test in February 2004, the applicant was subjected to a complete medical check-up, including an X-ray examination. Another radiography test followed shortly after and it confirmed the discovery of the illness. The Court is therefore convinced that the facility's medical personnel acted timeously and diligently in identifying the illness, through the key measure in the modern strategy of tuberculosis control and treatment.",

In particular, the evidence put before the Court shows that the Russian authorities used all existing means (sputum smear bacterioscopy, culture testing and chest X-ray exams) for correct diagnosis of the applicant, having considered the extent of the disease and determined the severity of the tuberculosis, in order to prescribe appropriate treatment.",

During the entire period of his treatment the applicant was subjected to regular and systematic clinical and radiological assessment and bacteriological monitoring, which formed part of the comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at curing the disease.

The Court notes that the intake of medicines by the applicant was supervised and directly observed by the facility medical personnel throughout the whole treatment regimen as required by the DOTS strategy. In addition, in a situation where the authorities met with the applicant's occasional refusal to cooperate and his resistance to the treatment, they offered him psychological support and attention, having provided clear and complete explanations about medical procedures, the sought-after outcome of the treatment and the negative side-effects of interrupting the treatment, irregular medication or fasting (contrast Gorodnitchev, cited above, \u00a7 91; Testa v.

The Government alleged that the force had been used lawfully in response to the applicant's unruly conduct. The force did not exceed what was reasonable and necessary in the circumstances of the case. As is apparent from the reports by the warders and their interviews with the investigator, when in the morning of 10 July 2003 the applicant had refused to leave the van and proceed to the courthouse, the warders had overpowered him and had carried him there. Similar events had occurred in the afternoon of the same day, when the applicant had not only refused to leave the van, but had also attempted to bite a warder (see paragraph 41 above). The applicant did not dispute that he had disobeyed the warders' orders and had actively resisted them, to the point of using violence. However, relying on the statement by his fellow inmate, Mr H., he submitted that the warders had repeatedly hit and kicked him in various parts of his body and had hit him on the head with handcuffs, causing the cut on his forehead.",

The Court, however, cannot overlook the inconsistencies that abounded in the various accounts of the events which the applicant gave in his submissions to the Court and complaints to domestic authorities. For instance, during the first interview with the investigator of the Industrialniy District prosecutor's office the applicant complained that in response to his attempt to bite a warder the latter had cut the applicant's forehead with handcuffs (see paragraph 41 above). When questioned for the second time the applicant amended his version of events by asserting that the warder had also cut his lip (see paragraph 45 above). However, in his application to the Court the applicant described the events on 10 July 2003 as a severe beating, alleging that the warders had repeatedly kicked and hit him. Following the communication of his complaint to the Government and in response to their memorial, the applicant gave an account of events that was similar to what he had told the investigator in the aftermath of the events of 10\u00a0July 2003.",

It is also surprising that, having actively resisted the warders' orders himself, Mr H. was able to take note of the exact circumstances in which the applicant had sustained an injury. The Court does not lose sight of the fact that in describing the manner in which a warder had hit the applicant on the forehead, Mr H. stated that the warder had put the handcuffs on his fist to resemble a knuckle-duster. However, that description sits ill with the nature of the applicant's injury: a short and narrow laceration on the forehead. It rather supports the version that the injury resulted from an inadvertent application of force during the confrontation between the applicant and the warders, or an accidental fall in the prison van.",

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. An obligation to investigate \u201cis not an obligation of result, but of means\u201d: not every investigation should necessarily be successful or come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimant's account of events; however, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Thus, the investigation of serious allegations of ill-treatment must be thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0107 et seq., and Assenov and Others v.

In the present case, despite the Government's surprising argument to the contrary, the Court finds it established that the applicant complained of ill-treatment to the prosecution authorities on 11\u00a0July 2003 (see paragraph 38 above). The Court is mindful of the fact that the prosecutor's office opened its investigation immediately after being notified of the alleged beatings. On the same day the applicant was subjected to a medical examination authorised by the investigating authorities. Further steps were promptly taken in the aftermath of the events under examination. In particular, the authorities took significant investigative measures, including collecting an official explanatory report from the head of the warders' service and questioning the warders, the fellow inmate of the applicant, his co-defendant and lawyer. They also called for an expert medical examination of the warder who had been injured by the applicant when the latter had offered resistance. The Court does not find the fact that the three investigator's decisions were annulled by a court to be evidence of any inefficiency in the investigation, since from the materials in the case file it appears that the investigating authorities made diligent efforts to establish the circumstances of the events and to reconcile conflicting versions of events. In particular, they persistently tried to identify and interview additional witnesses who could have shed light on the events in question. They also further questioned the known witnesses in order to eliminate or explain the discrepancies which had arisen in their previous statements. The Court is also mindful of the fact that the authorities' task was significantly complicated by the applicant's confusing complaints and inconsistent description of the events. The investigators were forced to proceed more cautiously and thoroughly when processing vague or perplexing information from the applicant. At the same time the Court is satisfied that the investigators did not delay questioning the applicant in person and also provided him with opportunities to clarify his testimony. In addition, the Court does not overlook the fact that the applicant did not complain that he had not been duly informed of the progress of the investigation.",

The Court firstly reiterates its constant approach that an applicant cannot be blamed for taking full advantage of the resources afforded by national law in the defence of his interests (see Kolomiyets v. Russia, no. 76835/01, \u00a7 29, 22 February 2007). The Government did not provide any evidence in support of their allegations that the applicant's unsuccessful requests were improper and contributed to the length of the proceedings. At the same time, the Court does not lose sight of the Government's argument that a substantial delay in the proceedings was caused by the four consecutive dismissals of the applicant's legal-aid lawyers. Each time a dismissal took place, the trial court was forced to adjourn hearings for the purpose of assigning new counsel to the applicant and giving the lawyer an opportunity to study the case file. Bearing in mind the prominent place which the right to a fair trial holds in a democratic society (see, inter alia, De Cubber v. , 26 October 1984, \u00a7\u00a030, Series A no. 86), the Court considers that the State should bear responsibility for a delay incurred through a successful challenge by a defendant of State-appointed counsel. The Court reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can fulfil the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v.  (No. 2), no. 72159/01, \u00a7 57, 4 March 2004). Therefore, the responsibility for an aggregate delay of approximately six months, caused by successful requests for dismissal of legal-aid lawyers, rests ultimately with the State (see, mutatis mutandis, Marchenko v. , no. 29510/04, \u00a7\u00a039, 5\u00a0October 2006, and Sidorenko v. Russia, no. 4459/03, \u00a7 32, 8 March 2007).",

In particular, the Court observes that having been opened in January 2002, the pre-trial investigation was already completed in July 2002 when the case was transferred to the trial court. However, the preliminary examination of the case by the trial court led to the remittal of the case to the investigation authorities for correction of procedural defects. The transfer of the case from the trial court to the investigation authorities occurred on three further occasions, causing an aggregate delay of approximately eight months in the examination of the case (see paragraphs 12, 13, 16 and 17 above).",

It therefore considers that the delay occasioned by the trial court's failure to discipline the participants in the proceedings is attributable to the State (see Ku\u015bmierek v.

The Government argued that his transfer to the correctional colony in the Novosibirsk Region had been carried out in accordance with the requirements of Russian law, in particular section 73 of the Code on the Execution of Criminal Sentences, as the applicant had lived in Novosibirsk prior to his conviction, had family there and had been sent to serve his sentence in a correctional colony in the Novosibirsk Region following his final conviction. He had been detained in the  temporarily, having been placed in a specialised medical detention facility. The Government insisted that the applicant also had not argued that he had been threatened or intimidated. They drew the Court's attention to the fact that it had taken almost eight months after the meetings with Ms Rassadina before the applicant had complained about them to the Court. In the Government's opinion, by lodging his Article 34 complaint the applicant had merely attempted to manipulate the State into allowing his further stay in the detention facility in the . The complaint to the Court was sent not long before the transfer was to be effected. The Government noted that the applicant had never made use of domestic avenues to seek a stay or annulment of his transfer to the Novosibirsk Region.",

It firstly observes that since the appointment of the representative in 2007 and the Court's subsequent notification to the applicant that it would correspond only with the representative, the applicant has approached the Court directly, bypassing his representative.

The Court is also mindful of the fact that numerous letters from the applicant's representative to the Court, including those received in 2008, were always accompanied by the applicant's lengthy handwritten submissions.

It is obvious that where the settlement has been secured in collaboration with the Court, no question would normally arise as to whether the applicant has acted of his own free will. However, to deny a State the right to contact an applicant directly for the purpose of settling the case pending before the Court would have the effect of substantially discouraging settlement discussions, stemming the free flow of ideas and information, offers and claims within the settlement negotiations, and ultimately placing a heavy burden on the Court. The parties should be left with ample room to explore the possibility of resolving disputes otherwise than by a judgment.

It notes the Government's argument that by virtue of the Russian Code on the Execution of Criminal Sentences, in particular section 73, it was within the State's discretion to assign the applicant to a correctional facility in the Novosibirsk Region, that is the region where he had lived before the conviction (see paragraph 72 above). The applicant started serving his sentence in the Novosibirsk Region and was only transferred to a medical detention facility in the  temporarily. The Court is unconvinced by the applicant's argument that the State officials had threatened him with transfer back to the Novosibirsk Region to influence his decision to settle the case pending before the Court. In this respect, the Court attributes particular weight to the fact that it was more than seven months after the negotiations between the applicant and State officials had taken place, and not long before the transfer back to the Novosibirsk Region was to be effected, that he decided to raise his Article 34 complaint with the Court. In view of the finding of the absence of any indication of interference by the State with the applicant's correspondence or hindrance of his contact with his representative or wife (see paragraphs 164-167 above), the Court is prepared to accept the Government's argument that the applicant's delay in filing the complaint under Article 34 was a sign that the complaint itself was no more that a disguised attempt to induce the authorities to annul his transfer to the Novosibirsk Region. This conclusion is strengthened by the Court's inability to find any signs of negative consequences for the applicant following the State's failure to secure a friendly settlement. In addition, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant has never attempted to approach the competent domestic authorities with a request to determine his further place of detention in the . In these circumstances the Court is unable to conclude that the actions of the authorities can be described as \u201cimproper\u201d.

The Court further observes that the applicant suffered humiliation and distress on account of the inhuman and degrading conditions of his detention and the excessive length of criminal proceedings. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant's suffering and frustration cannot be compensated by a mere finding of a violation. However, the particular amount claimed appears excessive. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR\u00a015,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",

It is clear from the length and detail of the pleadings submitted by the applicant that a great deal of work was carried out on his behalf. Keeping in mind that the applicant was granted legal aid by the Court in the amount of 850 euros and that some of his complaints were declared inadmissible, the Court awards EUR 3,000 to the applicant in respect of costs and expenses for his representation before the Court, together with any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
