Italy [GC], no.\u00a016483/12, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2016 (extracts)), the Court is thus convinced that the decision of the first-instance court to proceed with the hearing in the counsel\u2019s absence was reasonable. The domestic court had no choice but to continue with the detention hearing, to preserve the expedient nature of the proceedings required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, while at the same time trying to safeguard the applicant\u2019s defence rights by appointing legal aid counsel. The Court is not convinced that the assistance rendered to the applicant by that lawyer was of manifestly poor quality. As follows from the detention order of 21 December 2006, the lawyer argued the applicant\u2019s case, having cited a number of grounds warranting his release. As the Court has previously held that a State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes or chosen by the accused. It follows from the independence of the legal profession from the State that the conduct of the defence is essentially a matter between the defendant and his counsel, whether counsel be appointed under a legal-aid scheme or be privately financed (see, mutatis mutandis, Sannino v. Italy, no. 30961/03, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2006VI). The Court does not find any evidence in the case-file materials to support the applicant\u2019s assertion that the legal services by lawyer N. were inadequate. The mere fact, that the District Court upheld the prosecution motion and extended the applicant\u2019s detention does not render the legal assistance provided to the applicant by lawyer N. ineffective.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that it is permissible for the court of appeal reviewing a detention order to only hear the detainee\u2019s lawyer, if the hearing before the first-instance court offered sufficient procedural guarantees (see Lebedev v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7 114). Given that the applicant did not indicate any deficiency of the detention hearing held by the first-instance court on 19\u00a0January 2007, which could have prevented the upper court from examining his appeal in his absence, the Court is of the view that the appeal hearing on 8\u00a0February 2007 satisfied the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. Accordingly there has been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention on that account.",

The trial court did not need to determine the detention matter since the applicant\u2019s detention had already been extended by the proper detention order of 16\u00a0March 2007 until 4\u00a0April 2007. The trial court had merely restated what had been decided on 16 March 2007, by noting the lack of necessity to change the measure of restraint. In the Government\u2019s view, the Regional Court, when ordering the preliminary hearing, had acted within its competence and in accordance with Articles 227-229 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure. The Government also contested the applicant\u2019s argument that the appeal review of the decision to hold the preliminary hearing fell short of the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",

The Court notes, that the preliminary hearing was scheduled for a day before the expiration of the detention term on 4 April 2007, covered by the detention order of 16 March 2007 and was meant to be exclusively devoted to the determination of the detention issue. While making reference to the current status of the measure of restraint in his decision of 26 March 2007 the judge did no more than noted the current status of the applicant\u2019s restraint measure. He was not required, and as follows, he did not take any formal decision on the need to maintain or not the measure of restraint since that period had been already covered up to 4 April 2007 by the detention order on 16 March 2007, following a hearing which was not complained of by the applicant. When ordering the preliminary hearing the judge of the Regional Court therefore confined himself to verifying the grounds for holding it, in accordance with Article 228 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, without making any rulings apart from scheduling the date of the hearing. Therefore, the order of 26\u00a0March 2007 was of a technical organisational nature, and could not be regarded as a decision under which the applicant was deprived of his liberty Accordingly the fact that it was issued without either of the parties being present, as well as the alleged delay in the appeal review thereof, does not give rise to any issues under Article 5\u00a0\u00a7 4 of the Convention. The Court therefore finds that there was no violation of that Convention provision on that account.",
