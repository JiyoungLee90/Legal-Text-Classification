In any event, the Government asserted that under the domestic legislation the first-instance court could have issued a detention order even if another measure of restraint were not previously applied in respect of the applicant. In view of the above, the Government considered that the quashing of the detention order of 4 June 2007 did not render the applicant\u2019s detention between 8 June and 18 July 2007 unlawful (see Riccardi v. Romania, no.\u00a03048/04, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54, 3 April 2012).",
