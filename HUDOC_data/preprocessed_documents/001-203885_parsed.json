In support of his request he submitted that numerous problems had come to light during the vote-counting operations in the constituency. He explained that the irregularities in question could have affected the distribution of seats among the different electoral lists, and could have resulted in the allocation of one or two seats to the PTB-GO! list, in view of the very small number of votes by which the party had fallen short. In particular, the applicant complained that: witnesses present at some of the counting stations during the vote count had pointed to fatigue as a potential source of errors in the counting operations, some of which had lasted more than twelve hours without a break; the physical conditions in which the counting had taken place had been poor; some mistakes had occurred because counting stations had been set up hurriedly on the actual day of the elections and because the presiding and other officers of polling and counting stations had had insufficient training; some ballot papers had been found several days after the elections, and it could not be ascertained whether they had been counted or not; some mistakes had been discovered because the ballot papers had been too large in relation to the small size of the boxes that had to be ticked, and the red pencils distributed to voters had not left a clear mark on the pink ballot papers when they had not been pressed down hard enough; and several witnesses had reported that, contrary to the law in force, ballot papers containing marks or symbols which did not identify the voter had been declared spoiled, even though the votes had been validly cast.

Drawing on the Credentials Committee\u2019s findings, the Walloon Parliament observed first of all that the note appended to the Committee\u2019s report indicated that the distribution of seats was liable to change if the 21,385 ballot papers declared blank, spoiled or disputed were ultimately deemed to be valid votes, and that that change was also likely to affect the distribution of seats in other constituencies in Hainaut Province as a result of the \u201crelated lists\u201d system. However, the number of votes by which the applicant\u2019s list would have failed to qualify was different in each scenario considered. It could have been fifteen votes in one scenario and as many as 1,582 in another. In any event, the Walloon Parliament found that most of the grievances raised by the applicant related to inherent features of the electoral system in general, and that it was not its task, in the context of the procedure for examining credentials, to cast doubt on the legal validity of the relevant rules. Some of the grievances had arisen from findings which, however regrettable, could have been made during any elections and in the vast majority of constituencies. Furthermore, the press articles submitted by the applicant did not constitute admissible evidence in the context of an electoral dispute, and the witness statements should have been referred to in the notice of results from the counting stations concerned, rather than being submitted as solemn declarations after the event. The Walloon Parliament further noted that the number of ballots declared blank, spoiled or disputed had been lower than at the previous elections in June 2009, and was thus unlikely in itself to arouse suspicion. Contrary to what the applicant had maintained, it was accepted, in electoral theory and practice, that any handwritten annotation other than the actual vote constituted an unlawful mark within the meaning of Article 157 of the Electoral Code, thus spoiling the ballot in question. Nevertheless, some members of the Walloon Parliament were alarmed that votes cast using anything other than a red pencil had been deemed spoiled by some but not all counting stations, and consideration was given to the fact that several witnesses had felt that some ballot papers had been wrongly declared spoiled. In any event, the applicant\u2019s complaint had not indicated that these potential irregularities had been noted in any official record.",

The plenary session then decides on the credentials committees\u2019 findings by means of a separate vote on each complaint (Article 12 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2). If no majority can be reached at the plenary session, the credentials committees\u2019 findings are sent back to them so that they can draw up a fresh proposal after giving the complainants the opportunity to make further submissions (Article 12 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03 and 4).

This means both that the time limits for appeals must be very short and that the appeal body must make its ruling as quickly as possible.

It had subsequently been introduced in the countries of Europe as they had moved towards parliamentary systems in the course of the nineteenth century. This system, firmly rooted in the constitutional history of various countries, was based on a particular approach to the separation of powers and on the idea of Parliament as a sovereign body with specific rights that no judicial authority could impinge upon. Nevertheless, incidents and abuses observed in certain countries had pointed to the need to transfer electoral disputes to independent and impartial bodies, and had led several countries to divest their parliaments of responsibility for supervising the election of their members. Twentieth-century European constitutions had generally abolished the power of parliaments to be the judge over elections, at least at last instance, and most European States had now assigned that power to a judicial body, although there was still considerable variety in the remedies available in those States.",

Access to a judicial remedy was only one of the many factors to be taken into account in determining whether a system of validation of credentials was in conformity with the Convention. The Court should attach significant weight to the discretion enjoyed by Parliament: if clear and accessible rules and procedures regulated the holding of elections and thus limited the scope of Parliament\u2019s discretion, this significantly minimised the risk of arbitrary action and politically motivated decisions, and was therefore indicative of a system that ensured the fairness and objectivity required by the Convention.

There are numerous ways of organising and running electoral systems and a wealth of differences, inter alia, in historical development, cultural diversity and political thought within Europe (ibid., \u00a7\u00a061; see also \u017ddanoka, cited above, \u00a7 103, and Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066).

It has, however, emphasised that the State\u2019s margin of appreciation in this regard is limited by the obligation to respect the fundamental principle of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, namely \u201cthe free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\u201d (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, \u00a7\u00a054; Podkolzina, cited above, \u00a7 33; T\u0103nase v.\u00a0Moldova [GC], no.\u00a07/08, \u00a7\u00a0157, ECHR 2010; and Cernea v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a043609/10, \u00a7\u00a040, 27\u00a0February 2018).",

They may be summarised as follows. Parliament is a unique forum for debate in a democratic society, which is of fundamental importance (\u00a7 138). There is a close nexus between an effective political democracy and the effective operation of Parliament (\u00a7\u00a0141). The rules concerning the internal operation of Parliament are the exemplification of the well-established principle of the autonomy of Parliament. In accordance with this principle, Parliament is entitled, to the exclusion of other powers and within the limits of the constitutional framework, to regulate its own internal affairs, for example the composition of its bodies. This forms part of \u201cthe jurisdictional autonomy of Parliament\u201d (\u00a7 142). In principle, the rules concerning the internal functioning of national parliaments, as an aspect of parliamentary autonomy, fall within the margin of appreciation of the Contracting States (\u00a7 143). Nevertheless, the breadth of the margin of appreciation to be afforded to the State in this sphere depends on a number of factors (\u00a7\u00a0144). As regards Article 10 of the Convention, the Court has noted that the discretion enjoyed by the national authorities is not unfettered but should be compatible with the concepts of \u201ceffective political democracy\u201d and \u201cthe rule of law\u201d to which the Preamble to the Convention refers (\u00a7 147).",

Moreover, the conclusions of the Committee\u2019s report indicate that the members in question were nevertheless present during the deliberations on the applicant\u2019s complaint and voted on the final report to be submitted to the plenary Parliament, which included the opinion on the merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint (see paragraph 16 above).",

The decision was therefore taken by a body that included members of parliament whose election could have been called into question if the applicant\u2019s complaint had been declared well-founded and whose interests were directly opposed to his own. However, the Court has previously held that an individual whose appointment as a member of parliament has been rejected has legitimate grounds to fear that the large majority of members of the body that reviewed the lawfulness of the elections, where those members represented other political parties, may have had an interest contrary to his own (see Grosaru, cited above, \u00a7 54).",

In the present case, the risks of political decisions being taken on account of the foregoing considerations (see paragraphs 103-106 above) were not averted by the applicable voting rules. The decision on the applicant\u2019s complaint was taken by a simple majority. A voting regulation of that kind allowed the prospective majority to impose its own view, even though there would also be a significant minority. Thus, contrary to the Venice Commission\u2019s recommendations (see paragraph 64 above), the rule on voting by simple majority that was applied without any adjustment in this particular case was incapable of protecting the applicant \u2013 a candidate from a political party not represented in the Walloon Parliament prior to the elections of 25\u00a0May 2014 \u2013 from a partisan decision.",

Furthermore, regulations establishing the procedure for examining complaints concerning the election of the Walloon Parliament were adopted on 25 April 2018. The regulations provide for a number of procedural safeguards: complaints are examined by the Credentials Committee at a public sitting; the complainant is given a hearing, and may be assisted by a lawyer in making his or her submissions; members of the Committee may put questions, request documents, interview witnesses and order a recount of ballots before formulating their draft decision; and reasons are given for the draft decision (see paragraph\u00a031 above).",

In that case, the Court found that the second condition had not been met, since \u201cthe full responsibility for assessing the applicant\u2019s linguistic knowledge was left to a single civil servant, who had exorbitant power in the matter\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 36).",

Without entering into extensive legal theoretical considerations, it suffices to note here very briefly, in particular, that in numerous legal systems there are valid legal rules which do not have a textual basis in legal provisions. Secondly, the reasoning looks only at specific provisions of domestic law without trying to establish the totality of the applicable relevant legal rules and principles of law. In particular, it fails to consider whether the general principle of proportionality is applicable and circumscribes the discretion of the parliament. One also has to note here that certain principles guiding the bodies adjudicating in electoral matters have been developed in the Court\u2019s case-law (see, for instance, Riza and Others v. Bulgaria, nos.\u00a048555/10 and 48377/10, \u00a7\u00a7 153-79, 13 October 2015; Davydov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a075947/11, \u00a7\u00a7 335-38, 30 May 2017; and Kovach v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a039424/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054-62, ECHR 2008). These principles circumscribe the powers of the Walloon Parliament. Thirdly, it does not appear necessary to adopt very specific legal rules if general legal principles would offer sufficient guidance to the decision-making body. In any event, the main guiding principle should be that of adequacy: the reaction of the body competent to examine electoral appeals should be adequate to the nature of the irregularities established and should especially take into account their impact upon the outcome of the elections.",

The composition of the relevant body and the voting rules must leave as little scope as possible for partisan decisions, in keeping with the requirement for objective impartiality that applies in judicial proceedings [footnote omitted]. Direct opponents must be excluded in each case. The rules on majorities required for decisions must ensure fair representation. Clearly, it is within this set of rules that the greatest risk of lack of objectivity in purely parliamentary systems lies. The issue is not, however, that much different from that of partisan electoral commissions (whose members are appointed by political parties), which are very often appeal bodies. It is therefore possible to draw on the recommendation in the Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters, which considers it at least \u2018desirable that electoral commissions take decisions by a qualified majority or by consensus\u2019 [footnote omitted].\u201d",
