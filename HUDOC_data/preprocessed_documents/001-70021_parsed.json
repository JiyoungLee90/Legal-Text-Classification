I found the information provided by the commanding officer to be satisfactory. On 26 January 2001 I contacted the \u015e\u0131rnak, Cizre and \u0130dil public prosecutors' offices by telephone and asked whether the missing men had been detained within their sectors. They said they had not. Later that day Mr\u00a0Tan\u0131\u015f arrived with the father of one of the missing men. We took a statement from him, they lodged their complaint and the investigation began that day. On 27 and 28 January I took a statement from someone who said that he saw Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz enter the district gendarmerie command and gave instructions to the commanding officer to send full lists of the names of the soldiers and officers who were on the premises on 25 January 2001. I also questioned five or six soldiers who were on duty that day. I repeat that it would not have been possible to conceal any detention from me and that there would have been no point in my going to the station. On 29 January 2001, in accordance with our internal organisation procedure, I handed the investigation file over to my colleague G\u00fcndo\u011fan \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, who took evidence from various gendarmes and members of the armed forces. On the same day a delegation from the Human Rights Association came to see me and asked me questions about the investigation. I did not say that they should look for Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz in \u015e\u0131rnak. I always spoke to S\u00fcleyman Can on the telephone and did not meet him in person. We did not receive any information about what had happened to the missing men. I saw the visitors' register and the custody record on 29 January 2001 and checked the signatures.\u201d",

It has previously held that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of individual petition instituted under Article 34 that States should furnish all necessary facilities to make possible a proper and effective examination of applications (see, for example, Tanr\u0131kulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7 70, ECHR 1999-IV). It is inherent in proceedings relating to cases of this nature, where an individual applicant accuses State agents of violating his or her rights under the Convention, that in certain instances only the respondent Government have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. A failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention, but may also give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations (see Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 70, ECHR 2000-VI, and Tepe v. Turkey, no. 27244/95, \u00a7 128, 9 May 2003). The same principle will apply where the State fails to secure the attendance of witnesses at a hearing, thereby making it far more difficult to establish the facts.",

He explained how a few weeks before his son went missing he himself had been arrested in Cizre, while travelling to \u015e\u0131rnak, by members of the security forces who had told him that the commanding officer of the \u015e\u0131rnak regiment, Levent Ers\u00f6z, wished to speak to him. He went to \u015e\u0131rnak, as requested, on 2 January 2001. Levent Ers\u00f6z told him to end his involvement with HADEP and asked where his son was. On being told that he was in Diyarbak\u0131r, he instructed \u015euayip  to tell him to come and see him immediately. A few days later, \u015euayip  received a telephone call informing him that S\u00fcleyman Can, the commanding officer of the Silopi district gendarmerie wished to see him. He complied with that request and, during his meeting with S\u00fcleyman Can, he took a call from Levent Ers\u00f6z, who instructed him to tell Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f that unless he went to see him that same day, he would be killed if he ever set foot in \u015e\u0131rnak province again. Later that month, \u015euayip  received a further summons from S\u00fcleyman Can, who told him once again that he had to persuade his son to end his involvement with HADEP and that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f would be in trouble unless he resigned from the party. S\u00fcleyman Can instructed \u015euayip  to send Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f to see him. Shortly afterwards, his son told him that he had been summoned by S\u00fcleyman Can and told to leave HADEP. He refused, saying that the party was legal and that if he did not set up a branch, someone else would.

When he told them that he was not at the station and that he did not know when he would be back, they had said that they would wait for a while and, after signing the visitors' register, they had been directed to the waiting-room on the second floor next to the commanding officer's office. Selim G\u00fcl said that he spotted Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f and Ebubekir Deniz by chance as he went past the room where they were waiting. They told him that they were waiting for S\u00fcleyman Can as they wished to speak to him about Ebubekir Deniz's lorry, which had been seized as he was suspected of involvement in the illegal importation of fuel. After a brief discussion the two men got up to leave. Ebubekir Deniz left the room shortly before Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f, who handed him a HADEP document and a piece of paper with information about contraband taken out of the inside pocket of his jacket. Selim G\u00fcl said that he saw the two men go downstairs and leave the station by the main entrance. Veysel Ate\u015f said that when the two men returned to the main entrance, Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f said that they had decided to leave as S\u00fcleyman Can had not arrived, but that they would come back later. Veysel Ate\u015f handed back Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f's mobile phone, the two men signed the register and went out into the street.",

It finds it hard to accept that, if the two men had decided of their own volition to see S\u00fcleyman Can in an attempt to recover the confiscated vehicle, they would have gone to the station without first making an appointment or that, on being told that S\u00fcleyman Can would be out for an indefinite period, they would have said they intended to stay and await his return. Nor does the Court find it likely that the two men would have been allowed to go to the waiting-room inside a military building without an escort and to remain there on their own until, by chance, Selim G\u00fcl should happen upon them. Selim G\u00fcl's statement that he came across the two men by accident also poses a problem. He acknowledged in his deposition that he had never met Ebubekir Deniz, that neither man had been to the station to meet him and that their visit was unexpected, as its sole acknowledged purpose was to discuss the issue of Ebubekir Deniz's vehicle with S\u00fcleyman  However, in his testimony he said that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f had come to the station as an informant to deliver to him, out of Ebubekir Deniz's sight, documents containing information on the HADEP party of which both men were members. The explanation given by Selim G\u00fcl \u2013 that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f was an informant and had already supplied information in the past to S\u00fcleyman Can, with whom he was in close contact, and to whom he may have intended to give further information on this occasion \u2013 is not readily reconciled with S\u00fcleyman Can's testimony before the delegates that Serdar Tan\u0131\u015f had never previously personally supplied him with any information about HADEP. Since the documents he is alleged to have handed over to Selim G\u00fcl were also decreed to be confidential, the delegates were unable to consult them or to establish their content to see whether they supported or contradicted Selim G\u00fcl's account.",

However, the witness was unable to explain why the page containing the six entries for 25 January 2001 did not contain the duty officer's signature, whereas the corresponding page for 5 January 2001 did. In addition, the Court is struck by the fact that, although the missing men's disappearance was reported on the afternoon of 25 January 2001, the visitors' register containing the entries for that date was not submitted to the public prosecutor concerned until 29 January 2001. Whatever the case may be, the Court does not consider that Veysel Ate\u015f's evidence or what appears to be the signatures of the two missing men definitively establishes that they left the gendarmerie station free men or that they were at liberty when they went into the street after leaving the building.",

Whether the failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee's fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on concrete elements, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 85, and Ertak v.

The passage of time may therefore to some extent affect the weight to be attached to other elements of circumstantial evidence before it can be concluded that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. The Court considers that this situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere irregular detention in violation of Article 5.
