As to the medical record made by the medical staff at Criuleni police station (see paragraph 13 above), the document stated that the findings on 16 and 21 May 2006 made no reference to objective evidence of ill-treatment (except for self-inflicted wounds on his arms) and only noted subjective information such as pain on the right side of the chest. A neurological consultation was prescribed, but that could have referred to a neurological condition, with no connection to any alleged ill-treatment. As to the findings made on 26 June 2006, they were made fifty-three days after the date of the relevant events and did not have anything in common with the alleged ill-treatment.",

It is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how the injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Selmouni cited above, \u00a7 87). It is not sufficient for the State to refer merely to the acquittal of the accused police officers in the course of a criminal prosecution, and consequently the acquittal of officers on a charge of assaulting an individual will not discharge the burden of proof on the State under Article 3 of the Convention to show that the injuries suffered by that individual whilst under police control were not caused by the police officers (see Ribitsch v.
