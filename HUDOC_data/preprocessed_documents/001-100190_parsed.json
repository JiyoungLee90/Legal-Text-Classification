It held that the length of imprisonment had been clear as soon as the amount of the guarantee had been fixed; accordingly, after knowingly accepting these conditions the applicant could not now complain that the penalty was excessive, since it was linked to the amount of the guarantee. Furthermore, the Convention did not afford a right to call into question the length of a sentence imposed by a competent court and in no way had the penalty imposed on the applicant been shown to have reached the threshold required to fall within Article 3.",

It held, however, that the Civil Court had erred in considering his detention as falling within Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), namely, detention following a conviction. His detention had its basis in Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(b), namely, to secure the fulfilment of an obligation prescribed by law. It followed that, according to Strasbourg case-law, there should be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the deprivation of liberty and the fulfilment of the obligation. In the present case the applicant had undertaken an obligation knowing the unambiguous and non-arbitrary consequences it entailed, according to a pre-established rate which remained valid up to the date of payment. The fact that no ceiling applied to the provision in question did not affect the proportionality between the obligation and the consequences it entailed. Absolving a person of such an obligation when it had not been fulfilled would render the notion of guarantees against detention futile. This reasoning applied to both Article 5 and Article 3 of the Convention. Indeed, the applicant had neither contested the proportionality of the amount specified in the guarantee imposed nor stated that it was beyond his means. It followed that it could not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Notwithstanding that elements of shocking disproportionality could raise an issue under Article 3 (see L\u00e9ger v. France, no. 19324/02, 11 April 2006, and Price v. the United Kingdom, no. 33394/96, ECHR 2001-VII), this was not so in the present case.",

Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element (see Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, ECHR 2008)",

The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness. A period of detention will in principle be lawful if it is carried out pursuant to a court order (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 42, Reports 1996-III). However, the domestic authorities must strike a fair balance between the importance in a democratic society of securing compliance with a lawful order of a court, and the importance of the right to liberty (see Paradis and Others, cited above). The Court considers that in such circumstances issues such as the purpose of the order, the feasibility of compliance with the order, and the duration of the detention are matters to be taken into consideration.

It notes however that in 2006 the applicant was indigent and unable to pay the said amount, although he might have been able to do so when he assented to the obligation in 2001. Indeed, it would have been reasonable for the applicant to assume that the proceedings against him would not have lasted over five years. The Court observes that the applicant had been under strict bail conditions (see paragraph 8 above) for nearly five years. Thus, it is plausible to conclude that he had been unable to earn a living during that period. In such circumstances, it was unrealistic to expect that the applicant would be able to comply with the court order.",

In the present case, the detention for non-compliance with a court order has so far amounted to over four years and is set to last for over five years and six months in total. Moreover, this period was not subject to remission, as would have been the case had the applicant been detained after conviction (Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a)).

France, 8 June 1995, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 317-B, and G\u00f6ktan, cited above, \u00a7 48) and the Government have acknowledged that in the present case the measure was punitive in nature (see paragraph 33 above). The Court sees no reason to differ. In particular, it notes that imprisonment in default, as applied to the failure to pay a guarantee following a breach of bail conditions, may give rise to a situation where an individual is imprisoned for a longer time than the term he would have served had he been found guilty of the crime he was charged with. The situation would be even more paradoxical if the individual were to be acquitted of such charges. The Court, furthermore, has difficulty in accepting that the detention of the applicant could secure the fulfilment of the obligation as his indigent state (see paragraph 42 above) will undoubtedly persist and quite plausibly increase while he remains in jail.",

As a result he has been detained, and will continue to be so, for a total of more than five and a half years (two thousand days), unless he pays the sum of EUR 23,300. The Court observes that Maltese law, in respect of the circumstances in which a bail bond will be forfeited to the Government as a result of a failure to observe bail conditions (Article 579 of the CC), makes no distinction between conditions related to the primary purpose of bail, namely appearance at the trial, and conditions related to other considerations. However, it gave the authorities discretion not to apply the said provision if the breach of conditions was not of a serious nature. In the present case, where the condition breached referred to a curfew and was not connected to the primary purpose of granting bail, the Court has difficulty in understanding the authorities\u2019 decision to apply the relevant Article. In this light, the Court finds it relevant to point out that in the absence of proper guidelines as to the exercise of discretion under Article 579, or of a distinction between breaches of conditions relating to the primary purpose of bail and other considerations, Maltese law is deficient in that it can lead to arbitrary and disproportionate results.",

However, the Court observes that Article 586 of the CC does not apply to imprisonment in default a ceiling on the duration of the detention (an individual could hypothetically be imprisoned for life) or provide for any assessment of proportionality. Therefore Maltese law is deficient also in this respect.
