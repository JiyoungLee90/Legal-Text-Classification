They pointed out, primarily, that the Court could not create a substantive right which had no legal basis in the country concerned.  domestic law did not recognise any \u201cright\u201d on the part of the applicant which could bring Article 6 \u00a7 1 into play. Under section 7 of the 1986 Law and Article 4 of the Grand-Ducal Regulation of 19 February 1989, prison leave was not a right but merely a privilege granted to prisoners. The legislature, in giving responsibility for matters relating to the execution of sentences imposed by the criminal courts to the Attorney General or his or her representative, had sought to remove the enforcement of judicial rulings from the control of the ordinary courts, whose task was confined to hearing and determining cases. Hence, the granting of prison leave would remain a matter exclusively for the Attorney General or his or her representative, ruling, in the case of persons whose sentence exceeded two years, in accordance with the majority decision of the Prison Board. Furthermore, prison leave, including the arrangements for its implementation, fell wholly within the State\u2019s powers of discretion in the sphere of justice and penal policy. Thus, a dispute (contestation) over \u201crights\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention could not be said to exist. The Government added that prisoners, who had the benefit of the safeguards provided by the Convention throughout the criminal proceedings until their conviction by the courts, had to serve their sentence to its end, forfeiting their liberty in the process. Hence, the applicant had been subjected to generally permissible restrictions applied to prisoners convicted under ordinary criminal law, arising solely out of the custodial sentence imposed on him. In that respect, the present case differed from Enea v. Italy ([GC], no. 74912/01, ECHR 2009...), where the applicant had been placed under a more severe confinement regime entailing more substantial restrictions on his rights compared with other inmates imprisoned under the ordinary criminal law. As to whether the alleged right relied upon was a \u201ccivil\u201d right, the Government argued that any supposed right to prison leave did not by its nature have mainly or exclusively pecuniary implications. The applicant\u2019s action in the administrative courts had not had a pecuniary aim, as it had sought the setting-aside of the decisions of the Prison Board rather than the recognition of a possible right to prison leave for the applicant. The outcome of the administrative proceedings, moreover, had not been directly decisive for the granting of prison leave, as the administrative courts could not substitute their assessment for that of the Prison Board. Lastly, in so far as the applicant relied on his right to see his children and reintegrate into social and professional life, the Government submitted that, if there had indeed been any restriction in that regard, it had been brought about solely by the offence which the applicant had committed and which had led to his custodial sentence. The Prison Board had taken no measures to prevent the applicant from seeing his children or resuming work. As to his social and professional reintegration, the Government pointed out that the applicant had received vocational training throughout his detention, of which he could make use when he had completed his sentence. The Government concluded that the proceedings before the Prison Board did not fall within the scope of Article 6 of the Convention.",

First of all, a substantive right to prison leave indisputably existed in the  legal system. Where a prisoner satisfied the criteria and conditions laid down in sections 8 and 13 of the 1986 Law, he or she was entitled to prison leave. This was demonstrated by the fact that the Government\u2019s representative had agreed, without any reservations, to discuss the merits of the case brought before the . In contrast to the Government, the applicant concluded that the granting of prison leave could not be regarded merely as a privilege under  law, comparable, for instance, to a grandducal pardon. It constituted a right under  law also by virtue of the fact that it was a measure reflecting a generally recognised principle of international law. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe advocated, in particular, that a system of prison leave should form an integral part of the overall regime for sentenced prisoners (Rec(2006)2, point 103.6). The applicant therefore concluded that, in line with the reasoning followed in Enea (cited above, \u00a7 101), the matter he had been unable to bring before a court should be characterised as a \u201cdispute\u201d over \u201crights\u201d for the purposes of Article 6. The applicant further argued that his right to prison leave was a \u201ccivil\u201d right and that his action had pursued several pecuniary aims. He pointed out that his requests for prison leave had been made with a view to his professional and social reintegration. He had sought to prepare the ground for securing gainful employment with a view to paying compensation to the victim and settling his debts, but also in order to avoid being a burden on society after leaving prison. The refusals by the Prison Board had been directly decisive for the civil right in question. Prison leave would also have enabled him to exercise outside prison his right of contact with his children, who were reluctant to visit him there. If the administrative courts to which he applied for judicial review had found that they had jurisdiction, they would have reviewed the lawfulness of the impugned decisions. They could then have decided to set aside the decisions and refer the case to the competent authority. The latter would have given a fresh decision which, in its turn, would have been subject to review by the administrative courts. The applicant inferred from this that the decisions of the Prison Board and the administrative courts had been directly decisive for his social rehabilitation and reintegration into the workforce; he stressed in that connection that prison leave was a first step towards qualifying for other measures relating to enforcement of his sentence. Lastly, the applicant pointed out that an individual who considered that his rights had been infringed by an administrative decision was required to have that decision set aside before bringing an action for damages against the State. Accordingly, his action before the administrative courts had also had a pecuniary aim, as it was a first step towards claiming compensation through the civil courts.",

Switzerland, no.\u00a020872/92, Commission decision of 22 February 1995, Decisions and Reports (DR) 80, p. 66; Lors\u00e9 and Others v. the Netherlands (dec.), no.\u00a052750/99, 28 August 2001; and Montcornet de Caumont v.  (dec.), no. 59290/00, ECHR 2003VII). However, the case-law has evolved in relation to proceedings concerning detention in prison. Thus, the Court has recently found Article 6 \u00a7 1 to be applicable under its civil head to proceedings concerning security and disciplinary measures in prison (see Enea, cited above, \u00a7 98; Ganci v. , no. 41576/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-26, ECHR\u00a02003XI; Musumeci v. , no. 33695/96, \u00a7 36, 11 January 2005; G\u00fclmez v. , no. 16330/02, \u00a7\u00a7 27-31, 20 May 2008; and Stegarescu and Bahrin v. , no. 46194/06, \u00a7\u00a7 35-39, 6 April 2010). In the instant case it has to be ascertained whether the issue of the fairness of the proceedings and of access to a court in order to complain of the refusal to grant prison leave should, in its turn, be examined under the civil head of Article 6 \u00a7 1, which secures to everyone the right to have \u201cany claim relating to his civil rights and obligations\u201d brought before a \u201ctribunal\u201d.",

Under the 1986 Law and the Grand-Ducal Regulation of 19 January 1989, prison leave may be granted if various criteria are met. Accordingly, the applicant could arguably maintain that, as a prisoner, he was entitled to prison leave provided that he satisfied the conditions laid down by the legislation (see, mutatis mutandis, H. v. , 30 November 1987, \u00a7 43, Series A no.\u00a0127B). The Court further observes that the restrictions on the right to a court to which the applicant claimed to have been subjected in the context of his requests for prison leave related to a set of prisoners\u2019 rights which the Council of Europe has recognised by means of the European Prison Rules, adopted by the Committee of Ministers and elaborated upon in three Recommendations (Rec(2006)2, point 103.6, Rec(2003)23 and R(82)16) (see, mutatis mutandis, Enea, cited above, \u00a7 101).

The Court points out that the proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s various requests for prison leave raised the issue of his interest in reorganising his professional and social life on his release from prison. More specifically, his requests for prison leave referred to his wish to take courses with a view to obtaining diplomas in accounting and computer use, and to complete certain administrative formalities with his bank and various institutions (in particular, the renewal of his driving licence and his consular registration card). By so doing the applicant sought to make preparations for his release to enable him to secure paid employment, settle his various debts and avoid being a burden on society. Whilst it is true that the impact on his private life was indirect, it was nevertheless beyond doubt. It should be pointed out that it is in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant, if not the greatest, opportunity of developing relationships with the outside world (see, mutatis mutandis, Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 251B, and Bigaeva v. , no. 26713/05, \u00a7 23, 28 May 2009). In these circumstances the Court considers that the restriction alleged by the applicant, in addition to its pecuniary implications, related to his personal rights, in view of the significance of the applicant\u2019s interest in resettling in society. In that connection it is of the view that the applicant\u2019s social rehabilitation was crucial to the protection of his right to lead a \u201cprivate social life\u201d and develop his social identity (see, mutatis mutandis, Bigaeva, cited above, \u00a7 22). The Council of Europe has stressed the vital role and importance of providing prisoners with possibilities for resettling successfully in society and leading a law-abiding life following their release (see Recommendation Rec(2003)23, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 9 October 2003). The Court therefore concludes that the proceedings in question related to a civil right.",

He stressed that the latter, under  law, was not an ordinary court, an administrative court or a jurisdictional organ of a professional association, but rather an administrative authority composed of the Attorney General or his or her representative, a judge and a public prosecutor, who were appointed by ministerial order. Even assuming that the Prison Board could be considered as having a judicial role, none of the due process guarantees imposed by Article 6 had been afforded to him. First of all, the Prison Board could not be said to be independent, vis-\u00e0-vis the executive or the parties, because of its composition and the way its members were appointed. Furthermore, the impartiality of the Prison Board was open to doubt, given that some of its members had been parties to the criminal proceedings and had been in charge of the applicant\u2019s prosecution. Lastly, as to the conduct of the proceedings before the Prison Board, the applicant alleged a breach of the adversarial principle and the principle of respect for the rights of the defence.

Prisoners could make a request simply by using a form provided by the prison or by means of a letter written by themselves or their lawyer. They could attach any items they considered relevant and could make observations at any time. The Board gathered all the available evidence, including the prisoner\u2019s file, and took its decision after consulting the guidance committee responsible for supervising the prisoner during his detention. Each case was examined individually, with the Board taking into consideration, among other things, the personality of the prisoner, his or her progress while in prison and the risk of a repeat offence. Refusals by the Board were accompanied by reasons and were never final, and the prisoner could refer to the reasoning of the decision in order to alter his conduct with a view to submitting a fresh request. Where a request was refused, the prisoner could make another request after two months, or even earlier if new evidence came to light. The Prison Board was made up of three members of the national legal service, appointed for a three-year term, who were independent in accordance with the Luxembourg Constitution. The members of the Board were never the same members of the legal service who had prosecuted or convicted the prisoner in question. Hence, the tasks entailed in membership of the Prison Board were entirely separate from those carried out by the prosecuting authorities. The process of prosecuting and sentencing an individual was unconnected to the mandate of the members of the national legal service appointed to sit on the Prison Board. The Government pointed out that the law had deliberately instituted a collegiate board which issued majority decisions, on the basis of the prisoner\u2019s file, with a view to affording him or her the greatest possible guarantees of independence and impartiality. On this last point, they submitted that the applicant had not adduced any actual evidence of a lack of independence or impartiality on the part of the Prison Board\u2019s members.",

Pointing out that the State had a certain margin of appreciation in this sphere, they asserted that the 1986 Law did not provide for any appeal against measures relating to the execution of sentences taken in accordance with the law. Once the ordinary courts had passed sentence, the  legislature, which had not followed the French example of instituting a post-sentencing judge, sought to ensure that the implementation of that judicial decision was not controlled by the courts, and entrusted this task to the executive. This division of powers pursued a legitimate aim, namely the protection of public order and the prevention of crime. In that connection the Government stated that, while the 1986 Law was aimed at the gradual reintegration of prisoners into society, the sentence was designed to protect society from an individual who was liable to commit further offences outside prison. There was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved, given that prisoners had the possibility of applying for several periods of prison leave. Lastly, the Government stressed that the 1986 Law provided for other measures benefiting prisoners in the context of the enforcement of sentences, such as the semicustodial regime.",

Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is not aimed at creating new substantive rights (as the respondent Government points out in its observations), but at providing procedural protection of rights, whether they are recognised in the Convention or the Protocols thereto or in the domestic legal order (see Zehnalova and Zehnal v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 38621/97, 14 May 2002, and W. v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1987, \u00a7 73, Series A no. 121).

I cannot agree with this approach.

In reality, however, that judgment, while reaffirming the non-binding nature, in particular, of Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2006)2 elaborating on the abovementioned Prison Rules, confines itself to observing that the great majority of the member States recognise that prisoners enjoy most of the rights to which the Recommendation refers, and provide for remedies to protect them. The existence of a right to appeal before the courts against decisions liable to affect the rights of prisoners in the legal system of the respondent State in question \u2013 in that case, Italy \u2013 is based on a 1999 Italian Constitutional Court judgment which specifically held that certain parts of the Prison Administration Act, which did not allow prisoners to apply to the courts to complain of a violation of their rights, were in breach of the Constitution (see Enea, cited above, \u00a7 100).",
