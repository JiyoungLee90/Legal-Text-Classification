Article\u00a04(4) of Directive 2008/115 is intended in that context to ensure that those simplified national procedures observe the minimum guarantees prescribed by the directive, which include, in particular, the detention conditions laid down in Articles\u00a016 and 17.\u201d",

Based inter alia on his visit to Melilla and Madrid from 13 to 16 January 2015 ..., the Commissioner points to the existence of a practice whereby migrants who attempt to enter Melilla in groups by climbing the fence surrounding the city are summarily returned by Spain\u2019s border guards to Morocco. The Commissioner underlines that these returns take place outside of any formal procedure and without identification of the persons concerned or assessment of their individual situation, a circumstance which prevents them from effectively exercising their right to seek international protection in Spain. Additionally, he stresses that migrants summarily returned from Melilla have no access to an effective remedy which would enable them to challenge their removal or seek redress for any illtreatment they may have been subjected to during such operations.\u201d",

In accordance with the Law on Aliens, their return shall in all cases be carried out in compliance with the international human rights standards; applications for international protection shall be submitted in dedicated placed provided for that purpose at the border crossings. The Guardia Civil explained to us that attempts by foreigners to jump the fences happened on a daily basis, although not by massive groups of people as it had been frequently the case in 2016 and 2017. When foreigners attempt to jump the fences in both Melilla and Ceuta the Guardia Civil does not intervene unless they have climbed down the internal fences. In most of the cases foreigners endure physical injuries while jumping over the fences. This is the reason why the authorities have entered into a co-operation protocol with the Spanish Red Cross, which provides immediate medical assistance to intercepted foreigners.",

While I understand the difficulties that the Spanish authorities encounter in managing such flows I was not convinced that they affect the ability of sub-Saharan Africans to approach the Spanish border. Without any possibility for legal and safe access to the Spanish territory, persons from subSaharan Africa, including women and young children, turn to organised crime networks, hiding in cars or embarking on rafts to gain access to the autonomous cities of Melilla and Ceuta, thereby exposing themselves to risks of trafficking in human beings, violence and sexual abuse.

Omission might in particular consist of tolerance towards conduct directed against the alien by individuals or private entities, for example, if the State failed to appropriately protect an alien from hostile acts emanating from non-State actors. What appears to be the determining element in the definition of expulsion is that, as a result of either a formal act or conduct \u2013 active or passive \u2013 attributable to the State, the alien in question is compelled to leave the territory of that State. In addition, in order to conclude that there has been expulsion as a result of conduct (that is, without the adoption of a formal decision), it is essential to establish the intention of the State in question, by means of that conduct, to bring about the departure of the alien from its territory.",

With respect to non-admission, it should be explained that, in some legal regimes, the term \u2018return (refoulement)\u2019 is sometimes used instead of \u2018non-admission\u2019. For the sake of consistency, the present draft articles use the latter term in cases where an alien is refused entry. The exclusion relates to the refusal by the authorities of a State \u2013 usually the authorities responsible for immigration and border control \u2013 to allow an alien to enter the territory of that State. On the other hand, the measures taken by a State to compel an alien already present in its territory, even if unlawfully present, to leave it are covered by the concept of \u2018expulsion\u2019 as defined in draft article 2, subparagraph (a). This distinction should be understood in the light of the definition of the scope ratione personae of the draft articles, which includes both aliens lawfully present in the territory of the expelling State and those unlawfully present. Moreover the exclusion of matters relating to non-admission from the scope of the draft articles is without prejudice to the rules of international law relating to refugees. That reservation is explained by draft article 6, subparagraph (b), which references the prohibition against return (refoulement) within the meaning of article 33 of the Convention on the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951 and hence inevitably touches on questions of admission.",

However, such protection can be envisaged only for so long as the application is pending. This protection, which reflects a trend in the legal literature and finds support in the practice of some States and of UNHCR, would constitute a departure from the principle whereby the unlawfulness of the presence of an alien in the territory of a State can in itself justify expulsion of the alien. The protection might be set aside only in cases where the manifest intent of the application for refugee status was to thwart an expulsion decision likely to be handed down against the individual concerned. It concerns only individuals who, while not enjoying the status of refugee in the State in question, did meet the definition of \u2018refugee\u2019 within the meaning of the 1951 Convention or, in some cases, other relevant instruments, such as the 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, and should therefore be regarded as refugees under international law. Any individual who does not correspond to the definition of refugee within the meaning of the relevant legal instruments is ineligible to enjoy the protection recognized in draft article 6 and can be expelled on grounds other than those stipulated in subparagraph (a), including on the sole ground of the unlawfulness of his or her presence in the territory of the expelling State. In any event, article 6 is without prejudice to the right of a State to expel, for reasons other than those mentioned in subparagraph (a), an alien whose application for refugee status is manifestly abusive.",

In particular, the author claimed that, by summarily deporting him to Morocco on 2 December 2014, without performing any form of identity check or assessment of his situation, the State party: (a) failed to provide the author with the special protection and assistance to which he was entitled as an unaccompanied minor (art. 20); (b) failed to respect the principle of nonrefoulement and exposed the author to the risk of violence and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in Morocco (art. 37); and (c) failed to consider the best interests of the child (art. 3).",

Similarly, the Committee considers that \u2018the positive aspect of these protection obligations also extends to requiring States to take all necessary measures to identify children as being unaccompanied or separated at the earliest possible stage, including at the border\u2019. Accordingly, it is imperative and necessary that, in order to comply with its obligations under article 20 of the Convention and to respect the best interests of the child, the State conducts an initial assessment, prior to any removal or return, that includes the following stages: (a) assessment, as a matter of priority, of whether the person concerned is an unaccompanied minor, with, in the event of uncertainty, the individual being accorded the benefit of the doubt such that, if there is a possibility that the individual is a child, he or she is treated as such; (b) verification of the child\u2019s identity by means of an initial interview; and (c) assessment of the child\u2019s specific situation and particular vulnerabilities, if any.",

The Committee therefore considers that, in accordance with article 37 of the Convention and the principle of non-refoulement, the State has an obligation to carry out a prior assessment of the risk, if any, of irreparable harm to the child and serious violations of his or her rights in the country to which he or she will be transferred or returned, taking into account the best interests of the child, including, for example, \u2018the particularly serious consequences for children of the insufficient provision of food or health services\u2019.

The applicants had not provided proof of their participation in the storming of the fences, although the burden of proof lay with them. In any event, on the basis of the images provided by the applicants and in view of the injuries and fractures they claimed to have sustained prior to their attempted entry, the first applicant would have been unable to climb over the three fences and the second applicant, who had allegedly had a painful knee, could not be the person shown on the video footage provided, who appeared to have a problem with his heel and a broken arm.

Under that law, the existence of a fence located some distance from the border does not authorise a State to unilaterally exclude, alter or limit its territorial jurisdiction, which begins at the line forming the border. Furthermore, as regards the argument of some of the third-party interveners that EU law required member States to protect the EU\u2019s external borders under the Schengen Borders Code (see paragraph 45 and 46 above), the Court observes that Articles 1, 2(2)(a) and 4(3) and (4) of the Return Directive make clear that States may adopt or maintain provisions that are more favourable to persons to whom it applies, without their decisions and actions in that regard coming within the European Union\u2019s sphere of competence (see paragraph 47 above). Furthermore, this EU legislation does not affect Spanish jurisdiction under international law. Besides, as is stipulated in Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the provisions of internal law may not be invoked as justification for failure to perform a treaty (see paragraph 61 above).",

The Chamber did not deem it necessary to determine whether the applicants had been removed after entering Spanish territory, or before managing to do so as argued by the Government. It held that if interceptions on the high seas came within the ambit of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 (see Hirsi Jamaa and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7 180, and Sharifi and Others, cited above, \u00a7 212), the same must also apply to the refusal of entry to the national territory in respect of persons arriving in Spain illegally. The Chamber concluded from this that the case indeed concerned an \u201cexpulsion\u201d for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 (see paragraphs 98 et seq. and, in particular, paragraphs 102-05 of the Chamber judgment). As to the merits of the complaint concerning the \u201ccollective\u201d nature of the expulsion, the Chamber concluded that, since the removal measures had been taken in the absence of any procedure whatsoever and without any assessment of the applicants\u2019 individual circumstances or any prior administrative or judicial decision, their expulsion had indeed been collective, in breach of the aforementioned provision.",

The applicants in the present case had not faced any such risk in Morocco, as confirmed by the Court in its decision declaring the complaint under Article 3 inadmissible. Moreover, even after they had succeeded in entering Spain the applicants had requested asylum belatedly (N.D.), or not at all (N.T.). In the Government\u2019s view, they could not therefore be regarded as asylum-seekers. The applicants came from safe third countries, they had not been exposed to risk and they could have entered Spain lawfully if they had submitted asylum applications at the Spanish embassy or consulates in Morocco (see paragraph 34 above) or in the other countries they had travelled through, or at the authorised border crossing point at Beni Enzar. Alternatively, they could have secured contracts to work in Spain from their countries of origin. The Government referred in that regard to the report of 18 December 2015 by the Melilla police directorate, which stated that six asylum applications had been submitted at Beni Enzar between 1 January and 31 August 2014 and that, after the office for registering asylum claims had been opened by the Spanish authorities at Beni Enzar on 1 September 2014, 404 applications had been lodged at the same location during the last four months of that year. The Government stated that \u201cbefore the Special International Protection Unit was built and deployed at [Beni Enzar], the applicant for asylum was informed of his rights, with the help of an interpreter and assisted by a free of charge specialized lawyer assigned by the Bar. He/she was then driven to an open Centre for the Temporary Stay of Migrants, where their basic needs were taken care of. Health services, social services and NGO\u2019s [sic] develop their work in these centres too.\u201d In the Government\u2019s view, the applicants had taken part in an illegal storming of the border fences in an attempt to enter Spanish territory without using the designated border crossing points. Furthermore, migratory pressures had been especially intense in 2014 owing to the proliferation of networks of smugglers organising repeated, large-scale and violent assaults on the fences in order to enter Spain through Melilla.",

However, these procedures required the identification and registration of the persons intercepted, respect for procedural guarantees, access to a lawyer and an interpreter, and access to the relevant legal remedies. The Commissioner noted that the LOEX had been amended in 2015 in order to lend coherence to the Government\u2019s concept of an \u201coperational border\u201d, and that this amendment was liable to erode migrants\u2019 fundamental rights protections and encourage the practice of summary returns by other member States. She had therefore called on the national authorities to reconsider the amendment, to improve the ambiguous legal framework governing rejections at the border (\u201cpush-backs\u201d) and to put in place a clear procedural system, compliant with international human rights law, for the border police in Ceuta and Melilla. She observed that an office responsible for dealing with asylum applications had been opened in Beni Enzar in November 2014. However, access to this border crossing point continued to be impossible for persons from subSaharan Africa who were on the Moroccan side of the border, whose only option in order to enter Spain was to climb over the border fences.

The procedure provided for in Directive 2008/115/EC (the Return Directive) applied to persons who had already crossed the border without authorisation. In the Belgian Government\u2019s view, that directive was therefore inapplicable in the present case, since the border surveillance authorities had merely repelled an illegal crossing attempt by non-nationals, namely third-country nationals who had sought to enter the State\u2019s territory without complying with the rules in force (that is to say, without requesting asylum or reporting to the border crossing point). Hence, these persons could not be considered to have entered the country\u2019s territory. In the intervener\u2019s view, allowing persons who circumvented the rules on crossing borders to enter the territory, when they did not report to an authorised crossing point and did not have the necessary documents to enter and remain in the country, would be wholly contrary to the European rules on border controls and the crossing of borders, depriving those rules of any purpose and encouraging human trafficking.

The BRA (see paragraph 118 above), which was responsible for recognising persons under UNHCR\u2019s mandate, had been inactive from 2004 to 2013, when it had resumed operations. In practice, since 2013, the UNHCR office in Rabat had dealt with asylum applications, with the BRA taking the decisions on the recognition of refugee status in Morocco. However, most migrants trying to reach the UNHCR office in Rabat were arrested and detained, which prevented them from applying for protection (see paragraph 163 below). It was clear from the report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that sub-Saharan refugees were subjected to serious violence and sexual abuse on their route to Ceuta and Melilla.",

In the intervener\u2019s view, while it was possible not to apply the directive to persons who were subject to a refusal of entry or who were intercepted while crossing the border illegally (Article 2(2)), the provisions of Articles 12 and 13 always had to be taken into account. The directive did not permit any exceptions to the right of asylum or the principle of non-refoulement, and required safeguards against arbitrary and/or collective expulsions. Immediate returns also breached the provisions of the Procedures Directive (2013/32/EU) and the Reception Directive (2013/33/EU) of 26 June 2013 concerning international protection and persons seeking such protection, owing to the lack of individual consideration of applications and the lack of information, procedural safeguards and so on.

They argued that the applicants had not entered Spanish territory but had merely attempted to enter Spain illegally by crossing a land border. It was true that they had come under the control of the border guards after crossing two fences, but in any event they had not been given leave to enter Spanish territory lawfully. For an expulsion to occur, the person concerned had to have first been admitted to the territory from which he or she was expelled. The Government called into question the Court\u2019s case-law, which, they argued, had departed from the intentions of the drafters of Article 4 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a04 by extending its scope of application to extraterritorial situations (the Government referred to Hirsi Jamaa and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 170 and 171). In their view, that case-law could not apply in any circumstances to events which, as in the present case, took place in the vicinity of States\u2019 land borders, given that the Hirsi Jamaa and Others judgment itself drew a distinction between \u201cmigrants having taken to the sea, often risking their lives, and not having managed to reach the borders of a State ... [and] those travelling by land\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 177).

In the instant case the applicants had not demonstrated that they had been unable to enter Spanish territory lawfully. The Governments of Belgium, France and Italy, in their capacity as third-party interveners, agreed with this argument (see paragraphs 144 et seq. above).",

In such cases, the member States may apply simplified national return procedures, subject to compliance with the conditions laid down in Article 4(4) of the Directive, including the principle of non-refoulement (see the CJEU judgment in the case of Affum, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 72-74).",

The opposite approach would entail serious risks of arbitrariness, in so far as persons entitled to protection under the Convention could be deprived of such protection on the basis of purely formal considerations, for instance on the grounds that, not having crossed the State\u2019s border lawfully, they could not make a valid claim for protection under the Convention. States\u2019 legitimate concern to foil the increasingly frequent attempts to circumvent immigration restrictions cannot go so far as to render ineffective the protection afforded by the Convention, and in particular by Article 3 (see, mutatis mutandis, M.S.S. v.

According to the report of the Melilla police directorate (see paragraph 128 above), even before the setting-up of an asylum registration office on that date, a legal avenue to that effect had been established under section 21 of Law 12/2009 (see paragraph 34 above). The Government stated that on this basis, twenty-one asylum applications had been lodged between 1 January and 31 August 2014 in Melilla, including six asylum applications lodged at the Beni Enzar border crossing point, with the asylum-seekers being escorted to the Melilla police station in order for them to lodge a formal application.

As indicated by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, referring to the 2014 annual report of the Spanish Ombudsman, those 404 applications were all submitted by Syrian refugees at a time when the Syrian crisis had intensified. This is confirmed by Annex 14 of the Government\u2019s submissions, according to which, owing to the notable increase in the number of applicants for international protection at the end of 2014, and in order to facilitate the processing of asylum applications, the number of national police officers in Beni Enzar and Tarajal was increased, and the officers received the appropriate training to deal with the asylum applications that were submitted. Thus, the higher number of applications from 1\u00a0September 2014 onwards would appear to be primarily the result of an increased number of requests for protection by Syrian nationals in that period and, as such, does not call into question the accessibility of Beni Enzar prior to 1 September 2014.",

However, the Government demonstrated that this allegation was mistaken, pointing out that according to Article 2 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code, Royal Decree 203/1995 (cited in paragraph 35 above), laying down implementing arrangements for the previous version of the Law on asylum, was still in force. That decree provided for a specific procedure enabling the ambassadors to establish whether asylum applications submitted at the Spanish embassies and consulates were genuine and, if appropriate, to arrange for the transfer to Spain of the persons concerned, by means of an urgent admission in the event of a high risk in a third country. According to this Royal decree, an administrative decision had to be issued within six months and was subject to judicial review. The applicability of this procedure was confirmed by a circular letter of 20 November 2009, sent by the Government to all Spanish ambassadors and containing instructions regarding the arrangements for such transfers. This circular letter provides that \u201cif in the exercise of his or her duties the ambassador considers that \u2018there is a risk to [the asylumseeker\u2019s] physical integrity\u2019, he or she may secure the person\u2019s transfer to Spain (this may entail issuing a visa and a one-way airline ticket to Spain, subject to prior approval by the Ministry)\u201d (see paragraph 38 above).

In this regard the Court notes the efforts undertaken by Spain, in response to recent migratory flows at its borders, to increase the number of official border crossing points and enhance effective respect for the right to access them, and thus to render more effective, for the benefit of those in need of protection against refoulement, the possibility of gaining access to the procedures laid down for that purpose.",

An applicant may certainly be wrong in his or her interpretation of the Convention, but in any event it must be evident that the application is motivated by a serious intention and that the applicant is committed to pursuing it. If that is not the case, it is the Court\u2019s duty to consider such a situation carefully and, if there are no exceptional circumstances in the applicant\u2019s case (such as illness, mental immaturity, and the like), then it is certainly not appropriate, from the point of view of universal justice, for the Court to deal with the application, not even as regards the question whether the application was justified or not. To my mind, it is therefore necessary to interpret the last sentence of paragraph 1 of Article 37 of the Convention (\u201cHowever, the Court shall continue the examination of the application if respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto so requires\u201d) exclusively in relation to the applicant and his or her specific problem and not generally in relation to the issue raised by the applicant, which might possibly entail a violation of the Convention in general rather than concrete terms.",

It may be useful therefore to briefly explain at the outset why it makes a difference to take this position rather than to consider, as I do, that the provision is not applicable. The main reasons why the difference matters a great deal are twofold. Firstly, the interpretation according to which the circumstances fall within the scope of the provision in question brings the substance under the Court\u2019s supervision. In my view, the Court is thereby stepping outside the bounds of its proper remit. Secondly, the criteria developed by the majority for the assessment of the merits of the case mark a significant shift of focus in this context. Both moves will have major implications in practice.",

While this is true, it does not follow that the Court is entitled to turn this observation, derived from an internal regulation adopted by a group of States that have pooled their sovereignty in matters of border management, into a Convention requirement.

My startingpoint in the light of the above limitations enshrined in the Convention is that wider obligations in terms of the provision of access to entry for aliens through the State\u2019s external borders, or access to asylum procedures, are not matters falling under the Convention. In this regard it is important to note that non-refoulement as covered by the Convention is a negative obligation, that is to say, an obligation to refrain from measures entailing the removal of persons from the State\u2019s jurisdiction, directly or indirectly, to another jurisdiction where they would be subjected to a real risk of ill-treatment.

Important issues of national security, the protection of territorial integrity and public order are at stake as well.

In fact, it appears rather bizarre. I find it difficult to see why the States Parties should be expected to accept that, as a matter of principle, any persons about to penetrate their external borders must be treated as potential asylum-seekers, and that nobody can be stopped and prevented from entry without individualised procedural safeguards, including persons whose hostile intentions are obvious or are known in advance on the basis of intelligence activities. A situation where the States Parties would no longer be able to respond to national security crises or incidents at their borders without the necessity of first invoking Article 15 of the Convention (in so far as permitted) appears neither reasonable nor very sensible. Nor does it appear reasonable that detention as provided for under Article 5(1)(f) would be the only available option in any kind of situation involving the illegal entry of aliens.",

In the commentary, it is made clear that this limitation of the notion of \u201cexpulsion\u201d is, however, without prejudice to the rules of international law relating to refugees and to the principle of nonrefoulement. Thus, the Draft Articles are in line with the position \u2013 on which there is no disagreement (see above) \u2013 according to which the key point with regard to the Convention, including the interpretation of Article\u00a04\u00a0of Protocol No. 4, is to ensure and preserve compliance with the obligation of non-refoulement. What the Draft Articles neither call for nor support is an interpretation of the notion of \u201cexpulsion\u201d which would under all circumstances encompass the non-admission of aliens and thus require the wholesale equating of any non-admission to expulsion, subjecting all to the same principles.
