Moreover, women who gave birth at home in Croatia often experienced difficulties registering their children in State registers since the relevant law obliged them to submit medical documents to prove their motherhood. Furthermore, midwives were not free from harassment. The Ministry of Health had expressly held that their assisting with home births was considered as quackery (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a012 above) and they had also been submitted to police questioning (see\u00a0paragraph 15 above). The applicant thus argued that her situation was more akin to Ternovszky (cited above), in which the Court had held that a lack of legal certainty and threats to healthcare professionals had limited the choices of the applicant in that case when considering home delivery. For the Court, that situation had been incompatible with the notion of \u201cforeseeability\u201d and hence with that of \u201clawfulness\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 26).",

That was confirmed by the Ministry of Health letter (see paragraph 12 above) to which the applicant had referred in her application to the Court.

They noted that the Commission for Perinatal Medicine of the Ministry of Health was of the view that hospitals were the safest places for child deliveries, providing the best guarantees for the preservation of the health and life of both mothers and babies. As such, the question of whether the State should allow its medical staff to participate in such deliveries fell within its margin of appreciation, meaning that each Contracting Party should be absolutely free to decide on its own, on the basis of its own assessment of numerous factors which needed to be considered, whether or not to provide that alternative to its citizens. The Government asserted that the Contracting Parties should not be compelled to make provision for home delivery and that the spirit of the Convention did not require that legislative measures or practices to that effect should be implemented in every Contracting Party. That, however, did not mean that a Contracting Party should entirely disregard the fact that a substantial number of women did not feel comfortable in a hospital environment and that certain adverse effects in relation to child delivery could be linked to that particular feeling of discomfort and fear.",

Mothers-to-be were free to choose the maternity ward in which they wished to give birth. The Government further submitted that in 1993 Croatia had joined the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), a programme launched by the WHO and UNICEF. Currently all maternity wards in Croatia were BFHI accredited, that is certified for their excellence in maternity care and support for breastfeeding.

No woman had ever been punished for such an act. Moreover, no health professional, including the foreign midwife who had assisted the applicant, had ever been prosecuted in criminal proceedings or sanctioned for assisting with a home birth (see\u00a0paragraph 16 above).

They noted that the Commission for Perinatal Medicine of the Ministry of Health was of the view that hospitals were the safest places for performing deliveries, providing the best guarantees for the preservation of the health and life of both mothers and newborns (see paragraph 58 above). In the case of Dubsk\u00e1 and Krejzov\u00e1 the Court also noted that the risk for mothers and newborns was higher in the case of home births than in the case of births in maternity hospitals which were fully staffed and adequately equipped from a technical and material perspective, and that even if a pregnancy proceeded without any complications and could have therefore been considered a \u201clow-risk\u201d pregnancy, unexpected difficulties could arise during the delivery which would require immediate specialist medical intervention, such as a Caesarean section or special neonatal assistance.

On that background, the Court finds it appropriate to invite the Croatian authorities to make further progress in such matters by keeping the relevant legal provisions under constant review so as to ensure that they reflect medical and scientific developments while fully respecting women\u2019s rights in the field of reproductive health, notably by ensuring adequate conditions for both patients and medical staff in maternity hospitals across the country (compare Dubsk\u00e1 and Krejzov\u00e1, cited above, \u00a7 189).",

If \u2013 as the majority allege \u2013 Article 8 could not be interpreted as conferring a right to give birth at home as such, then it is difficult to understand why the fact that it was impossible in practice for women to be assisted when giving birth in their private home can still come within the scope of their right to respect for their private life and accordingly of Article 8. Moreover, as explained in a more detailed manner in several separate opinions (see the concurring opinion of Judges De Gaetano, Pinto de Albuquerque, Wojtyczek and Dedov, paragraph 5, attached to the judgment in the case of Paradiso and Campanelli v.
