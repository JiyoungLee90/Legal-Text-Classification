The court considered that the only certainty was that the child had been born and that he had been handed over to the first applicant against payment of almost 50,000 euros (EUR). In the court\u2019s view, the hypothesis that the applicants had behaved illegally with a view to having the particulars of the birth certificate entered in the civilstatus register and to circumventing the Italian legislation thus appeared well-founded.",

In the Public Prosecutor\u2019s view, there was therefore no other solution but to proceed with the adoption procedure for the child, and his temporary placement with a foster family had therefore been requested, in accordance with sections 8 and 10 of the Adoption Act. The Public Prosecutor repeated his request and emphasised that the child had been removed more than a year previously, and that he had since been living in a children\u2019s home (casa famiglia), where he had developed meaningful relationships with the persons responsible for his care. He explained that the child had thus still not found a family environment to replace the one that had been illegally provided by the couple who had brought him to Italy. According to the Public Prosecutor, the child seemed destined for another separation, even more painful than that from the mother who had given birth to him and then from the woman who claimed to be his mother.",

The Court of Cassation held that the decision to take the child into care was lawful. Having noted the absence of genetic links between the child and the intended parents, the Court of Cassation concluded that the impugned situation was illegal under Ukrainian law, since the latter required a biological link with one of the intended parents. The Court of Cassation reiterated that the prohibition on surrogate motherhood was still in force in Italy. It explained that the prohibition on surrogate motherhood in Italian law was a criminal-law one, and was intended to protect the surrogate mother\u2019s human dignity and the practice of adoption. It added that only a legally recognised adoption, organised in accordance with the regulations, would allow non-genetic parenthood to be validated. It stated that the assessment of the child\u2019s best interests had been carried out in advance by the legislature, and the court had no discretion in this matter. It concluded that there could be no conflict of interest with the child\u2019s interests where the court applied the domestic law and refused to take into account a legal parent-child relationship established abroad following a gestational surrogacy arrangement.",

Ukrainian law required that one of the two parents be the biological parent. The acquittal judgment delivered at first instance had been challenged by the public prosecutor before the Court of Cassation. That court dismissed the public prosecutor\u2019s appeal on points of law, thus confirming the acquittal, which had been based on the finding that the defendants had not been in breach of section 12 \u00a7\u00a06 of Law no. 40 of 19\u00a0February 2004 (the Medically Assisted Reproduction Act), given that they had had recourse to an assisted reproduction technique which was legal in the country in which it was practised.

One of them was the \u201cmother\u201d under Italian law, and the seminal fluid had been provided by an unknown donor. The claimant had been successful at first and second instance. On an appeal by the public prosecutor, the Court of Cassation dismissed the latter\u2019s submissions, and thus accepted that a child born through assisted reproduction techniques within a same-sex female couple could be adopted by the woman who had not given birth to that child. In reaching that conclusion the Court of Cassation took into account the stable emotional bond between the claimant and the child, and the best interests of the minor child. The Court of Cassation referred to section 44 of the Adoption Act, which provides for special circumstances.",

It was not convinced of the adequacy of the elements relied on by the Italian authorities in concluding that the child ought to be taken into the care of the social services. The Chamber based its reasoning on the principle that the removal of a child from the family setting is an extreme measure to which recourse should be had only as a very last resort, to fulfil the aim of protecting a child who is faced with immediate danger (in this regard, the Chamber referred to the following judgments: Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos.\u00a039221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7\u00a0148, ECHR 2000VIII; Neulinger and Shuruk v.

On the basis of the evidence in the file, the Chamber held that the national courts had taken decisions without any specific assessment of the child\u2019s living conditions with the applicants, and of his best interests. Accordingly, it concluded that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention on the ground that the national authorities had failed to strike the fair balance that ought to be maintained between the general interest and the private interests at stake (see \u00a7\u00a7 75-87 of the Chamber judgment).",

However, these measures resulted from an arbitrary analysis by the domestic courts, in so far as they had concluded that the child had been \u201cin a state of abandonment\u201d. The applicants also submitted that although the practice of gestational surrogacy was prohibited by the Medically Assisted Reproduction Act (sections 6 and\u00a014), criminal proceedings had nonetheless never been taken against surrogate mothers or intended parents. In the absence of an extraterritoriality clause, gestational surrogacy arrangements entered into legally in another State could not, in their view, be prosecuted in the Italian courts. Given that it was impossible to prosecute gestational surrogacy as such, other provisions were used as the basis for criminal proceedings.

Although the States enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in authorising or prohibiting the practice of gestational surrogacy arrangements on their territory, they considered that this was not the subject of the present application. The Court was required in the present case to determine whether the measures resulting in the child\u2019s irreversible removal had struck a fair balance between the interests at stake, namely those of the applicants, those of the child, and those of public order. From that standpoint, the applicants considered it appropriate to bear in mind that in all decisions concerning a child, his or her best interests ought to be the primary consideration.

The Minors Court had refrained from examining the actual conditions of the child\u2019s life, and had presumed that he was deprived of emotional or material support from the parents. In the applicants\u2019 view, the domestic courts had expressed doubt as to their emotional and educative capabilities solely on the basis of the unlawfulness of their conduct, and had held that they had resorted to a gestational surrogacy arrangement on account of their narcissism. The applicants pointed out, however, that they had previously been assessed as fit to become adoptive parents by those same authorities. Moreover, the social workers, acting on an instruction by the Minors Court, had drawn up a report that was highly favourable to continuation of joint life with the child.

It also noted that the court-ordered reports on the family showed that the child was well integrated in the family and deeply attached to the applicants and to their children. The applicants had also provided for the child\u2019s social development.

The Kopf and Liberda case concerned a foster family which had cared, over a period of about forty-six months, for a child who had arrived in their home at the age of two.

The concept of private life also encompasses the right to \u201cpersonal development\u201d or the right to self-determination (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a02346/02, \u00a7\u00a061, ECHR 2002III), and the right to respect for the decisions both to have and not to have a child (see Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a06339/05, \u00a7\u00a071, ECHR 2007-I, and A, B and C v.

The identity of the genetic parents remained unknown. The applicants had acted unlawfully since, firstly, they had brought a child to Italy in breach of the Adoption Act. According to that statute, before bringing a foreign child to Italy, candidates for international adoption were required to apply to an authorised organisation and then to request the involvement of the Commission for Inter-country Adoption, the only body competent to authorise entry and permanent residence of a foreign child in Italy.\u00a0Section\u00a072 of the Act made conduct contravening these rules liable to prosecution, but assessment of the criminal-law aspect of the situation was not within the competence of the minors courts.

We would emphasise that Article 8 \u00a7 1 cannot, in our opinion, be interpreted as enshrining \u2018family life\u2019 between a child and persons who have no biological relationship with him or her, where the facts, reasonably clarified, suggest that the origin of the custody is based on an illegal act, in breach of public order.

In our view, the proposed formula is simultaneously both too vague and too broad. The approach seems based on the implicit assumption that existing interpersonal ties should enjoy at least prima facie protection against State interference. We note in this respect that close and constant personal ties may exist out of the scope of any family life. The reasoning does not explain the nature of those specific interpersonal ties which form family life.

The emphasis placed on the natural and fundamental character of the family in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights positions the family among the most important institutions and values to be protected in a democratic society. Furthermore, the wording and the structure of Article 23 of the ICCPR as well as the wording of Article 12 of the Convention clearly link the notion of family with marriage. In the light of all the above-mentioned provisions, a family is to be understood a natural and fundamental group unit of society, founded primarily by the marriage between a man and a woman. Family life encompasses, in the first place, ties between spouses and between parents and their children.

Pregnancy, with its worries, constraints and joys, as well as the trials and stress of childbirth, create a unique link between the biological mother and the child. From the outset, surrogacy is focused on drastically severing this link. The surrogate mother must renounce developing a life-long relationship of love and care. The unborn child is not only forcibly placed in an alien biological environment, but is also deprived of what should have been the mother\u2019s limitless love in the prenatal stage. Gestational surrogacy also prevents development of the particularly strong bond which forms between the child and a father who accompanies the mother and child throughout a pregnancy. Both the child and the surrogate mother are treated not as ends in themselves, but as means to satisfy the desires of other persons. Such a practice is not compatible with the values underlying the Convention. Gestational surrogacy is particularly unacceptable if the surrogate mother is remunerated.

I presume that the real answer lies somewhere in the middle: the civilised nations constitute the basis of international law, and surrogacy does not impede the civilised development of nations. However, if one takes into account the numbers of those involved, directly or indirectly, in any forms of this anti-social way of money-making, whether lawful or not, the real scale of the problem would be impressive. When social solidarity is not encouraged or effectively protected in practice by the authorities (who merely limit themselves to declarations in official documents), this raises the problems of social discrimination and inequality, which may lead to social destabilisation or degradation, and this threat should not be underestimated.",

By contrast, the majority not only take into account the reasons given by the Minors Court (the illegal situation created by the applicants), but even, following the Government\u2019s argument, consider the wider context of the prohibition on surrogacy arrangements under Italian law (on the latter point, see paragraph 203 of the judgment). We believe that the specific facts of the present case, and in particular the judgments handed down by the domestic authorities, do not warrant such a broad approach, in which sensitive policy considerations may play an important role.",

Where a couple has managed to enter into a surrogacy agreement abroad and to obtain from a mother living abroad a baby, which subsequently is brought legally into Italy, it is the factual situation in Italy stemming from these earlier events in another country that should guide the relevant Italian authorities in their reaction to that situation. In this respect, we have some difficulty with the majority\u2019s view that the legislature\u2019s reasons for prohibiting surrogacy arrangements are of relevance in respect of measures taken to discourage Italian citizens from having recourse abroad to practices which are forbidden on Italian territory (see paragraph 203 of the judgment). In our opinion, the relevance of these reasons becomes less clear when a situation has been created abroad which, as such, cannot have violated Italian law. In this respect, it is also important to note that the situation created by the applicants in Russia was initially recognised and formalised by the Italian authorities through the consulate in Moscow (see paragraph 17 of the judgment).",

At no point did the courts ask themselves whether it would have been in the child\u2019s interest to remain with the persons who had assumed the role of his parents. The removal was based on purely legal grounds. Facts came into play only to assess whether the consequences of the removal, once decided, would not be too harsh for the child. We consider that in these circumstances it cannot be said that the domestic courts sufficiently addressed the impact that the removal would have on the child\u2019s well-being. This is a serious omission, given that any such measure should take the best interest of the child into account (see paragraph\u00a06 above).",

The mere fact that the domestic courts did not find it necessary to discuss the impact on the applicants of the removal of a child who was the specific subject of their parental project demonstrates, in our opinion, that they were not really seeking to strike a fair balance between the applicants\u2019 interests and any opposing interests, whatever these might have been.",
