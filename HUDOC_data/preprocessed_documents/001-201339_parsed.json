Croatia [GC], no. 25703/11, \u00a7\u00a0117, ECHR 2015). The Court is thus of the view that the finding of a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage (see also Kormev, cited above, \u00a7 96). The Court notes in addition that Article 422 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows for the possibility to reopen criminal proceedings where it has found a violation of the Convention which is of particular importance for the case (see paragraph 13 above).",
