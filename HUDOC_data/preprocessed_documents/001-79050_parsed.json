In common with the majority of the Chamber, I take the view that, whereas it has been shown that the injuries recorded in the medical report of 14 May 2001 were the result of ill-treatment by the police following the applicant's arrest on 10 May, the same cannot be said of the injuries sustained by the applicant on 10 July 2002 and recorded in the medical report of the following day.",

One such strong presumption arises in respect of injuries sustained by a person during detention, first explained by the Court in the case of Tomasi v. France (judgment of 27 August 1992, Series A no.\u00a0241-A, pp. 40-41, \u00a7\u00a7 108-111) in which the Court stated that where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see to similar effect Ribitsch v.

Moreover, according to his own account, the injury which he sustained to his left leg as a result of the fall prevented him from running away from the scene. The medical report of 11 July 2002 recorded a series of injuries, including concussion, fractures of three ribs, a fracture of the tibia of the left foot and a fracture of the second finger of his left hand. The forensic report prepared on 2 December 2002 confirmed that all the injuries recorded in the medical report could have been caused as a result of a fall from the third floor, \u201cif the applicant's body had hit hard objects\u201d. In the light of this evidence, I find that a plausible explanation has been given for the injuries sustained by the applicant. In this regard, unlike the minority of the Chamber, I do not attach decisive importance to the use of the word \u201cobjects\u201d in the forensic report as indicating the expert's view that there must have been various sources of impact; nor do I feel sufficiently qualified to assert that had the applicant landed on a flat surface following his fall he could not plausibly have sustained multiple injuries to the different parts of his body identified in the medical report.",

As to the former point, while the omission to carry out a medical examination of an injured suspect is clearly unacceptable, I am unable to draw the inference from this omission that the applicant's injuries had not in fact been sustained at the time of his initial detention. As to the latter point, had this lack of medical attention been part of the complaint made by the applicant, I would have found a substantive violation of Article 3 on the ground that the failure to provide medical assistance to a detainee who was in urgent need of it could of itself amount to inhuman treatment for the purposes of that Article.

Moldovan police officers are doing their very difficult job just like Albanian, Maltese or Andorran police officers do, trying to protect society against those who violate the law and it is absolutely unfair and unjust to accuse them of applying torture only because of the simple fact that they are policemen. Of course, their professional activity does not attract too much love on the part of those from the opposite side of the law.
