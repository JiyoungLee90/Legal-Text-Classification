The Court notes that the enforcement ended in 2005 due to the fact that the debtor did not have any property with which he could satisfy the applicant\u2019s claim. It recalls in this connection that the execution of a judgment given by any court must be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see the Hornsby v. Greece judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, p. 510, \u00a7 40). That does not mean that a State could be held responsible for non-enforcement of a judgment due to the insolvency of the debtor (Sanglier v. France, 50342/99, \u00a7 39, 27\u00a0May 2003). However, when the authorities are obliged to act in order to enforce a judgment, as in\u00a0the instant applicant\u2019s\u00a0case,\u00a0and they fail to do so, their inactivity can engage the State\u2019s responsibility on the ground of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (Scollo v.\u00a0Italy, judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 315C, \u00a7\u00a044). However, and in so far as the applicant is not complaining about the length of the above-mentioned proceedings concerning the debtor\u2019s objections, it is to be noted that the applicant did not claim compensation under the State Liability Act of 2003 (Act no. 514/2003 Coll.) for defective or negligent enforcement on the part of the executions officer (see \u0160ebekov\u00e1 and Horvatovi\u010dov\u00e1 v. , no. 73233/01, \u00a7 52, 14\u00a0February 2006), and did not, ultimately, seek redress before the .",
