The applicant was treated with thirty-six types of prescribed anti-hypertension, cardiological, hepatoprotective, antiinflammatory, urological, nephrological, antioxidant, beta-adrenoreceptor and sedative medication, as well as with various vitamins. In addition, as disclosed by the medical file, on 8 June 2009 the applicant gave his consent in writing to start receiving anti-HCV treatment with the powerful anti-viral agents Ribovirin and Interferon.",

Acknowledging that the prison hospital had started administering antiHCV and other types of drugs, the applicant nevertheless claimed that no adequate treatment had been provided for his kidney problems. Furthermore, certain anti-HCV drugs, such as Interferon, had, he stated, had a deleterious effect on his kidneys. Relying on these arguments, the applicant claimed that only a civilian hospital, where he could benefit, according to the medical conclusions of 15 February to 7 April 2008, from the permanent supervision of a nephrologist, could provide adequate treatment for him.",

According to the GP\u2019s opinion dated 23 February 2010, given the chronic nature of the applicant\u2019s kidney problems and that his condition was not acute, nor was he experiencing deterioration, there was no need for specific treatment such as haemodialysis at a specialist nephrology hospital. As to his HCV, despite the provided anti-viral medication, there continued to be a virological response to the blood tests conducted (SVR).",

Alternatively, he could have requested a domestic court, under Article 24 and 33(1) of the Code of Administrative Procedure, to order the relevant authorities to take additional measures for the protection of his health in prison.

Thus, the Court notes that firstly the new Code, which entered into force on 1 October 2010, clearly provided for a detainee\u2019s right to health care in prison (Article 24 of the Code). The Code then described in a precise manner the procedure for submitting complaints, in the event a detainee felt that his or her right, including that to health care, was not being duly respected by the prison authority (see paragraphs 38-43 above). The Court notes that this procedure is accompanied by important procedural guarantees. Notably, the Code obliged the prison authority to ensure that every detainee was well aware of such a complaints procedure from the very beginning of his or her detention (Article 97 of the Code). The Code also made it clear that a complaint may not be examined by the same officer/authority who has been implicated in the infringement of the detainee\u2019s right (see Articles 98 and 99 of the Code and compare, a\u00a0contrario, with the old prison rules contained in the Imprisonment Act\u00a01999, cited in Aliev, cited above, \u00a7 33).",

Indeed, as the Court has already mentioned above, the efficiency of a domestic remedy with respect to a medical complaint from prison is largely contingent on the promptness with which that remedy can operate. No less important is the requirement for the relevant authority to give a fully reasoned response to the complaint, as well as a transparent opportunity for the detainee to challenge that response further before a court by instituting administrative-legal proceedings, that is by resorting to the above-mentioned provisions of the CAP (see Article 107 of the Code and compare, a contrario, with the old prison rules contained in the Imprisonment Act 1999, cited in Aliev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33, 58-60 and 63).",

However, the Government argued, referring to the relevant excerpts from the applicant\u2019s medical file, that during his periods of in-patient treatment in the prison hospital the authority had provided him with a sufficient number of consultations with several different nephrologists (those examinations occurred on 18 July, 7 and 18 September 2006, 3 and 4 February and 20\u00a0November 2008, and 12 January, 16 March and 5 June 2009, see paragraphs 14, 20, 21, 25 and 26 above) who had been specifically summoned for that purpose from civilian hospitals. The only somewhat lengthy period during which the applicant had been left unattended by this medical specialist was while he was in  Prison between April and October 2008. However, the Government continued, that omission should not amount to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, as the applicant was still able to benefit from supervision by a general practitioner of that prison. The Government further submitted more recent excerpts from the applicant\u2019s medical file, which disclosed that he had had additional examinations by other qualified civilian nephrologists, on 30\u00a0November 2009, 17 February, 8 June, 8 July and 10 August 2010, and 6\u00a0January, 3\u00a0March and 14 April 2011.

However, this provision requires the State to ensure that prisoners are detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject them to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, their health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, providing them with the requisite medical assistance. Indeed, the detention of a person who is ill raises arguable issues under Article 3 of the Convention, and a lack of appropriate medical care may thus amount to treatment contrary to that provision (see, amongst many others, Naumenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a042023/98, \u00a7\u00a0112, 10 February 2004).",

In this task, it must reserve, in general, sufficient flexibility, defining the required standard of health care, which must accommodate the legitimate demands of imprisonment but remain compatible with human dignity and the due discharge of its positive obligations by the State, on a case-by-case basis (see Aleksanyan, cited above, \u00a7 140).",

Notably, the mere fact of a deterioration of the applicant\u2019s state of health, albeit capable of raising, at an initial stage, certain doubts concerning the adequacy of the treatment in prison, could not suffice, as such, for a finding of a violation of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention, if, on the other hand, it can be established that the relevant domestic authorities have in timely fashion resorted to all reasonably possible medical measures in a conscientious effort to hinder development of the disease in question.",

As regards the question of whether the prison hospital could be considered a medical establishment capable of dispensing nephrology/urology treatment of adequate quality, the Court, having regard to the descriptions of the Government and the CPT and to the absence of any evidence to the contrary from the applicant (see paragraphs 44 and 62-68 above), considers that that hospital is, in its current condition, indeed equivalent to a civilian hospital of average standard. This level of equivalence is sufficient for the purposes of Article 3 of the Convention, since this provision may not be interpreted as providing detained persons with medical assistance of the same level as those as in the best civilian clinics (see Mirilashvili v. Russia (dec.), no. 6293/04, 10 July 2007).",

However, this particular limitation of the resources of the prison hospital is not sufficient to qualify as a breach of Article 3 of the Convention, since it is fully compensated by the prison authority\u2019s willingness to arrange for the applicant to be examined by nephrologists invited in from civilian hospitals. Indeed, it is praiseworthy that the domestic authorities did not hesitate to resort to the services of specialised medical facilities in the civilian sector (see, a\u00a0contrario, Aleksanyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0155-157, and Akhmetov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081). As to the frequency with which the applicant has been examined so far in prison by nephrologists invited from the outside, the Court, bearing in mind the unavoidability of certain restrictions imposed by the fact of imprisonment, finds that frequency to be sufficient and the applicant\u2019s expectations to be excessive. This is particularly so because, as the Government noted by reference to the applicant\u2019s medical file, each time the nephrologist examined the applicant, the clinician did not note any significant deterioration of the patient\u2019s condition, thus either simply maintaining the previously prescribed treatment or slightly amending the medication regimen (see paragraph 63 above).",

Thus, the medical records show that, on the contrary, numerous various types of medication were administered to the applicant in the prison hospital, as well as on an out-patient basis during his detention period in Rustavi Prison, with the State bearing the cost (contrast with, for example, Pitalev v.

It is also praiseworthy that, when the applicant developed the suspicious symptom of a dry cough, the prison authority screened the applicant for tuberculosis, another widespread disease in Georgian prisons, the results of which confirmed that he was not contaminated by the relevant mycobacterium. Instead, the doctors then diagnosed him with chronic bronchitis and prescribed him the relevant medication which, as the applicant\u2019s medical file confirms, was duly administered to the patient in the prison hospital (see paragraph 66 above).",

The circumstances of the present case, however, show that the prison authority has been able to cope with the applicant\u2019s serious renal disorders by having him treated in the prison hospital, thus rendering the question of his early release redundant.",

In other words, when assessing the criminal proceedings as a whole, the Court considers that this specific episode, relating to the taking of one particular piece of evidence of ordinary weight, may not serve as a sufficient ground to prejudice the overall fairness of the trial (see, for instance, Mirilashvili v. , no.\u00a06293/04, \u00a7\u00a7 164-166, 11 December 2008).",
