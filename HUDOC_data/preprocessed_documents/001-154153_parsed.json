However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII).",

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. As with an investigation under Article 2, such investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Otherwise, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would, despite its fundamental importance, be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2000-IV).",

They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence (see Tanr\u0131kulu v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a023763/94, \u00a7\u00a0104 et seq., ECHR\u00a01999-IV; and G\u00fcl v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a022676/93, \u00a7 89, 14 December 2000).

In dismissing the complaint for the first time, the prosecutors speculated that the applicant\u2019s injuries could have been caused by her falling over. Later, when confronted with the findings in the repeated forensic medical report to the effect that the injuries could not have been caused by a fall and that they had been inflicted by at least six different blows, the prosecutors found a new ground to dismiss the complaint, namely they considered the date of the x-ray being 10 November instead of 13\u00a0November 2009. They did not explain how they reached such a conclusion and the materials of the case file do not contain any evidence in support of it. On the contrary, all the medical documents contained in the domestic case file submitted by the Government to the Court refer to 13\u00a0November 2009 as the date when the applicant\u2019s head had been x-rayed. The Court further notes that\u00a0the prosecutors did not ask the applicant to identify the police officers responsible for her ill-treatment, let alone conduct a confrontation between them. It is therefore impossible for the Court to conclude that an effective official investigation took place. Thus, there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention under its procedural head as well.",
