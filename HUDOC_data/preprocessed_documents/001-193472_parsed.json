At the moment of conclusion of the contract of 26\u00a0December 2003, block no. 3 had been part of the UVG\u2019s integral property complex. The IRC was a structural unit of the UVG and its property could not be privatised. Therefore, the Fund\u2019s inclusion of block no. 3 in the list of objects for privatisation had been in breach of the law. The court thus invalidated the contract of 26 December 2003, ordered the applicant company to return block no. 3 to the State and ordered the State to refund UAH 552,756 to the applicant company. As to the applicant company\u2019s request, the court held that by the time the case had been resolved by the Donetsk Regional Commercial Court, the IRC had been reorganised into an independent legal entity and its property rights had been transferred to the IRC State Enterprise. The UVG had not therefore been a proper party to the proceedings and it could not have put forward any counterclaims seeking the invalidation of the contract of 26 December 2003.

Bulgaria, nos.\u00a047797/99 and 68698/01, \u00a7\u00a7 59-67, 12 January 2006). The Court also considers that in both sets of proceedings the core of the applicant company\u2019s dispute with the State was the same: the lawfulness of the privatisation of block no. 3 and the validity of the contract of 26 December 2003. In the final judgment of 1\u00a0February 2006 the Donetsk Regional Commercial Court ruled on both these issues. Therefore, in the Court\u2019s view, the subsequent proceedings against the applicant company had the effect of providing a \u201csecond chance\u201d, allowing the State to obtain a re-examination of a dispute that had already been determined in the above-mentioned judgment. In turn, such a re-examination created legal uncertainty by depriving that judgment of any legal effect (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 69-70).",

Nor can it be considered that a public interest overriding the fundamental principle of legal certainty and the applicant company\u2019s rights justified a re-examination of the dispute and the resulting invalidation of the applicant company\u2019s property title (see, similarly, Kehaya, cited above, \u00a7\u00a076, and Solomun v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 679/11, \u00a7\u00a7 60-63, 2 April 2015). In view of this conclusion, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine other arguments raised by the Government.",

In such circumstances, it cannot be considered that there is no call for an award under Article 41 (see, mutatis mutandis, Chernyayev v. Ukraine, no. 15366/03, \u00a7 28, 26 July 2005, and \u010calovskis v. Latvia, no. 22205/13, \u00a7\u00a7 235 and 236, 24 July 2014). That being so, the Court agrees that the pecuniary damage to be paid to the applicant company corresponds to the value of block no. 3 and the repairs made to it. It also notes that in claiming compensation for pecuniary damage the applicant company referred to the 2003 expert report and it considers that to be an acceptable source on which the applicant company\u2019s claim for compensation for pecuniary damage can be based. The Court will therefore base its decision on the amounts indicated in that report. According to the report, the market value of block no. 3 was UAH 552,756 which corresponded to the amount claimed by the applicant company. However, as far as the value of the repairs is concerned, the report referred to UAH\u00a0375,295 (rather than to the UAH 450,354 claimed by the applicant company). The Court will therefore adhere to the amounts stated in the report. The value of block no. 3, together with the repairs made to it by the applicant company, accordingly totalled UAH 928,051. The Court finds it reasonable to award the above amount to the applicant company, which corresponds to EUR 29,824. In awarding compensation for pecuniary damage to the applicant company, the Court also notes that it does not appear that the latter had a possibility of obtaining that compensation at the domestic level, given that in the event of the invalidation of a sale of privatised objects, money paid by buyers for such objects was to be refunded from the proceeds of their onward sale (see paragraph 23 above). It was not contended by the Government nor does it appear otherwise that block no. 3, whose sale to the applicant company was declared invalid by the domestic courts on the ground that it had not been eligible for privatisation, could be sold again. As to the applicant company\u2019s claim for lost profit, the Court notes that no documentary evidence has been submitted in support of this head of claim and therefore rejects it as unsubstantiated. Lastly, deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant company EUR 3,900 for non-pecuniary damage.",
