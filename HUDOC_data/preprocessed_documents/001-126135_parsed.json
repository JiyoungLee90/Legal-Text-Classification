As regards the assessment of evidence, the Court reiterates that its role is of a subsidiary nature, and that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see \u00dclk\u00fc Ekinci v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a027602/95, \u00a7\u00a0142, 16 July 2002, and McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a028883/95, 4\u00a0April 2000). Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts, and as a general rule it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them (see Klaas v. Germany, 22\u00a0September 1993, \u00a7 29, Series\u00a0A no. 269). Though the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic courts, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those courts (see Klaas, cited above, \u00a7 30). Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention the Court must apply particularly thorough scrutiny (see Av\u015far v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7\u00a0283, ECHR 2001VII) even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place.",

In this connection, it notes that according to the applicants, \u015e.C., a minor who had been working as a street pedlar, had been chased by two police officers. One of the police officers had kicked him, causing him to fall down and hit his head on the edge of the pavement. However, the Government denied the allegations, stating that \u015e.C. had come over faint and died suddenly, as he was trying to run away from the police officers. The Court further notes that at the end of the criminal proceedings, the two accused police officers were acquitted of the charges against them for lack of evidence.",

Furthermore, it was also indicated in the report that the toxicology and histopathology reports revealed nothing unusual. Despite these steps having been taken, the actual cause of death could not be established. Having said this, the Court also notes that there were nine witnesses who had testified that they had seen a police officer kicking \u015e.C. However, it appears that in delivering its acquittal decision, the trial court did not take these statements into consideration. In the Court\u2019s opinion, for the reasons explained below (see paragraphs 32-36), there were several shortcomings in the investigation of the incident. Because of these shortcomings, the actual circumstances in which the applicants\u2019 relative, \u015e.C., died remain a matter of speculation and assumption, and there is insufficient evidence on which to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that he died in circumstances engaging the responsibility of the State.",

This obligation is not confined to cases where it has been established that the death was caused by an agent of the State. Nor is it decisive whether members of the deceased\u2019s family or others have lodged a formal complaint about the death with the competent investigation authority. The mere fact that the authorities were informed of the death will give rise ipso facto to an obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances in which it occurred (see Tanr\u0131kulu v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 103, ECHR\u00a01999-IV; Al Fayed v\u00a0France (dec.), no. 38501/02, \u00a7 73, 27 September 2007). The nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfies the minimum threshold of an investigation\u2019s effectiveness depends on the circumstances of each particular case. It must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (see Velikova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 41488/98, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2000-VI). Whatever mode is employed to fulfil that purpose, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention, and they cannot leave it to the initiative of the victim\u2019s relatives (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2002II; Al Fayed, cited above, \u00a7 74).",
