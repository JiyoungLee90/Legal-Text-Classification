In its decision it observed that the applicant\u2019s claims had not been credible and had been vague and unsubstantiated. The Reviewing Authority noted, inter alia, that although the applicant had stated in his interview with the Asylum Service that he had been arrested and detained for three days by the Syrian military security forces, that had been in 1992, thirteen years before he decided to leave the country. With the exception of this incident, he had confirmed that he had never been harassed by the Syrian authorities and had never been persecuted. Moreover, although the applicant claimed that he had stated in his interview with the Asylum Service that he had been subjected to electric shock treatment and the \u201cwheel treatment\u201d whilst in detention in Syria, it transpired from the minutes of that interview that he had in fact stated that the electric cables had not functioned and had not mentioned that the wheel had been used to torture him. The Asylum Service had therefore not considered it necessary to refer him for a medical examination. The Reviewing Authority also observed that the applicant had merely claimed that he had left Syria on account of the increased pressure on the Kurdish population in that country following the events in Qamishli in 2004 and his fear of being arrested in the future, and because of his political activities as a member of the Yekiti Party. His allegations, however, had been general and vague. Further, his written asylum application had been based on other grounds. In particular, in his application the applicant had stated that he had come to Cyprus in search of work and better living conditions.",

About 150 Kurds from Syria, including the applicant, remained in the area around the clock, having set up about eighty tents on the pavement. According to the Government, the encampment conditions were unsanitary and protesters were obstructing road and pedestrian traffic. The encampment had become a hazard to public health and created a public nuisance. The protesters performed their daily chores on the pavement, including cooking and washing in unsanitary conditions. The sewage pits had overflown, causing a nuisance and offensive odours. The public lavatories were dirty and the rubbish bins of the Government buildings were being used and, as a result, were continuously overflowing. Furthermore, the protesters were unlawfully obtaining electricity from the Printing Office. Members of the public who lived or worked in the area had complained to the authorities. The Government submitted that efforts had been made by the authorities to persuade the protesters to leave, but to no avail.

The court could, within the context of a habeas corpus application, examine the conformity of the applicant\u2019s detention with Article 15 (3) of the Directive and Article\u00a011\u00a0(2) (f) of the Constitution. The applicant was not estopped from bringing a habeas corpus application due to the fact that he had not challenged the deportation and detention orders issued against him. Even if the lawfulness of the detention was assumed, detention for the purpose of deportation could not be indefinite and the detainee left without the right to seek his release. The Supreme Court also rejected the argument that the applicant was estopped from bringing the application because his continued detention had been brought about by his own actions, that is, by his application to the Strasbourg Court for an interim measure suspending his deportation.",

The applicant had been arrested on 11 June 2010 with a view to his deportation but had not been deported by the Government in view of the application by the Court on 12 June 2010 of Rule 39 and the issuing of an interim measure suspending his deportation. Consequently, the authorities had not been able to deport him. As the applicant himself had taken steps to suspend his deportation, the ensuing time could not be held against the Government and could not be taken into account for the purposes of Article\u00a015 (5) and (6) of the Directive. The six-month period would start to run from the moment that the interim measure had been lifted.

These safeguards are provided for in the domestic law, in particular, section\u00a014(6) of the Aliens and Immigration Law and Regulation 19 of the Aliens and Immigration Regulations, as well as in Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a07 to the Convention. The Supreme Court observed that Cypriot jurisprudence recognised the wide discretion of the Immigration Officer as an integral part of state sovereignty but at the same time imposed safety measures in order to prevent arbitrary acts by state organs and abuses which could lead to the infringement of fundamental and internationally safeguarded human rights.",

The Directive has been invoked before the Supreme Court in habeas corpus proceedings in which detainees challenged the lawfulness of their protracted detention for the purpose of deportation (see, for example, Supreme Court judgments of 12 March 2012 in the case of Yuxian Wing, habeas corpus application no.\u00a013/2012; of 8\u00a0January 2011 in the case of Shanmukan Uthajenthiran, cited above; and of 22 December 2011 in the case of Mostafa Haghilo, habeas corpus application no. 133/2011).",

Thirdly, it is reported that as soon as a negative second instance decision is taken, a deportation order is faxed to the police and rejected asylum seekers are frequently arrested before they even receive the letter informing them of the negative decision of the Refugee Reviewing Authority or have a chance to appeal to the Supreme Court. Filing an appeal in any case does not have a suspensive effect on the deportation order. This raises questions concerning respect of the principle of non-refoulement.

This was because although an application to the Supreme Court did not automatically suspend the deportation process, an application to suspend the deportation, including as an interim measure, had to be lodged with the Supreme Court. The suspension was not granted automatically; an applicant had to establish flagrant illegality or irreparable damage. This therefore meant that in Cyprus asylum-seekers might be at risk of forcible return to a place where they were at serious risk of human rights violations (breaching the principle of non-refoulement) before their claim was finally determined unless the Supreme Court agreed to suspend the deportation order or, in cases where the asylum -seekers had petitioned the Court, an interim measure had been granted.",

Detainees and their lawyers had told Amnesty International that often they were not provided with the reasons and justification for detention. Usually, detainees were given a short letter simply referring to the legislative provisions under which their detention had been ordered and to the fact that they were being detained pending deportation. In some cases, deportation and detention orders had been handed to the individuals concerned several months into their detention. The report noted that such shortcomings were particularly common in relation to detained asylum-seekers. A large number interviewed by Amnesty International, particularly those whose applications were pending, did not appear to know how long they would be detained, even when they were aware of the grounds for their detention.",

In the case of an appeal against an unsuccessful application, the length of the appeal proceedings in both cases was about five years on average. In addition, according to domestic legislation, the Minister of Interior reviewed immigration detention orders either on his or her own initiative every two months, or at a reasonable time following an application by the detainee. The Minister was also solely responsible for any decision to prolong detention for an additional maximum period of twelve months. However, the lack of automatic judicial review of the decision to detain was a cause of major concern. Referring to Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, Article 18 (2) of the Asylum Procedures Directive and Article 15 (2) of the EU Returns Directive the report concluded that because of the lack of an automatic judicial review of the administrative orders to detain, especially in cases of prolonged detention, it was clear that the procedural safeguards in Cypriot law fell short of international and regional standards.",

On 11 June, 143 of the protesters, including children, were reportedly arrested during an early morning police operation. Several of them were released immediately but, according to reports, 23 were forcibly removed to Syria that day. On 14 June, the European Court of Human Rights issued interim measures requesting that Cyprus suspend the removal of the 44 who were still in detention. Seven of these were then released, either because they had pending asylum applications or were stateless. According to reports, of those remaining, 32 were forcibly removed to Syria after the European Court lifted the interim measures in their cases in September. The remaining five continued to be detained in Cyprus. Seventeen of those forcibly removed were reportedly arrested and detained upon or after their arrival in Syria.\u201d",

He stressed, however, that if it had not been for the application of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court by the Court he would have been deported by the authorities. In reply to the Government\u2019s plea of non-exhaustion he maintained that he did not have an effective domestic remedy at his disposal as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In this respect, the applicant pointed out, inter alia, that a recourse against a decision by the Reviewing Authority or against deportation and detention orders did not have automatic suspensive effect. Neither did an application for a provisional measure to suspend deportation made in the context of such proceedings.

For example, in both the cases of I.M. and Gebremedhin (cited above), although the Court ruled that the applicants could no longer be considered as victims in respect of the alleged violation of Article 3, it found that the main complaint raised an issue of substance and that, in the particular circumstances, the applicants were still victims of the alleged violation of Article 13 taken together with Article 3. The same approach was taken recently by the Court in the case of De Souza Ribeiro in relation to a deportation complaint under Articles\u00a08 and\u00a013 (De Souza Ribeiro v. France [GC], no.\u00a022689/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a084100, 13\u00a0December 2012, read together with De Souza Ribeiro v. France, no.\u00a022689/07, \u00a7\u00a7 22-26, 30 June 2011).",

The Court observes in this respect that the Reviewing Authority in its decision granting the applicant refugee status held that the applicant had proved, in a convincing manner, that his fear of persecution and the danger to his life in the event of his return to Syria was objectively credible because of his political activity in Cyprus (see, mutatis mutandis, S.F. and Others v.\u00a0Sweden, no. 52077/10, \u00a7\u00a7 68-71, 15 May 2012 on the relevance of sur place activity in the receiving country).",

The Court notes in this regard that at the time the applicant was to be sent back to Syria, his asylum application was being re-examined by the authorities and that it appears from the file that his deportation was halted only because of the application by the Court of Rule\u00a039. The decision granting the applicant refugee status was taken more than ten months after he lodged his complaints before this Court. Secondly, although the authorities\u2019 decision to grant the applicant asylum has removed the risk that he will be deported, that decision does not acknowledge and redress his claim under Article 13 in conjunction with Articles 2 and 3 about the effectiveness of judicial review proceedings (see paragraphs 109-110 above).

Moreover, and contrary to the Government\u2019s submissions, the authorities did not always suspend deportation orders. The applicant relied on the court record in a recourse challenging a decision by the Reviewing Authority in a case in which deportation had taken place despite the fact that an application for a provisional order to suspend the execution of the deportation order had been filed. The person concerned had been deported the day before the hearing of the application by the Supreme Court. As a result the application was withdrawn (Shahin Haisan Fawzy Mohammed, see paragraph 84 above). The applicant also claimed that asylum-seekers faced a number of difficulties in filing applications for provisional orders. Such an order would only be granted on proof of flagrant illegality or irreparable damage. Further, until recently, legal aid was not available either for the institution of a recourse against deportation and detention orders or for an application for a provisional order (see paragraph 72 above).",

Although these proceedings did not have automatic suspensive effect, in the course of the proceedings the applicant could have filed an application for a provisional order to suspend the execution of the deportation order issued against him.

Its main concern is whether effective guarantees exist that protect the applicant against arbitrary refoulement, be it direct or indirect, to the country from which he or she has fled (see M.S.S., cited above, \u00a7 286) or to any other receiving country in which he or she would be at a real risk of suffering treatment in violation of Article 3 (see, for example in the specific context of the application of the Dublin Regulation, M.S.S., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0342 et seq). Where a complaint concerns allegations that the person\u2019s expulsion would expose him or her to a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention, the effectiveness of the remedy for the purposes of Article 13 imperatively requires close scrutiny by a national authority (see Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, \u00a7\u00a0448, ECHR 2005III), independent and rigorous scrutiny of any claim that there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 (see Jabari v. Turkey, no. 40035/98, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2000 VIII), as well as a particularly prompt response (see De Souza Ribeiro, cited above, \u00a7\u00a082). In such a case, effectiveness also requires that the person concerned should have access to a remedy with automatic suspensive effect (see, inter alia, De Souza, cited above, \u00a7 82, 13 December 2012; I.M. v. France, cited above, \u00a7 58; Al Hanchi v.

In this respect, the Government repeated their submissions under Article 13 of the Convention that, as a matter of administrative practice, if the applicant had agreed to an early hearing of the recourse and withdrawn his application for a provisional order, the authorities would have suspended the execution of the deportation order and the proceedings would have been expedited (see paragraphs\u00a0127-129 above). The lawfulness of the deportation and detention orders would have been adjudicated in a matter of weeks. The Government referred to the records of the proceedings in a number of recourses as examples of expedited judicial review proceedings (see paragraphs 77-79 above).",

The notion of \u201clawfulness\u201d under paragraph 4 of Article 5 has the same meaning as in paragraph 1, so that the arrested or detained person is entitled to a review of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of his detention in the light not only of the requirements of domestic law but also of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 \u00a7 1. Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a04 does not guarantee a right to judicial review of such a scope as to empower the court, on all aspects of the case including questions of pure expediency, to substitute its own discretion for that of the decision-making authority. The review should, however, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which are essential for the \u201clawful\u201d detention of a person according to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see, as a recent authority, Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, \u00a7 168, ECHR 2012). The remedies must be made available during a person\u2019s detention with a view to that person obtaining speedy judicial review of the lawfulness of his or her detention capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release (see Louled Massoud v.\u00a0Malta, no. 24340/08, \u00a7 39 July 2010). The accessibility of a remedy implies, inter alia, that the circumstances voluntarily created by the authorities must be such as to afford applicants a realistic possibility of using the remedy (see \u010conka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 55). The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see, amongst many authorities, Nasrulloyev v. Russia, no. 656/06, \u00a7\u00a086, 11 October 2007, and Kadem v. Malta, no. 55263/00, \u00a7 41, 9\u00a0January 2003).",

The authorities had not been able to deport the applicant only because of the Court\u2019s interim measure. In addition, the maximum period of detention of six months, provided for in Directive 2008/115/EC (see paragraphs 86 and\u00a098 above) which had been directly applicable in domestic law, had elapsed. Despite this the authorities had continued to detain him. In the applicant\u2019s view, his continued detention could only be considered as a form of punishment.

The Court notes in this respect that the operation took place at 3\u00a0a.m., at a time when the majority of the protesters were sleeping (see paragraph 36 above). Bearing in mind the nature, scale and aim of the operation, the manner in which it was carried out and the overall measures taken by the authorities, it would be unrealistic to assume that the protesters were free to refuse to board the buses or to leave the police headquarters. Nor have the Government indicated that they were. It is clear that the aim of the operation was also to identify the protesters who were staying in the country unlawfully with a view to deporting them. Only those who were found to be lawfully residing in Cyprus were able to leave the premises. There was undoubtedly an element of coercion, which in the Court\u2019s view is indicative of a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1. The fact that nobody had been handcuffed, put in cells or otherwise physically restrained during the period in question does not constitute a decisive factor in establishing the existence of a deprivation of liberty (see I.I. v.

This is a minimum safeguard against arbitrary treatment. This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5: by virtue of paragraph 2 anyone who is arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with paragraph 4. Whilst this information must be conveyed \u201cpromptly\u201d, it need not be related in its entirety by the arresting officer at the very moment of the arrest. Whether the content and promptness of the information conveyed are sufficient is to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, \u00a7 40, Series A no. 182). Anyone entitled to take proceedings to have the lawfulness of his detention speedily decided cannot make effective use of that right unless he is promptly and adequately informed of the reasons relied on to deprive him of his liberty (see Van der Leer v. the Netherlands, 21 February 1990, \u00a7\u00a028, Series A no. 170A). Further, if the grounds for detention change, or if new relevant facts arise concerning the detention, a detainee has a right to this further information (see X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 6998/75, Commission\u2019s report of 16 July 1980, \u00a7 105, Series\u00a0B no. 41).",

The relevant meetings that had been held by the authorities concerned the handling of the situation of Syrian Kurdish failed asylum-seekers. The Minister of the Interior had given instructions to proceed with the deportation of Syrian Kurdish failed asylum-seekers with the exception of those who were Ajanib or Mahtoumeen. The police had been instructed to use discreet methods of arrest and execute the deportation orders starting with the leaders of the protest. As a result, the police had carried out an operation on 11 June 2010 against the whole group of protesters, including women and children. According to the Government only those whose asylum applications had still been pending were released. The rest had been kept in detention pending deportation. However, in reality, the asylum procedure had not been completed for the applicant as well as a number of other protesters whom the Government had intended to deport. If it had not been for the application of Rule 39 by the Court they would all have been deported. In fact, some of the protesters had been released by the authorities following the application of Rule 39 and had had their deportation orders annulled. The applicant also noted that the authorities had issued deportation orders against stateless Syrian Kurds and that some of the asylum-seekers concerned had had their asylum applications dismissed purely on procedural grounds without having benefited from an examination of the merits of their claim.",

The Court came without difficulty to the conclusion that there had been a clear violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4. It first ruled on the complicated issue of the extraterritorial applicability of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 which arose in that case. Once it had found that this provision was applicable, the violation was self-evident, as the transfer of the applicants to Libya had been carried out without any form of examination of each applicant\u2019s individual situation. It was not disputed that the applicants had not undergone any identification procedure by the Italian authorities, who restricted themselves to embarking all the intercepted migrants onto military ships and disembarking them on Libyan soil. Moreover, the personnel aboard the military ships were not trained to conduct individual interviews and were not assisted by interpreters or legal advisers. In the Court\u2019s view this was sufficient to rule out the existence of sufficient guarantees ensuring that the individual circumstances of each of those concerned were actually the subject of a detailed examination (\u00a7\u00a7 185-186).",

As a result of this examination some of the persons arrested were allowed to return home as their immigration status was found to be in order and thus their presence on Cypriot territory was lawful. In these circumstances, the fact that all the persons concerned were taken together to the ERU headquarters and that the authorities decided to deport them in groups did not render their deportation a collective measure within the meaning attributed to that term by the Court\u2019s case-law. Similarly, the fact that the deportation orders and the corresponding letters were couched in formulaic and, therefore, identical terms and did not specifically refer to the earlier decisions regarding the asylum procedure is not itself indicative of a collective expulsion. What is important is that every case was looked at individually and decided on its own particular facts (see Andric, cited above). Although not expressly stated in the deportation orders and letters, the decision to deport was based on the conclusion that the person concerned was an illegal immigrant following the rejection of his or her asylum claim or the closure of the asylum file. Although a mistake was made in relation to the status of some of the persons concerned, including that of the applicant (see paragraphs 58 and 134 above) this, while unfortunate, cannot be taken as showing that there was a collective expulsion.",
