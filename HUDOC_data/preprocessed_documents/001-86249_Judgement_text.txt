The case originated in an application (no. 41803/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Ivan Pavlovich Belochenko on 16 November 2004.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mrs V. Lutkovska, succeeded by Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 21 January 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Sevastopil.
On 30 July 1999 the  (Військовий суд Севастопільського гарнізону) ordered the Military Unit A-3009 (Військова частина А-3009) to pay the applicant, a retired officer, 1,599.42 hryvnyas (UAH) in compensation for his uniform. This judgment was not appealed against, became final and the enforcement proceedings were instituted to collect the judgment debt.
On numerous occasions the bailiffs informed the applicant that they were unable to enforce the judgment on account of the lack of budgetary allocations.
On 17 May 2005 the judgment debt was paid to the applicant.
On an unspecified date the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Nakhimovsky District Court of Sevastopil (Нахімовський районний суд м. Севастополя) seeking indexation of the award, which was due to him under the judgment of 30 July 1999, default interest and non-pecuniary damage on account of the delay in payment.
On 10 October 2006 the court awarded the applicant UAH 1,375.50 in indexation of the judgment award and dismissed the remainder of his claims. This judgment was not appealed against, became final, and enforcement proceedings were instituted to collect the judgment debt. As of August 2007 this judgment remained unenforced.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment in the case of Voytenko v. Ukraine (no. 18966/02, §§ 20-25, 29 June 2004).
