Even though the size of the cell which he shared with three other prisoners could potentially raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Ostrovar\u00a0v. , no.\u00a035207/03, \u00a7 60, 13 September 2005), it is to be observed that he was only confined there for a period of 14 days. The applicant has not substantiated his argument that the material conditions of his detention were such as to give rise to concern. The Court also notes that the food provided to the applicant appears to have been adequate and that there were no restrictions on his spouse's visiting rights. While it is regrettable that it was the applicant's spouse who had to provide him with bedding, he was at least able to benefit thereby from a certain level of hygiene in his cell.",
