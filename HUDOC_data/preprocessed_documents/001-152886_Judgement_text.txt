The case originated in an application (no. 65499/11) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr György Kepecs (“the applicant”), on 17 October 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr G. Magyar, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
The applicant complained that the imposition of 98% tax on part of his severance payment was contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
On 6 June 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Budapest.
From 1 October 2003 the applicant was employed with a State-owned gambling service provider.
On 28 June 2010 the applicant’s employment was terminated as of 27 October 2010. The employer paid the applicant severance payment, subject to payroll burdens, which consisted of payment for unused annual leave and an additional two months’ salary.
Under new legislation (see paragraph 9 below) the severance payment was subsequently taxed at a 98% rate in its part exceeding 3.5 million Hungarian forints (HUF); the income tax and social security contributions already paid (see paragraph 7 above) were deducted from the tax payable. Thus, the applicant paid an additional HUF 3,588,701 (approximately 11,300 euros (EUR)) in special tax on 17 May 2011.
For relevant domestic law, see the judgments N.K.M. v. Hungary (no. 66529/11, §§ 8-19, 14 May 2013); Gáll v. Hungary (no. 49570/11, §§ 8-18, 25 June 2013) and R.Sz. v. Hungary (no. 41838/11, §§ 8-17, 2 July 2013).
