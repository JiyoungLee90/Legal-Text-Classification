The Court finds no reason which would require it to reach a different conclusion. In particular, criminal charges were pending against the applicant for a considerable length of time and he could not be sure that he would not, either during those criminal proceedings or at any future stage, face further legal consequences if, as a publisher, he published other books on similar matters. The Court considers that the eight-and-a-half years\u2019 criminal proceedings conducted against the applicant, in view of the chilling effect which those proceedings may well have produced, cannot be viewed as comprising purely hypothetical risks to the applicant, but constituted genuine and effective restrictions per se. The declaration that the proceedings had become time-barred merely put an end to the aforementioned risks but did\u00a0not alter the fact that those risks had placed the applicant under pressure for\u00a0a substantial period of time (ibid. \u00a7\u00a7 49 and 50; see also Semir\u00a0G\u00fczel\u00a0v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 29483/09, \u00a7\u00a7 26-31, 13 September 2016).

The Court considers that the principles contained in the abovementioned judgments pertaining to the media also apply to the publication of books in\u00a0general or written texts other than the periodical press (see Association\u00a0Ekin v. France, no 39288/98, \u00a7\u00a7 56-57, ECHR 2001VIII, and \u00c7amyar and Berkta\u015f v. Turkey, no. 41959/02, \u00a7\u00a036, 15\u00a0February 2011). The Court notes that criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant on the basis of charges of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation and disseminating propaganda in its favour through the publication of a book because he was the owner of the publishing house and editor-in-chief of the book in question. Therefore, the impugned interference must also be seen in the context of the essential role of the press in ensuring the proper functioning of political democracy (ibid., \u00a7 37, and the cases cited therein).",

The assize court found that the book facilitated transmission of the opinions of the PKK to the public and thus was used to bringing more sympathisers into that organisation in both of its judgments.
