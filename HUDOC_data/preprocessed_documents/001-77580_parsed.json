They did not feel that they had enough evidence to bring charges and consequently some officers from the Police, Gendarmerie and MIT started talking about using different methods of dealing with certain members of the Kurdish community. A special team was formed for this purpose by, inter alia, the Chief of Police, Mehmet A\u011far and the Chief of Special Forces, Korkut Eken. This team consisted both of members of the Special Forces and certain civilians, including Ya\u015far \u00d6z. The activities of this special team were known to other members of the MIT and the Intelligence Branch of the Gendarmerie (the J\u0130TEM). The kidnapping and the killing of Sava\u015f Buldan and his friends formed part of such activities. It was established that these persons were helping the PKK financially. The way they were kidnapped and killed did not bear any resemblance to the activities of a Mafia or other underground organisation known to us. Police identity cards and policing methods were used during the kidnapping of Sava\u015f Buldan and his friends, otherwise it would not have been possible to kidnap them and to kill them as there are checkpoints on the roads along which they would have been stopped.

However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating a use of lethal force or a disappearance may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see, in general, McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, \u00a7\u00a7 108-15, ECHR 2001III, and Av\u015far, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 390-95).",

For the Court, the applicants' concerns should have led the authorities to broaden the scope of the investigation. However, it is apparent from the case file that the authorities did not make any serious attempt to broaden the investigation so as to investigate the possible involvement of State agents in the killing. It notes that a link between the killing of Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and the special team mentioned in the Susurluk Report was in fact established in the decision of the  dated 24\u00a0November 1998. In reaching this decision, the  stated that there was no evidence to suggest that the killing of Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and his friends had been carried out for personal motives. However, the  ruled that it had no jurisdiction in the matter and transferred the case file to the  (paragraphs 37-38 above). As can be observed from the facts of the case, a protracted dispute then ensued over which court had jurisdiction to prosecute Ya\u015far \u00d6z for the killing of Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m. Ultimately, the Fifth Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation found that the charges laid against Ya\u015far \u00d6z were not related to organised crime and remitted the case to the , which acquitted Ya\u015far \u00d6z for lack of evidence. It can only be concluded that in the course of these proceedings the link identified between the killing of Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and the activities of the special team was regrettably ignored. The Court is also struck by the fact that it would appear that no investigation was carried out in order to determine whether the documents referred to by Mr\u00a0Hanefi Avc\u0131 in his statement dated 7 February 1997 in fact existed (paragraph\u00a025 above). It recalls in this connection that, according to Mr Avc\u0131, if an investigation were to be conducted into certain sources it would be possible to find documents to verify the accuracy of the allegation that Adnan Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and his friends had been killed by an illegal group.",

The Court notes in this respect that there was no real co-ordination between the different public prosecutors dealing with the case. In this connection, it refers to the fact that the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor's office only transferred the case file to the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor on 17 March 1995, almost nine months after the incident (paragraph 23 above). However, this case file contained crucial information including eyewitness testimonies to the abduction of the applicants' relative. Such information could have been very useful to the Y\u0131\u011f\u0131lca public prosecutor in the early stages of his investigation. Furthermore, the video recordings of the security cameras outside the \u00c7\u0131nar Hotel were requested only on 29 September 1998, almost four years after the incident. As these recordings were kept for one month and then erased, crucial evidence that would have been of great importance to the pending investigation could not be obtained (paragraph 31 above).",
