The defendants were sentenced to prison sentences ranging from eight months to one year on account of, inter alia, the significant passage of time from the commission of the crime until their conviction. However, the court concluded that prison sentences were appropriate in order to make the defendants realise the gravity of their offences, particularly as they had not shown any genuine regret over the criminal acts committed against the applicant who continued to suffer from the consequences thereof.

The court pointed out that the overall duration of the proceedings had amounted to fifteen years and nine months, noting in particular the lack of any activity between April 1991 and March 2001. Moreover, it observed that the applicant\u2019s case had involved two major criminal acts, a gang rape and a sexual assault, which, in addition to posing a considerable threat to society, had caused severe mental distress to the applicant. The court emphasised that due to the nature of these criminal acts committed against her, the criminal proceedings ought to have been conducted in a particularly diligent, determined and prompt manner; however, that had not been the case. It was further noted that the lengthy proceedings had been extremely stressful for the applicant, who had been forced to relive the painful events too many times, in addition to which she had had no effective remedies at her disposal in order to accelerate the proceedings. Thus, having regard to the importance of the case for the applicant and the lengthy period of absence of any procedural acts on the part of the criminal court, the court deviated from the general practice of the domestic authorities to award, within the statutory range of between EUR 300 and 5,000, 45% of the sum that would be awarded for a violation of the right to trial within a reasonable time by the Court. Thus, the applicant was awarded the maximum amount possible under the 2006 Act, although she would have apparently not been entitled to such amount purely on the basis of the excessive length of proceedings.",

For such a procedural obligation to come into effect, a significant proportion of the investigating steps required by this provision will have been or ought to have been taken after the critical date (see Janowiec and Others, \u00a7\u00a0142). Subsequently, the Court has applied this principle to cases concerning deaths at the hands of private individuals (see Lyubov Efimenko v. Ukraine, no. 75726/01, \u00a7 63, 25 November 2010, and Frande\u015f v. Romania (dec.) no.\u00a035802/05, 17 May 2011). Finally, in Tuna v.

The Court agrees with the Government that a considerable number of procedural steps were carried out before the critical date. However, it is worth noting that following the remittal of the case for fresh examination, three entire retrials involving a number of hearings were conducted after this date. Furthermore, the criminal proceedings against the ten individuals accused of raping and sexually assaulting the applicant took place before three judicial instances and were only concluded on 12 July 2007, thirteen years after the entry into force of the Convention. A significant proportion of the proceedings covering a lengthy period of time therefore took place after the critical date and, finally, the applicant\u2019s complaints about the State\u2019s failure to conduct effective and prompt criminal proceedings also pertain to a large extent to this period.",

In support of their submissions, they cited eight decisions of the Supreme Court adopted between 1998 and 2009 and two decisions of the Ljubljana Higher Court of 2010 and 2011 showing that the State had been found by the domestic courts to be liable for damages related to the work of its employees and the exercise of their powers. Moreover, the Government submitted eleven decisions of the Supreme Court, the Ljubljana Higher Court and the Maribor Higher Court in which a wide range of rights, such as the rights to personal dignity, to physical and mental integrity, to a healthy living environment, to personal liberty, to respect for the deceased and to the inviolability of the home had been considered as \u201cpersonal rights\u201d by the courts and their unlawful infringement had been found to cause mental distress warranting compensation.",

It emphasises at the outset that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically: in reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of the individual case. This means, among other things, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.

The Court notes that the prospects of success of such a remedy would depend on whether the applicant could prove that the conduct of the domestic authorities had amounted to unlawful \u201cinfringement of her personal rights\u201d (see the relevant domestic provisions summarised in paragraph 34 above). However, none of the decisions cited by the Government showed that the procedural obligation to provide for effective prosecution of violent acts against individuals would be considered by the domestic courts within the context of \u201cpersonal rights\u201d and that the authorities\u2019 failure to comply with their procedural obligation would amount to the \u201cinfringement\u201d of these rights. The domestic decisions cited by the Government related to substantive fundamental rights and not to the rights arising from the State\u2019s positive obligation to conduct an effective investigation and criminal proceedings. Moreover, it cannot be overlooked that the Government disputed the applicant\u2019s victim status on account of the compensation she had been awarded in the proceedings against the State under the 2006 Act (see paragraph 51 below). Having regard to the specific circumstances of the present case, where the applicant essentially complained of the lack of promptness in dealing with her case, this Government\u2019s objection reinforces the Court\u2019s doubts as to whether she could have obtained a separate examination of her complaints in the light of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 3 in a civil action brought in accordance with the general rules of civil law.",

In her additional submissions the applicant pointed out that all perpetrators of the gang rape and sexual assault had been acquitted of all charges in the initial proceedings, which, for her, had resulted in prolonged and heightened uncertainty as to whether her rapists would be convicted and had caused her severe suffering. In the retrial, the proceedings against the two missing defendants had had to be severed into separate cases, which had entailed her involvement in three separate trials in which she had had to relive the events in question over and over. She had also felt deeply humiliated by the statements made by the defendants at the hearings, in which they had laid heavy emphasis on her physical disability. Finally, the applicant pointed out that the perpetrators had been handed down very lenient prison sentences which had not sufficiently taken her young age at the time of the commission of their crimes and her physical and learning disabilities into account.",

This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, such as by taking witness statements and gathering forensic evidence, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see Denis Vasilyev v. Russia, no.\u00a032704/04, \u00a7 100, 17 December 2009, with further references). The promptness of the authorities\u2019 reaction to the complaints is an important factor (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a7 133 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV). Consideration has been given in the Court\u2019s judgments to matters such as the time taken to open investigations, delays in identifying witnesses or taking statements (see M\u0103t\u0103saru and Savi\u0163chi v.

Following the remittal of the case and an initial inquiry seeking to establish the defendants\u2019 places of residence in 1991, all activity in the case ceased until, and beyond, the entry into force of the Convention for Slovenia, owing to the fact that two defendants could not be found. Between 1995 and 2001 another four similar inquiries were made with no success (see paragraph 12 above). For the same reason, the five hearings scheduled between 1999 and 2001 also had to be adjourned (see paragraph 14 above). At the applicant\u2019s suggestion, on 29 May 2001 the competent court severed the cases against the two missing defendants, who allegedly resided abroad, into separate proceedings and subsequently issued an international arrest warrant against them. The first hearing in the main proceedings against eight defendants was held on 22 November 2001, and on 4 June 2002 the court found them guilty of the charges (see paragraph 19 above) and imposed prison sentences on them. The first-instance judgment was upheld both by the higher court on 25 January 2006 and by the Supreme Court on 12 July 2007 (see paragraph 20 above). In addition the two missing defendants, who were subsequently found abroad and extradited to Slovenia, were eventually convicted as charged and their appeals were dismissed in 2004 and 2006 (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above).",

Namely, it notes with concern that the only procedural activity undertaken by the competent court between the remittal of the case in 1991 and the first retrial hearing, which took place on 22 November 2001, was to make a few inquiries about the defendants\u2019 places of residence and to schedule five hearings, all of which were adjourned for failure of some of the defendants to appear in court. Considering that it was clear from as early as July 1991 that two defendants were not to be found in Slovenia, in the Court\u2019s opinion these steps were clearly insufficient to secure their presence at the hearings and thus to proceed with the case in a diligent manner. In this connection, the Court finds it striking that detention orders and international arrest warrants against them were only issued in 2001. It is equally striking that the separation of the cases against these defendants from the main proceedings was also first envisaged in 2001, at the suggestion of the applicant, who, since 1995, had repeatedly been urging the district court to accelerate the proceedings. In the Court\u2019s opinion, this course of proceedings implies a lack of interest on the part of the competent courts in bringing the responsible persons to justice, which was at variance with the Convention requirements of effective investigation and trial as set out in paragraph 63 above.",

In this regard, the Court would add that the failure of the State to ensure effective prosecution of rape cannot be justified by the backlog of cases in the relevant courts (see, mutatis mutandis, Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7 183, ECHR 2006V, and the references cited therein).

They pointed out that in the proceedings for compensation under the 2006 Act, the domestic courts had taken account of the particular circumstances of the criminal proceedings, emphasising that the applicant\u2019s case had not been handled in a careful, resolute and rapid manner, as required by the serious nature of the criminal acts involved, and that during the lengthy proceedings the applicant had had to relive the abuse she had suffered, which had caused her severe mental distress.

Indeed, the Court considers that the duration and severity of the violation are among the factors to be taken into account in assessing whether the domestic award could be regarded as adequate and sufficient redress (see, mutatis mutandis, Shilbergs, cited above, \u00a7 74, and Shishkin v. , no. 18280/04, \u00a7 108, 7\u00a0July 2011).",

It is especially difficult in a case where personal suffering, whether physical or mental, is the subject of the claim. There is no standard by which pain and suffering, physical discomfort and mental distress and anguish can be measured in monetary terms (see Shilbergs, cited above, \u00a7 76, and Nardone v. Italy (dec.), no. 34368/02, 25\u00a0November 2004). The Court does not doubt that the domestic courts in the present case attempted to assess the level of mental distress and suffering sustained by the applicant as a result of the lack of effectiveness in conducting the criminal proceedings concerning her rape. However, this assessment was by definition limited by the statutory maximum of EUR\u00a05,000, an amount which could not be exceeded regardless of the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). This amount, however, is substantially lower than the amounts awarded by the Court in other cases involving deficiencies in an investigation and/or a prosecution of cases of sexual abuse committed by private individuals (see M.C. v. Bulgaria, cited above; P.M. v. Bulgaria, cited above; C.A.S. and C.S. v. , no. 26692/05, 20\u00a0March 2012; and D.J. v. Croatia, no.\u00a042418/10, 24 July 2012).",
