The case originated in an application (no. 10374/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Mikhail Borisovich Volovich (“the applicant”), on 4 December 2001.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, the Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 4 April 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Yekaterinburg. He suffers from an occupational disease.
On 15 May 1997 the applicant sued his former employers, private companies, for compensation for health damage.  The Zheleznodorozhniy District Court of Yekaterinburg registered his statement of claim and listed the first preliminary hearing for 9 July 1997. Another preliminary hearing was held on 4 September 1997.
Of six hearings listed between 5 February 1998 and 13 June 2000 two hearings were adjourned because the judge was ill or involved in other proceedings and two hearings were postponed for provision of additional evidence and obtaining statements by witnesses.
In June 1999 and January 2000 the applicant asked the District Court to order expert medical examinations. The examinations were not ordered because the applicant withdrew his requests.
On 13 June 2000 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court dismissed the applicant's action as unsubstantiated.
That judgment was quashed on appeal by the  on 1 August 2000. The case was remitted for a fresh examination to the District Court.

On 5 June 2001 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court ordered a medical examination of the applicant. The court noted that the defendants should bear the expenses of the examination and stayed the proceedings pending completion.  The applicant appealed against that decision, claiming that the examination was not necessary.
The  upheld the decision of 5 June 2001 on 7 August 2001.
On 9 July 2002 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court sent the case-file and the applicant's medical records to the Moscow-based Federal expert council on occupational diseases (Федеральный экспертный совет по профзаболеваниям).
In November 2002 the council informed the applicant that the examination had not been carried out because it had not been paid for.
The examination was performed on 10 April 2003 by the  of the medical sciences.  The expert report was sent to the District Court on 16 April 2003. A month later the District Court received the case-file.
On 23 May 2003 the case was assigned to another judge and a hearing was fixed for 18 June 2003.  Between 18 June and 4 August 2003 the District Court fixed two hearings which were adjourned because the defendants defaulted and the judge was ill.
On 4 August 2003 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court dismissed the applicant's claims.
That judgment was upheld on 2 October 2003 by the .
