The Court notes that the final decision in the prosecution of the accused police officers was delivered on 8 November 2007, before the Court had delivecidred on the admissibility of the present application. The Government\u2019s first objection must accordingly be dismissed. As regards the second objection, the Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected the Government\u2019s similar preliminary objections in previous cases (see, in particular, Atalay v.\u00a0, no.\u00a01249/03, \u00a7 29, 18 September 2008). It reaffirms its earlier conclusions that the remedy referred to by the Government cannot be regarded as sufficient for a Contracting State\u2019s obligations under Article\u00a03 of the Convention. The Court therefore finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from its previous findings. Accordingly, this objection cannot be upheld.",

In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Av\u015far v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7 282, ECHR 2001VII (extracts)). Such proof may, however, follow from the co-existence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see G\u00fcler and \u00d6ngel, cited above, \u00a7 26, and Ireland v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 161, Series A no. 25). Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000VII).",

In this connection, the Court further takes note of the fact that the applicants were not examined by a doctor immediately after their arrest. Such an examination would have been the appropriate step for the authorities to have taken (see \u00c7a\u011flayan v. , no. 30461/02, \u00a7\u00a041, 21\u00a0October 2008). Moreover, although the medical report issued on 18\u00a0January 1998 revealed no signs of violence on their bodies, the subsequent report drafted the following day noted several bruises on the applicants. These findings matched at least the applicants\u2019 allegation of having been beaten and kicked. In this connection, the Court notes that the applicants remained in detention during this time and therefore reiterates that the domestic authorities were under an obligation to provide a plausible explanation for these injuries. However, in their observations the Government failed to do so, stating solely that the findings in the medical reports did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicants had been ill-treated, as alleged.",

Due to this delay, the criminal proceedings against the accused police officers were dropped as being time-barred. In view of the foregoing, the Court concludes that, far from being rigorous, the criminal justice system as applied in this case was not sufficiently dissuasive to effectively prevent illegal acts of the type complained of by the applicants. Accordingly, there has also been a procedural violation of Article 3 of the Convention.",
