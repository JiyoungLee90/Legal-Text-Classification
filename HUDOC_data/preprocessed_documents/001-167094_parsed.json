Together with the [airport security screening service] they checked all passengers, which included screening their luggage with special equipment and checking their documents. During the check some [officers] noticed that tickets of certain passengers had additional non-standard notes, and, when inspected, these tickets raised doubts as to their authenticity. Because of that, thirteen suspected forged tickets were seized and the passengers were questioned about the circumstances of their purchase. Moreover, several passengers decided not to fly, without explaining why. On the same day similar checks were conducted for other flights to Samara.",

Accordingly, in the absence of any written evidence from the Government to rebut the applicant\u2019s version of events, the Court accepts what he has said. As for the two points of the applicant\u2019s account which the Government expressly deny, the seizure of the passport and the duration of the questioning, the Court finds the applicant\u2019s account more credible. For the former, it is a reasonable inference that, if the applicant\u2019s ticket was seized, the police would also seize his passport, even if only to compare the information on the passport with the passenger information on the ticket. For the latter, when the Government have failed to produce any records, or even to state at what time they say the questioning ended if not 1.30 p.m., the Court sees no reason to disbelieve the applicant.",

It follows that he was under the control of the police from 8.30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m.",

The following four factors are decisive. First, the applicant had little choice but to follow the police officer from the check-in hall; if he had refused, he would have been disobeying an ostensibly lawful order of the police (see, mutatis mutandis, Lykova, cited above, \u00a7 78). Second, although not physically restrained, he was clearly unable to leave the room in which he was questioned: the armed guard in the doorway prevented that (see the cases cited at paragraph 36(v) above and, in particular, Iustin Robertino Micu, \u00a7\u00a089). Third, it is no answer that, as the Government have argued, the applicant was not detained because he was not arrested: as reiterated at paragraph 36(iii) above, the characterisation or lack of characterisation given by a State to a factual situation cannot decisively affect the Court\u2019s conclusion as to the existence of a deprivation of liberty. Fourth, give its nature, the applicant\u2019s detention of liberty must be distinguished from the Gahramanov case, where the stopping of the applicant at an airport during a routine border control to clarify his situation was found not to be deprivation of liberty, particular when his detention did not exceed the time strictly necessary for that purpose (see \u00a7\u00a7 41-47 of the judgment, cited above). In Mr Kasparov\u2019s case, the police went beyond simply clarifying the situation relating to his tickets and purportedly began investigating the crime of forgery, by questioning him, searching him and drawing up a report. Their detention of him thus went far beyond the time strictly necessary for verifying the formalities normally associated with airport travel. Therefore, in contrast to the Gahramanov case, this was not the normal situation that anyone travelling through an airport can be expected to endure in the common good.",

The prosecutor\u2019s decision of 28\u00a0June 2007 not to open proceedings first records the evidence of officer A., who stated that he received intelligence about forged tickets on the eve of the applicant\u2019s flight. However, the prosecutor\u2019s decision then goes on to record the evidence given by the Head of the Operational-Search Unit of the Aviation Division of the Ministry of the Interior, whose evidence was that, on the occasion of the EURussia summit in Samara, the police carried out activities \u201cto identify persons of an extremist nature\u201d and that it was only in the context of those activities that the supposedly forged tickets were then discovered (see paragraph 17 above). In their submissions to the Court, the Government have not sought to explain this contradiction between the evidence of officer\u00a0A. and the evidence of the Head of the Operational-Search Unit. In any event, in respect of officer A., the Court has already noted that there is no evidence to support the allegations of forgery. Moreover, even if the Court were to accept the evidence of the Head of the Operational-Search Unit rather that than of officer A., the Court has already found that the detention of those travelling to the Samara summit on the basis of a vague reference to \u201coffences of an extremist nature\u201d was insufficient for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1(c): Shimovolos, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a055 and 56. If it was insufficient in Shimovolos, it is insufficient in this case. For this reason, and for the reasons given in paragraph 53 above, the Court concludes that the applicant was not arrested and detained on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence nor to prevent their committing an offence, within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c).",

Azerbaijan, no. 69981/14, \u00a7\u00a7 125 and 156, 17 March 2016). While I agree with my colleagues that the applicant has suffered a violation of his rights under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, as he was unlawfully deprived of his liberty, and of Article 11 of the Convention, as that deprivation of liberty prevented him from exercising his right to freedom of assembly, these findings do not suffice to address the fact that the State instrumentalised the law in order to target and silence a dissident, a circumstance which falls squarely within the ambit of Article 18.",

Like Article 14 of the Convention, another accessory provision, Article 18 must be understood as protecting a legal interest separate from that protected by the other rights and freedoms enshrined in the Convention. Preventing improper limitations of rights as a legal interest is separate from and additional to protecting those rights themselves, in the same way as preventing discriminatory limitations of rights as a legal interest is separate from and additional to protecting those rights themselves.

In 2014 it found a violation of Article 18 in the context of criminal proceedings against an Azerbaijani blogger and opposition politician, on the grounds that \u201cthe actual purpose of the impugned measures was to silence or punish the applicant for criticising the Government\u201d (see Ilgar Mammadov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 15172/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0142-43, 22 May 2014). In 2016 the Court similarly found a violation of Article 18 in the criminal proceedings instituted against an Azerbaijani human rights advocate, where the \u201cthe actual purpose of the impugned measures was to silence and punish the applicant for his activities\u201d (see Rasul Jafarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 125 and 156).",

The facts indicate that the applicant in the present case was singled out at Sheremetyevo airport to prevent him, as a prominent opposition member, from attending a demonstration at the EURussia summit in Samara. The fact that the Court has found that his deprivation of liberty did not have a legitimate purpose as required under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, and that the restriction of his freedom of assembly under Article 11 of the Convention lacked a legal basis, does not address the fact that he was singled out by the authorities, who made improper use of the relevant legal machinery with the intention of silencing a dissident.",

This is due largely to the accessory nature of the provision and to the high standard of proof required under it, which has rightly been criticised by some of my colleagues (see, inter alia, Tchankotadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a015256/05, 21 June 2016, joint concurring opinion of Judges Saj\u00f3, Tsotsoria and Pinto de Albuquerque, \u00a7\u00a7 7-10, and, in the same judgment, the concurring opinion of Judge K\u016bris). On occasion, the Court has interpreted that standard of proof in an almost impossibly strict manner, requiring applicants to provide evidence to rebut the presumption that the State authorities acted in good faith, in order to prove that the criminal proceedings against them did not have a \u201chealthy core\u201d (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, \u00a7\u00a7 906 and 908-09, 25\u00a0July 2013).",

For present purposes it suffices to note that the Court\u2019s jurisprudence has begun to move away from the inordinately high standard of proof occasionally required under Article 18 in the past (see Ilgar Mammadov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 15172/13, \u00a7\u00a7 142-43, 22 May 2014, and Rasul Jafarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 125 and 156) and that, where the Court finds that an applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty was not based on a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), it considers the presumption of good faith on the part of the State to be rebutted and examines the merits of the complaint, namely whether there is \u201cproof that the authorities\u2019 actions were actually driven by improper reasons\u201d (compare Rasul Jafarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0156-57).",

In the past, the Court has held that \u201cin view of the scarcity of the case-law under that Convention provision, in each new case where allegations of improper motives are made the Court must show particular diligence\u201d (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7 898). That diligence is missing here. Indeed, the Court\u2019s failure to examine complaints under Article 18 on the merits not only fails to do justice to the victims of targeted criminal proceedings, but it also reinforces the relegation of Article\u00a018 to an insignificant role in which it is not being used for its intended purpose.",
