At the same time, the Court has noted that the reasons not to release the person should be compelling (see Barilo v. Ukraine, no.\u00a09607/06, \u00a7 93, 16 May 2013). In the present case, the reasons for extending the applicant\u2019s detention were the need to obtain an assessment of his personality and of the likelihood of his absconding (see paragraph 10 above). The Court notes that the reasons given do not substantiate the existence of any risks or circumstances justifying the need to keep the applicant in detention. In fact, the District Court\u2019s decision did not contain any assessment of his individual circumstances or the risks justifying his detention having regard to the specificity of his condition (see paragraph 9 above).",
