Belgium, judgment of 13\u00a0June 1979, Series A no. 31, pp. 27-28, \u00a7 63). A \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of the above provision may be either an \u201cexisting possession\u201d or a claim, in respect of which the applicant can argue that he has at least a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of obtaining effective enjoyment of a property right (see the Pine Valley Developments v. Ireland judgment of 29 November 1991, Series A no. 222, p. 23, \u00a7 51). The \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d may also encompass the conditions attaching to the acquisition or enjoyment of property rights. For example, in the case of Pine Valley (cited above), the Court found that a legitimate expectation arose when outline planning permission had been granted, in reliance on which the applicant companies had purchased land with a view to its development. The planning permission, which was later annulled rendering development of the land impossible, was a \u201ccomponent part of the applicant companies\u2019 property\u201d. Similarly, where an applicant had leased land for a period of 22 years on payment of an annual ground rent with an option to renew the lease for a further period at the expiry of the term and had erected at his own expense buildings to sub-let for rent, the Court found that he had to be regarded as having at least a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of exercising the option to renew and this had to be regarded, for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as \u201cattached to the property rights granted to him ... under the lease\u201d (Stretch v. the United Kingdom, no. 44277/98, \u00a7 35, 24\u00a0June\u00a02003).",

Thus, in 1992 the Ministry of Defence exchanged twenty of its apartments for six apartments that had been owned by the State Housing Fund and inhabited by servicemen, thereby making the latter apartments eligible for a sale under the beneficial conditions of the Z.O.S.J.N.A. (see paragraph 17 above).
