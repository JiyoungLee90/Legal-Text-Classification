On 18 December 2004 the applicant appealed to the Bavarian Social Court of Appeal.

On 27 April 2005 the Pension Office received the information from the Slovenian authorities. However, they were translated only on 27 June 2005 and submitted to the court on 28 June 2005. On the same day the Pension Office requested additional information from the Slovenian pension authorities which it received on 26 July 2005.

On 5 March 2008 the judgment was served on the applicant.
The present case was initially registered under application no. 847/04. In his application form the applicant merely complained about the refusal of the Pension Office to grant him an early pension for disabled persons and a pension on account of his reduced earning capacity.
On 4 January 2006 the applicant submitted that it had been incomprehensible for him why it took the Social Court of Appeal and the Pension Office such a long time to decide his application. In his view there had been too many delays in the whole case. Due to these delays he had now been suffering for several years from a financial distress. He further maintained that he had been “cheated” for many years by the Pension Office.
On 6 October 2007 the Court decided to sever the proceedings in so far as they concerned the proceedings regarding a pension on account of the applicant's reduced earning capacity and to conduct them under the instant application no. 46682/07.
By letter of 7 November 2007 the applicant informed the court that his proceedings concerning the pension on account of his reduced earning capacity were still pending and that he was very impatient because he “has now been fighting for his rights for eight years”.
On 20 November 2007 the Court declared application no. 847/04 concerning the disability pension inadmissible for being manifestly illfounded.
