The case originated in nine applications (nos. 70945/11, 23611/12, 26998/12, 41150/12, 41155/12, 41463/12, 41553/12, 54977/12 and 56581/12) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by various religious communities active in Hungary, and their ministers and members (see Annex), on 16 November 2011, 3 and 24 April, 25 and 28 June, and 19 and 29 August 2012, respectively. Given that the applications raised the same issue in essence, the Court decided to join them in accordance with Rule 42 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
In a judgment delivered on 8 April 2014 (“the principal judgment”), the Court declared application no. 41463/12 inadmissible and held, as regards the remaining applications, that in removing the applicants’ church status altogether rather than applying less stringent measures, in establishing a politically tainted re-registration procedure and in treating the applicants differently from the so-called incorporated churches in certain aspects, the authorities disregarded their duty of neutrality vis-à-vis the applicant communities. The Court found a violation of Article 11 of the Convention read in the light of Article 9 (see Magyar Keresztény Mennonita Egyház and Others v. Hungary, nos. 70945/11, 23611/12, 26998/12, 41150/12, 41155/12, 41463/12, 41553/12, 54977/12 and 56581/12, ECHR 2014 (extracts)).
Under Article 41 of the Convention the applicants sought just satisfaction in regard to the pecuniary damage sustained, corresponding in essence to tax donations and State subsidies lost or expected to be lost in the future, as well as non-pecuniary damage and the costs and expenses incurred before the Court.
The Court held that, as regards the claims in respect of non-pecuniary damage made by Mr Izsák-Bács (in application no. 70945/11), Mr Soós (in application no. 23611/12), Mr Görbicz (in application no. 26998/12), Mr Guba (in application no. 41150/12) and Ms Bruck (in application no. 41155/12), the finding of a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction. However, it also considered that the remaining questions as to the application of Article 41 were not ready for decision, especially in view of the complex array of material advantages which the applicants claimed to have lost. The Court thus reserved that matter and invited the Government and the applicants to submit, within six months from the date on which the judgment became final, their written observations on that issue and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (see paragraph 132, and point 11 of the operative provisions, of the principal judgment).
On 8 September 2014 the panel of the Grand Chamber declined to accept a referral request from the respondent Government. Accordingly, the principal judgment became final on that date.
On 5 March 2015 the Government requested an extension of the time-limit to reach an agreement on the applicants’ claims for just satisfaction. In view of the reasonable prospects of reaching a settlement, the President of the Chamber decided to extend the time-limit until 15 May 2015.
On 15 May 2015 the Government notified the Court about an agreement concluded with six of the applicants, notably Magyar Keresztény Mennonita Egyház in application no. 70945/11, Evangéliumi Szolnoki Gyülekezet Egyház in application no. 23611/12, Budapesti Autonóm Gyülekezet in application no. 26998/12, Árpád Rendjének Jogalapja Tradicionális Egyház and Fény Gyermekei Magyar Esszénus Egyház in application no. 41553/12, and Magyarországi Biblia Szól Egyház in application 56581/12. These applicants also confirmed the conclusion of the agreements and waived any further claims against Hungary in respect of the facts giving rise to their applications.
On the same date the Government further submitted that settlement negotiations were still pending, with a view to concluding partial agreements, with Szim Shalom Egyház in application no. 41150/12, Magyar Reform Zsidó Hitközségek Szövetsége Egyház in application no. 41155/12, Dharmaling Magyarország Buddhista Egyház in application no. 41553/12 and Magyarországi Evangéliumi Testvérközösség in application no. 54977/12.
On 23 July 2015 Út és Erény Közössége Egyház (one of the applicants in application no. 41553/12) informed the Court that it had changed lawyer and was thereafter represented by Mr T. Perecz, a lawyer practising in Budapest.
On 28 July 2015 the Government informed the Court about the conclusion of partial agreements with three applicants out of those four mentioned in paragraph 8 above, notably Szim Shalom Egyház in application no. 41150/12, Magyar Reform Zsidó Hitközségek Szövetsége Egyház in application no. 41155/12, and Magyarországi Evangéliumi Testvérközösség in application no. 54977/12.
In respect of the latter applicant, the agreement contains the following passage:
“8.  The parties note that they could not reach an agreement concerning the legal basis and the amount of the damage allegedly caused by the lack of access to grants obtainable from the State budget, European Union sources or internationally financed programmes via individually appraised calls for project proposals.
The parties agree to continue until 31 December 2015 their negotiations in good faith concerning the reparation of the breach found by the [Court’s] judgment. For the reparation of damage occurring between 1 January 2015 and the date of the dispute’s resolution, they shall follow the principles laid down in the present agreement [concerning the damage occurred in the 2012-2014 period].
The parties shall inform the [Court] that, in the light of point 8 above, their agreement is to be considered a partial one, covering the damage which occurred until 31 December 2014.”
In regard to Szim Shalom Egyház and Magyar Reform Zsidó Hitközségek Szövetsége Egyház, the respective agreements contain the following passage:
“The applicant accepts the Government’s proposal and declares that it no longer maintains any claim against the Hungarian State in respect of damage sustained until 31 December 2014 concerning the matters covered by the agreement, notably the loss of 1 per cent personal income tax donations and the corresponding supplementary State subsidy, the legal costs and expenses, the default interest and the non-pecuniary damage. In these respects, the applicant considers that the Government fulfilled its obligation, flowing from the judgment of the [Court], to provide just satisfaction.”
As regards the remaining just satisfaction claims, the applicants and the Government each filed observations.
On 4 and 18 May 2016 the Government and Magyarországi Evangéliumi Testvérközösség, respectively, informed the Court of their continuing negotiations with a view to an agreement that would cover the period following 31 December 2014.
The Court finds it appropriate to reserve the questions related to the claims of Magyarországi Evangéliumi Testvérközösség and to adopt, at the same time, a partial judgment concerning the remaining applicants.
