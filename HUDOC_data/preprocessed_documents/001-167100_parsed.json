The applicant had given a partial confession to the theft but had denied murder. He had been convicted of a criminal offence in the past and had tried to escape from a police station by jumping out of a toilet window. The incident had prompted the police to install iron bars on it. In September 2006, after the murder of G., the applicant had been hospitalised for a drug overdose, but had not been arrested because after the hospital had alerted the police he had managed to escape. During the interview on 6\u00a0October 2008 the applicant, who had been drunk and had smelled of alcohol, had behaved provokingly and insulted them with obscene words. They had therefore handcuffed him (placing his hands in front) to avoid any attempts to escape or commit suicide.

Ch. claimed that he had been putting documents into a safe at the time, while F. said that Ch. had been sitting at the table and the applicant had been sitting on a chair near the table immediately before jumping out of the window. Access to the window had been blocked by the table. It had been possible to reach and open it while sitting at the table.

The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim. In the absence of such an explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government. That is justified by the fact that those in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (ibid., \u00a7 83).",

However, the exact order of events, including the time and witnesses to the applicant\u2019s fall, was never established. The investigating authority thus referred to explanations by police officer T. that he had been the first to see the applicant and go near him after his fall from the window and that nothing had been shackled to his hands. However, in his earlier statements the same officer had asserted that he had not gone near the applicant and had not seen him or whether there had been any objects nearby (see paragraph 38 above). No explanation to the change in his statements was given in the domestic inquiry. Furthermore, office no.\u00a0217 was not examined immediately after the incident, which was one of the grounds for the annulment of the investigator\u2019s refusal to open a criminal case (see paragraph 34 (i) and (ii) above).

The investigating authority carried out the preinvestigation inquiry and decided that there was nothing to show that the elements of a crime were present in respect of the actions of the police officers. On that basis they refused to open a criminal investigation. In total, they took twenty-four such decisions. The decisions were so poorly reasoned that the higher domestic authorities repeatedly set them aside as unsubstantiated, unlawful or based on an incomplete inquiry, sometimes on the same or next day. Those authorities noted on several occassions that their instructions, issued between half a year to a year and a half earlier, had never been fulfilled by the investigators responsible for dealing with the applicant\u2019s complaint, one of whom was found liable in disciplinary proceedings for stalling the inquiry. This makes it all the more surprising that such an inquiry was concluded two years later by the domestic courts, finding that the investigating authority had carried out all measures necessary for establishing the relevant facts fully, objectively and thoroughly, and had taken a reasoned decision on the basis of a full and comprehensive inquiry in accordance with the law (see paragraph\u00a040 above). In assessing whether the investigating authority\u2019s refusal to open a criminal case was lawful and well founded, in the proceedings under Article\u00a0125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the domestic courts applied strikingly low standards which fell short of the requirements of Article 3.",
