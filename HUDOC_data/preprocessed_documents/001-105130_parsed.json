In cases where contact and residence disputes concerning children arise between parents and/or other members of the children\u2019s family (see, for example, Hokkanen v. , 23 September 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 299-A, and Zawadka v. Poland, no. 48542/99, \u00a7\u00a055, 23 June 2005), the Court\u2019s case-law has consistently held that this Convention provision includes, among other things, a right for a parent to have measures taken with a view to his or her being reunited with the child, and an obligation for the national authorities to take such measures.",

The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and cooperation of all concerned are always important ingredients. Whilst the national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such cooperation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, as should, more particularly, the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article\u00a08 of the Convention (see P.P. v. , no. 8677/03, \u00a7 82, 8\u00a0January 2008; Hokkanen, cited above, \u00a7 53; and Ignaccolo-Zenide v.\u00a0Romania, no. 31679/96, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2000I). The adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent (see P.P. v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 83).",

Thus, instead of issuing the applicant with the writ of execution within one day (see paragraph 43), it took the first-instance court almost two weeks to do so (see paragraph 11). Further, despite the fact that the applicant applied to the bailiffs for assistance with the enforcement of the judgment within a few days, it took them almost two months to locate the applicant\u2019s former husband and her son, even though they had made no attempts to hide themselves, living openly in one of the houses belonging to the family, (see paragraphs 12 and 13) and a further two weeks to transfer the case to the competent bailiffs (see paragraphs 13 and 14). The Court finds that in the circumstances of the case the task of finding the applicant\u2019s child was rather simple and should not have taken so much time.",

In this respect, the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s reference to the applicant\u2019s refusal to take the child on 3\u00a0April 2009 as an excuse for the actions of the bailiffs and the courts. It takes into account the fact that the removal of the child had taken place in the house of the applicant\u2019s former husband\u2019s parents, that for almost one year before the events of 3 April 2009 the applicant\u2019s child had hardly seen her at all (see paragraphs 15 and 16) and that the child had an openly negative reaction to his mother. In these circumstances, the Court cannot place the responsibility for the failed attempt of enforcement of 3 April 2009 on the applicant.",

The Court considers that the reasoning employed by the bailiffs and the lower courts was unacceptable in the circumstances of the case, as the applicant not only consistently manifested her wish to have the judgment enforced (see paragraphs 18, 22-24 and 25), but also brought separate parallel proceedings which were meant to undermine the intentions of the bailiffs. The Court notes that despite the difficulties with which the applicant and the authorities were faced on 3 April 2009 and the potential threat to the emotional well-being and health of the child, the authorities apparently have not considered a more gradual and flexible approach towards the enforcement of the judgment.",

The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s submission that due to the nature of the dispute the process of enforcement may have required transitional measures and could not be completed within a short period of time. It observes, however, that during the period at issue, the bailiffs neither enforced the judgment, nor came up with any other plan or set of measures which would make the transition period smoother for the child (see paragraphs 29-32). In this connection, the Court is unable to accept the proceedings for clarification, brought by the bailiffs, as the writ of execution was clear and unequivocal. In fact, the decision of 25 January 2011 made this obvious, as it simply repeated the ruling of the custody judgment and described what the bailiffs had already attempted to do earlier.",
