It is sufficient to establish, in the light of the position of the ECHR, that this model provides for remedies which are in principle capable of accelerating judicial proceedings and awarding financial compensation for the violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time. In Kud\u0142a v. Poland (judgment of the Grand Chamber, 26 October 2000, application no.\u00a030210/96), the ECHR expressed the view that the domestic remedy that had been available to the applicant for protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time could be considered effective within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ... if it prevented the alleged violation or its continuation or provided adequate redress for any violation that had already occurred (\u00a7 158). In the ECHR\u2019s view, Article 13 of the Convention offers an alternative: a remedy is effective if it can be used to either expedite a judicial decision before the violation occurs, or ensure adequate redress for delays that have already occurred (\u00a7 158).",

Since it therefore appears that the court president can find such a request well-founded only if he or she agrees with the requesting party that the court did not decide within a reasonable time, it seems that the purely acceleratory remedy in question may be granted only if the length of proceedings has already been excessive. Accordingly, it would appear that if a party to judicial proceedings would resort to it in order to prevent the impending violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, such request would be dismissed as ill-founded. It follows that this purely acceleratory remedy can only prevent further violations of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time in the proceedings in which such a violation has already occurred.",
