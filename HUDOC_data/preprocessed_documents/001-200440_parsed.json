Notwithstanding this margin of appreciation, the Court finds it problematic that when deciding on the residence of the children, the domestic courts relied mainly on the applicant\u2019s affair. Even assuming that this might be relevant in certain circumstances, no assessment of other relevant factors for the best interests of the children was conducted. In particular, in the absence of any direct, concrete evidence demonstrating the impact of the applicant\u2019s past affair on her two children\u2019s upbringing and daily life, the Court finds that\u00a0 the domestic courts adopted their decision on the basis of general considerations (compare Palau-Martinez, cited above, \u00a7 42).",
