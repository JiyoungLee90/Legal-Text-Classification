In general terms, she nevertheless underlined that the grounds relied upon in a public care order should be factual and not speculative. For instance, sexual abuse of the child could not be relied upon as a fact in the absence of any expert findings corroborating such a statement. Although the issuing of a public care order could well be justified already on the basis of such suspicions, the grounds relied upon should refer to the symptoms from which the child has been found to suffer. As for the access restrictions, the Deputy Ombudsman stressed, again in general terms, that the Social Welfare Board must actively support access arrangements between the children and both their parents and others who are close to them. Such access should not hamper the foster family\u2019s daily work. The access arrangements should normally be agreed upon when the public care plan was being drawn up.

The allegation on sexual abuse of P. was first made on 4\u00a0December\u00a01991 by her mother in connection with the announced intention of the father to seek a divorce and to demand the care and custody of both children. Medical and psychological investigation of P. resulted, on 12\u00a0March\u00a01992, in a finding that there was no indication of sexual abuse. The measures recommended in the same statement did not include the taking into care of P. ",

It follows from these considerations that the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities for the regulation of the public care of children and the rights of parents whose children have been taken into care, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions that those authorities have taken in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see, for instance, the Hokkanen v.

The Court notes that in the period between 8\u00a0June\u00a01993 and 31\u00a0December\u00a01994 the applicant father seems to have met the children altogether seven times. While originally only five meetings were envisaged for the whole year of 1995, the County Administrative Court, upon the applicant father\u2019s appeal, increased the meetings by ordering, on 25\u00a0April\u00a01995, that from 1\u00a0May to 31\u00a0December\u00a01995 the applicant father could see the children once a month in their foster home. He met them once a month also in 1996. This increase of the meetings, however, seems to have met with the resistance of P. who expressed the wish of not having to meet her father so often. This in turn led the authorities to organise a child psychiatric examination in which P. told that she had been subjected to sexual abuse. After this, the Social Welfare Board restricted the applicant father\u2019s access to the children so that he could see them in their foster family four times in both 1997 and 1998. The decision was upheld by the County Administrative Court.",
