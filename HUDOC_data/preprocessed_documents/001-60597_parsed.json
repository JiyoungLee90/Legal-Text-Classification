It cannot be denied that a \u201cright\u201d to compensation arose in the circumstances, having regard to the clear language of the provisions of Law no. 466 and to the domestic authorities' finding that the applicant had been detained for two days before being released without charge (see paragraph 23 above). The award of compensation was not at the discretion of the domestic court once it was established that the statutory conditions had been fulfilled (see Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands, judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 327-A, p. 19, \u00a7 51).

Furthermore, had the domestic courts taken the view that the applicant's claim raised important public-interest considerations, a hearing could have been organised.

It is true that the complaints, taken separately, each amount to a criticism of the fairness of the domestic proceedings within the meaning of paragraph 1 of that Article.

In the Court's opinion, the applicant should have been afforded an opportunity to explain orally to the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Assize Court the moral damage which his detention entailed for him in terms of distress and anxiety. The essentially personal nature of the applicant's experience, and the determination of the appropriate level of compensation, required that he be heard. It cannot be said that these matters are technical in nature and could have been dealt with properly on the basis of the case file alone. On the contrary, the Court considers that the administration of justice and the accountability of the State would have been better served in the applicant's case by affording him the right to explain his personal situation in a hearing before the domestic court subject to public scrutiny. In its view, this factor outweighs the considerations of speed and efficiency on which, according to the Government, Law no. 466 is based.",

In the first place, domestic law did not regulate the stage at which the opinion was to be submitted to the Court of Cassation or how long the case file rested with the first-instance court before it was transferred to the Court of Cassation for the Principal Public Prosecutor's attention. It was also impossible to discover the date on which the competent division of the Court of Cassation considered the opinion and took a decision. These factors, along with the physical distance between \u0130zmir, where the applicant lives, and Ankara, where the court was based, undermined the accessibility argument. The applicant also pointed out that this general ambiguity in the procedure was further compounded by the fact that nothing was stated in Turkish law about the non-participation of the Principal Public Prosecutor in the deliberations of the divisions of the Court of Cassation. For the applicant, what was decisive was that the relevant division of the Court of Cassation read the opinion and rejected his appeal in accordance with the Principal Public Prosecutor's recommendation.",

In Kress the Court reaffirmed its case-law on the scope of the right to an adversarial procedure in circumstances where the submissions of an independent legal officer in a civil or criminal case are not disclosed in advance to the parties and the latter have no possibility of replying to them. The Court referred in this judgment (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 64-65), among other authorities, to J.J. v. the Netherlands relied on by the Chamber in its reasoning. Although it is true that the Court found no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on the facts in Kress, it must be stressed that the circumstances of the instant case are different. In Kress, the Court noted that the Government Commissioner made his submissions for the first time orally at the public hearing of a case before the Conseil d'Etat and that the parties to the proceedings, the judges and the public all learned of their content and the recommendation made in them on that occasion (ibid., \u00a7 73). Furthermore, in Kress it was not contested that a lawyer who so wishes can ask the Government Commissioner, before the hearing, to indicate the general tenor of his submissions and reply to the Commissioner's submissions by means of a memorandum and in the event of the latter raising orally at the hearing a ground not raised by the parties the presiding judge would adjourn the case to enable the parties to reply (ibid., \u00a7 76). However, these safeguards were absent in the instant case given that the Court of Cassation considered the parties' grounds of appeal without holding an oral hearing.",

In its view, and as a matter of fairness, it was incumbent on the registry of the Court of Cassation to inform the applicant that the opinion had been filed and that he could, if he so wished, comment on it in writing. It appears to the Court that this requirement is not secured in domestic law. The Government have contended that the applicant's lawyer should have known that consultation of the case file was possible as a matter of practice. However, the Court considers that to require the applicant's lawyer to take the initiative and inform himself periodically on whether any new elements have been included in the case file would amount to imposing a disproportionate burden on him and would not necessarily have guaranteed a real opportunity to comment on the opinion since he was never made aware of the timetable for the processing of the appeal (see, mutatis mutandis, Brandstetter v. Austria, judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no. 211, pp. 27-28, \u00a7 67).

The claim must be accompanied by the relevant documents and the quantum depends on the complainant's financial and social situation. There is no more to the procedure than that. Admittedly, the applicant did allege in addition before our Court that he had been the victim of ill-treatment, but that complaint was declared inadmissible in the Chamber's decision of 9 November 2000, and in any event Law no. 466 does not constitute a legal basis for an award of compensation for ill-treatment by the Turkish authorities. Such a claim should have been submitted to the civil courts in the context of civil proceedings. Consequently, the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Assize Court had to settle a very simple dispute, in that it needed to do nothing more than assess the amount of compensation to be awarded to Mr G\u00f6\u00e7, on the basis of the file alone. That was a technical exercise which could be completed in the light of the sums awarded in previous cases.

Moreover, the Rules of our own Court provide that it may dispense with a hearing if it does not need one; in practice, it actually does so more often than not in Chamber cases. Otherwise, it would be in great danger of failing to rule within a reasonable time, or indeed of being paralysed, and it is not desirable for the European Court of Human Rights to require domestic courts to do what it cannot impose on itself.",

In the present case the reporting judge saw no reason to hold such a hearing, nor did the claimant ask for one. Seeing that no public interest made oral submissions necessary in what was a purely technical matter, and without wishing to question the applicant's good faith, we think that that implicit waiver, which was nevertheless unequivocal within the meaning of the judgments cited above, makes his complaint of the lack of a hearing somewhat artificial.",

It would be more appropriate to say that the circumstances should be typical for certain types of procedure, like the specifically regulated compensation procedure which was at issue in the present case, in which a hearing is not normally required. In this typical procedure the balance between individual interests and the public interest has already been taken into account in the establishment of the procedural rules as such. It is only in more exceptional situations that the need for an oral hearing has to be shown. The method of solving legal problems by \u201ctype\u201d, that is to say by introducing, on the basis of a careful assessment of the competing interests, a specific procedure which normally does not call for a hearing, is one of the classic methods for the solution of problems of a more or less technical nature.",

The Grand Chamber nevertheless takes the view, like the two dissenting Judges Makarczyk and T\u00fcrmen in the Chamber judgment, that the two complaints are distinct and therefore require separate consideration (see paragraph 46 of the judgment). In my view, it is the right to an adversarial procedure which is fundamental to a fair trial, regardless of whether this right is guaranteed by an oral hearing or a written procedure. A violation of the right to an adversarial procedure in the instant case will therefore normally cover other violations resulting from the same procedure, as was held in the original Chamber's judgment. Nevertheless, and on further reflection, I would not exclude that there may be cases where the lack of an oral hearing cannot be covered by a finding of a violation of the right to an adversarial procedure, regardless of whether or not an oral hearing in the specific case is really necessary. The Court takes the view that \u201cgiven the fundamental nature of the right to a public hearing, of which the right to an oral hearing is one aspect, ... the applicant's complaint under this head cannot be taken to be absorbed by a finding that his right to an adversarial procedure was breached\u201d (see paragraph 46 of the judgment). In my opinion, the starting-point should be the fundamental nature of the right to an adversarial procedure of which the right to be heard, be it in an oral or written procedure, is one of the basic aspects. This different perspective may also explain the difference between the approaches taken by the original Chamber and the Grand Chamber.",
