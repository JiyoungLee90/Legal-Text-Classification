They argued that the proceedings at issue had not concerned her rights and obligations but the rights and obligations of the claimant. According to the Government, an intervener in the proceedings could not be affected by a decision of a domestic court to such an extent that he or she could reasonably claim that the decision had led to a violation of his or her rights guaranteed by the Convention. In this connection the Government pointed to the following considerations. An intervener conducted actions in the name of the party joined. Further, an intervener could conduct only those actions that were in the party\u2019s favour. Moreover, a party which an intervener had joined was allowed to withdraw at any given moment actions of the intervener that were not in the former\u2019s interest. Therefore, if an intervener deemed that he or she was entitled to a specific right regarding the subject of dispute in which he or she participated in such a capacity, he or she was authorised to lodge a civil action on his or her own behalf before a competent court. The applicant had been a so-called ordinary intervener because the courts had refused to grant her the status of single co-litigant. Thus she should have instituted separate civil proceedings on her own.",

Greece [GC], nos. 29381/09 and\u00a032684/09, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). The word \u201cvictim\u201d, in the context of Article 34 of the Convention, denotes the person or persons directly or indirectly affected by the alleged violation (see SARL du Parc d\u2019Activit\u00e9s de Blotzheim v. France, no. 72377/01, \u00a7 20, 11\u00a0July 2006). Hence, Article 34 concerns not just the direct victim or victims of the alleged violation, but also any indirect victims to whom the violation would cause harm or who would have a valid and personal interest in seeing it brought to an end (see, mutatis mutandis, Defalque v. Belgium, no.\u00a037330/02, \u00a7 46, 20 April 2006, and Tourkiki Enosi Xanthis and Others v.\u00a0Greece, no. 26698/05, \u00a7 38, 27\u00a0March 2008).",

Furthermore, the Court notes that the domestic courts established that the claimant had not had any rights to the property at issue and it therefore dismissed the claim (see paragraph 14 above). The claimant had sold part of this property to the applicant in 1997 (see paragraph 7 above). Further to this, the applicant joined the claimant and participated in the proceedings at issue from the very beginning and the domestic courts recognised her legal interest in the claimant\u2019s potential success (see paragraph 11 above). Moreover, she was allowed ratione personae to make use of legal remedies, namely an appeal, an appeal on points of law and a constitutional complaint (see paragraphs 15 and 17 above). In particular, the Constitutional Court recognised the applicant as a right-holder from section 62 of the Constitutional Court Act (see paragraphs\u00a020 and 22 above). If the applicant had had at her disposal another legal remedy in respect of the violation of her constitutional rights, as argued by the Government (see paragraph 31 above), the applicant could have lodged a constitutional complaint only after that remedy had been used, as provided for in section 62(2) of the Constitutional Court Act (see paragraph 22 above). However, the Constitutional Court did not declare the applicant\u2019s complaint inadmissible for non-compliance with the exhaustion-of-remedies rule (see paragraph 20 above).",

The Government stressed that court administrators were authorised to help judges and conduct actions for which they had competence under the relevant domestic law. Judges checked their work and thus the lawfulness of the actions of a court administrator did not come into question.

On the other hand, the Court finds that the applicant must have sustained non-pecuniary damage. In this connection the Court first reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in cases where it finds that an applicant has not had a fair hearing as required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention would, as a rule, be to reopen the proceedings in due course and reexamine the case in keeping with all the requirements of a fair hearing (see, for example, Lungoci v. Romania, no. 62710/00, \u00a7 56, 26 January 2006; Yanakiev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a040476/98, \u00a7 90, 10 August 2006; Lesjak v. Croatia, no.\u00a025904/06, \u00a7 54, 18 February 2010; and Kardo\u0161 v. Croatia, no. 25782/11, \u00a7\u00a067, 26 April 2016). In this connection the Court notes that, having regard to section 428a of the Civil Procedure Act (see paragraph 23 above), the applicant can now lodge an application for the reopening of the proceedings which were brought before the Buje Municipal Court, in respect of which the Court has found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In these circumstances, ruling on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 2,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
