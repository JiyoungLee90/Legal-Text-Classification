As subsequently established by domestic authorities in the indictment and in the judgment convicting S. (see paragraphs 31 and 34 below), there was a disagreement between the applicant and the inspectors as to whether he had a valid ticket. They insisted that the applicant pay a fine for travelling without a ticket, while he insisted that he had broken no rules. The applicant was asked to get off the tram. It was then agreed that the applicant would accompany the inspectors to a tram depot to resolve the dispute. While they were on their way to the depot S. kicked the applicant. In response the applicant sprayed the inspectors with tear gas from a can he had on him. S. then kicked the applicant in the left knee, causing a fracture. A struggle between the applicant and S. ensued. G. and S. then left the scene. The applicant could not stand up or walk following the knee fracture, he was helped to the nearby tram stop by the bystanders who called an ambulance for him. According to the applicant, he has been receiving treatment for his injury until early 2005.",

The minimum standards of effectiveness defined by the Court\u2019s case-law include the requirements that the investigation be independent, impartial and subject to public scrutiny. It is beyond doubt that a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. A prompt response by the authorities in investigating allegations of ill-treatment may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. When an official investigation has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirement of the prohibition of ill-treatment. While there is no absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction or in a particular sentence, the national courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow major attacks on physical and moral integrity to go unpunished (see, for example, Mesut Deniz v. Turkey, no.\u00a036716/07, \u00a7 52, 5 November 2013, with further references).",

The Court observes that the assault on the applicant occurred in public, as a result of the assault he could not stand up or walk and had to resort to bystanders\u2019 help. This was bound to arouse in him the feelings of humiliation and helplessness, diminishing his dignity. The Court is also conscious of the fact that the assault resulted in a knee fracture, an injury which generally takes more than thirty days to heal. Moreover, according to the applicant\u2019s uncontested submissions, his knee fracture required some continued medical treatment for a period of about three years. In view of these considerations, the Court concludes that the violent treatment to which the applicant was subjected on 24 February 2002 constituted inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see and compare Aleksandr Nikonenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a054755/08, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 40, 14 November 2013, and \u0130brahim Demirta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 25018/10, \u00a7\u00a031, 28 October 2014).",

Thus, according to the applicant\u2019s uncontested submissions, he was not informed about the initial decision not to initiate criminal proceedings, taken on 4\u00a0March 2002, until 18 December 2002. The Court further notes that on 31\u00a0August 2004 the investigating authorities informed the applicant that the investigation in his case was continuing. This information appears to have been misleading, since the investigation had in fact been suspended on 14\u00a0October 2003 and was not resumed until 2 February 2005 following the prosecutor\u2019s intervention.",

Indeed, the Government stated that S.\u2019s case file contained no copies of any summonses or notices which would have been sent to the applicant in the course of examination of the case against S. by the trial court. It is true that the record of the hearing held on 20 November 2007, at which S. was convicted, contains a statement, worded in general terms and without any specific facts, that the applicant had been duly notified of the hearing. However, in several cases concerning Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention where it was in dispute whether the applicant had been notified, the Court held, in circumstances similar to the present case, that normally such statements in the hearing records cannot, without more, be viewed as sufficient evidence of notice (see, for example, Pirali Orujov v.

As to the possibility of bringing a civil claim for damages against S. prior to the conclusion of criminal proceedings, the Court observes that it previously found that a civil claim for damages lodged in the course of pending criminal proceedings could constitute an appropriate compensatory remedy in the context of Article 3 of the Convention where a particular offender has been identified and prosecuted (see, for example, Afanasyev v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 38722/02, \u00a7 77, 5 April 2005). However, the Court notes that, because of the unjustified delay in the criminal proceedings, by the time when the applicant may have first become aware that S. had been charged and could, conceivably, bring a claim for damages against him, that is 25 September 2007 (see paragraphs 28 and 44 above), five years and seven months had passed after the assault on the applicant. Therefore, such a claim could not be regarded as capable of providing appropriate and sufficient redress for a violation of Article 3 in the particular circumstances of this case (see, mutatis mutandis, Sizarev v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 17116/04, \u00a7 97, 17 January 2013).",
