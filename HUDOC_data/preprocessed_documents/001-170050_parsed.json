It considered that the main criminal offence, of which the applicant was convicted, intentional homicide, was a particularly serious one. While it acknowledged that he had lived in Switzerland for over twenty years, which had thus become the centre of his life, it found that he was neither professionally nor socially integrated. It considered that he had no stable employment, but considerable debts. Both he and his wife and children had benefitted significantly from social welfare. Moreover, the court considered that the applicant could reasonably (re-)integrate in \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, considering that he spoke Albanian, was born there and had spent a part of his childhood there and had visited the country since. It observed that the same was true for his wife, who likewise originated from \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, where she spent the first twelve years of her life and still had relatives. She knew Albanian and visited the country annually on holiday. At the same time, she was not well integrated in Switzerland as she did not undergo any professional training after leaving school, had received social welfare as from 2005 and only started to work in 2010. As far as their children were concerned, the court considered that they attended primary school and kindergarten, respectively, and were still of an adaptable age. The Federal Supreme Court concluded that the public interest in the applicant\u2019s removal outweighed the applicant\u2019s interest in remaining in Switzerland and enjoying respect for his family life there, also noting that his wife and children had a choice between either following him to \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d or remaining in Switzerland and maintaining contact through short but regular visits.",

Moreover, he was twenty years old at the time he committed that offence on which the expulsion order was mainly based. The circumstances of the offence, a car race, were typical of an offence committed by adolescents. He claimed that he had matured since, also due to a therapy he underwent and relied on expert reports stating that there was a low risk that he would reoffend. The applicant emphasised that he had not offended in the years between the commission of the offence in 2000 and the commencement of his prison sentence in 2006 and that he served his sentence in a semi-custodial regime (offener Vollzug). All of these factors bore testimony to the fact that he did not constitute a threat to public safety. He also argued that the length of time between the commission of the offences in 2000 and the first service of the expulsion order in 2009 had to be taken into account.",

The Court takes into account that the prison sentence of five years and three months bears testimony to the severity of the offence. It is not convinced by the applicant\u2019s submission that the domestic courts were of the opinion that the offence and his guilt were not severe by sentencing him to five years and three months\u2019 imprisonment while the maximum penalty possible for homicide was twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, noting that the range of penalties for homicide also applied to homicide committed with direct intent.",

While he does not have any relatives of his own there, his wife does. Likewise, even though he claims that he could not write well in Albanian and last visited the country in 2004, he still had considerable cultural and social ties to \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d.",

While the entry ban is thus, without any doubt, of a long duration, it should be noted that the applicant could ask for its temporary suspension for short periods of time in order to visit his wife and children in Switzerland (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 26 above). What is more, the applicant\u2019s wife and the couple\u2019s children relocated to \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d in late 2011 and enjoyed their family life with the applicant there until returning to Switzerland in August 2015 to avoid the expiry of their permanent residence permit (see paragraphs 22 and 24 above). In other words, the applicant\u2019s expulsion and the entry ban against him did not preclude him from enjoying family life with his wife and children for seven years, but rather shifted the family\u2019s country of residence to \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d for almost four years. Hence, the applicant and his wife and children were, respectively are, geographically separated for a period of a little over three years in total, during which the applicant could ask for a permission to visit his wife and children in Switzerland for short periods of time.",

Against the background of the gravity of the applicant\u2019s offence, the ties both the applicant and his wife have to \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d as well as the adaptable age of their children, and considering the sovereignty of member States to control and regulate the residence of aliens on their territory, the Court accepts that the domestic authorities balanced the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his family life reasonably against the State\u2019s interests in public safety and in preventing disorder and crime. It cannot find that in the present case the respondent State attributed too much weight to its own interests when it decided to revoke the applicant\u2019s permanent residence permit and order his expulsion to \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d. The Court finds, therefore, that the respondent State has not overstepped the margin of appreciation afforded to it in the present case.",
