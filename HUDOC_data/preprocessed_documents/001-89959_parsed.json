[GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7\u00a092, ECHR 2000XI). Furthermore, in considering whether a particular form of treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3 (see Raninen v.

Even so, this space was significantly smaller than 4 sq. m, which is the minimum requirement for a single inmate in multi-occupancy cells according to the CPT standards (see the relevant CPT reports at paragraphs 32-34 above) and even smaller than the 2.5 sq. m minimum required at the material time under the domestic law. Nothing suggests that in either case the applicant was allowed any out-of-cell activities that could compensate for this serious lack of space (see Cenbauer v. , no.\u00a073786/01, \u00a7\u00a049, ECHR 2006III; Malechkov v. , no.\u00a057830/00, \u00a7\u00a0141, 28\u00a0June 2007; and, by contrast, Nurmagomedov v.

Furthermore, while the second cell contained beds, there were half as many as the number of inmates, which forced the inmates to take turns to sleep. Moreover, no bed linen or blankets were provided. Sleeping conditions were further aggravated by the constant artificial lighting in the cell. The cell was similarly infested with pests and insects and lacked natural light.",

Whilst this information must be conveyed \u201cpromptly\u201d, it need not be related in its entirety by the arresting officer at the very moment of the arrest. Whether the content and promptness of the information conveyed were sufficient is to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0182, p.\u00a019, \u00a7\u00a040, and Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1994, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0300A, p.\u00a031, \u00a7\u00a072).",

Both documents were signed by the applicant.

While accepting this approach, I would have preferred to examine separately the complaints relating to the lack of legal assistance. The applicant alleges he had been denied access to a lawyer prior to and during the trial (paragraph 77). For the same reasons expressed in my partly dissenting opinion in the Galstyan case, to which I refer, I find that there has been a violation of Article 6 paragraph 1 taken together with Article 6 paragraph 3 (c) also in this respect.",
