The mere fact that the official receiver had made a request to that effect was not sufficient, as the practice at the time of the alleged offences required that the decision should be made by the meeting of the debtors. The District Court noted, however, that chapter 39, section 9 (3) of the Criminal Code (rikoslaki, strafflagen), which had entered into force after the commission of the alleged offences, allowed for the official receiver to request a prosecution. The District Court concluded that although the provision was of a procedural nature and as such applicable to offences committed prior to its entry into force, applying the provision in this case would lead to an unfavourable outcome for the applicants. Thus, the District Court decided not to apply the new provision, and accordingly, not to consider the merits of the charges.",

The parties disagree as to whether the existence of the annulment application impeded the handling of the subsequent leave to appeal matter. Be that as it may, the responsibility for diligence and proper administration of justice lies primarily with the authorities and they must themselves take appropriate steps to ensure that proceedings progress without undue delay.

Further, the Government left it to the Court\u2019s discretion, whether they had submitted sufficient documents to support their claims. The Government agreed that the second applicant had incurred some costs and expenses before the  institutions. However, the number of hours claimed to have been spent by the lawyer on the case and the hourly rate also appeared somewhat excessive. The applicants had personally prepared the majority of the case file from the beginning of the proceedings in 1997 until October 2001 when the representative had been engaged by the second applicant. In addition, the representative\u2019s invoice included translation costs in the amount of EUR\u00a01,851 although no details of those costs had been provided. The Government considered that the total amount of compensation for costs and expenses for the second applicant should not exceed EUR 1,500 (without value-added tax).",

Those cover the period following the giving of notice of the application to the respondent State and they can be considered to have been actually and necessarily incurred. The Court reiterates that under Article 41 of the Convention no awards are made in respect of the time or work put into an application by the applicant as this cannot be regarded as monetary costs actually incurred by him or her. However, the Court considers it reasonable that the applicants be awarded compensation for their various expenses such as copying and postage, having in particular regard to the fact that since lodging the initial application in 1997 they have updated the case-file on several occasions in pace with the domestic proceedings. The second applicant may be awarded such compensation for expenses incurred prior to engaging his representative.",
