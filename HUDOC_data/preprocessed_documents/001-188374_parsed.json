In cases of willful ill-treatment, a breach of Article\u00a03 of the Convention cannot be remedied only by an award of compensation to the victim. This is so because, if authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of willful illtreatment by State agents to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough to prosecute and punish those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Jeronovi\u010ds v.

The case file indicates that in 2000 and 2001 her allegations were examined by way of pre-investigation inquiries, without a full investigation being opened (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above). The Court has found that this preliminary investigative procedure does not comply with the principles of an effective remedy, because an inquiring officer can take only a limited number of procedural steps within that procedure, at a point where victims have no formal status and are therefore excluded from participating effectively in the procedure (see Skorokhodov v. Ukraine, no. 56697/09, \u00a7\u00a034, 14 November 2013, with further references). Indeed, nothing suggests that such inquiries were effective in the present case. The applicant was not even informed of the outcome of those inquiries, while the Government replied that no information could be provided on those inquiries, given that the relevant file had been destroyed after the expiry of the statutory period for keeping such records (see paragraph 19 above). The Government did not inform the Court about any further investigative procedures employed by the domestic authorities to scrutinise the applicant\u2019s allegations. In that regard, it is remarkable that the domestic courts, when subsequently dealing with the applicant\u2019s civil claim (see paragraphs 20-25 above), did not mention any results of the criminallaw inquiries or investigations. Overall, the material available to the Court does not allow the Court to conclude that there had been any effective investigation of the alleged facts and that the State has done enough to prosecute and punish those responsible.",

The applicant failed to raise before the Higher Administrative Court the question of the sufficiency of the awarded damages (see paragraph 25 above). Nothing suggests that the applicant had been unduly restricted in her access to that judicial authority. Accordingly, it is not open for the applicant to challenge at international level the sufficiency of the civil award (see, mutatis mutandis, Akopyan v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 12317/06, \u00a7\u00a093, 5\u00a0June 2014). However, even assuming that the amount was sufficient, the question remains as to whether or not the civil redress was provided to the applicant in an effective manner. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, redress for a Convention violation should be provided by a remedy which itself remains effective, adequate and accessible. In particular, excessive delays in an action for compensation will render the remedy ineffective, with the consequence that the applicant retains victim status (see, for example, G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7\u00a0127, ECHR 2010, in the context of Article 3, and Akopyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a097 and 101, in the context of Article 3, Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 and Article 8 of the Convention).",
