The conditions in Bucharest\u00adJilava Prison, in particular the section for dangerous detainees, were qualified as appalling by the CPT, which noted that the prison administration itself had acknowledged that material conditions of detention throughout the prison were extremely poor. The CPT declared itself particularly concerned about the constant lack of beds and the fact that in all the prisons visited the personal space per detainee was no more than 1.5\u00a0square metres and sometimes even as little as 0.6 square metres. While welcoming the changes introduced in domestic legislation providing for personal space of 4\u00a0square metres for each prisoner, the CPT recommended, inter alia, that necessary measures be taken to ensure compliance with this requirement. The CPT found the detainees\u2019 access to medical treatment to be insufficient, including with respect to dental care: lack of adequate staff, long waiting periods for consultation, inadequate consultation procedures.

This obligation has been consistently emphasised by the Committee of Ministers in the supervision of the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments (see, for example, ResDH(97)336, IntResDH(99)434, IntResDH(2001)65 and ResDH(2006)1). In theory it is not for the Court to determine what measures of redress may be appropriate for a respondent State to take in accordance with its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention. However, the Court\u2019s concern is to facilitate the rapid and effective suppression of a shortcoming found in the national system of protection of human rights (see Driza v. Albania, no. 33771/02, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2007XII (extracts)).",

Moreover, even in a situation where individual aspects of the conditions of detention comply with the domestic regulations, their cumulative effect may be such as to constitute inhuman treatment. As the Court has repeatedly stressed, it is incumbent on the Government to organise its prison system in such a way that it ensures respect for the dignity of detainees (see, among other authorities, Ananyev and Others v.
