In particular, the association had stated that it would strive to preserve and popularise the Macedonian cultural and historical heritage; to \u201cpreserve, develop and pass on to future generations the historical truth about the Macedonian question and the work for its resolution\u201d; to restore and build monuments relating to the Macedonian past and heritage; to work to protect the rights of Macedonians; to organise lectures, talks and conferences about the past and present problems faced by the Macedonian people; to organise regional Macedonian gatherings, the commemoration of historical dates and events; to gather memoirs and historical and archive materials relating to the history of the Macedonians; to ensure the recording, preservation and popularisation of the Macedonian folkloric heritage; and so on. These activities and goals, seen against the backdrop of the disputes about Bulgarian historical personalities and events, were directed against the unity of the Bulgarian nation, which was contrary to the prohibition laid down in Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution (see paragraph 15 below).",

The mere fact that the association would seek to promote a minority ethnic consciousness was not a threat to democracy or the unity of the nation. The refusal to register it had also been discriminatory, since an association having the same articles but called \u201cUnion of the Thracian Societies\u201d had earlier been registered without any question being raised about the existence of a Thracian ethnos in Bulgaria. More generally, in approaching these matters the courts had to bear in mind that they were dealing with the fundamental right to freedom of association, and that only the Constitutional Court was competent to ban an organisation for being contrary to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution.",

The lower court had therefore been correct to refuse registration. Moreover, the possibility, envisaged by the association\u2019s articles, for it to invest in, design and erect buildings, amounted to a secondary business activity which went beyond the bounds of what was permitted to associations, and in effect suggested that the association would operate as a business, in breach of the prohibition in section 3(3) of the Not-For-Profit Legal Persons Act 2000 (see paragraph 16 below).",

The second was the characterisation of the association\u2019s goals as political and therefore only capable of being pursued by a political party (see paragraphs 7 and 10 above). In United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others (no. 2) (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36-39) and Yordan Ivanov and Others (cited above, \u00a7 41), both of these grounds were found to be insufficient to justify a refusal to register a similar association. The present case presents no material difference. It does not appear that the purported problem with association\u2019s allegedly too broadly defined intended secondary business activity \u2013 the construction of buildings \u2013, briefly referred to by the Sofia Court of Appeal but not even mentioned by the lower court, was so serious as to amount to a standalone ground to deny registration.
