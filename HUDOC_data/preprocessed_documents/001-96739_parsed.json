Instituting civil proceedings was thus an inherent element of the applicant company\u2019s commercial activity and its financial success depended on their outcome. These debts were contested by the Fund and the applicant company was apparently unsuccessful in effectively enforcing this type of debt before the Polish courts. The present case thus differs from the cases previously examined by\u00a0the Court where a company sustained losses resulting from a breach of\u00a0contract and had been obliged to seize a civil court to enforce payment from another business entity (compare and contrast Podbielski and PPU Polpure v. Poland, no. 39199/98, \u00a7 11, 26 July 2005, and Teltronic-CATV v.\u00a0Poland, no. 48140/99, \u00a7 7, 10 January 2006).",

Sweden, judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports of\u00a0Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, \u00a7 38). Assuming that the dispute in\u00a0the present case was \u201cgenuine and serious\u201d within the meaning of the Court\u2019s case-law (see Kupiec v. Poland, no 16828/02, \u00a7 47, 3\u00a0February\u00a02009), the Court finds that when entering into risky litigation over contested debts amounting to almost PLN 90,000,000 the applicant company must have been aware of the obligation to pay court fees. According to the general rule, the amount of court fees for bringing a civil action and further appeals is set at 5% of the value of the claim. The applicant company obtained a substantial reduction of court fees as the amount it was finally ordered to pay amounted to 0.055% of the value of the claim. Nevertheless, it appears that the applicant company rather unrealistically expected a full exemption from court fees.",

In November 2002, at the appellate level, the applicant company was also partly exempted from court fees above PLN\u00a050,000 (see paragraph 11 above). In this connection the Court firstly notes that there is no evidence that the applicant company substantiated its assertion that its financial situation had changed between March and November 2002 so that it was no longer possible for it to pay the same amount of court fees. Secondly, it should be noted that according to\u00a0the documents submitted by the applicant company to the court, it was generating gross income and had a monthly turnover of PLN 30,000. The domestic courts, in two reasoned decisions, considered that the applicant company was free to manage its gross income and although it had declared losses which had exceeded its gross income, the court fees should have been considered as part of the activity costs of the applicant company. Consequently, the courts found that it had not been established that the applicant company would be unable to pay the reduced fees. The Court sees no reason to contest the domestic authorities\u2019 assessment of the applicant company\u2019s financial standing and considers that the alleged confusion of net profit with gross income by the court on 26 November 2002 appears to\u00a0be\u00a0a\u00a0clerical mistake and was not repeated by the appellate court.",
