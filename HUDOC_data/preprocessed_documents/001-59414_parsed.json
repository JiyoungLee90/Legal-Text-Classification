Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cideas\u201d that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. As set forth in Article 10 \u00a7 2, this freedom is subject to the exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly. In assessing whether such a \u201cneed\u201d exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, \u00a7 43, ECHR 1999-VIII). ",

Indeed, the payment of some 220,000 Slovakian korunas in damages and legal costs ordered by the courts was a very high amount by the country\u2019s standards \u2013 the equivalent of twenty-five average monthly salaries at the relevant time, as the applicant correctly states \u2013 which exceeded, to my mind, the degree of severity of sanction that the courts ought to attribute in a civil case to the transgression committed by the applicant. As the Court rightly notes in paragraph 58 of the judgment, the reasons relied on by the domestic courts to justify the amount of compensation do not appear sufficiently convincing since, inter alia, disciplinary proceedings against H. were brought prior to the publication of the applicant\u2019s open letter and, hence, any damage she may have suffered cannot be imputed to the applicant.

The fact is that in dubious factual circumstances where \u2013 as the domestic courts found \u2013 the right of the applicant to occupy the flat was not absolutely established, the latter wrote a defamatory open letter addressed to the Prime Minister which was posted up at several tram and bus stops in . In that letter, he severely criticised the claimants, presenting his own subjective point of view, and exposed them to public criticism. In my view, the paragraph which states that \u201c[A.] and his wife lied to me when they said they had no place to live and alleged that because of this they would not vacate the flat. I point out that [H.] is a public prosecutor (!). If our newly born democracy has legal representatives like this, it will not outlive its childhood and we can bury it right away. The judiciary should first and foremost ensure that the law is respected and justice upheld in the State.
