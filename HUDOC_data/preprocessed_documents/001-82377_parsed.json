However these findings are insufficient to substantiate the severe ill-treatment described by the applicant as occurring during his detention in police custody. There is also no material in the case file which would call into question the findings in the medical report dated 12 August 1996 or add probative weight to the applicant's allegations. In particular, there is no indication in the case file that the applicant requested, or had been refused permission, to see another doctor at the end of his police custody.",

The Court has held on many occasions that, where a person is injured while in detention or otherwise under the control of the police, any such injury will give rise to a strong presumption that the person was subjected to ill-treatment (Matko v. Slovenia, no. 43393/98, \u00a7 99, 2\u00a0November 2006; Bakbak v. Turkey, no. 39812/98, \u00a7\u00a047, 1 July 2004).

At this point, the Court would like to emphasize that in similar situations, it is crucial to determine whether the injuries had been sustained in the course of the arrest and whether the arresting officers had used excessive force. However, in the present case, it notes with concern that the applicant was not medically examined upon his arrest. Such an examination would have been the appropriate step for the authorities to have taken as, in their observations and in the domestic proceedings, they admitted that the police officers had resorted to force during the arrest. A report could have then clarified the cause and extent of any injuries existing at that time. Furthermore, it is also understood from the incident report that the police officers had received an intelligence report that the applicant would be at that address.
