The case originated in an application (no. 17534/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Süleyman Ceyran (“the applicant”), on 15 April 2003. The applicant was represented by Mr F. Babaoğlu, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 19 June 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings relating to a bill of indictment dated 26 September 2001. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Switzerland.
On 26 September 2001 the public prosecutor at the Erzurum State Security Court filed a bill of indictment with the Erzurum State Security Court against the applicant on the charge of membership of an illegal organisation, the Dev-Yol (Revolutionary Way), for certain offences allegedly committed in 1981 or before.
On 15 August 2003 the Erzurum State Security Court issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction (görevsizlik kararı), pursuant to provisional Article 1 of Law no. 2845, which limited the jurisdiction of State Security Courts to offences committed after 1 May 1984. The case was thus referred to the Sivas Assize Court.
On 11 November 2004 the Second Chamber of the Sivas Assize Court acquitted the applicant of the charges against him. The applicant did not attend any of the hearings before the Sivas Assize Court as he lived in Switzerland at the material time.
On 19 November 2004 the judgment of 11 November 2004 became final since it was not appealed by the parties.
