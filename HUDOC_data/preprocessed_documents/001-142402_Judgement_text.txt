The case originated in an application (no. 41030/10) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a German national, Mr József Neckov (“the applicant”), on 16 July 2010.
The applicant was represented by Ms Zs. Varak, a lawyer practising in Miskolc. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 17 October 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The German Government did not wish to exercise their right to make written comments in the case (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention).
The applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Miskolc.
In 2003 litigation started, before the Miskolc District Court, between the applicant and his ex-spouse with a view to terminating common ownership of their marital property.
The case was heard at second instance by the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court.
The final decision was given by the Supreme Court on 8 November 2011.
