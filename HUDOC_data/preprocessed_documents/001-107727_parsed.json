According to them, the fact that the reasoned judgment had been filed in the case-file after the operative version and before the applicant\u2019s preliminary appeal served as evidence of the judge\u2019s timely actions. They did not submit an extract from the case-file in support of their argument. They further argued that on several occasions the applicant had changed the respondents and amended his claims which had made it necessary for the trial court to start hearing the case from the beginning. It had been the applicant\u2019s responsibility to indicate the respondents\u2019 addresses at which they could be notified of the hearings but he had failed to do so. The trial court had also spent some time helping the applicant establish the respondents\u2019 whereabouts and had severed the claims against unidentified respondents into a separate case to expedite the proceedings.",

Finally, some delay stemmed from the applicant\u2019s decisions to replace the respondents and to alter his claims. With this in mind, the Court considers that both the authorities and the applicant equally contributed to the delay during the examination of the case.",

It also takes cognisance of the fact that the first-instance court\u2019s decision returning the applicant\u2019s grounds of appeal as time-barred was overturned by the appeal instance. At the same time, the Government did not buttress their stance with any evidence.
