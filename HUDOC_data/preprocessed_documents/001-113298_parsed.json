It is further observed that the enforcement proceedings had officially ended in 2001, which was before the Convention entered into force in respect of the respondent State on 3 March 2004. The said proceedings were terminated on the grounds that the debtor had issued a decision on flat allocation on 1 March 2001. However, the Court notes that this decision was not yet final at the time when the Convention entered into force in respect of Montenegro, as the debtor clearly had not decided on the applicant\u2019s objection in that regard. Such a situation continued well after the ratification, as observed by the domestic courts themselves, which pronounced on this issue between 15 April 2005 and 13 November 2006, clearly stating that the debtor had not rendered a final decision on flat allocation by then (see paragraphs 18-20 above).",

A different conclusion would lead to a situation in which a State could avoid its responsibility for enforcements simply by officially terminating the enforcement proceedings without having enforced an impugned decision beforehand, thus allowing a final, enforceable judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party (see, mutatis mutandis, Hornsby v. , 19 March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II).
