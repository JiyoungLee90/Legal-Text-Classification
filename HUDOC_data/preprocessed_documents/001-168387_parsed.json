While she evidently did have the right to do so, it cannot be denied that this caused substantial delay, as the authorities had to await the end of these proceedings, one after another, before being able to proceed with the construction plans (see paragraph 18 above). As a result, even though it appears that the municipality was prepared to start the construction as early as 2003-2004 when the construction plans were approved and the future flats were allocated to their owners (see paragraph 10 above), actual construction could only commence in 2011 (see paragraph 14 above).",

As to the Government\u2019s argument (see paragraph 18 above) that any hardship suffered by her was moderated by the fact that she lived in Sofia and not in Troyan and had been allowed to use her expropriated house until 2009, the Court will take these circumstances into account below when examining the applicant\u2019s claims under Article 41; they are however insufficient for it to conclude that the authorities\u2019 inactivity before 2004 did not upset the fair balance between the general interest and the applicant\u2019s rights required under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraph 23 above).",

However, it is unable to accept the method suggested by her, based on lost rent. Even if it is realistic to assume that the applicant would have attempted to rent out the flat due to her, as she lived in Sofia and not in Troyan, she would have inevitably experienced delays in finding suitable tenants, which, as also seen on the basis of the data provided by the Government, could have been substantial. In addition, even if she did possibly find tenants, the applicant would have inevitably incurred expenses to maintain the property, and would have been subject to taxation on any rent (see Kirilova and Others (just satisfaction), nos.\u00a042908/98, 44038/98, 44816/98 and 7319/02, \u00a7 31, 14 June 2007, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02830, and Dichev, cited above, \u00a7 43). Taking into account these considerations, and the fact discussed above (see paragraph 25) that the applicant was responsible for much of the delay in the compensation proceedings after 2004, the Court considers it equitable to awards her EUR\u00a02,000 under the present head, plus any tax that may be chargeable.",
