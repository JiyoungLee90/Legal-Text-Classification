Likewise, the applicant had not informed the Court that since 2008 she had been occupying a flat in Sh.

Lastly, the applicant had misled the Court as to her living arrangements after her eviction and before moving into the flat in Sh. Street. In fact, during the entire period at issue the applicant had been living with her mother and children in her mother\u2019s flat, rather than living under irregular lodging arrangements. In support of this argument, the Government provided a certificate from the local housing authority in Stryy indicating that following her return from prison, the applicant had \u201cpermanently resided without residence registration\u201d in her mother\u2019s flat \u201cuntil she had arbitrarily occupied the flat in [Sh.

Street, after having regularised and duly registered her rights to that flat in 2012 and before the case had been communicated. Lastly, she had not misled the Court by stating that she had been living in ad hoc rental arrangements for a long time, although she had not been able to provide any relevant documents. She had been staying in her mother\u2019s flat from time to time, but that was only in between her temporary rental arrangements. Her mother\u2019s flat, which was comprised of two rooms and measured 32\u00a0square metres, had been too small to accommodate her mother, her two children and herself on a permanent basis.

Ukraine, no.\u00a09089/04, \u00a7 45, 16 February 2012). Whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty on the State or in terms of interference by a public authority to be justified in accordance with paragraph 2, the applicable principles are broadly similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole (see Novoseletskiy v. Ukraine, no.\u00a047148/99, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2005II (extracts)). This balance may be upset, in particular, on account of important delays in the enforcement of domestic decisions pertinent to the protection of the relevant rights and serious protractions by the authorities in finding effective solutions for the individual situations (see ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 78 and 89; Pibernik v. Croatia, no.\u00a075139/01, \u00a7\u00a7 69-70, 4 March 2004; mutatis mutandis Dubetska and\u00a0Others v.

The onus is on the State to justify a situation in which certain individuals bear a heavy individual burden on behalf of the rest of the society (see, mutatis mutandis, Dubetska and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 145 and 155).",

The Court cannot therefore assess as such the compatibility of the above measures with the applicant\u2019s rights guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention.

Thus, according to the domestic legal order, the applicant had the right to occupy the flat formally acknowledged by the judicial authorities, however, without a possibility for that right to be realised in practice. Seeking to resolve this situation, the applicant initiated a new set of court proceedings, which resulted in the adoption on 6\u00a0July\u00a02005 of another court judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour. That judgment obliged the municipality to provide her with a replacement housing unit (see paragraph\u00a021 above). However, the applicant\u2019s personal situation \u2013 namely, the impossibility for her to establish a permanent new home and the need to either share a small two-room flat with her mother, children and possibly other relatives or make do with various ad hoc living arrangements \u2013 did not change, because the municipality did not provide any such unit. Accordingly, the failure of the State authorities to re-house the applicant had an important impact on her rights guaranteed under Article\u00a08 of the Convention.",
