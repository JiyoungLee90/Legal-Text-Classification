The applicant further complained under Article 5 of the Convention and Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 that it was unlawful for him to be forcibly taken to the court hearings, that he had not been duly notified about the dates of those hearings and that, when he had been forcibly taken to the court on 25 January 2005, this had not been ordered by the court. Relying on Article 2 of Protocol No. 7, he also submitted that he had not been provided with a copy of the decision of 27 June 2002 and, therefore, his right to appeal against that decision had been impaired. The applicant also invoked this provision with regard to the refusal of the Supreme Court of 18 July 2005 to review his case in cassation.",
