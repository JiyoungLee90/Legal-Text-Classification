The object of the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies is to allow the national authorities (primarily the judicial authorities) to address an allegation that a Convention right has been violated and, where appropriate, to afford redress before that allegation is submitted to the Court. In so far as there exists at national level a remedy enabling the national courts to address, at least in substance, any argument as to an alleged violation of a Convention right, it is that remedy which should be used (see Azinas v. Cyprus [GC], no. 56679/00, \u00a7\u00a038, ECHR 2004III).",

Neither of the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaints was declared inadmissible on formal grounds, for example that she had not complied with the procedural rules under domestic law. Instead, the Constitutional Court held that her complaint was ill-founded on the ground that she had not put forward any arguments relevant for the protection of her constitutional rights. By doing so, the Constitutional Court implicitly accepted that the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint satisfied formal criteria (see, by way of comparison, Bjedov v. Croatia, no. 42150/09, \u00a7 48, 29 May 2012). The Court sees no reason to hold otherwise. The Court also notes that in her submissions before the Constitutional Court, the applicant complained in substance about her eviction from the flat in which she had been residing since 1983. She thus gave the Constitutional Court adequate opportunity to remedy the situation she is now complaining of before the Court. In those circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the applicant exhausted domestic remedies in respect of her complaint under Article 8 of the Convention concerning her right to respect for her home (see, by way of comparison, Pauli\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 3572/06, \u00a7\u00a7 25 and 26, 22 October 2009; Orli\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 48833/07, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 41, 21 June 2011; and Bre\u017eec v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 7177/10, \u00a7 27, 18 July 2013).

It is to be noted that when the applicant was allocated the flat at issue, it was publicly owned. While the respondent State certainly enjoys a wide margin of appreciation in drawing up its social and housing policies, the Court notes that the eviction order was not submitted until 2007, in the context of proceedings in which she sought to establish her right to purchase the flat as a holder of a protected tenancy. Thus, in addition to noting the applicant\u2019s longstanding occupancy of the flat and the fact that she paid the rent for it, the Court also observes that the owner did not initially take a firm standpoint as regards the applicant\u2019s entitlement to occupy the flat (see Orli\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 70, and Bre\u017eec, cited above, \u00a7 48).",
