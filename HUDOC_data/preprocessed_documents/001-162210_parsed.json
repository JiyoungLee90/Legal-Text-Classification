They also noted that, although it was not expressly stated in the relevant domestic law, a historical and comparative interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure led to the conclusion that the underlying reason for ordering pre-trial detention on the grounds of gravity of the charges was to protect public safety and legal order in cases of the most serious crimes; or, more precisely, to protect the public from great disturbance and to ensure public confidence in the functioning of the judiciary (Z. \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107 and D.

They considered that the particular circumstances of each case should be assessed in light of Rule 65(B) as it now stood. The burden still remained on the accused to satisfy the Trial Chamber that the requirements of Rule 65(B) had been met. This was justified by some given the specific functioning of the Tribunal and absence of power to execute arrest warrants. The second approach seems to have been the following. It has been concluded that based on international human rights standards, \u201cde jure pre-trial detention should be the exception and not the rule as regards prosecution before an international court.\u201d The Trial Chamber in question referred to the fact that, at the Tribunal, in view of its lack of enforcement powers, \u201cpre-trial detention de facto seems to be...the rule.\u201d In addition, it stated that one must take account of the reference to serious crimes. Nevertheless, it found that, \u201cany system of mandatory detention on remand is per se incompatible with Article 5(3) of the Convention (see Ilijkov v.

The Chamber notes that in certain circumstances, six years of pre-trial detention may be a factor in the consideration of exceptional circumstances warranting the release of an accused. However, the length of current or potential future detention of the Accused cannot be considered material in these circumstances because it does not mitigate in any way that the Accused, who is charged with the grave offences coming under the subject matter jurisdiction of this Tribunal, which offences carry maximum term of imprisonment of his life, may be a flight risk or may pose a threat to witnesses or to the community if he were to be released. Detention under Rule 65 is intended to ensure the safety of the community and the integrity to the trial process. The Chamber observes that the Accused even while in custody found the opportunity to intentionally absent himself from the trial proceedings of 2 April 2002.\u201d",

It observed, in particular, that Article 102 \u00a7 1 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure did not provide for mandatory remand in custody and that the domestic courts had examined in detail the particular gravity of the specific circumstances of the case. Thus, given that the detention on the grounds of the gravity of charges had not lasted excessively long in the circumstances, and in view of the seriousness of the crime at issue and the nature and gravity of the charges against the applicants, the Court considered that the domestic authorities\u2019 reliance solely on the gravity of charges was a relevant ground for the applicants\u2019 detention (see Geto\u0161-Magdi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 80-91, and \u0160uput, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 101-10).",

That provision therefore did not provide for mandatory detention, nor was it applied to that effect in the applicant\u2019s case (compare Geto\u0161-Magdi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 82-84, and \u0160uput, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103-05).",

In particular, the national courts repeatedly explained in detail the charges against the applicant. They cited considerations, such as the fact that the charges concerned his actions and omissions in his capacity as an official in the Ministry of the Interior and a commander of a reserve police unit. They also cited the fact that the unit under his command had allegedly taken money and valuables from their victims (cars, jewellery, household appliances), and had subsequently exposed them to torture, sometimes by subjecting them to electric shocks through an induction telephone, cutting open muscles and wiring open wounds, severe beatings, physical ill-treatment, degrading treatment and locking in rooms without beds or toilets. They had also allegedly carried out summary executions, including the killing of a twelve year-old girl and her family, as well as killings and ill-treatment of more than twenty other civilians (see paragraphs 25, 32 and 34 above).",

The prevention of a threat to public order is commonly seen as a legitimate ground for detention (see paragraph 58 above), and is as such accepted in the Court\u2019s case-law (see, for example, Pe\u0161a, cited above, \u00a7 101, and J.M., cited above, \u00a7 62, where the preservation of the public\u2019s sense of justice was in issue), and international criminal law practice (see, for instance, paragraph 61 above).
