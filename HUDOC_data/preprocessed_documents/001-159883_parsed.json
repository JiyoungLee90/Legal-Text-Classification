The Deputy Minister further found that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that he ran a real risk of persecution by the Taliban, who were in charge of most of Afghanistan at the time the impugned decision was taken.

The applicant\u2019s asylum claim had been considered in the light of an official report (ambtsbericht), drawn up on 29 February 2000 by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs on \u201cSecurity Services in Communist Afghanistan (1978-1992), AGSA, KAM, KhAD and WAD\u201d (\u201cVeiligheidsdiensten in communistisch Afghanistan (1978-1992), AGSA, KAM, KhAD en WAD\u201d) and concerning in particular the question whether, and if so which, former employees of those services should be regarded as implicated in human rights violations. On the basis of this report, the Netherlands immigration authorities had adopted the position that Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention could be held against virtually every Afghan asylum seeker who, holding the rank of third lieutenant or higher, had worked during the communist regime for the KhAD or its successor the WAD.",

She rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that the applicability of Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention ought to have been examined at an earlier stage, holding that at the relevant time (1997/98) considerably less information had been available to the Netherlands asylum authorities about the full extent of the human rights violations committed by the KhAD, notwithstanding that to a certain extent there had been a general awareness of the nature of the former communist regime in Afghanistan.",

Noting, inter alia, the applicant\u2019s steady career path in the KhAD, the Minister excluded the possibility of the applicant not having known or not having been involved in human rights violations committed by the KhAD. Relying on the official report of 29 February 2000, the Minister underlined the widely known cruel character of KhAD, its lawless methods, the grave crimes it had committed such as torture and other human rights violations as well as the climate of terror which it had spread throughout the whole of Afghan society. The Minister lastly emphasised that the applicant had done nothing to distance himself from KhAD during the ten years he had made a career there, referring to the applicant\u2019s own statement to the effect that he had consciously chosen to stay with KhAD in order to avoid being sent to the war front.

The Minister noted that, according to an official report on Afghanistan issued by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs in July 2005, the position of ex-communists and persons associated with the former communist regime was not yet entirely clear. Members of the KhAD/WAD possibly ran a risk of becoming a victim of human rights violations from the side of the authorities (except for the government) but more so from the side of the population (victims\u2019 relatives) as they were identified with human rights violations during the communist regime. However, there were no indications that persons in Afghanistan should fear persecution merely because of their ties with the former communist regime. The Minister, therefore, held that the applicant had to demonstrate personal facts or circumstances warranting the conclusion that his return to Afghanistan would be in breach of Article 3 of the Convention, and found that the applicant had not done so. In reaching this finding, the Minister noted that the applicant\u2019s fear of being subjected to treatment proscribed by Article 3 had remained unsubstantiated in any concrete manner and was only based on assumptions. The applicant had not specified which particular faction of the mujahideen had been looking for him shortly after he left Afghanistan, nor whether that faction was currently holding any position of power in Afghanistan. The Minister further took into account the applicant\u2019s statement made at the hearing of 19 May 2005 that in the meantime his parents and brother had returned to Kabul. Although the applicant\u2019s father had allegedly been approached in early 2005 by individuals asking for the applicant, the Minister held that it had not been demonstrated that the applicant\u2019s parents and brother had experienced serious difficulties from the authorities or any groups. The Minister further considered that the mere fact that Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention was being held against the applicant did not in itself warrant the conclusion that, if expelled to Afghanistan, he would have to fear treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. The Minister also rejected as still unsubstantiated the applicant\u2019s claims that he risked treatment contrary to Article 3 because he would be considered an infidel as his family was not professing Islam, as he drank alcohol and had studied, and also because of his ethnicity.",

The applicant had left Afghanistan as a precaution within a week of the mujahideen\u2019s seizing power in 1992, and he had never returned since.

Furthermore, since December 2010 and to date, the UNHCR Guidelines no longer included ex-communists and former KhAD/WAD staff among the potential risk profiles and there were no indications that ex-communists faced a risk of persecution by the current Afghan government. Accordingly, as many of this group were taking part normally in Afghan society, it could not be said that this category of persons was systematically exposed to a risk of inhumane treatment or that the mere fact of belonging to this category implied that such persons ran a real risk of treatment prohibited by Article 3.",

He had not demonstrated that the current authorities, the mujahideen or members of the general population held him responsible for the human rights violations committed by the KhAD/WAD. The Government pointed out that, in the course of his interviews with the Netherlands authorities, the applicant had stated that his parents had returned to Afghanistan in January 2005, that he was in telephone contact with his parents every month, and that since their return to Afghanistan they had been approached only on one occasion by an unknown person asking about \u201cthe son who worked for the KhAD/WAD\u201d in a normal and cordial conversation.
