(dec.), no. 34746/97, 10 July 2001). The word \u201cvictim\u201d in the context of Article 34 denotes the person directly affected by the act or omission which is in issue, the existence of a violation being conceivable even in the absence of prejudice (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 36, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III and Eckle v. Germany, 15 July 1982, \u00a7 66, Series A no.\u00a051). The Court further considers that the issue of whether an applicant may claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention does not turn on the substance or content of the right in issue, but solely on the question whether it is linked to the person who relies on it (Gayduk and Others v.
