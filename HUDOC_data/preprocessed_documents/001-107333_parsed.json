Three adjournments were caused by the applicant\u2019s conduct: the first, when she wished to make additional submissions; the second because of her new complaint; and the third due to her negotiations with the defendant aimed at settling the case. As concerns the conduct of the authorities, the Court observes that a certain period of inactivity appears to have occurred in the Court of Appeal. Lastly, it took two and a half years for the Supreme Court to decide the case. This period appears to have been almost entirely caused by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to suspend the proceedings pending the outcome of other leading cases.",

The remaining part of the case related to an administrative decision which concerned the building where the applicant lived. It is difficult for the Court to assess the practical significance of the outcome of this dispute for the applicant. The Court notes, however, that the ownership of the apartment had already passed to the applicant\u2019s family in 2002 and it does not therefore appear that the dispute immediately affected her right of residence in the apartment but rather might have had a bearing on the financial matters related to it.",
