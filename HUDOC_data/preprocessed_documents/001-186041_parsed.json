B.M. had been working that day with officers B.R., J.P. and F.Z. They had noticed the applicant with V.P. in a vehicle which had been parked in the car park of a supermarket in Biograd na Moru. The applicant had left the vehicle and entered the supermarket while V.P. had stayed inside it. B.M. and B.R. had approached the vehicle, identified themselves to V.P. who had then left the vehicle and thrown away a plastic bag which had contained about fifty grams of heroin. V.P. had not put up any resistance and had been handed over to officers J.P. and F.Z. who had placed him in the police vehicle. B.M. and B.R. had approached the applicant inside the supermarket and identified themselves. Since there had been some customers in the supermarket the officers had not resorted to handcuffing the applicant but had instead taken the applicant by the arm and escorted him towards the exit. The applicant had verbally expressed his discontent but when inside the supermarket had not physically resisted the officers. B.M. had held the applicant by one of his wrists. When they had left the supermarket the applicant had made a sudden movement to free himself and had attempted to flee. Officer B.M. had caught up with him and applied a leg sweep technique. Officer B.R. had also then caught up with the applicant who had then fallen to the ground, together with officers B.M. and B.R. While on the ground the applicant had fiercely and aggressively resisted the officers, attempting to get up and flee. That had lasted for about three to four minutes. It had been difficult for the officers to hold the applicant down, as he had weighed about 90 kilograms. B.M. admitted that in responding to the applicant\u2019s fierce resistance he might have hit him once or twice in order to prevent him from fleeing. His intention however had not been to hurt him. After the applicant had been overcome, he had been restrained and there had been no further hitting or ill-treatment. B.M. also stated that the officers\u2019 conduct in respect of the applicant had been completely professional and that the use of force against the applicant had been \u201cunavoidable\u201d. The officers had been cautious since they had known the applicant as a drug dealer and had had to ensure that he did not flee and destroy the evidence.

They immediately reported to their superiors that the applicant had sustained injuries as a result of force used against him. However, the incident is described differently by the applicant and by the Government. The Court notes that the medical documentation shows that the applicant suffered a haematoma under both eyes and a perforated eardrum, the latter of which was a serious bodily injury. In his criminal complaint lodged with the State Attorney\u2019s Office he alleged that he had been hit and kicked by the police, which had caused him to fall down, and that the officers had continued to hit and kick him while he had been lying on the ground. In view of the requirement that any use of physical force by State officials must be confined to what is strictly necessary, the Court considers that the above facts called for an investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of illtreatment in order to establish all relevant circumstances of the use of physical force against him.",

However, the national courts dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for an investigation without giving any reasons as to why the evidence suggested by the applicant was not relevant. In particular, the prosecuting authorities again made no serious effort to assess the most important aspect of the case \u2013 whether the force used by the police officers had been indispensable and/or excessive in the given situation. Thus, no forensic reports were ordered which could have established how the injuries had been caused and brought clarification to the applicant\u2019s allegations that he had been hit and kicked by the police officers while both standing and lying on the ground.",
