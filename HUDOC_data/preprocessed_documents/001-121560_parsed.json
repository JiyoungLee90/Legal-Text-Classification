When quashing a conviction by way of supervisory review and remitting the case for a retrial, the supervisoryreview court was under an obligation to examine the issue of detention. In so doing, it was to be guided by the requirements set out in Articles 10, 108, 109 and 255 of the CCrP and to proceed on the assumption that the preventive measure chosen during the previous round of proceedings had ceased to apply after the judgment convicting the defendant had become final. The quashing of the conviction did not automatically restore the preventive measure and if the court considered that the accused was to remain in custody it was to ascertain, with the proper participation of the interested parties, whether there were grounds, including factual circumstances, calling for his or her detention in the new round of proceedings. Such detention order could be issued after the parties had been provided with an opportunity to state their position before the court, so as to enable it to carry out its own assessment of the circumstances of the case, rather than base its decision solely on arguments raised by the prosecution or mentioned in a previous detention order. Moreover, the supervisoryreview court was to take into account the stage of the criminal proceedings, which could entail the emergence of new circumstances calling for the preventive measure to be varied. At the same time, irrespective of the procedural stage, a decision to place a person in custody or to extend his or her detention needed to reflect the factual circumstances examined by the court. Such court\u2019s assessment could be made in a separate decision or be part of a decision to set aside the conviction and remit the case for fresh examination.",
