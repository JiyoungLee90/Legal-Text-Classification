Given the support provided to the separatists by the troops of the 14th Army and the massive transfer to them of arms and ammunition from the 14th Army\u2019s stores, the Moldovan army was in a position of inferiority that prevented it from regaining control of Transdniestria.

Once the Court is faced with such a situation, it would be failing in the discharge of its judicial functions if it did not declare that there is an obligation, especially upon Members of the United Nations, to bring that situation to an end. As this Court has held, referring to one of its decisions declaring a situation as contrary to a rule of international law: \u2018This decision entails a legal consequence, namely that of putting an end to an illegal situation\" (I.C.J.

In the alternative, the approach followed by the Court in Bankovi\u0107 and Others v.  and 16 Other Contracting States (dec.) [GC], no.\u00a052207/99, ECHR 2001XII was a more accurate interpretation, since it recognised that jurisdiction could be extended extra-territorially only in exceptional cases. For the Russian Government, jurisdiction could exceptionally be extended extra-territorially where a Contracting state exercised effective control over another territory, equivalent to the degree of control exercised over its own territory in peacetime.

In contrast, in Al-Skeini, for example, the Court found that the applicants\u2019 relatives fell within  jurisdiction because they had been killed by British soldiers. Even in Ila\u015fcu the Court based itself on two sets of arguments in order to find Russian jurisdiction: first, that the \u201cMRT\u201d was subject to Russia\u2019s dominant influence, but also that the applicants had been arrested and transferred to \u201cMRT\u201d custody by Russian soldiers. In Ila\u015fcu the Court\u2019s decision was based on the fact that  had directly been involved in the arrest and, following the ratification of the Convention, did not make sufficient efforts to secure their release. In the present case, the Russian Government emphasised that there was no causal link between the presence of the Russian forces in Transdniestria and the treatment of the applicants\u2019 schools. On the contrary, the Russian Government had tried to resolve the schools crisis by acting as a mediator. Moreover, the Russian Government contended that there was no evidence that  exercised effective military or political control in Transdniestria. If the Court were to find Russian jurisdiction in this case, this would effectively mean that  would be responsible under the Convention for any violations taking place in Transdniestria, notwithstanding the insignificant size of the Russian military presence there. The Court should, therefore, find that the facts complained of fell outside Russia\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 1 of the Convention.",

In 2003, when the Moldovan Government refused to sign the Memorandum on the Establishment of the  (\u201cthe Kozak Memorandum\u201d), the \u201cMRT\u201d blocked the removal of any further items. According to the Russian Government, the cooperation of the Moldovan authorities was also needed, since they had blocked the use of the railway line from Transdniestria into Moldovan-controlled territory. At present, only shells, hand grenades, mortar bombs and small-arms ammunition were stored in the warehouses. Over 60% of this equipment was to be destroyed at the end of its warranty period, but the Russian Government did not specify when this would be. Moreover, its destruction would only be possible once agreement had been reached on environmental safety. The Russian Government emphasised that they had a responsibility to safeguard the arms store and protect against theft but nonetheless felt themselves under pressure to remove the 1,000 servicemen stationed in Transdniestria to guard it. In addition to this small contingent, there were approximately 1,125 Russian soldiers stationed in the Security Area as part of the internationally agreed peace-keeping force. The Security Area was 225 km long and 12-20 km wide. In the Russian Government\u2019s view, it was evident that the presence of a few hundred Russian soldiers guarding the military warehouses and executing their peacekeeping functions could not be the instrument of effective overall control in Transdniestria.",

The debt owed by Moldovagaz to  exceeded USD 1.8 billion, of which USD 1.5 billion related to gas consumed in Transdniestria. Gazprom could not simply refuse to supply gas to the region, since it needed pipelines through  to supply the Balkan States. Complex negotiations were on-going between Gazprom and Moldovagaz concerning the repayment of the debt. In 2003-2004 a solution was proposed whereby the \u201cMRT\u201d would permit Russia to remove military equipment to the value of USD 1 million in return for Russia writing off an equivalent sum from the gas debt, but this scheme was never implemented because at that point relations between Moldova and the \u201cMRT\u201d deteriorated and neither was prepared to consent. The Russian Government denied that there were separate contracts for gas supply to  and Transdniestria and contended that it was impossible for Gazprom to fix different rates for consumers in each part of the country.

The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control, whether it be exercised directly, through the Contracting State\u2019s own armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration (Loizidou v.

It is true that in that case the Court considered it relevant to the question whether Russian jurisdiction was engaged that Mr Ila\u015fcu, Mr Le\u015fco, Mr Ivan\u0163oc and Mr\u00a0Petrov-Popa had been arrested, detained and ill-treated by soldiers of the 14th Army in 1992, who then transferred them to \u201cMRT\u201d custody. The Court considered that these acts, although they took place before Russia ratified the Convention on 5\u00a0May 1998, formed part of a continuous and uninterrupted chain of responsibility on the part of the  for the detainees\u2019 fate. The Court also found, as part of that chain of responsibility, that during the uprising in Transdniestria in 1991-1992, the authorities of the Russian Federation contributed both militarily and politically to the establishment of the separatist regime (see Ila\u015fcu, cited above, \u00a7 382). Furthermore, during the period between May 1998, when Russia ratified the Convention, and May 2004, when the Court adopted the judgment, the Court found that the \u201cMRT\u201d survived by virtue of the military, economic, financial and political support given to it by the Russian Federation and that it remained under the effective authority, or at the very least under the decisive influence, of Russia (Ila\u015fcu, cited above, \u00a7 392). The Court therefore concluded that the applicants came within the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the Russian Federation for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention (Ila\u015fcu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 393-394).",

In the Ila\u015fcu judgment the Court found that there were approximately 1,500 ROG personnel guarding the arms store in 2002 (cited above, \u00a7 131). The numbers of Russian troops are not disputed by the other parties to the case (see paragraph 37 above). As for the at Colba\u015fna arms store, it is impossible accurately to establish its size and contents for the period 2002-2004, since the Russian Government did not provide the Court with the detailed information it had requested and since no independent observer was allowed access. However, in the Ila\u015fcu judgment (cited above, \u00a7 131) the Court referred to evidence to the effect that in 2003 the ROG had at least 200,000 tonnes of military equipment and ammunition there, and also 106 battle tanks, 42 armoured cars, 109 armoured personnel carriers, 54 armoured reconnaissance vehicles, 123 cannons and mortars, 206 anti-tank weapons, 226 anti-aircraft guns, nine helicopters and 1,648 vehicles of various kinds.",

Nonetheless, as the Court found in Ila\u015fcu (cited above, \u00a7 387), in view of the size of the arsenal stored at Colba\u015fna, the Russian Army\u2019s military importance in the region and its dissuasive influence persisted. Moreover, in connection with both the arms store and the troops, the Court considers that the historical background has a significant bearing on the position during the period under examination in the present case. It cannot be forgotten that in the Ila\u015fcu judgment the Court held that the separatists were able to secure power in 1992 only as a result of the assistance of the Russian military. The Colba\u015fna arms store was originally the property of the USSR\u2019s 14th Army and the Court found it established beyond reasonable doubt that during the armed conflict the separatists were able, with the assistance of 14th Army personnel, to equip themselves from the arms store. The Court further found that the massive transfer to the separatists of arms and ammunition from the 14th Army\u2019s stores was pivotal in preventing the Moldovan army from regaining control of Transdniestria. In addition, the Court found that, from the start of the conflict, large numbers of Russian nationals from outside the region, particularly Cossacks, went to Transdniestria to fight with the separatists against the Moldovan forces. Finally, it found that in April 1992 the Russian Army stationed in Transdniestria (ROG) intervened in the conflict, allowing the separatists to gain possession of Tighina.",

The Court does not consider that the Russian Government have discharged the burden of proof upon them and established that this finding was incorrect. In particular, it is not denied by the Russian Government that the Russian public corporation Gazprom supplied gas to the region and that the \u201cMRT\u201d paid for only a tiny fraction of the gas consumed, both by individual households and by the large industrial complexes established in Transdniestria, many of them found by the Court to be Russian-owned (see paragraphs 39-40 above). The Russian Government accepts that it spends USD millions every year in the form of humanitarian aid to the population of Transdniestria, including the payment of old age pensions and financial assistance to schools, hospitals and prisons. In the light of the statistic, supplied by the Moldovan Government and undisputed by the Russian Government, that only approximately 20% of the population of the \u201cMRT\u201d are economically active, the importance for the local economy of Russian pensions and other aid can be better appreciated.\u00a0Finally, the Court notes that the Russian Government do not take issue with the applicants\u2019 statistics regarding nationality, according to which almost one fifth of those living in the region controlled by the \u201cMRT\u201d have been granted Russian nationality (see paragraphs 41-42 above).",

[GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 48, ECHR 2005-X; Austin and Others v. the  [GC], nos. 39692/09, 40713/09 and 41008/09, \u00a7 54, 15 March 2012). The two sentences of Article\u00a02 of Protocol No. 1 must therefore be read not only in the light of each other but also, in particular, of Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Convention which proclaim the right of everyone, including parents and children, \u201cto respect for his private and family life\u201d, to \u201cfreedom of thought, conscience and religion\u201d, and to \u201cfreedom ... to receive and impart information and ideas\u201d (see Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v.

In interpreting and applying this provision, account must also be taken of any relevant rules and principles of international law applicable in relations between the Contracting Parties and the Convention should so far as possible be interpreted in harmony with other rules of international law of which it forms part (see Al-Adsani v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35763/97, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2001-XI; Demir and Baykara v.  [GC], no. 34503/97, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2008; Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, \u00a7 62, ECHR 2008-...; Rantsev v.\u00a0Cyprus and Russia, no. 25965/04, \u00a7\u00a7 273-274, ECHR 2010 (extracts)). The provisions relating to the right to education set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention against Discrimination in Education, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are therefore of relevance (see paragraphs 77-81 above, and see also Timishev v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, \u00a7 64, ECHR 2005XI). Finally, the Court emphasises that the object and purpose of the Convention, as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings, requires that its provisions be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see, inter alia, Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, \u00a7\u00a087, Series A no. 161; and Artico v.

In order to ensure that the restrictions that are imposed do not curtail the right in question to such an extent as to impair its very essence and deprive it of its effectiveness, the Court must satisfy itself that they are foreseeable for those concerned and pursue a legitimate aim. However, unlike the position with respect to Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention, it is not bound by an exhaustive list of \u201clegitimate aims\u201d under Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Podkolzina v.

The applicants further complain that, although the schools were subsequently allowed to reopen, their buildings were commandeered by the \u201cMRT\u201d authorities and they had to move to new premises which were less well equipped and less conveniently situated. The applicants contend that they were subjected to a systematic campaign of harassment and intimidation by representatives of the \u201cMRT\u201d regime and private individuals. The children were verbally abused on their way to school and stopped and searched by the \u201cMRT\u201d police and border guards, who confiscated Latin script books when they found them. In addition, the two schools located in \u201cMRT\u201d-controlled territory were the target of repeated acts of vandalism. The applicants submitted that the alternative, for parents and children from the Moldovan community, was either to suffer this harassment or change to a school where teaching was carried out in Russian, Ukrainian or \u201cMoldavian\u201d, that is, Moldovan/Romanian written in the Cyrillic script. \u201cMoldavian\u201d was not a language used or recognised anywhere else in the world, although it had been one of the official languages in  in Soviet times.

First, Article 6 of the \u201cMRT\u201d Law on Languages\u201d was in force and the use of the Latin alphabet constituted an offence in the \u201cMRT\u201d (see paragraph 43 above). Secondly, it is clear that the schools had to move to new buildings, with the Alexandru cel Bun School divided between three sites and pupils at the \u015etefan cel  having to travel 40 kilometres each day. Thirdly, according to figures provided by the Moldovan Government, the number of pupils enrolled in the two schools still in \u201cMRT\u201d controlled territory approximately halved between 2007 and 2011 and there has also been a significant reduction in children studying in Moldovan/Romanian throughout Transdniestria. Although it appears that Transdniestria has an ageing population and that Moldovans in particular are emigrating (see paragraphs 8 and 42 above), the Court considers that the 50% attendance drop at Evrica and Alexandru cel Bun Schools is too high to be explained by demographic factors alone. For the Court, these uncontested facts serve to corroborate the general thrust of the allegations contained in the 81 affidavits submitted by the applicant parents and pupils, describing the constant harassment they suffered.",

The Court therefore considers that the forced closure of the schools, based on the \u201c\u201cMRT\u201d Law on languages\u201d (see paragraphs 43-44 above), and the subsequent measures of harassment constituted interferences with the applicant pupils\u2019 rights of access to educational institutions existing at a given time and to be educated in their national language (see paragraph 137 above).\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Court considers that these measures amounted to an interference with the applicant parents\u2019 rights to ensure their children\u2019s education and teaching in accordance with their philosophical convictions. As stated above, Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 must be read in the light of Article 8 of the Convention, which safeguards the right to respect for private and family life, inter alia. The applicant parents in this case wanted their children to be educated in the official language of their country, which was also their own mother tongue. Instead, they were placed in the invidious position of having to choose, on the one hand, between sending their children to schools where they would face the disadvantage of pursuing their entire secondary education in a combination of language and alphabet which they consider artificial and which is unrecognised anywhere else in the world, using teaching materials produced in Soviet times or, alternatively, subjecting their children to long journeys and/or substandard facilities, harassment and intimidation.",

Given the fundamental importance of primary and secondary education for each child\u2019s personal development and future success, it was impermissible to interrupt these children\u2019s schooling and force them and their parents to make such difficult choices with the sole purpose of entrenching the separatist ideology.",

In Sampanis and Others v. , no. 32526/05, 5 June 2008 the Court awarded EUR 6,000 to each applicant who had experienced anxiety, humiliation and depression as a result of his or her child being denied enrolment in school on ethnic grounds. The applicants submitted that, on this basis, they were each entitled to EUR 6,000 as a minimum in respect of the harm they had suffered as a direct result of the denial of an effective education due to their ethnicity and language. In addition, the applicants submitted that, when considering applications for damages from large umbers of victims, the Court should adopt an approach similar to that of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which used an approximate estimation of damage suffered based on the particular combinations of facts for each class of claimant (see, for example, Gonz\u00e1lez et al (the \u201cCotton fields case\u201d) v. Mexico, judgment of 16 November 2009).

This is the thrust of the assessment of the general principles relevant to jurisdiction, within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention, expressed by the Court in paragraphs 104 and 105 of the judgment, supported by numerous examples from its own case-law including its most recent decisions. It appears to establish such circumstances by suggesting, in paragraph 114, that such extraterritorial control can be exercised directly by a State through its agents or the assertion of its authority, but concludes immediately afterwards, in the same paragraph, as follows: \u201cThe Court accepts that there is no evidence of any direct involvement of Russian agents in the action taken against the applicants\u2019 schools\u201d. So, what exceptional circumstances remain? The \u201ceffective control over the \u201cMRT\u201d during the relevant period\u201d (see paragraphs 114 and 116 of the judgment), plus the conclusions containing strong political overtones (paragraphs 117-121).

By contrast, the outcome of the present case was only too foreseeable, given that the judgments in Ila\u015fcu and Others and Ivan\u0163oc and Others are \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 already established case-law. What is \u201cunforeseeable\u201d in this judgment, however, is the controversial interpretation of the content and scope of the right to education set forth in Article 2 of Protocol No.\u00a01. In the leading Belgian linguistic case the Court\u2019s interpretation of the second sentence of that Article dispelled any ambiguities: \u201cThis provision does not require of States that they should, in the sphere of education or teaching, respect parents\u2019 linguistic preferences, but only their religious and philosophical convictions. To interpret the terms \u201creligious\u201d and \u201cphilosophical\u201d as covering linguistic preferences would amount to a distortion of their ordinary and usual meaning and to read into the Convention something which is not there\u201d (Case \u201crelating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium\u201d v.\u00a0Belgium (merits), 23 July 1968, \u00a7 6, Series A no. 6). Admittedly, that judgment also says that the right to education would be meaningless if it did not imply, in favour of its beneficiaries, the right to be educated in the national language or in one of the national languages, as the case may be. The Court could therefore have concentrated on the exercise of this \u201clinguistic\u201d right which, in the present case, ran up against the problem of the use of a particular alphabet.",

In my view, the Court should not examine the complaint under Article 2 of Protocol No.\u00a01 on the merits because this complaint goes well beyond the ordinary meaning given to the right to education.",

In its examination of this application, the Court seeks to develop its case-law on Article 2 of Protocol No.\u00a01... while refraining, by a majority, from replacing the problem within the context of the provisions of Article 8. The magic wand consisting in an \u201cevolutive interpretation\u201d of the Convention is applied only to Article 2 of Protocol No.\u00a01, giving it a meaning hitherto unseen... The task that the Court sets itself at the beginning of its analysis of the context of this Article (see paragraph 136 of the judgment) conflicts with the ratione materiae criterion. I fear that, in taking this approach, the Court is setting a bad example of what is called \u201cjudicial activism\u201d.

In the fairly recent judgment in the case of Ponomaryovi v.\u00a0Bulgaria (no. 5335/05, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2011), the Court awarded each of the applicants EUR 2,000\u00a0on account of the violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 2 of Protocol No.\u00a01. In Or\u0161u\u0161 and Others v.\u00a0Croatia ([GC], no. 15766/03, ECHR 2010), which concerns the education of Roma children, it awarded each applicant, for several violations, among which was Article 2 of Protocol No.\u00a01, EUR 4,500, and in Sampanis and Others v. Greece (no. 32526/05, 5 June 2008) it awarded each applicant EUR 6,000 on account of the greater seriousness of the violation (Article 13 and Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 2 of Protocol No.\u00a01). In the present case, however, a far more generous award is made in respect of a single violation. This observation also concerns the costs and expenses: EUR 10,000 in Or\u0161u\u0161 and EUR 50,000 in the present case, whereas these are both Grand Chamber cases...
