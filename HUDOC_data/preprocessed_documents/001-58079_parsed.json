The traditional aims of the statute are sought to be realised specifically at the expense of the applicants\u2019 rights under the Convention and, more generally speaking, the struggle to recognise that sexual abuse of children is a gross violation of children\u2019s and human rights and to promote fundamental change in the nature of social reactions and attitudes to the depressingly prevalent phenomenon of child sexual abuse.

The Court of Appeal in its judgment in Stubbings v. Webb of 27 March 1991 (see paragraph 14 of the judgment) concluded that the limitation period started to run only when the applicant realised that her symptoms were attributable to the abuse suffered as a child.  Alternatively, the Court of Appeal was prepared to exercise its discretion under the Limitation Act 1980, section 33, to allow the action to proceed. Pursuant to the Limitation Act 1980, section 11, this discretion is only available in cases relating to personal injury arising from negligence, nuisance or breach of duty. Relying on Letang v. Cooper [1965] 1 Queen\u2019s Bench Reports p. 232, the Court of Appeal found that section 11 did not distinguish between claims based on unintentional and intentional trespass to the person. This finding was overturned by the House of Lords which held that cases of deliberate assault did not fall within the definition in section 11 but were more properly the subject of an action founded on tort; there was no discretionary power to extend the limitation period.",

In the light of evidence to the contrary, it cannot reasonably be contended that all victims of intentionally inflicted injury are more likely to be aware of the facts on which to found a claim than victims of unintentional injury. Especially in the case of a child sexual abuse victim, it is not reasonable to make the victim\u2019s access to a court depend on whether the perpetrator inflicted the injury intentionally or negligently. The legitimate purposes pursued by the State in imposing a limitation period on actions are equally applicable to both types of claimant.
