Similarly to its findings in Karelin, the Court is unable to conclude that there were sufficient safeguards in place to exclude legitimate doubts as to the adverse effect the statutory procedure had on the trial court\u2019s impartiality. Lastly, it notes that the appeal proceedings have not remedied the deficiencies of the trial.
