If one is unable or unwilling to wait until the maturity of bonds, he or she may sell them on the Stock Exchange (their current price is around 40% of their nominal value). With the aim of making such bonds attractive, the Republika Srpska has accepted that they may be used to pay direct taxes accrued by 31 December 2007.",

The respondent State enforced the judgments under consideration in that case in cash and undertook to so enforce a number of other similar judgments (see Momi\u0107 and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 28730/06, 17\u00a0May\u00a02011). However, it should be emphasised that none of the applicants in those cases, unlike the present applicants, had accepted government bonds. The present case must therefore be distinguished from the \u010coli\u0107 and Others jurisprudence. Given further the fact that many of the present applicants have already sold their bonds on the Stock Exchange (see paragraph 10 above) and that the legal costs awarded to them have already been paid in cash, the Court considers the impugned domestic judgments to have been enforced.",

Italy (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0180 and 193, ECHR 2006V). One of the features of such redress is the amount awarded by the national authorities (see Kudi\u0107 v. , no. 28971/05, \u00a7 17, 9 December 2008). While it is true that the national authorities expressly acknowledged the breach alleged in the present case, the applicants were not able to obtain any compensation in respect of the delayed enforcement of the judgments (see paragraph 8 above). Therefore, they may still claim to be victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention in relation to the period during which the judgments remained unenforced (see Dubenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a074221/01, \u00a7 36, 11 January 2005). The Court thus rejects the Government\u2019s objection.",
