The first witness said that when investigating a theft of which he had been suspected by officer N.D. of committing, officer N.D. had threatened him that he would frame him in the same way in which he had framed the applicant. The second witness, detained in the same facility as the applicant, said that officer N.D., when arresting him in relation to other offences, had enquired whether he had been aware of any offences committed by the applicant. The tone of his voice had indicated that he bore a personal animosity towards the applicant and wished to frame him. After that the court heard officer N.D., who repeated his account of the events of 27 September 2000. He additionally said that he knew the witnesses called by the applicant, who were either suspected of criminal offences or had previous convictions, and that their statements were not truthful. The court organised a confrontation between them and officer N.D. All three reiterated their positions. Officer N.D. was then crossexamined by the applicant.",

It found that there had been no grounds to increase that sentence from ten to thirteen months, because the applicant had served it as early as 1996 and an increase would not further the aims of the punishment. As for the merits of the criminal case against the applicant, the court observed that, in the absence of breaches of procedural rules on the part of the lower courts, it was not competent to deal with arguments concerning the assessment of evidence and those courts\u2019 findings of fact. There was no appearance of a breach of the rules of procedure and no error in the application of the substantive law. The applicant\u2019s arguments concerning the establishment of the facts had been rejected by the lower courts after careful consideration of all the evidence. The appellate court had allowed the applicant to call witnesses and had reexamined officer N.D. The claim that it had failed to examine the case with due care was therefore illfounded.

Moreover, Article 94 \u00a7 1 (7) often coincided with other grounds for the mandatory appointment of counsel, for instance those predicating such appointment on the subject matter of the case or the situation of the accused.

First, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Secondly, although Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence. The Court is therefore not called upon to determine whether particular types of evidence \u2013 for instance, evidence obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law \u2013 may be admissible; the question that must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7\u00a7 16263, ECHR 2010...).",

That testimony did indeed repeat what the applicant had said, but this cannot be regarded as in itself contrary to the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d). It is true that inculpatory hearsay emanating from a police officer may carry doubts as to its reliability. However, as already noted, Article 6 of the Convention does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence. Similarly, the fact that the testimony emanated from an officer who had already dealt with the applicant and had taken part in the uncovering of the offence does not in itself raise a fairness issue (see, mutatis mutandis, Cornelis v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 994/03, ECHR 2004\u2013V). Nor can the Court gainsay the national courts\u2019 opinion as to the officer\u2019s \u2013 or the other witnesses\u2019 \u2013 credibility and reliability. It is not for it to substitute its own assessment of the evidence made by these courts, unless their assessment was arbitrary or capricious (see Brennan v. the United Kingdom, no. 39846/98, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2001X). The applicant was given the opportunity of opposing the use of the officer\u2019s testimony, but retracted his initial objection to the officer\u2019s being called to give evidence at the trial. He was also able to crossexamine the officer and challenge the truthfulness of his statement. Indeed, he called two witnesses with a view to undermining the officer\u2019s credibility. After hearing those witnesses and organising a confrontation between them and the officer, the appellate court specifically found, in a reasoned ruling, that there were no grounds to doubt the accuracy of the officer\u2019s testimony (see paragraphs 26 above).",

The Court cannot substitute itself for the national courts in carrying out that assessment; it must rather review whether they considered the issue in line with the requirements of Article 6 (see R.D. v. Poland, nos. 29692/96 and 34612/97, \u00a7 45, 18 December 2001). In this connection, the Court notes three points. First, the firstinstance court expressly stated in its judgment that the applicant was unemployed and was financially dependent on his parents (see paragraph 20 above). Secondly, the appellate court appointed counsel for the applicant by reference to a declaration about his financial situation and to Article 70 \u00a7 1 (7) of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1974, which predicated the grant of legal assistance on the impossibility for the accused to afford counsel (see paragraphs 24 and 37 above). Thirdly, the applicant expressly asserted that he could not afford to retain counsel (see paragraph 29 above), whereas in rejecting his request the Supreme Court of Cassation did not properly explain why it did not accept that assertion, confining its reasoning to the very brief and blanket statement that the applicant had not pointed out why he had been unable to retain counsel (see paragraph 30 above and, mutatis mutandis, Raykov v. , no. 35185/03, \u00a7 66, 22 October 2009, and contrast Caresana v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 31541/96, 29 August 2000). The Supreme Court of Cassation did not give any indication whatsoever as to the circumstances, if any, which grounded its refusal (see R.D. v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 46). In the light of those facts, the Court is satisfied that the applicant lacked sufficient means to pay for his legal representation before the Supreme Court of Cassation (see, mutatis mutandis, Twalib v. Greece, 9\u00a0June 1998, \u00a7 51, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV, and Tsonyo Tsonev (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 39).",

Where deprivation of liberty is at stake, the interests of justice in principle call for legal assistance (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 61, Reports 1996III; Shabelnik v. Ukraine, no. 16404/03, \u00a7 58, 19 February 2009; and Tsonyo Tsonev (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 40). There can therefore be little doubt that they required that it be granted to the applicant for the purposes of his representation before the Supreme Court of Cassation. An additional factor was the complexity of the cassation procedure (see Pham Hoang, \u00a7 40 in fine; Twalib, \u00a7 53; and Tsonyo Tsonev (no. 2), \u00a7 40, all cited above). Lastly, it cannot be overlooked that a qualified lawyer would have been able to clarify the grounds set out by the applicant in his appeal and effectively counter the pleadings of the public prosecutor at the hearing (see Artico v.\u00a0Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7 34 in fine, Series A no. 37; Pakelli v. Germany, 25\u00a0April 1983, \u00a7\u00a7 3739, Series A no. 64; Granger v. the United Kingdom, 28 March 1990, \u00a7 47, Series A no. 174), thus ensuring respect for the principle of equality of arms (see Tsonyo Tsonev (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 41).",

Its refusal to deal with them must therefore be regarded as justified. The manner of application of Article 6 of the Convention to proceedings before courts of appeal depends on the special features of the proceedings involved; account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate court therein (see, among many other authorities, Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 56, Series A no. 115). Under Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 the Contracting States may limit the scope of review of a conviction or sentence by a higher court, and in several of those States such review is limited to questions of law (see Pesti and Frodl v. Austria (dec.), nos. 27618/95 and 27619/95, ECHR 2000I). Since the Convention and its Protocols must be read as a whole, such a limitation cannot be regarded as falling foul of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Bulgaria, no. 9808/02, \u00a7 51, 24 March 2005). This is a stringent test: a flagrant denial of justice goes beyond mere irregularities or lack of safeguards in the trial procedures that result in a breach of Article 6 of the Convention. What is required is a breach of the principles of fair trial that is so fundamental as to amount to a nullification, or destruction of the very essence, of the right guaranteed by that Article (see Othman (Abu Qatada) v. the United Kingdom, no. 8139/09, \u00a7 260, 17 January 2012). Until now, the Court has found that a flagrant denial of justice has occurred or would occur only in certain very exceptional circumstances: conviction in absentia coupled with an impossibility to obtain from a court which has heard the accused a fresh determination of the merits of the charge (see Enhorn v. Sweden (dec.), no.\u00a056529/00, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2005I; Stoichkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 5556; and Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2006II); proceedings amounting to a mockery of basic fair trial principles (see Ila\u015fcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, \u00a7\u00a7 21216, 286, 436 and 46163, ECHR 2004VII); a trial that is summary in nature and conducted with total disregard for the rights of the defence (see Bader and Kanbor v.\u00a0Sweden, no. 13284/04, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2005XI); detention without access to an independent and impartial tribunal able to review its lawfulness (see AlMoayad v. Germany (dec.), no. 35865/03, \u00a7 101, 20 February 2007); deliberate and systematic refusal of access to a lawyer, especially for an individual detained in a foreign country (ibid.); or a trial in which evidence obtained under torture is used to secure a conviction (see Othman (Abu\u00a0Qatada), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 26367). This is not the case here. Although the proceedings against the applicant were not fully in line with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, the flaws in them did not render them so fundamentally unfair as to amount to a flagrant denial of justice.",

The situation at hand is therefore far from being the paradigmatic case of double jeopardy envisaged by Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (compare with Sagir v. Austria, no. 32054/96, Commission decision of 2 July 1998, unreported, and with R.T. v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 31982/96, 30 May 2000). However, even assuming that, because of the possibility of increasing the combined sentence by up to one half, the situation complained of fell within the ambit of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 and that the later ruling \u2013 that of the Supreme Court of Cassation \u2013 impermissibly dealt with a question already settled in a final decision, the result was favourable for the applicant. While the  upheld the increase of his combined sentence from ten to thirteen months, the Supreme Court of Cassation found such an increase unnecessary and left the combined punishment at ten months, which the applicant had already served in 1996. The applicant can thus hardly claim to be a victim of a violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (see, mutatis mutandis, Nikitin v. Russia, no.\u00a050178/99, \u00a7 60 in limine, ECHR 2004VIII).",
