She testified that on 4 March 2004, after the police patrol had driven her to the police station, she had first been taken to a room where a police officer, S., had been filling in some papers. He had told her that she had been arrested and that her fingerprints would be taken. She had left her jacket and bag in that room. Another police officer, B., had then taken her to another room, where another police officer, L., had taken her fingerprints using ink. Afterwards, she had gone to a bathroom to wash the ink off her hands. When she returned to the first room, she was informed that she would be searched in the presence of two attesting witnesses B. and K. The police officer had searched the applicant\u2019s bag and discovered two packages wrapped in aluminium foil, which did not belong to her. The applicant stated that her fingerprints had been taken before and after the search, and that only the second episode had been recorded.",

Referring to its own, as well as to this Court\u2019s case-law, it recognised the Trial Chambers\u2019 discretion in relation to the admissibility of evidence, as well as in defining the modalities of cross-examination and the exercise of this right by the defence. It stressed that such deference is based on the recognition of \u201cthe Trial Chamber\u2019s organic familiarity with the day-to-day conduct of the parties and practical demands of the case\u201d. The Appeals Chamber highlighted that the right of an accused to cross-examine a witness is not absolute, that the fairness of a trial must not be uniquely predicated on the fairness accorded to the accused and that while the proceedings must be conducted with full respect for the procedural rights, the restrictions on the right to cross-examination will not necessarily entail a violation or be inconsistent with a fair trial (ibid. \u00a7\u00a7 6, 12).",

Various ways are conceivable in which national law may meet this requirement. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment on them (see Zahirovi\u0107 v. Croatia, no.\u00a058590/11, \u00a7\u00a042, 25 April 2013, with further references).

As regards the applicant\u2019s allegations of entrapment, the Chamber specifically observed that they had been raised for the first time in the applicant\u2019s observations before the Court. Accordingly, it concluded that the applicant had failed to support her request to question A. with sufficient reasons (ibid.). Further, the Chamber examined the overall fairness of the proceedings and concluded that the applicant\u2019s conviction had been based on a range of evidence. Despite A.\u2019s absence from the trial his pre-trial statements had been read out at trial and the applicant was able to comment on them as well as on the other evidence.",

Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2006XII).

First of all, as a general rule, it is for the domestic courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce and Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call a particular witness. Second, it is not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he or she has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he or she must, in addition, support the request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth.",

On the contrary, in a case where the examination of a defence witness had been requested in order to establish an issue beyond the scope of a charge or the testimony had been incapable of proving the accused\u2019s innocence, the absence of the witness had not compromised the fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Tymchenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 47351/06, \u00a7 92, 13\u00a0October 2016).

Since the overall fairness of the proceedings is an overriding criterion under Article 6 an applicant has to demonstrate not only that a particular defence witness was not examined, but also that the examination of that witness was necessary and that the refusal to call the witness prejudiced the rights of the defence (see Guilloury v.

Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 162, ECHR 2010).

While certain post-Perna cases examined whether a witness\u2019 testimony was relevant for the \u201cestablishment of the truth\u201d, others relied on its ability to influence the outcome of a trial (see Tarasov, cited above, \u00a7 105), reasonably establish an accused\u2019s alibi (see Polyakov, cited above, \u00a7 34), arguably lead to an acquittal (see Dorokhov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072) or arguably strengthen the position of the defence or even lead to the applicant\u2019s acquittal (see Topi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 42). What appears to unite all of the above standards is the relevance of a witness\u2019s testimony to the subject matter of the accusation and its ability to influence the outcome of the proceedings. In the light of the evolution of its case-law under Article 6 of the Convention the Court considers it necessary to clarify the standard by bringing within its scope not only motions of the defence to call witnesses capable of influencing the outcome of a trial, but also other witnesses who can reasonably be expected to strengthen the position of the defence.",

It is impossible to evaluate in the abstract whether certain reasons for the examination of a witness could be considered sufficient and relevant to the subject matter of the accusation. This assessment necessarily entails consideration of the circumstances of a given case, including the applicable provisions of the domestic law, the stage and progress of the proceedings, the lines of reasoning and strategies pursued by the parties and their procedural conduct. Admittedly, the relevance of a defence witness\u2019 testimony might be so apparent in certain cases that even scant reasoning given by the defence would be sufficient to answer the first question of the test in the affirmative (compare Pello, cited above, \u00a7 33).",

For example, in Ibrahim and Others, when examining the impact of procedural failings at the pre-trial stage on the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings, the Court stated that consideration should be given, inter alia, to the quality of the evidence and whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy, taking into account the degree and nature of the compulsion, and also of the use to which the evidence was put, in particular whether the evidence formed an integral or significant part of the probative evidence upon which the conviction was based, and the strength of the other evidence in the case. Nonetheless, these substantive elements of the overall fairness assessment remained in the shadow of a large number of solely procedural elements. This cannot be said for examination of complaints concerning the use of evidence obtained in violation of Convention rights. In Bykov, the Court emphasized that it was necessary to examine whether there existed any doubt regarding the quality of the evidence, including whether the circumstances in which it had been obtained cast any doubt on its reliability or its accuracy, and whether there existed supporting evidence for the defendant\u2019s conviction.

While it is perfectly understandable that the Court cannot side with any particular legal theory of justice and fairness, I would wish to argue that the approach should remain procedural and should, as far as possible, avoid any assessment of the fairness of the outcome. The reasons for this are manifold. Firstly, the overarching element in adjudication of complaints under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 3 of the Convention is the (overall) fairness of the proceedings \u2013 and not of the outcome. Secondly, this is a logical consequence of the fact that Article 6 guarantees fundamental procedural rights. On the other hand, there is no right under the Convention or its Protocols guaranteeing any particular outcome in criminal proceedings. Thirdly, as the Court constantly emphasises, it is not a tribunal of fourth instance and may not, as a matter of principle, adjudicate on the matters of errors of fact. Consequently, it cannot and may not weigh up whether the evidence produced against the defendant in a given set of domestic criminal proceedings was sufficient, reliable or accurate, and whether his conviction was fair. What it can do instead is to verify whether the criminal proceedings as such were fair. The constituent elements of the notion of fairness as described in point 10 of this dissenting opinion may serve as a useful source of inspiration.",

According to the police officers, the applicant was stopped \u201cbecause she walked idly\u201d (police officer P.) or \u201cbecause she has been walking quickly\u201d (police officer S.). Some police officers stated that she was stopped \u201cbecause it was unclear where she was going to go\u201d, \u201cbecause she was a person of Caucasian ethnicity\u201d and \u201cbecause she was wearing black clothing\u201d. In my opinion, the only reason that is possibly acceptable would be that she \u201cresembled a girl from a wanted persons notice\u201d, as stated by only one of the five police officers who took part in her arrest and search. However, it was subsequently established by the police themselves that the applicant was not the wanted person. Although the applicant does not complain before the Court about the arrest, these circumstances cast some doubt on whether the police acted in good faith in this case. This doubt is not dispelled by the police version, which in itself does not seem particularly credible. In their version, they incidentally stopped a woman in the street of Moscow for no compelling reason, brought her to the police station, and performed a search of her bag (again for no compelling reason pertaining to the situation in hand), where they found two packages of explosives.

Likewise, the foil containing the explosives was never examined for fingerprints or DNA, whether that of the applicant or any other person. No explanation was given for these omissions, though one could reasonably expect a good-faith investigation to take these steps in order to elucidate the exact role of the applicant (if any) and to search for possible accomplices, as it is highly unlikely that a 21-year-old woman would organise a terrorist attack on her own. Instead, the police examined her jacket and bag for residues, which in the applicant\u2019s version were left unattended for some time. While the police admittedly deny that the applicant was taken to a different room to be photographed and fingerprinted prior to the search of her bag, claiming that the applicant had her jacket and bag with her at all times, the applicant\u2019s account on this point is not necessarily prima facie incredible: since, in the police version, she was taken to the station for an identity check, fingerprinting and photographing would have been the most logical first step.

In considering whether questioning of the attesting witnesses could have made the assertion of planted evidence more probable, one can observe that the defence failed to elaborate on this particular point, not only at the main hearing, but also in their appeal, in the supervisory review complaint and also in the proceedings before the Court. Furthermore, the applicant herself cast doubt on the relevance of the motion with her intervention. This is admittedly the weak point in the applicant\u2019s case before our Court. However, one must bear in mind the particularities of her procedural situation. The defence did not have any alternative evidence at hand to prove the applicant\u2019s assertion. Whilst it is true that the domestic court heard the police officers involved in the arrest and search, and that the prosecution questioned them at the main hearing regarding the relevant circumstances, they were not merely witnesses against the defendant within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention, but also, prima facie, hostile towards the defence on this particular point. Assuming the hypothesis that the applicant was correct in her allegations, what was the likelihood that the police officers would admit to having planted the evidence? It is unreasonable to verify assertions of planted evidence only by hearing those who are possibly responsible for such misconduct. No court would ever acquit a defendant on the sole basis that he denied his guilt. If equal treatment is the key maxim in consideration of defence motions, these cannot be dismissed simply because the police deny the defence assertions. Thus, I find it surprising that the majority highlight the questioning of the police officers as a significant element in rejecting the relevance of the defence motion to have the attesting witnesses heard (see paragraph\u00a0170 of the judgment).",

In sum, I believe that the reasoning provided by the Supreme Court was inadequate and that, in consequence, the domestic courts\u2019 decision making in the present case does not pass the second element of the three-pronged test.",

This point weighs heavily in the Court\u2019s examination of the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the failure to summon and hear witness A. In fact, the applicant\u2019s lawyer U. clearly stated during the exchange of closing arguments that \u201cthis whole criminal case is a set-up against Murtazaliyeva by law-enforcement agents\u201d. This statement must be construed as a properly raised entrapment plea when viewed against the background of all the available case material, which demonstrates that the applicant\u2019s strategy and line of defence before the domestic courts was essentially to protest her innocence and to insist in particular on her claim that the police had planted the plastic explosives in her handbag. In this respect it should be emphasised that, contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, the denial of guilt does not logically preclude reliance on police incitement. Furthermore, according to the nemo tenetur principle, a defendant must not be forced to choose between a defence of being innocent and an entrapment defence.

Admittedly, in order to save the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and satisfy the \u201cprovocative\u201d criticism from the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in Horncastle, Al-Khawaja and Tahery departed from the \u201csole or decisive\u201d rule, according to which a trial was unfair if a conviction was based solely or to a decisive extent on evidence provided by a witness whom the defendant had been unable to question at any stage of the proceedings.

The cure was worse than the disease.

As Judges Spielmann, Karaka\u015f, Saj\u00f3 and Keller denounced, such application of the three-step examination would imply its redundancy so long as the overall fairness test was fulfilled, which would not only fail to provide any guidance to the national authorities as to the appropriate application of the Al-Khawaja and Tahery test, but indeed would give them too much leeway. To complicate matters, the then majority added that sufficient counterbalancing factors were still needed if the untested pre-trial testimonial evidence carried significant weight.

Criminal justice is not about ontological justice and judges in criminal trials are not Gods. A procedure is fair when fundamental procedural rules are respected. In this sense, it is difficult to know what the assessment of whether a procedure is fair overall may mean in practice.

These factors include, among \u201c[o]ther relevant procedural safeguards afforded by domestic law and practice\u201d, specific considerations (such as defendants\u2019 age and mental capacity) but also other \u201cfactors\u201d which are as broad as the fairness assessment itself. The Court states, for example, that it will have regard to \u201cthe legal framework governing the pre-trial proceedings\u201d and \u201cthe quality of the evidence... taking into account the degree and nature of any compulsion\u201d. This is a map of the size of the territory: apparently accurate, but in reality useless in terms of providing any guidance. This is shown by the fact that not even the Court itself reviewed all these elements when conducting the fairness assessment a year later in Simeonovi v.\u00a0Bulgaria. The lack of legal certitude is compounded in the case of a refusal by defence witnesses to attend, because the Ibrahim and Others list of the ten relevant factors for the assessment of the overall fairness of the proceedings was totally ignored in the present case, and no effort was made to replace it by an alternative list.",

One need not take an extremely deontological stand to understand why this kind of reasoning should be prohibited in a court of law. The gravity and nature of offences may prompt States to adopt particular procedural provisions, and, specifically, nothing in the Convention should be understood to prevent countries from fighting terrorism, organised crime and other serious forms of crime. However, listing this factor among those relevant to assessing the fairness of proceedings is very troubling. I note that the Ibrahim and Others judgment did not refer to the public interest in the investigation and punishment of \u201cthe kind of offence in issue\u201d, but of \u201cthe particular offence in issue\u201d. This could be read as implying that defendants are entitled to different degrees of fairness in the procedures against them not only because of the kind of offence they are indicted for, but also because of the \u201cpublic interest\u201d their case happened to arouse. This would be the ultimate paradigm of \u201cstreet justice\u201d, more akin to vigilante punishment than to a lawful trial. Even if I think that the Court could not possibly have intended such a meaning, it is telling that in a paragraph which is envisioned as pedagogical this kind of ambiguity can be found. However, it is unclear what else the Court could have meant. It could have meant that States are granted some discretion in imposing more restrictive procedural rules to crimes that involve especially sensitive issues. If that were the case, however, this issue should have been assessed in the previous stage, that is, when evaluating the reasons the Government provided for the restriction. Taking the public interest into consideration twice entails a double-counting \u2013 or, in other words, \u201chalf-counting\u201d the importance of the fairness of the trial.",

And second, whether that evidence would reasonably have led to conviction, even if the defendant had had legal assistance of his or her own choice.

For example, a judge or public prosecutor who does not allow the defendant to have access to a lawyer of his or her choice while conducting a preliminary investigation cannot possibly know in advance whether the rest of the proceedings, carried out in part by different bodies, will be conducted \u201csufficiently fairly\u201d to compensate for a putative violation of the Convention.

According to Article 60 of Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation, an attesting witness is \u201ca person, disinterested in the outcome of the criminal case\u201d; he or she is entitled to take part in an investigative action and make comments on it, and these comments are to be entered into the record. An attesting witness is also entitled to familiarise himself or herself with that record. Since there are no legal requirements as to the legal qualification of the attesting witness, he or she may not be in a position to comment on, let alone verify, the legality of the procedure adopted by the investigator. This evidently empties the role of the attesting witness of much of its interest. Even where he or she does possess a legal qualification, the attesting witness evidently cannot replace the guarantee of legal assistance to the accused or to suspects who have not been charged, for the obvious reason that he or she is chosen by the investigator. Furthermore, there is a serious risk of misuse of this witness by the prosecutorial side, since it can be easily anticipated that the investigator will choose individuals who have his or her trust and who will not create problems. Moreover, when brought and questioned before the trial court, an attesting witness may be led to reproduce what he or she heard from the material witnesses or the accused or the suspect during the investigative action. Such questioning would correspond to misuse of the attesting witness as a hearsay witness at the trial. In order to comply with the prohibition on hearsay, the questioning of attesting witnesses would have to be limited to the circumstances surrounding the investigative action and its conduct. Finally, the Court itself has already held that the absence of attesting witnesses in court does not infringe Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention, since \u201cit appears that the contribution by attesting witnesses to the proceedings was limited to statements on the manner of conducting the investigative measures\u201d and \u201ctheir depositions did not serve to a material degree as a basis for the applicants\u2019 convictions\u201d.",
