Proceedings before the
On 16 December 2002 the applicant complained to the  about the length of the proceedings concerning the dissolution of co-ownership of a real estate. She indicated that the District Court in Trnava was the authority responsible for the alleged violation. The applicant claimed, inter alia, just satisfaction of 130,000 Slovakian korunas (SKK). She later increased this sum to SKK 34 million.
On 27 October 2003 the  found a violation of the applicant’s constitutional right to a hearing without undue delay. It ordered the Trnava District Court to proceed with the case expeditiously. The  further awarded SKK 20,000 as just satisfaction to the applicant.
In its finding the  stated that it only had regard to the length of the proceedings after 15 February 1993 when the Constitutional Court Act came into effect.
The  admitted that the overall length of the period under consideration was partly due to the factual complexity of the case. In its view, the applicant had contributed substantially to the length of the proceedings by her procedural motions, such as appeals against procedural decisions, requests for exemption from the obligation to pay the fees, comments on questions put to experts and by challenging the District Court judges.
As regards the conduct of the District Court, the  noted that the period under consideration lasted more than ten years and that during that time the District Court had held seventeen hearings. Even taking into account that the proceedings had been stayed for two years and five months pending the outcome of a different set of proceedings, their overall length was not reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case. The  noted, in particular, that undue delays of thirteen and twelve months respectively had occurred between 4 March 1996 and 4 April 1997 and between 9 October 2002 and 1 October 2003. The decision further stated that the District Court had not proceeded with the case diligently.
On 6 December 2002 the applicant filed a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution about the length of the proceedings concerning her claim of 20 November 1995. She claimed, inter alia, SKK 2 million in just satisfaction.
On 27 October 2003 the  found that the Trnava District Court had violated the applicant’s constitutional right to a hearing without undue delay. It ordered the Trnava District Court to proceed with the case expeditiously. The  further awarded SKK 10,000 as just satisfaction to the applicant.
The decision stated that the case was not complex. As to the applicant’s conduct, the  noted that the defendant had paid her the remainder of the sum originally due on 27 May 1999 and that she had only informed the District Court of this fact and modified her claim accordingly on 13 November 2002.
The decision further stated that the District Court was responsible for undue delays in the proceedings between 1 December 1997 and 7 January 1999 and between 6 September 2001 and 13 November 2002.
When awarding just satisfaction to the applicant the  took into account that at that time the proceedings no longer concerned the principal sum originally claimed by the applicant, but only default interest and her costs.
On 3 May 2004 the applicant again complained to the  about the length of the proceedings before the Trnava District Court which had been brought against her in 1991. She alleged that the District Court had failed to proceed with the case in compliance with the ’s finding of 27 October 2003.
The  rejected the complaint as being inadmissible on 27 May 2004. The decision stated that less than seven months had lapsed from the delivery of the ’s judgment of 27 October 2003.
In two separate letters addressed to the  and dated 3 June 2004 the applicant complained that the District Court in Trnava had caused further delays in the proceedings concerning her cases. She requested that an advocate be appointed to represent her in the constitutional proceedings.
In the letter concerning the proceedings brought in 1995 the applicant stated that the District Court had also violated her rights under Articles 8 and 12 of the Convention, under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and under Articles 2-5 of Protocol No. 7. She submitted no further reasons for that allegation.
On 9 June 2004 the applicant sent a letter to the President of the  requesting that the District Court should proceed with the cases without any further delay.
