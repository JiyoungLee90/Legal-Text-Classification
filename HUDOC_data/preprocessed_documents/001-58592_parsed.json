Since what was at issue was an allowance exclusive to staff in post in given d\u00e9partements, only the Colmar and Metz courts of appeal had had normal jurisdiction to hear the cases, and the Court of Cassation had taken care, after the judgments of 22 April 1992, in which it had quashed the judgments of the court below, to order a rehearing of the cases by one and the same second court of appeal, namely the Besan\u00e7on Court of Appeal (see paragraph 19 above).",

The first scrutiny was carried out by the Constitutional Council when such provisions were submitted to it for review. While it declined to assess whether an Act was compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, a comparison of Convention law with its decisions on fundamental rights showed that, on many points, the development of its case-law duly reflected that of the European Court\u2019s case-law. The Constitutional Council was particularly vigilant to circumscribe very narrowly the use of laws designed to legalise existing practices (lois de validation). It laid down three conditions to be satisfied if such laws were to be constitutional: the legalisation could only be preventive; the legalisation measure must not offend the principle that a criminal statute must not have retrospective effect; and the legislature could only intervene on grounds of the general interest. The second scrutiny was carried out by the ordinary courts when applying new legislation to pending cases. Laws to legalise existing practices were passed mainly in the sphere of administrative law, and that explained why there were so few decisions by the Court of Cassation on the subject. But there were very many court decisions concerning retrospective and interpretative legislation. The courts put a limit on the application of such legislation to pending proceedings, holding that they could not be applied for the first time in the Court of Cassation and could not be a ground for quashing a decision against which it was no longer possible to bring an ordinary appeal.",

In the first place, the concern had been to prevent further conflicting decisions being given by the courts. In its three judgments of 22 April 1992 the Court of Cassation had drawn the logical conclusion from the finding that the index which served as a basis for the allowance had disappeared; those judgments had the potential to give rise to conflicting decisions by the courts below, since three different courts of appeal had to deal with the issue. Divergences had appeared between the Besan\u00e7on, Colmar and Metz courts of appeal, none of which had resolved the matter in the same way (see paragraphs 16, 20, 21, 35 and 41 above). Further such divergences could be expected. In the second place, the Government submitted that it had been necessary to avoid jeopardising the financial stability of the socialsecurity schemes in issue, as had been expressly noted by the Constitutional Council. Furthermore, the court actions could have threatened the continuity of the social-security public service. An exponential increase in staff costs would have led to a corresponding reduction in the funds earmarked for paying benefits to those who were insured with the social-security system, especially as roughly 5,000 of the 9,000 or so officials receiving the IDP had instituted legal proceedings by the time the Act had been passed. If these actions had generally been successful, the budget of the bodies concerned would have been cut by approximately 350,000,000 francs. The 1994 Act had therefore been dictated by compelling grounds of the general interest (see the National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society judgment cited above).",

The Act was not designed to reduce the IDP in an authoritarian way but to guarantee its fixed percentage in staff remuneration, thereby adopting the solution found by the Colmar Court of Appeal in its judgments of 23 September 1993 (see paragraph 20 above). The intention of the legislature had been quite simply to revert to the method of calculation decided on at the time of the original pay agreement. Furthermore, contrary to what applied in the Papageorgiou case (see the judgment cited above), the existence of a link between the provisions of section 85 of the Act of 18\u00a0January 1994 and the remainder of that Act was clearly established and confirmed in the Constitutional Council\u2019s decision.

Firstly, the Court of Cassation had not been able to impose a uniform solution on the various courts of appeal, as it had jurisdiction to deal with matters only of \u201claw\u201d, not of \u201cfact\u201d. Since, in earlier cases, the Court of Cassation had held, in particular, that the determination of the parties\u2019 intention at the time of concluding a contract or agreeing a practice was a question of \u201cfact\u201d, intervention by the legislature had been necessary in order to establish a uniform method of calculating the IDP. Secondly, the instant case had links with the National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society case (see the judgment cited above): certain trade unions had belatedly taken advantage of a \u201ctechnical flaw\u201d after several years of lawful application of the collective agreement without any dispute. The applicants therefore could not be unaware that the authorities would not let that \u201ctechnical flaw\u201d endanger the budget of the social-security schemes. The Government also considered that the State, which occupied a special place in relation to the dispute, had not had recourse to legalisation in consideration of the party concerned (intuitu personae) as the Greek State had been accused of doing in the Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis case (see the judgment cited above). The applicants were not employees of the State but were employees, subject to private law, of the local social-security offices, which were private-law entities that enjoyed financial autonomy. That explained why the ordinary courts and not the administrative courts had jurisdiction. The State had been a party to the proceedings only very indirectly, in its capacity as \u201cguardian\u201d of the socialsecurity offices and in the general interest of the social-security schemes. Thirdly and lastly, the Government considered that the scope of the legalisation had been as limited as possible. Contrary to what had been the position in the Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis case (see the judgment cited above), the purpose of the Act had not been to ensure that pending proceedings failed, as the legislature had excluded from its scope court decisions that had become final on the merits.",

The outcome of the litigation was therefore much more uncertain than in the earlier cases considered by the European Court of Human Rights. The Government pointed out that the retrospective application of a new statute to pending proceedings was compatible with the Convention, provided that there had still not been a decision against which it was no longer possible to bring an ordinary appeal. In the instant case Mr Zielinski and Mr Pradal had indeed obtained such a judgment from the Metz Court of Appeal by the time that the new statute was applied to the case.

The court decision obtained by those applicants was therefore neither enforceable nor final on the merits. It would not have been possible to pass legalising legislation excluding all pending proceedings regardless of the stage that they had reached; that would have removed the Act\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre and would have led to discrimination between those who had applied to the courts and those who had not, who would have found that the legalising Act was raised against them. The Government noted that the legalisation had had no disproportionate effect on the position of those applicants, because while the Colmar Court of Appeal was bound by the provisions of the Act, it was not to be forgotten that the same court had already ruled on the dispute in terms identical with those of the legalising Act in judgments of 23 September 1993 (see paragraph 20 above).",

The Court notes that a majority of earlier decisions by the tribunals of fact had been favourable to the applicants. Admittedly, whereas the Metz Court of Appeal had found wholly in favour of the employees of the social-security offices concerned (see paragraphs 16 and 35 above), the Colmar Court of Appeal, unlike the Colmar industrial tribunal, had dismissed the claims (see paragraphs 20, 38 and 41 above). However, the special role of the Besan\u00e7on Court of Appeal, the court which had to rehear the cases after the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgments of 22 April 1992 (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above), must be emphasised. The Besan\u00e7on Court of Appeal had been designated to resolve the dispute, notably the issues of \u201cfact\u201d, within the legal framework previously laid down by the Court of Cassation itself (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above). Keeping strictly within the compass of the issues as laid down in the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgments of 22 April 1992, it found that no practice had arisen and rejected the method contended for by the State. It set a new reference index and, allowing a claim in the alternative by certain employees of the socialsecurity offices concerned, held that the IDP had to be calculated on the basis of 6.1055% of the minimum wage, this being the percentage corresponding to the amount of the IDP as calculated on the basis of twelve points at 1 January 1953. Such a decision, which clarified the issues while remaining within the limits laid down by the Court of Cassation on 22 April 1992, was favourable to the applicants, since it had the effect of more than doubling the amount of the allowance actually paid by the social-security offices and conferred a right to back payment of the difference on allowances paid over several years (see paragraphs 21-22 above).",

Apart from the potential variety and importance of the forms of oversight, including those affecting collective agreements laying down rules and regulations governing different categories of staff (see paragraph 44 above), the Court notes that the prefect \u2013 the State\u2019s representative in the d\u00e9partement or region \u2013 or the Regional Department of Health and Social Affairs, an external department of the supervising ministry, systematically intervened as parties to the trial in the proceedings between the applicants and the bodies that employed them. At all events, the French system, with its bodies that manage a public service and have special governmental powers and are subject to ministerial supervisory authorities, is an illustration of the special role and the duties of the member States of the Council of Europe \u2013 as may result from the European Social Charter \u2013 in relation to the social welfare of their peoples.

The Court therefore confirms all its decisions in earlier cases, in which initially the principle was laid down that the legislature must not interfere with the administration of justice (Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v. Greece judgment of 9\u00a0December 1994, Series A no. 301-B, and Papageorgiou v. Greece judgment of 22 October 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VI), and then the idea introduced that such interference could, however, be justified on compelling grounds of the general interest (judgment of 23\u00a0October 1997 in the National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom case, Reports 1997-VII), grounds which are assessed by the Court against the background and in the circumstances of each case and which may, exceptionally, be held by it to be more legitimate than the rights relied on by certain individuals or, at any rate, held to prevail over them.",

The financial considerations relating to the substantial costs to the social-security bodies of the ruling given by any particular court should not, in my view, be regarded as having been decisive in the legislature\u2019s intervention in this instance.",

The European Court therefore cannot accept too lightly, on the sole ground of rationality and of an abstract application of the idea of justice, that such conflicts constitute a compelling ground of the general interest which justifies the intervention of the legislature.",

                        "content": "The present case in fact appears to be such an instance at first blush. In 1988, staff members of the local social-security offices of Alsace-Moselle challenged before several industrial tribunals the method whereby the offices had, for nearly fifteen years, calculated the amount of a special allowance introduced by an agreement of 1953. In April 1992 the Court of Cassation quashed judgments of the Metz Court of Appeal relating to some of these cases, held that the 1953 agreement could no longer apply in its original terms and ordered that the cases should be reheard by a tribunal of fact in order that it might be determined whether a practice had been established (on account of the application of a given method of calculation by the social-security offices over many years) or, in the absence of such a practice, in order that the method of calculating the allowance should be determined. In September 1993, however, the Colmar Court of Appeal held that a practice had been established for paying the allowance by the method adopted by the social-security offices, while in October the Besan\u00e7on Court of Appeal held, on the contrary, that no practice had been established and laid down a new method of calculation \u2013 in other words, two unappealable but contradictory assessments of one and the same question of fact, namely whether a practice existed. At that stage, there is no doubt that an unjustifiable inequality of position arose between staff members of the local social-security offices of Alsace-Moselle in respect of the calculation of the allowance in question, according as they came, as litigants, within the jurisdiction of the Colmar Court of Appeal or within that of the Metz Court of Appeal. Besides, how could the social-security offices in practice have applied these irreconcilable decisions to their staff?",

That would have been so, in my view, if the legislature alone had been in a position to remedy the contradictions between the judgments. But in fact the interested parties could still have applied to the Court of Cassation, relying precisely on the conflict of judgments. A judicial resolution of the difficulty, which would have remedied the denial of justice, was therefore possible. It was ultimately for that reason that the conflict between decisions given in autumn 1993 by the Colmar and Metz courts of appeal did not amount to a compelling ground of the general interest justifying the legislature\u2019s intervention, it being remembered that, regardless of the resulting confusion, that conflict did not in itself cause any financial difficulties for the social-security bodies.",
