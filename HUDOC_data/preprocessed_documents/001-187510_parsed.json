The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, for example, Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, \u00a7 15, ECHR 2002-VIII). The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his Convention grievances. To be effective, a remedy must be capable of directly resolving the impugned state of affairs (see Balogh v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 47940/99, \u00a7 30, 20 July 2004). The Court notes that the application of this rule must make due allowance for the context of the individual case including, among other things, the personal circumstances of the applicant. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66 and 69, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011IV).",

Cyprus [GC], \u00a7 118; Piersack v. Belgium, \u00a7 30; and Grieves v. the United Kingdom [GC], \u00a7 69). The Court recalls that there is no watertight division between the two notions since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test) (Korzeniak v. Poland, no. 56134/08, \u00a7 49, 10 January 2017; and Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2005XIII).",

The personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (see Hauschildt v. Denmark, 24\u00a0May\u00a01989, \u00a7 47, Series A no. 154). As regards the type of proof required, the Court has, for example, sought to ascertain whether a judge has displayed hostility or ill will for personal reasons (see De Cubber v.\u00a0Belgium, 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 25, Series A no. 86).",

Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge\u2019s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports 1996-III).",

In the case at hand, the Court, having addressed the first function, dispenses itself from discharging the second. In doing so, the Court fails to bear in mind that just satisfaction goes beyond mere compensation and also holds a broader function, which is both preventive and instructive. The award of just satisfaction, besides reinstating the victim in his fundamental right, serves as a concrete warning to governments. It creates a financial incentive for the respondent State to change its practice and to prevent circumstances similar to those that led to a violation from arising again.",
