He had also communicated with the prison psychologist. The courts evaluated those factors positively. That being so, on the basis of the applicant\u2019s character reports which Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison administration had drawn up for the purpose of possible transfer, the courts observed that in 2003 and 2008 he had received disciplinary punishments and had been placed for ten and fifteen days in a punishment cell, having been found in possession of a mobile phone, which was forbidden under the prison regulations. Although from 2003 until 2008 the applicant had received positive assessments and his behaviour was not conflictual, it was only in 2009, one month before he had asked the prison administration to intervene on his behalf so that he could be transferred to a correctional home, that he had fully admitted his guilt for the crimes committed. Even in his character report for 2008 the applicant was described as having no remorse about the crimes he had committed and had not made any serious resolutions. That led the courts to doubt the sincerity of his repentance. Moreover, as was apparent from his file, he had also committed a number of other small violations of the prison rules for which he had received a warning from Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison authorities without any disciplinary sanctions. It was also relevant that until March 2011 the applicant had remained on a list of persons likely to attempt to escape (linkusi\u0173 pab\u0117gti asmen\u0173 \u012fskaita). Lastly, it was also pertinent that throughout his imprisonment the prison administration had assessed the applicant\u2019s behaviour only as \u201csatisfactory\u201d (patenkinamai); he had not been assessed positively (teigiamai) until 2011. The courts thus held that it was not yet possible to conclude that the applicant had really changed and that therefore it was safe to make the conditions of serving his sentence less strict by transferring him to a correctional home. Only after further observation of the applicant\u2019s behaviour would it be possible to reliably state that his personality changes were long term.",

The court held that while the prisoner had fulfilled the measures described in his individual social rehabilitation plan, he had also committed two violations of the internal prison rules, and his behaviour had not improved until 2013. According to reports by the prison psychologist and a social behaviour report, he did not always act in a responsible manner. The prisoner\u2019s way of thinking, his close links with other criminals, financial difficulties (he had not fully paid the civil claim against him), showed that there remained a likelihood that he would reoffend. The court also emphasised that the Parole Commission\u2019s conclusions to the same effect had been based on written evidence in J.B.\u2019s file and reports by competent specialists, all of which had been established in accordance with the methodology provided for by the relevant legislation. For the court, given that J.B.\u2019s behaviour in prison had not been beyond reproach, it was not reasonable to expect that he would behave without fault if released on parole.

The CPT called upon the 47 Council of Europe member States to review their treatment of life-sentenced prisoners according to the individual risk they present, and to provide for their possible reintegration into society at some stage. The CPT underlined that although the majority of countries imposing life sentences require that a minimum period of between 20 and 30 years be served before a prisoner may benefit from conditional release, a number of others\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including Bulgaria, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands and, for certain crimes, Hungary, the Slovak Republic and Turkey\u00a0\u2013\u00a0do not have a system of conditional release for life-sentenced prisoners. As a result, some prisoners may never be released (except on compassionate grounds or by pardon). The detention regime should keep life-sentenced prisoners in contact with the outside world, offer them the possibility of release into the community under licence and ensure that at some stage their release can be safely granted, at least in most cases. To this end, these prisoners should be given a precise date for the first review for possible release, based on an individual plan defined at the outset of the sentence, and reviewed regularly. The CPT also noted that the conditions under which life-sentenced prisoners were held varied significantly from one country to another, and often even from one establishment to another. In many countries, life-sentenced prisoners were held together with other prisoners and benefited from the same rights in terms of work, education, recreational activities, and contact with the outside world. However, in a number of countries including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Latvia, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, life-sentenced prisoners were as a rule kept separate from other prisoners.",

This is known as an \u201cactual or whole life sentence\u201d. The CPT has criticised the very principle of such sentences in several visit reports, expressing serious reservations regarding the fact that a person sentenced to life imprisonment is considered once and for all to be dangerous and is deprived of any hope of conditional release (except on compassionate grounds or by pardon). The Committee maintains that to incarcerate a person for life without any real prospect of release is, in its view, inhuman. It is also noteworthy that even persons who are convicted by the International Criminal Court (or special international tribunals) of the most serious crimes such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity may in principle benefit at a certain stage from conditional (early) release. Indeed, the CPT considers that a prison sentence which offers no possibility of release precludes one of the essential justifications of imprisonment itself, the possibility of rehabilitation. While punishment and public protection are important elements of a prison sentence, excluding from the outset any hope of rehabilitation and return to the community effectively dehumanises the prisoner. This is not to say that all life-sentenced prisoners should be released sooner or later; public protection is a crucial issue. However, all such sentences should be subject to a meaningful review at some stage, based on individualised sentenceplanning objectives defined at the outset of the sentence, and reviewed regularly thereafter. This would provide not only hope for the prisoner, but also a target to aim for which should motivate positive behaviour. It would thus also assist prison administrations in dealing with individuals who would otherwise have no hope and nothing to lose. The European Court of Human Rights has in recent years examined a number of cases where domestic courts had imposed life sentences on prisoners with no possibility for early or conditional release and where, barring compassionate or highly exceptional circumstances, a whole life sentence meant precisely that. The most authoritative judgment of the Court to date, delivered by the Grand Chamber in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom states that it was incompatible with human dignity, and therefore contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, for a state to deprive a person of their freedom without at least giving them a chance one day to regain that freedom. Three main consequences can be drawn from the existing case-law of the Court. The legislation of member states must henceforth provide for a time during the serving of the sentence when there will be a possibility to review that sentence. Furthermore, member states must establish a procedure whereby the sentence will be reviewed. Finally, detention in prison must be organised in such a way as to enable life-sentenced prisoners to progress towards their rehabilitation.",

One of the general principles set out in that recommendation is the non-segregation principle, according to which life-sentenced prisoners should not be segregated on the sole ground of their sentence. This principle should be read in conjunction with the security and safety principle, which calls for a careful assessment of whether prisoners pose a risk of harm to themselves, to other prisoners, to those working in the prison or to the external community. The assumption is often wrongly made that the fact of a life-sentence implies a prisoner is dangerous. In this context, the explanatory report to the Recommendation (2003) 23 notes that \u2018as a general rule, the experience of many prison administrations is that many such prisoners present no risk to themselves or to others\u2019 and that \u2018they exhibit stable and reliable behaviour\u2019.

Furthermore, when a plea was rejected, a decision by the President of the Republic could not be appealed against to any court. In addition, no reasons for rejection were provided that would enable the prisoner to understand in which area and how he should seek to improve. For example, the pardon plea submitted by the second applicant, J.\u00a0Maksimavi\u010dius, was considered on 12\u00a0October 2012. Despite a positive character assessment in 2011 and 2012 by Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison administration (see paragraph 19 above), the plea was denied. Notwithstanding the criteria listed in the Pardon Commission regulations and information provided by Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison administration about his character, the applicant still remained with an open question as to what else he must do, and how and in what manner he should seek to improve in order to demonstrate that he posed no danger to society and was ready to be re-integrated. That knowledge was crucial if in practice the objective of his prison sentence was not to oblige him to spend the rest of his life in prison and to die there, but essentially to reform and be rehabilitated. The applicant K.\u00a0Matio\u0161aitis also stated that life prisoners were not shown (n\u0117ra supa\u017eindinami) their character assessments. In his letter of 29 September 2015 to the Court, the applicant V.\u00a0Beleckas even asserted that during seventeen years of his sentence he had never seen either his character assessment or other documents sent to the court for the purpose of his transfer to Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s or to the Pardon Commission. Once a pardon plea is rejected, the life prisoner is merely asked to sign the prison journal confirming that he had been informed of the fact.

Even though the seven amnesties declared thus far had not included life prisoners, Lithuanian law did not contain any limitations on including such persons in the amnesty act. Secondly, a life prisoner could be dispensed from serving the remainder of his sentence if he contracted a terminal illness. Thirdly, following the entry into force of the new Criminal Code, a life prisoner could ask the court to reclassify his crime and to commute his sentence. On that point, the Government relied on the examples of I.A. and R.V. (see paragraphs 87-92 above). Fourthly, it was true that because of the \u201cextreme sensitivity of the issue\u201d, the Committee for the Supervision of the Criminal Code had recently arrived at the conclusion that at this stage there was no need to amend the legislation to include release on parole for life prisoners, although they had not dismissed the possibility of legislative developments in that regard in the future.

The decrees on presidential pardon, both at the time when the Convention came into force in respect of Lithuania, and in subsequent amendments, included the main aspects relevant for the consideration of pardon pleas: the nature of the crime committed, the term of the sentence that had already been served, and the behaviour as well as the personality of the convict.

Despite having been convicted of aggravated murder, he had subsequently received a presidential pardon (see paragraph 85 above). Until presidential pardon was granted to J.B. in 2012, only five pleas had been submitted by life prisoners. Following J.B.\u2019s pardon, a certain activity among life prisoners could be observed. It might also have been influenced by the mitigation of the conditions, given that in 2011 the term that had to be served before a life prisoner could apply for presidential pardon was reduced from twenty years to ten years. By 15\u00a0September 2015, thirty-five life prisoners submitted pardon pleas (twenty of whom had submitted their pleas more than once). That notwithstanding, the fact that a relatively small number of life prisoners had been granted pardon should not be considered sufficient to prove that the penalty was irreducible de facto (the Government referred to Iorgov v.\u00a0Bulgaria (no. 2), no. 36295/02, \u00a7 57, 2\u00a0September 2010).

Although alleged unconstitutionality underpinned their complaints, those courts either did not consider it necessary to refer the matter to the Constitutional Court of their own motion, or denied such explicit requests by life prisoners altogether (see paragraphs 14, 44 and 93-97 above). It can likewise be noted that life prisoner R.P. also relied on the Committee of Ministers\u2019 Recommendation Rec(2003)22 on conditional release (parole) of 24\u00a0September 2003, paragraph\u00a04.a of which clearly indicates that the law should make conditional release available to all sentenced prisoners, including lifesentenced prisoners (the Recommendation is summarised at length in Kafkaris v. Cyprus ([GC], no. 21906/04, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2008). Furthermore, and contrary to what has been suggested by the Government (see paragraph\u00a0142 above), the Court also considers that the life prisoners\u2019 complaints about being discriminated against as well as about being de facto condemned to death in prison do not appear to be an actio popularis (see paragraph 94 above). Indeed, those requests concerned the very situation they were in. The complaint by life prisoner R.P. was lodged with the criminal courts with a view to annulling the prison authorities\u2019 concrete refusal to perform a particular action \u2013 to collect materials for R.P.\u2019s parole request (see paragraphs 95 above).",

The criteria applicable to pardon pleas have remained identical throughout its operation, with the exception of the term which a life prisoner must have served before he can submit a pardon plea, which was extended in 2003 from ten to twenty years. In 2011, that term was reduced by a presidential decree to ten years (see paragraphs 75 and\u00a076 above). That notwithstanding, even a term of twenty years after the imposition of a sentence is shorter than the maximum indicative term of twenty-five years which the Court has found to be acceptable (see Vinter and Others, \u00a7 120, and Murray, cited above, \u00a7 99).",

The authorities have a general duty to collect the following information about the prisoner and enclose it with the pardon request: the court decisions convicting the prisoner; a detailed assessment (i\u0161sami charakteristika) of the prisoner\u2019s behaviour, including a recommendation by the prison administration. As of 2003, a new criterion has been added: whether the prisoner has compensated for the pecuniary damage caused by the crime he committed (see paragraph\u00a075 above). That being so, the Court finds that there is nothing ambiguous or misleading in those rules such as to make the applicants\u2019 situation uncertain as to the factors that guide the President in the exercise of his or her power of pardon. The above list can be seen as a set of criteria allowing the President to assess whether a life prisoner\u2019s continued imprisonment is justified on legitimate penological grounds. The Court cannot criticise the non-exhaustive nature of the list, for it permits the President to evaluate any other relevant factors, which may be to a life prisoner\u2019s benefit. Lastly, the President is advised by the Pardon Commission, including persons that represent the interests of justice, those of prisoners\u2019 and the crime victims, in order to give a fair recommendation to the President (see paragraph 77 above).",

Under Lithuanian law, however, neither the Pardon Commission nor the President of the Republic is bound to give reasons why a life prisoner\u2019s pardon plea has been refused (compare and contrast Hutchinson, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051). Furthermore, and notwithstanding certain hypothetical arguments to the opposite by the Government (see paragraph 141 above), the Court considers it clear that because of the principle of the separation of powers the President\u2019s pardon decrees are not subject to judicial review (compare and contrast Hutchinson, cited above, \u00a7\u00a052). Above all, they cannot be challenged by the prisoners directly (see paragraphs 107-109 above).

To increase the transparency of the pardon procedure, the Commission also publishes comprehensive activity reports where it summarises reasons for its recommendations in individual cases to the authority exercising the power of pardon, as well as relevant statistical information (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 91-107; also see Hutchinson, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061). In contrast, no such information is made public in Lithuania, except for the general outline of the criteria relevant for the examination of pardon pleas (see paragraph 78 above), to demonstrate how, if at all, those criteria are practically applied by the President of the Republic. The Court lastly notes that although the latter takes a decision only after the Pardon Commission has provided its recommendations, those recommendations are not legally binding on the President (see paragraphs\u00a078 and 141 above).",

Although the Court is ready to concede that the aforementioned statement shows the strict stance of the President, who took office in 2009, towards those convicted of the most heinous crimes, it cannot fail to observe that that phrase has been taken out of context. The President\u2019s policy statement equally stipulates that \u201ceven persons on whom a life sentence has been imposed may appeal for pardon\u201d (see paragraph 79 above). More important for the Court is to note that there is an example of one person in the applicants\u2019 situation who has already benefited from the President\u2019s discretionary power: in May 2012 the incumbent President granted life prisoner J.B.\u2019s plea by commuting his sentence to a fixed term of twenty-five years (see paragraph 85 above). The Court must note, however, that four years have passed since J.B.\u2019s pardon, without one single other life prisoner having been fully or partially pardoned. The Court has already held that in assessing whether the life sentence is reducible de facto it may be of relevance to take account of statistical information on prior use of the review mechanism in question, including the number of persons having been granted a pardon (see Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0100, with further references). According to the statistical information provided by the Government, only one out of thirty-five life prisoners who have asked for pardon has received a positive response, whereas in general about one out of five of all pardon pleas are granted (see paragraphs 138 and 139 above). Accordingly, and although the Court is careful not to hold that the President of the Republic should periodically pardon life prisoners, it attaches a certain weight to the applicant\u2019s argument that J.B.\u2019s pardon was an isolated exception.",

To the extent necessary for the prisoner to know what he or she must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, it may be required that reasons be provided (see Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0100). The Court further observes the CPT\u2019s view to the effect that discretionary release from imprisonment, as with its imposition, was a matter for the courts and not the executive, a view which had led to proposed changes in the procedures for reviewing life imprisonment in Denmark, Finland and Sweden (see Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061).

The Court does not dispute this argument. It is ready to accept that during court proceedings for transfer a life prisoner is provided with sufficient procedural guarantees to make his case to prove his repentance and capacity to change (see paragraph 28 above). Even so, a life prisoner\u2019s transfer to Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Institution changes nothing as concerns the length of his sentence, which remains for life, without raising his hope of being released from prison (see paragraph 53 above). The Court also observes that in 2013 two of the applicants, V.\u00a0Beleckas and R.\u00a0Lenkaitis, used their right to apply for President\u2019s pardon, albeit without success (see paragraphs 30 and 37 above). Both of them later asked to be transferred to a correctional home, and the Vilnius Regional Court granted their requests, having concluded that these applicants had indeed repented (see paragraphs 32 and 38 above). At this juncture the Court also notes that the Vilnius Regional Court, on the one hand, and the Pardon Commission and/or the President of the Republic, on the other, came to opposite conclusions as to those applicants\u2019 capacity to distance themselves from their criminal past, whilst it was only the court which made its reasoning transparent and thus available to these applicants. In this connection the Court underlines that regard must be had to the need to encourage the rehabilitation of offenders (see James, Wells and Lee v. the United Kingdom, nos. 25119/09, 57715/09 and 57877/09, \u00a7 218, 18\u00a0September 2012; Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102), and that \u201c... a whole-life prisoner is entitled to know ... what he or she must do to be considered for release and under what conditions\u201d (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0122). The Court also observes that the principle of rehabilitation, that is, the reintegration into society of a convicted person, is reflected in international norms (see paragraph 112 above) and has not only been recognised but has over time also gained increasing importance in the Court\u2019s case-law under various provisions of the Convention (see Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102).",

In this connection the Court also observes that even in the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Home life prisoners are held segregated, and separately from other prisoners (see paragraph 104 above; also see point 74 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 115 above). Accordingly, and even assuming that the President\u2019s reasoning to grant a pardon plea could coincide with the court\u2019s reasoning to permit a life prisoner\u2019s transfer to Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s on account of that prisoner\u2019s reformed personality, which is not always the case (see the preceding paragraph), a life prisoner who chooses to repent in Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison is left with a conundrum as to what he or she must do to prove to the President his or her rehabilitation.",

The Court has already held that while Article 3 cannot be construed as imposing on the authorities an absolute duty to provide prisoners with rehabilitation or reintegration programmes and activities, such as courses or counselling, it does require the authorities to give life prisoners a chance, however remote, to some day regain their freedom. The regime and conditions therefore need to be such as to make it possible for the life prisoner to endeavour to reform himself, with a view to being able one day to seek an adjustment of his or her sentence (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0264-265; also see Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0104).",

Contrary to what has been claimed by the applicants, there is nothing in the file to suggest that the aim of those programmes is to get life prisoners used to spending their entire lives in prison, rather than their social rehabilitation for successful correction and transformation of their personality. Indeed, as the internal prison rules state, the programme of social rehabilitation starts immediately when a convict enters the prison and is aimed at his social rehabilitation with a view to eventual reintegration in society after having served the sentence (see paragraph 101 above). In 2012 the CPT also noted that a certain number of positive measures had been taken to expand the programme of life prisoners\u2019 activities, and that material conditions in the unit for life-sentenced prisoners remained unchanged since the CPT\u2019s visit in 2008 and were acceptable (see points 57 and 58 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 118 above).",

In particular, to this day the vast majority of life-sentenced prisoners still spend 22\u00bd hours in their cells as they are not enrolled in work activities or education, the latter being confined to teachers handing out exercises at the cell doors at very spaced-out intervals (see point 72 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 116 above; point 51 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 117 above; point 58 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 118 above). To make matters worse, life prisoners had always been left to languish in Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison in \u2018small group isolation\u2019, without being able to associate with other prisoners or even with other life prisoners from other cells (see point 74 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph\u00a0116 above, and point 51 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph\u00a0117 above). As noted by the CPT after its visit of 2004, several of the life prisoners claimed to be seriously affected by lack of human contact with other inmates and prison staff, and since 2000 four of them had committed suicide (see point 74 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 116 above). This clearly runs against the CPT\u2019s constant criticism of \u2018totally unjustified\u2019 systematic segregation (see point 74 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph\u00a0115 above; point 74 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph\u00a0116 above; points 51 and 52 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph\u00a0117 above; points 58 and 59 of the CPT report cited in paragraph 118 above). As the Court has already noted, life prisoners remain segregated even upon their transfer to Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Institution, once a court has already confirmed that they have at least partially reformed (see paragraph\u00a0104 above). In addition, although as early as in 2006 the CPT urged the Lithuanian authorities to \u2018fundamentally revise\u2019 the life prisoners\u2019 regime which could lead to life prisoners\u2019 \u2018personal degeneration\u2019 (see point 74 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 116 above), nothing of substance has improved in their situation, except for possibilities of obtaining vocational education in prison, open only as of September 2015 (see paragraph 106 above), as well as the very recently established possibility to have more frequent short-term visits (see paragraph 105 above). Although the CPT had advocated extending the possibilities to have long-term visits to all prisoners, including those serving life sentences, they do not have such a possibility (see point 75 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 116 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the deleterious effects of such life prisoners\u2019 regime must have seriously weakened the possibility of the applicants reforming and thus entertaining a real hope that they might one day achieve and demonstrate their progress and obtain a reduction of their sentence.",

This is particularly so for those convicted of murder or other serious offences against the person (see Vinter and Others, \u00a7\u00a0108; also see Murray, \u00a7 111, both cited above).

That being so, the Court nevertheless considers that in order to guarantee proper consideration of the changes and the progress towards rehabilitation made by life prisoner, however significant they might be, the review should entail either the executive giving reasons or judicial review, so that even the appearance of arbitrariness is avoided. The Court has also stated that to the extent necessary for the prisoner to know what he or she must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, it may be required that reasons be provided, and this should be safeguarded by access to judicial review (see Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0100). The Court has already established that presidential pardon in Lithuania de facto does not allow a life prisoner to know what he or she must do to be considered for release and under what conditions. It has also noted the absence of judicial review which could lead to full or partial commutation of a life sentence. Accordingly, the Court finds that, at the present time, the applicants\u2019 life sentences cannot be regarded as reducible for the purposes of Article 3 of the Convention (see L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058). Last but not least, it transpires that no reform will take place in Lithuania until the Court has resolved this case (see paragraphs 60 and 98 above).",

Until September\u00a02015, a profession could not be taught in Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison (see paragraphs\u00a0104 and 106 above). The Court however is ready to accept that that legal framework was established and functioned with sufficient clarity (see, by converse implication, Velyo Velev, cited above, \u00a7 36).

He was allowed to enrol and attend courses in computer literacy and English, and took part in other purposeful activities in prison, such as the \u201cknitting group\u201d (see paragraph 12 above). Accordingly, it may not be stated that that applicant was deprived of any meaningful education which would be relevant for his reform. Furthermore, even acknowledging that in September 2015 the legislative prohibition on having vocational training available in prison was abolished, this does not change the first applicant\u2019s situation so much as to attract the State\u2019s responsibility, for it was only in August 2014 that he had asked to obtain vocational training in Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison (see paragraph 15 above). Neither has the first applicant demonstrated having submitted any further vocational training requests to Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison authorities after the legislative ban was lifted. In this context the Court also does not lose sight of the fact that from 2007 the applicant worked in Luki\u0161k\u0117s Prison, but in 2009 he refused to continue working because he did not want to work with prisoners he considered as belonging to a lower caste (see paragraph 12 above). The Court finds that such a reason by this applicant is unacceptable, as it was based on him paying heed to the criminal sub-culture within the prison system, which the Court cannot condone. It also considers that such a reason by the first applicant clearly shows his lack of genuine interest in working with others. This leads the Court to seriously doubt the first applicant\u2019s argument that the opportunity to follow vocational training was of essential importance for him.",

The review mechanism must be formulated in a manner which mandates that the assessor, whether it be an executive or a judicial organ, examines after a certain period of time whether legitimate penological grounds justify continued imprisonment (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 119-20).

Firstly, the Court explained that, although the system of review does not necessarily have to be judicial in nature, it has to guarantee the independence and impartiality of the assessor, as well as certain procedural safeguards, and provide protections against arbitrariness. Secondly, the review mechanism must impose a duty on the authority to consider whether legitimate penological grounds justify continued imprisonment, and must not leave the decision fully to that authority\u2019s discretion. Thirdly, and in line with the Court\u2019s findings in Murray (see paragraph 2 above), there needs to be a degree of specificity or precision as to the criteria and conditions attaching to sentence review, in keeping with the requirements of legal certainty. Lastly, to the extent necessary for the prisoner to know what he or she must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, it may also be required that reasons be provided, and this requirement should be safeguarded by access to judicial review (see Murray, cited above, \u00a7 100).",

Hungary (no. 73593/10, 20 May 2014), the Court found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on the basis that the Hungarian presidential pardon system did not conform to the requirements of postconviction Vinter review for three reasons. Firstly, domestic law did not impose any obligation on the President to perform a Vinter-type review of the sentence. Secondly, although there was a duty to collect certain information about the prisoner, no criteria had been published in that regard. Thirdly, domestic law did not impose a duty on the Minister of Justice or the President to give reasons.",

Bulgaria (nos. 15018/11 and 61199/12, ECHR 2014 (extracts)), the Court examined the Bulgarian presidential clemency system under Article 3 of the Convention. In so far as the complaint concerned the period between 2004 and 2012, the Court found firstly that it was not clear whether domestic law provided de jure for the reducibility of life sentences. Secondly, the life sentence was not de facto reducible as the applicant in question could not have known that a mechanism existed that would actually permit him to be considered for release. The Court noted, however, that in 2012 the incumbent President had set up a Clemency Commission. The rules governing the work of the Commission provided that in its work it had to take account of the relevant case-law of international courts and other bodies on the interpretation and application of the international human rights instruments in force in respect of Bulgaria. The Commission had published the criteria that would guide it in the examination of clemency requests, as well as the reasons for its recommendations to exercise the power of clemency in individual cases. Also, the Court considered it important that the Constitutional Court had in April 2012 given a binding interpretation of the Constitution that defined the scope of the power of clemency and held that it should be exercised in a non-arbitrary way, taking into account equity, humanity, compassion, mercy and the health and family situation of the convicted offender, and any positive changes in his or her personality. The Constitutional Court had gone on to say that while the President or the Vice-President could not be required to give reasons in individual cases, they were expected to make known the general criteria guiding them in the exercise of the power of clemency. Lastly, the Constitutional Court had held that a clemency decree was open to legal challenge before it, albeit subject to some restrictive conditions, in particular relating to standing. That ruling of the Constitutional Court had thus provided weighty guarantees that the presidential power of clemency would be exercised in a consistent and broadly predictable way. The Court concluded that if the President\u2019s power of clemency was exercised in line with the practices adopted by the Clemency Commission and the precepts laid down by the Constitutional Court, the whole-life sentences could be regarded as de facto reducible.",

One of the elements of this development, albeit not yet an outstanding one (at least to the outside observer), is the slow but steady and purposeful movement from the admission \u2013 as in Vinter and Others (cited above, \u00a7 120), which is, to a much greater extent than the post-Vinter case-law, permeated with the spirit of the then still recent judgment in Kafkaris (cited above) \u2013 that the review of life prison sentences \u201cshould entail either the executive giving reasons or judicial review, so that even the appearance of arbitrariness is avoided\u201d (see paragraph 181 of the judgment, emphasis added) to the effective rejection, whenever possible, of the \u201cexecutive alternative\u201d. This is so despite repeated verbal assurances that the \u201cexecutive alternative\u201d is not impossible, at least in theory. If one looks more attentively at what arguments, employed in earlier cases pertaining to life imprisonment, are selected for recapitulation in later cases or at how the emphasis at times shifts from some arguments to others (even without any of them being rephrased), or at how prominence is given to certain provisions of hard or even soft law that are \u201cexternal\u201d to the Convention (see, for instance, paragraph 174 of the judgment), one could perhaps predict that sooner or later this movement will arrive at its logical destination. As to when, at last, this will take place, is a matter for the prophets. It is also true that today this logical destination has not yet been reached. For instance, in Hutchinson (cited above) the \u201cexecutive alternative\u201d was not dismissed, in particular owing to the fact that in the British system the executive does provide reasons for not commuting life prison sentences; moreover, these reasons are amenable to judicial review. Be that as it may, one cannot but observe how far the caselaw has moved away from Kafkaris (cited above).",

As a former constitutional judge, I am tempted to observe that such a practice of abstention would, to put it mildly, give rise to doubts as to its compatibility with the Lithuanian Constitution, under which \u201c[t]he President of the Republic, implementing the powers vested in him, shall issue actsdecrees\u201d (Article 85, emphasis added), but such considerations would be beyond the scope of the instant case. On the other hand, the introduction into the Lithuanian legal system of periodic judicial review of life prison sentences does not appear to be an insurmountable task, albeit one which, for some reasons (to which I shall briefly come back later), the authorities have not yet undertaken. Moreover, introduction of the said judicial review would not require any change to the national Constitution or any fundamental alteration of the institution of presidential pardon, the essence of which, so far, has been clemency or grace. Most importantly, such introduction would be in conformity with the law of the Convention as it stands now and even as it will become \u2013 if not in theory (the soothing mantra about the possibility of the \u201cexecutive alternative\u201d will continue to be repeated), then almost inevitably in practice \u2013 in the (perhaps foreseeable) future.",

So much against that it could not be comforted by the reminder, as in \u00d6calan v.\u00a0Turkey (no. 2) (cited above, \u00a7 207), that the \u201cfinding of a violation [of Article 3] cannot be understood as giving the applicant the prospect of imminent release\u201d and that the \u201cnational authorities must review, under a procedure to be established by adopting legislative instruments and in line with the principles laid down by the Court in paragraphs 111113 of its Grand Chamber judgment in the case of Vinter and Others ..., whether the applicant\u2019s continued incarceration is still justified after a minimum term of detention, either because the requirements of punishment and deterrence have not yet been entirely fulfilled or because the applicant\u2019s continued detention is justified by reason of his dangerousness\u201d?",

Begin by erasing the criminal sub-culture from your personality by not regarding other people as belonging to lower castes. Fully admit your guilt for the crimes committed. Feel remorse for you have done. Make serious resolutions about it. Do not commit disciplinary violations. Do not hide prohibited objects in your cell, especially knives or sharpened pieces of tin. Do not consume alcohol in prison \u2013 it is illegal. Do not behave in such a way that the authorities have reasonable grounds to believe that you will attempt to escape. And, of course, do not use physical violence against anyone. Trying to kill someone is also a no-no. Is it \u201ccapricious\u201d to expect that persons spending their life behind bars ought to know this?",

This, however, does not mean that the review of his sentence, albeit by way of presidential pardon, could not take place earlier (and, indeed, he could plead for presidential pardon after serving ten years of his sentence, as provided for by the domestic legislation). It is not clear, however, why his pleas for pardon were rejected in 2012 and 2014 (see paragraph 20 of the judgment). This applicant claims that his plea was rejected despite a positive character assessment, and that he was left with an \u201copen question as to what else he must do, and how and in what manner he should seek to improve in order to demonstrate that he posed no danger to society and was ready to be reintegrated\u201d (see paragraph 130 of the judgment, emphasis added). This is rather convincing, even very convincing (at least, if the eternal philosophical question as to the goals of punishment is set aside).
