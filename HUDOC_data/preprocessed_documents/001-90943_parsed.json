CH/03/10999 of 9 May 2007 and decision no. AP 158/06 of 18 October 2007). While the Constitutional Court awarded compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the amount of approximately 300 euros in one case (decision no. CH/03/10999), it rejected a similar request in the other case (decision no. AP 158/06). The Government claimed that those decisions had been enforced on 31 August 2007 and 14 March 2008 respectively. Given the developments in the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law, the Government submitted that an appeal to that court should now be considered an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in respect of the non-enforcement of judgments ordering the release of \u201cold\u201d foreign-currency savings.
