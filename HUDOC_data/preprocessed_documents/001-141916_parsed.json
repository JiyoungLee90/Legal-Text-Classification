The court held that in 1995 and 1996 a number of sets of criminal proceedings had been opened against individuals who had been engaged in similar activities to those of the applicant. The court assumed that the applicant had certainly known that he was being tried, because that type of trial had received extensive media coverage and had become notorious in the country; in addition, the applicant declared that he had been in contact with Bulgarian officials in Georgia.

The Convention leaves Contracting States wide discretion as regards the choice of the means calculated to ensure that their legal systems are in compliance with the requirements of Article 6.

In particular, the procedural means offered by domestic law and practice must be shown to be effective where a person charged with a criminal offence has neither waived his right to appear and to defend himself nor sought to escape trial (see Somogyi v.

The Court reiterates in this respect that neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 of the Convention prevents a person from waiving of his own free will, either expressly or tacitly, his entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial (see Sejdovic, cited above, \u00a7 86).

In this connection the Court needs to determine whether such facts had been established in the case at hand. In view of this, the Court takes into account the Government\u2019s contention and the Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s finding that the applicant had left Bulgaria, had married a Georgian national and had taken her surname. It further observes that indeed trials regarding \u201cfinancial pyramids\u201d attracted broad media attention and became notorious in the country at the time (see paragraph 23 above). However, the Court refers to its findings in the case of Sejdovic (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 96-100) and points out that the mere absence of the applicant from his usual place of residence and the fact that he was untraceable does not necessarily mean that he had knowledge of the trial against him. The Court is also not convinced that the remainder of the indicated circumstances, namely that the applicant had married and taken his wife\u2019s name or that the said trials had been covered by the media in Bulgaria, amount to facts sufficiently establishing that the applicant had knowledge of the criminal proceedings against him. As regards the applicant\u2019s own allegation that he was in contact with Bulgarian officials in Georgia and the ensuing conclusion of the Supreme Court of Cassation that he must therefore have been aware of the trial against him, that allegation was contested by the Government itself (see\u00a0paragraph 34 above). Therefore the Court cannot take it as a fact corroborating a conclusion that the applicant had knowledge of the trial against him.",

Whilst this information must be conveyed \u201cpromptly\u201d, it need not be related in its entirety by the arresting officer at the very moment of the arrest.

As regards the manner of communicating the reasons for the arrest, Article 5 \u00a7 2 does not require the reasons to be given in writing to the detained person or otherwise in a particular form (see Kane v.

The Court is of the view that in the absence of an effective remedy it was the very act of informing the applicant that triggered the running of the six-month time-limit in respect of that complaint.
