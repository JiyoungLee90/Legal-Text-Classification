A request to appeal out of time should therefore be submitted within seven days from the date on which the lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file or had an effective possibility of drafting an appeal (4 March 2005, II UZ 72/04; 27 June 2000, I CZ 62/00), or from the date when the lawyer was informed that he had been assigned to the case by the local bar association (11\u00a0October 2001, IV CZ 163/01; 17\u00a0November 1998, II UZ 122/98; 11\u00a0October 2001, IV CZ 163/01).",
