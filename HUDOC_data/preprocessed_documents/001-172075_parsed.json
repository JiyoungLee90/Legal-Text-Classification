While the Presidium first considered that the incorrect application of the domestic legislation governing unjust enrichment was a fundamental error justifying the quashing of the second instance court judgment and a new examination of the case, in the subsequent proceedings it decided exactly the opposite. The Court does not discern any element or fact which could explain this volte-face made by the supervisory review court, acting of its own motion and without this argument had even being raised by the appellant party. As regards the Government\u2019s assertion that the second quashing was justified by the principle of legal certainty and necessary to restore the other party\u2019s rights, this is not of relevance to the case which should be distinguished from other previous cases already delivered by the Court in relation to the supervisory review procedure on account of the element of arbitrariness disclosed in the judgment of 8 July 2010 of the Presidium of the Belgorod Regional Court. The Court is particularly struck by the fact that both times, the Presidium relied on exactly the same grounds and referred to exactly the same domestic and Convention provisions to justify its decisions. In any event, and more fundamentally, it remains unclear how the fact that the appeal court judgment delivered as a result of the first quashing was subsequently quashed on a further application for supervisory review could be said to improve legal certainty (see Ryabykh v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a052854/99, 21 February 2002).",
