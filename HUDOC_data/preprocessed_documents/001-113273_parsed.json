Mattresses and blankets (although dirty) were available. That said, the cell windows were still hidden by shutters and the other detention floors remained in a state of severe dilapidation (cf., inter alia, paragraph 48 of the report on the 2000 visit).",

They referred to the findings of the prosecutor who had looked into the applicant\u2019s complaints and had found no irregularities in the conditions of his detention (see paragraphs 39 and 50 above). These findings, however, do not refute all of the applicant\u2019s allegations. It does not appear that the issues of ventilation and closed-off windows were addressed in the above documents, although the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the CPT) highlighted this problem as being common to most detention facilities of this type. The same is true for daily outside exercise, which is not mentioned in the documents referred to by the Government. Furthermore, in the Court\u2019s opinion, compliance with the domestic standards on conditions of detention is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a03. The domestic standards themselves should correspond to the acceptable minimum standards. As concerns overcrowding, the Government listed the cells in which the applicant was held and indicated their size \u2013 12.9 sq.m. - without mentioning the actual number of inmates kept in those cells, while the applicant alleged that he had to share such cells with six other persons. Moreover, the Government could not disapprove such allegations due to destruction of documents, as mentioned above. On the other hand, the overcrowding also figures in the CPT reports among the recurrent problems of the Ukrainian penitentiary systems. The applicant\u2019s allegations suggest that the detainees had less than 2 sq.m. of living space which is far below the standards developed in the Court\u2019s case-law (see, among other authorities, Kalashnikov v. , no. 47095/99, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2002VI; and Melnik v. , no. 72286/01, \u00a7 103, 28 March 2006).",

France, no. 29731/96, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2001-II). Furthermore, Article 6 may also be relevant before a case is sent for trial and in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with it (see Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 36; and \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2005...). The manner in which Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) are applied during the investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings and the facts of the case. Article 6 will normally require that the accused already be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer at the initial stages of police interrogation. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a055, 27 November 2008).",

During those interviews, which according to the police concerned different matters, the applicant allegedly confessed to the murder of the police officer, the crime for which he had been sought and eventually extradited to . The Court considers that any conversation between a detained criminal suspect and the police must be treated as formal contact and cannot be characterised as \u201cinformal questioning\u201d, as stated by the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal (see paragraph 29 above). The Court notes that the facts of the case, as they stand, show that after being questioned by the police without legal assistance the applicant confessed to a very serious crime. The fact that he repeated his confession in the presence of the lawyer does not undermine the conclusion that the applicant\u2019s defence rights were irretrievably prejudiced at the very outset of the proceedings, and the domestic courts did not react to this procedural flaw in an appropriate manner by excluding such statements from the evidential basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction.",

Indeed, the above provision did not require them to give any reasons for their discretionary decision or even to take any formal decision that could be appealed against, and therefore contains no safeguards against arbitrariness or abuse (see Shalimov v. , no. 20808/02, \u00a7 88, 4 March 2010). In the present case the domestic court did not even refer to the above provision and did not give any reasons for refusing family visits, stating that under Article 345 of the Code of Criminal Procedure convicted persons could be granted family visits only after their conviction. Such a response to the applicant\u2019s requests supports the Court\u2019s above findings in the Shalimov case, namely that the Ukrainian legislation on family visits to detainees lacks precision. The Court finds that in these circumstances it cannot be said that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his family life was \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d as required by Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Shalimov v.

However, it\u00a0reiterates that Article\u00a013 cannot be interpreted as requiring a remedy against the state of domestic law, as otherwise the Court would be imposing on Contracting States a requirement to incorporate the Convention (see Appleby and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 44306/98, \u00a7 56, ECHR\u00a02003-VI; Ostrovar v. Moldova, no.\u00a035207/03, \u00a7 113, 13\u00a0September 2005). In so far, therefore, as no remedy existed in domestic law in respect of the quality of Article 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicant\u2019s complaint is inconsistent with this principle (see Shalimov v.
