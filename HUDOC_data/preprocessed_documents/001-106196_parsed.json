However, the complexity of the case alone cannot explain the overall length of the proceedings, which lasted more than 19 years for three levels of jurisdiction. As regards the applicant\u2019s conduct, the Court observes that even if there are delays attributable to the applicant, it cannot be considered to have decisively contributed to the total duration of the proceedings. As regards the applicant\u2019s extensions of his action and his opposition to the separation of the counterclaim, the Court emphasises that the former mainly took place in the very beginning of the proceedings and that the decision not to separate the proceedings lay in the Regional Court\u2019s sole discretion. The Court also notes that an applicant, in principle, cannot be held responsible for availing himself of the procedural means at his disposal under German law (see, mutatis mutandis, Ballhausen v. , no. 1479/08, \u00a7 63, 23 April 2009). Against this background, the Court finds that there were substantial periods of inactivity or delay, which are solely imputable to the domestic courts (see, in this context, among many other authorities, S\u00fc\u00dfmann v. , 16 September 1996, \u00a7 55, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV).",
