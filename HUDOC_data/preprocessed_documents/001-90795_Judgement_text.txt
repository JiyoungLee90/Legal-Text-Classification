The case originated in an application (no. 23057/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Krum Iliev Dinchev (“the applicant”), on 16 July 2003.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev, a lawyer practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Dimova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been deprived of effective access to a court on account of the discontinuation, due to the lapse of the relevant limitation period, of the criminal proceedings against an individual who had caused him bodily harm.
On 6 March 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaint that as a result of the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings against the individual who had allegedly caused him bodily harm the applicant had been deprived of access to a court. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3 of the Convention).
The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in .
At the relevant time he worked as an electrical engineer on a ship on the Danube river. At about 9 p.m. on 3 January 1992, while the ship was anchored in Passau, Germany, and the crew were celebrating a birthday onboard, one of them, Mr V.M., who had been drinking alcohol, showed the others a gas pistol he had bought. He put the muzzle close to the first mechanic’s head and then went out of the cabin. A few seconds later a shot was heard and V.M. entered the cabin, saying that he had shot the second mechanic. The others admonished him not to play with the pistol, as he could blind somebody. However, V.M. turned towards the applicant and told him that he “[would] be next”. The applicant warned him not to play with the pistol, but V.M. aimed at him, laughing. The applicant tried to hide his face and went out of the cabin and back in several times. V.M. continued to laugh and shot the applicant in the face, from a distance of about 50 or 60 centimetres. The applicant was blinded and felt numb in his nose, mouth and chin. His glasses were covered with powder.
On the next morning the applicant was taken to a hospital in  to undergo treatment. He had a number of black disfiguring scars on his face.
The applicant brought the matter to the attention of the Bulgarian prosecuting authorities on 2 June 1993. On 14 December 1993 the Vidin District Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal investigation into the incident and in December 1993 and January 1994 in the investigator in charge of the case interviewed several witnesses.
On 1 February 1994 V.M. was charged and questioned.
On 11 February 1994 the investigator concluded that V.M. had wilfully caused the applicant intermediate bodily harm, contrary to Article 129 § 1 of the 1968 Criminal Code (see paragraph 26 below), and recommended that he be committed for trial.
No further procedural steps were undertaken until 15 May 1998, when the Lom District Prosecutor’s Office, to which the case had been transferred in February 1994, submitted an indictment against V.M. to the Lom District Court, accusing him of negligently inflicting intermediate bodily harm on the applicant, contrary to Article 133 of the 1968 Criminal Code (see paragraph 26 below).
In the meantime, in 1994, November 1995 and January 1996, the applicant contacted the Lom District Prosecutor’s Office and requested that the case be processed faster. In 1996 and 1997 he also complained about the delay to the Montana Regional Prosecutor’s Office.
The first hearing before the Lom District Court, listed for 3 November 1998, was adjourned because the witnesses and an expert witness did not appear.
The hearing took place on 23 February 1999. The court accepted for examination a civilparty claim which the applicant had lodged the previous day, and gave him leave to take part in the proceedings as a private prosecuting party alongside the public prosecutor. Noting that V.M. was ill, the court adjourned the case.
A hearing scheduled for 15 April 1999 failed to take place because V.M. was ill and none of the witnesses had appeared.
A hearing listed for 23 February 2000 was also adjourned because V.M. was absent. The court found that he was evading the proceedings and ordered his detention.
A hearing listed for 5 July 2000 started as planned, but was adjourned because it emerged that V.M. had not received a copy of the indictment.
The next hearing was held on 20 September 2000. The court once again accepted for examination the applicant’s civilparty claim and gave him leave to take part in the proceedings as a private prosecuting party alongside the public prosecutor. The applicant’s counsel complained that the proceedings were protracted and on this ground requested the recusal of the panel examining the case. The court turned down his request. It adjourned the case because most of the witnesses were absent.
The next hearing took place on 18 January 2001. The public prosecutor asked the court to discontinue the proceedings because the applicable limitation period had expired. The applicant objected, saying that the court should deal with this request only after hearing the witnesses and forming a more definite view on the proper legal characterisation of V.M.’s act, which was highly relevant for determining the applicable limitation period. The court decided to discontinue the proceedings, finding that the limitation period for prosecuting the offence allegedly committed by V.M. had expired. The offence had been allegedly perpetrated on 3 January 1992, the investigation had been instituted on 14 December 1993, V.M. had been charged on 1 February 1994, and no procedural steps had been taken until 15 May 1998, when he had been indicted. The charges against him were under Article 133 of the 1968 Criminal Code, which provided for up to one year’s imprisonment or forced labour. By Article 80 § 1 (5) of the same Code, the prosecution of the alleged offence was barred following the expiration of two years after its commission (see paragraphs 27 and 28 below).
Upon the appeal of the applicant, in a decision of 14 June 2001 the  quashed the discontinuation and remitted the case. It found, inter alia, that the lower court had correctly adopted the legal characterisation of the offence given in the indictment. However, that court had, in breach of the rules of procedure, omitted to ask V.M. whether or not he wished to benefit from the expiration of the limitation period or preferred to be tried.
At a hearing held on 14 November 2001 the Lom District Court, having heard V.M.’s declaration that he wanted to avail himself of the expiration of the limitation period, again decided to discontinue the proceedings, giving the same reasons as earlier.
The applicant appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the court had erred by blindly accepting the legal characterisation of the offence given in the indictment instead of examining it independently. There were serious indications that V.M. had perpetrated his act wilfully and not negligently, as asserted in the indictment.
In a decision of 22 April 2002 the  upheld the lower court’s decision. It found that it had not erred by examining the case in line with the legal characterisation of the offence set out in the indictment and by ruling that the offence of which V.M. had stood accused could no longer be prosecuted. It was evident that the limitation period had lapsed even before the indictment had been submitted to the court. The lower court had omitted to spot this at the outset, but later had rightly discontinued the proceedings on that ground.
The applicant appealed on points of law, arguing that the legal characterisation of the alleged offence – and hence the applicable limitation period – had been incorrect, as there were indications that V.M. had perpetrated his act wilfully.
In a final judgment of 20 January 2003 the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the lower court’s decision. It found that at the time when V.M. had been indicted the absolute limitation period for prosecuting the offence – three years – had already expired. The court did not comment on the legal characterisation of the offence.
Article 133 of the 1968 Criminal Code makes it an offence punishable by up to one year’s imprisonment or, at the relevant time, forced labour, to negligently inflict grievous or intermediate bodily harm on another. The wilful inflicting of intermediate bodily harm is an offence punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment (Article 129 § 1 of the Code). Both offences are publicly prosecutable (Article 161 of the Code).
By Article 80 § 1 of the 1968 Criminal Code, the prosecution of an offence is barred after a certain period of time. This period varies in relation to the penalty provided for the offence and ranges from twenty years for offences punishable by life imprisonment to two years for offences punishable by one year’s imprisonment or less. The period starts to run from the completion of the offence (Article 80 § 3 of the Code) and is interrupted by every act effected by the competent authorities with a view to prosecuting the offender (Article 81 § 2 of the Code). Such interruptions notwithstanding, prosecution is no longer possible if the time elapsed since the perpetration of the offence is more than one and a half times the limitation period (Article 81 § 3 of the Code). Accordingly, the prosecution of an offence punishable by one year’s imprisonment or less, such as negligent infliction of intermediate bodily harm, is absolutely barred after the expiration of three years (one and a half times two years) from its perpetration, whereas the prosecution of an offence punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment, such as wilful infliction of intermediate bodily harm, is absolutely barred after the expiration of fifteen years (ten years plus one half) from its perpetration (Article 81 § 3 in conjunction with Article 80(3) and (5) of the Code).
Upon the expiration of the limitation period, the proceedings against the alleged offender must be discontinued (Article 21 § 1 (3) of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, superseded by Article 24 § 1 (3) of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure). However, he or she may waive this benefit and prefer to be tried. In that case the proceedings have to continue (Article 21 § 2 of the 1974 Code, superseded by Article 24 § 2 of the 2005 Code).
The victim of a tort which is also a publicly prosecutable criminal offence has a choice of bringing an action against the alleged tortfeasor in the civil courts, with the result that the proceedings will be stayed in anticipation of the outcome of the pending or impending criminal investigation against the tortfeasor (Article 182 § 1 (d) of the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure, superseded by Article 229 § 1 (5) of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure), or of making a civilparty claim in the context of the criminal proceedings instituted by the prosecuting authorities (Article 60 § 1 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, presently replaced by Article 84 § 1 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure). Until June 2003 a civilparty claim could be made even during a preliminary investigation, before the case had been brought to trial (Article 60 § 1 of the 1974 Code, as in force until June 2003). At present it can be made only after the case has already been brought to trial (Article 60 § 1 of the 1974 Code, as in force after June 2003, and Article 84 § 1 of the 2005 Code). The claim can be made in writing or orally (Article 61 §§ 1 and 2 of the 1974 Code and Article 85 §§ 1 and 2 of the 2005 Code). In a judgment of 28 October 2002 the Supreme Court of Cassation accepted that it could be made even by simply taking an active part in the preliminary investigation (реш. № 541 от 28 октомври 2002 г. по н.д. № 420/2002 г., ВКС, I н.о.).
Under Article 64 § 2 of the 1974 Code (superseded by Article 88 § 2 of the 2005 Code), the examination of the civilparty claim could not cause the criminal case to be adjourned. If the proceedings were discontinued, the claim was not examined, but could be brought separately in a civil court (Article 64 § 3 of the 1974 Code, as worded both before and after June 2003, presently superseded by Article 88 § 3 of the 2005 Code). The criminal court ruled on the claim only when giving judgment on the merits of the criminal case, even if in that judgment it ruled that the accused’s criminal liability had been extinguished (Article 305 of the 1974 Code, superseded by Article 307 of the 2005 Code; and реш. № 225 от 20 септември 2004 г. по н.д. № 849/2003, ВКС, II н.о.).
All tort claims are extinguished with the expiration of five years after the commission of the tort or the discovering of the tortfeasor (sections 110 and 114(3) of the 1951 Contracts and Obligations Act). However, by section 115(1)(g) of the Act, time ceases to run during the “pendency of the judicial proceedings relating to the [tort] claim”. The application of this rule in relation to criminal proceedings has been unclear. Thus, in a judgment of 18 May 2000 the Supreme Court of Cassation construed it as meaning that time stops running not only during the pendency of a civil suit, but also during the pendency of criminal proceedings relating to the same facts, even at their preliminary investigation phase and in the absence of a civilparty claim (реш. № 456 от 18 май 2000 г. по н.д. № 435/1999 г., ВКС, І н.о.). However, in a judgment of 28 March 2005 it ruled that even the bringing of a civilparty claim in the context of a preliminary investigation does not stop the running of time, because these proceedings are not “judicial” (реш. № 2110 от 28 март 2005 г. по гр.д. № 3159/2002 г., ВКС, ІІІ г.о.). The issue was conclusively settled by the General Assembly of the Civil and the Commercial Chambers of the Supreme Court of Cassation, which held, in a binding interpretative decision of 5 April 2006, that time stops running under section 115(1)(g) of the Act only when the victim brings a claim for damages against the tortfeasor, whether in the context of criminal proceedings or in separate civil proceedings (тълк. реш. № 5 от 5 април 2006 г. по тълк.д. № 5/2005 г., ОСГК и ОСТК на ВКС).
Persons who have suffered damage from a publicly prosecutable offence may take part in the criminal proceedings as private prosecuting parties alongside the public prosecutor (Article 52 of the of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, superseded by Article 76 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure). They may press charges even if those are dropped by the public prosecutor (Article 54 § 2 of the 1974 Code, superseded by Article 78 § 2 of the 2005 Code), but may not seek a legal characterisation of the offence that is different from the one given in the indictment drawn up by the public prosecutor (реш. № 713 от 6 декември 1999 г. по н.д. 541/1999 г., ВКС, ІІ н.о.).
