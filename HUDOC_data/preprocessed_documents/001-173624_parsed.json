However, the Court observes that neither the contents of the case file nor the applicant\u2019s submissions disclose any evidence that the relevant medical experts lacked the requisite objectivity. This is supported by the fact that the expert reports were delivered by experts with a considerable professional and educational background (see paragraph 29 above) and that the relevant domestic law sets out an overriding duty for experts to provide their opinions impartially and relevantly within their own areas of expertise (see paragraph 23 above, section 66 (2) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and Letin\u010di\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 63).",

Moreover, the Court has already recognised that disputes concerning benefits under social security schemes are generally rather technical and that their outcome usually depends on written opinions given by medical doctors. Accordingly, in view of the fact that the applicant did not adduce any relevant and decisive argument that would warrant an oral hearing, the Court does not find anything unfair in the decision of the Zagreb Administrative Court not to hear her oral evidence (see Pirinen v. Finland (dec.), no. 32447/02, 16 May 2006).",

It is normally not the Court\u2019s role to determine whether a particular expert report available to the domestic judge was reliable or not (see Matytsina v. Russia, no. 58428/10, \u00a7 169, 27 March 2014). The Court\u2019s task under the Convention is rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was admitted, were fair (see Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, \u00a7 31, Series A no.\u00a0274).",
