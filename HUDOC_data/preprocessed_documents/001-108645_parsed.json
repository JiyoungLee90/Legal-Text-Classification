The delegation\u2019s findings revealed that, in many instances, periods of detention (from several hours up to one day) went unrecorded in the protocols of detention. At the same time, custody registers often contained incorrect data, and on occasion, misleading information. By way of illustration, the register of a district police station indicated that a person was detained there for two hours while it was subsequently established that the person in question was in fact held at the police station concerned for three days.

The fact that the trial court subsequently and implicitly admitted that the applicant was detained on 12\u00a0May 2004 is of little relevance. The principal issue of concern is that at the time of the impugned detention there were no appropriate custody records and the applicant\u2019s status as a suspect was formalised only the next day, with a twenty-four-hour delay. There is no evidence that until the morning of 13\u00a0May 2004 any of the procedural rights he could exercise at the relevant time had been explained to him. In these circumstances the applicant could not make effective use of a variety of procedural safeguards enshrined in the Convention and the domestic legislation.

Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such a restriction - whatever its justification - must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during questioning by police without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz v.  [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a055, 27\u00a0November 2008).",

There are no grounds to hold that when they visited the applicant\u2019s home the police had already decided that the applicant was a suspect. At the same time, it appears that the applicant volunteered his confession of his own motion and it was only after his confession that the police must have considered him a suspect. Moreover, the statements made by the applicant during that initial interview were not used by the courts for his conviction and there is no indication that his defence rights were unduly prejudiced on account of that interview in any other way.",

In this regard the Court notes that in the case of Dayanan v.\u00a0Turkey (no. 7377/03, \u00a7\u00a7 31-33, ECHR 2009-...) it found that it is problematic to deprive a pre-trial detainee of legal representation, even if during the relevant period he or she does not make any statements that are later used to convict him or her. However, in contrast to Dayanan case, there is no evidence that the applicant was questioned during the time at issue, or that any other investigative action had been carried out with his participation. Regard should also be had to the fact that the conclusions in Dayanan case were made in view of the legislative restrictions on access to a lawyer at that stage of the proceedings (see also, mutatis mutandis, Hovanesian v. , no. 31814/03, \u00a7 37, 21 December 2010 and Zdravko Petrov v. , no. 20024/04, \u00a7 47, 23 June 2011). No such legislative restrictions existed in the present case. Furthermore, under Article 45 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the presence of defence counsel for minor suspects was obligatory. Moreover, the case file does not suggest that the delay in the applicant\u2019s gaining access to a lawyer of his own choosing was caused by the authorities. To the extent that this delay might have been attributable to the authorities\u2019 failure to document the applicant\u2019s arrest, this issue has been addressed by the above finding of a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention.",
