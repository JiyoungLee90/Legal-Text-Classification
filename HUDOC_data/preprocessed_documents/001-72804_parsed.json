In support of this argument, the Government presented a domestic court judgment rejecting the applicant\u2019s claim for index-linking the award because there was no proof of such re-submission. The applicant claimed that he had re-submitted the warrant: this was confirmed by a letter of 10 October 2003 from the Decisions Enforcement Department (\u201cthe Department\u201d). In that letter the Department replied to the applicant\u2019s request for enforcement that it was not possible at that time to enforce the judgment in his favour and that two proposals had been made to the respondent Ministry in 2002 and 2003 to enforce the judgment.

Delay in the payment of such compensation must have added to the frustration already resulting from the illegal detention. The authorities were thus under a particular duty to ensure prompt enforcement. Indeed, his request to enforce was left unanswered.
