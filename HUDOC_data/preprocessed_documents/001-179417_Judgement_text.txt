The case originated in an application (no. 38958/12) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Turkish nationals, Mr Aziz Çulhaoğlu, Mr Mahmut Hüdai Çulhaoğlu and Ms Seval Çulhaoğlu (“the applicants”), on 24 April 2012.
The applicants were represented by Mr M. Yalçın, a lawyer practising in Denizli. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 7 September 2016 the complaint concerning the independence and impartiality of the Supreme Military Administrative Court was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicants were born in 1961, 1990 and 1960 respectively and they live in Denizli.
The applicants’ relative, Mr Ahmet Aziz Çulhaoğlu, died during his compulsory military service. On 11 September 2009 the applicants initiated compensation proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court, alleging that the death of their relative had been caused due to the negligence of the military authorities.
On 16 September 2010 the Supreme Military Administrative Court, composed of five members, including three military judges and two military officers, decided to dismiss the case, stating that the death of Mr Ahmet Aziz Çulhaoğlu could not be attributed to the military authorities.
On 7 December 2011 the applicants’ rectification request was further rejected by the Supreme Military Administrative Court.
A description of the domestic law at the material time can be found in Yavuz v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 29870/96, 25 May 2000), and Tanışma v. Turkey (no. 32219/05, §§ 29-47, 17 November 2015).
