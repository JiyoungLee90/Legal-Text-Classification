What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see McKerr\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, \u00a7 111, ECHR 2001-III).",

The applicant's name was brought up repeatedly in the context of the events, yet no investigation dealt with the attack on her until the complaint was communicated in July 2004.

The investigation of various episodes was spread between different prosecutors' offices, which were sometimes not even aware of each others' work. In the present case, for example, an investigation has been pending with the Staropromyslovskiy District Prosecutor's Office into the same attack since September 2003. Yet in April 2005, upon receipt of the information from the Court, the Chechnya Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal investigation into the infliction of serious injuries on the applicant. The two proceedings were joined only in August 2006. It appears that no attempt was made to check credible allegations that a number of attacks committed in the district at the same time had followed the same pattern and could have been committed by the same persons. The investigation clearly failed to identify other victims and possible witnesses to the crimes and to take statements from them. For example, the case file examined by the Court contains hardly any information about the persons who were killed during the same attack as the applicant or about those who were granted victim status in the proceedings. There is no map or plan of the district which might show the locations of the bodies and important evidence, and no attempt seems to have been made to draw up a list of the local residents who remained in the district in the winter of 1999 - 2000.",
