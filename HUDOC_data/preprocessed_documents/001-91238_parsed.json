The applicant also stated that overcrowding of cells had been a problem throughout the prison and confirmed his point with reference to statements by fellow prisoners who had been detained in various other cells in IZ-63/1 (see paragraphs 37-69 above). The Government, relying on the information provided by prison officers in facility no. IZ-63/1 (see paragraph 25 above) and the certificate issued by the head of IZ-63/1 (see paragraph 24 above), argued that the cell had only had eight sleeping places and that the applicant had not been detained with more than seven inmates throughout his stay in that cell. The Government further submitted that the relevant documents indicating the exact number of inmates in the cells had been destroyed in February 2003, March 2005 and January 2007 (see paragraph 23 above).",

Russia, no. 34000/02, \u00a7 34, 7 June 2007, and Belashev v. , no.\u00a028617/03, \u00a7 52, 13 November 2007). The Court finds that these considerations hold true in the circumstances of the present case, since the events at issue had taken place around seven years before officers D.K. and D.S. gave their statements, and it is clear from the way the statements are formulated that the officers based them on their personal recollections and not on any objective data. Furthermore, the Government were requested to provide data in respect of each day of the applicant\u2019s detention in IZ-63/1, whereas the officers merely stated that the number of inmates had not exceeded a certain figure. The Court finds that in the circumstances of the case and given the lack of any original prison documentation, such an answer is too vague and unspecific to enable the Court to make a firm finding regarding the alleged lack of overcrowding in the facility in question. Thus, the Court takes note of the statements by officers D.K. and D.S., but it finds no objective reason to attach greater weight to those statements compared to those made, for instance, by the inmates referred to by the applicant. Overall, the Court finds that the Government have not accounted properly for their failure to submit detailed information supported by copies of the original prison documentation, with the result that the Court may draw inferences from their conduct.",

In particular, former detainees S.N. Vasilyev (see paragraphs 37-39 above), A.V. Bogolyubov (see paragraph 40 above), S.A. Rassokhin (see paragraphs 43 and 46 above), V.I. Molochkov (see paragraphs 56 and 57 above), S.V. Sidorchuk (see paragraphs 47 and 50 above as well as the Court\u2019s conclusions under Article 34 in paragraphs 118-123) and V.V.\u00a0Slivin (see paragraphs 59 and 61 above), in their largely uncontested statements relating to various dates between 1997 and 2002, all confirmed the fact that IZ-63/1 was severely overcrowded during their stay there. The Court is aware of the Government\u2019s objection that none of the persons mentioned above was detained in cell no. 36 of IZ-63/1 along with the applicant. However, the objection remains a mere allegation as it is not supported by any original documentation which, according to the Government\u2019s own position, was destroyed. Furthermore, being mindful of the objective difficulties experienced by applicants in substantiating their grievances in respect of the conditions of pre-trial detention in Russia, the Court is prepared to accept the above statements as sufficient confirmation of the applicant\u2019s point that the overcrowding of cells was a problem throughout pre-trial detention centre IZ-63/1 for a number of years before, during and after the applicant\u2019s detention there. The existence of this deplorable state of affairs may also be inferred from the information contained in an official newspaper of the Central Department for the Execution of Sentences of the Ministry of Justice, which estimated the population of the detention centre at over three thousand detainees, despite being designed to accommodate only one thousand two hundred inmates (see paragraph 28 above).",

After the Court requested the Government to comment on the applicant\u2019s allegations of undue coercion and pressure on witnesses, the Government produced yet another statement by Mr Sidorchuk, in which he essentially retracted his submission of 24 August 2004 and endorsed his initial statement, supplied by the applicant and dated 25 April 2005. No specific reason for such a drastic change of position was provided by the Government in their comments, but it did arrive in the statement by Mr Sidorchuk dated 27\u00a0January 2008, submitted by the applicant, in which the witness accused the authorities of having put pressure on him by using his pending application for release on parole as leverage. Even though the above-mentioned statement in itself may not be conclusive, subsequent developments amply illustrate that Mr Sidorchuk was indeed subjected to pressure by the authorities. On 10 March 2008, after his release on parole, Mr Sidorchuk was again contacted and interviewed, this time by an official from the prosecutor\u2019s office. The Court would stress that Mr Sidorchuk was not visited by the relevant official at his home or merely invited for a talk \u2013 an official from the prosecutor\u2019s office summoned him by sending a police patrol to his home address, from where Mr Sidorchuk was escorted to the police station under threat of being brought by force or fined (see paragraphs 52-55 above). At the same time, the Government did not produce any document which would prove the existence of a criminal case in the context of which Mr Sidorchuk could have been summoned as a witness. Therefore, the Court finds that the summoning of Mr Sidorchuk in the described manner was totally inappropriate. Next, as regards the purpose of the interview, the Government cited the need to check the witness\u2019s earlier statements concerning undue pressure from the prison authorities. The Court notes that nothing in the Government\u2019s submissions supports this version. In fact, had any formal inquiry, either disciplinary or criminal, been launched into this matter, the Government would have been able to identify it, report on the actions taken by the responsible officials, furnish the Court with transcripts of interviews by the officials involved and provide a copy of a final document containing findings and conclusions. Since the Government failed to provide any of these documents or even argue that they existed, the Court cannot but conclude that the interview of 10 March 2008, especially given the ominous form it took, was not justified by the need to clarify Mr Sidorchuk\u2019s previous statements, but was meant to put additional pressure on one of the witnesses in this case whose depositions played a key role in the establishment of the facts in the proceedings before the Court and were indispensable to the effective exercise of the applicant\u2019s right of individual petition guaranteed by Article 34 of the Convention.",

Hence, the Court would note in respect of the alleged pressure placed on Mr\u00a0Gromadskiy (see paragraph 76 above) and the alleged refusal of permission for the applicant\u2019s wife to visit on 19 February 2007 (see paragraphs 81-82 above), that nothing in the materials in its possession indicates that the applicant\u2019s ability to pursue the Strasbourg proceedings was in any way affected by the incidents in question. As regards the applicant\u2019s transfer from IK-13 to IK-26 in mid-February 2006 (see paragraphs 78-79 above), the Government explained \u2013 and in the absence of any clear evidence to the contrary the Court is satisfied with this explanation \u2013 that the above-mentioned transfer had taken place in the context of the general reorganisation of the functioning of the two prisons and had not been aimed at worsening the applicant\u2019s situation in connection with his application to the Court. Lastly, there is nothing in the materials of the case to support the applicant\u2019s allegation of pressure on the witness V.V.\u00a0Slivin (see paragraphs 59-62 above).",
