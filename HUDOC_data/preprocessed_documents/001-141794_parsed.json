In addition, application of the criminal provision required the existence of malicious intent, while the administrative provision was applicable as soon as culpable conduct was established.

Moreover, in its judgment of 26\u00a0February 2013 in case C-617/10 (\u00c5klagaren v.\u00a0Hans \u00c5kerberg Fransson), the ECJ had confirmed the following principles: (a) the applicability of European Union law entails applicability of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter; (b) Article 50 of the Charter (guaranteeing the ne bis in idem principle) presupposes that the measures which are adopted against a defendant are of a criminal nature; (c) for the purpose of assessing whether tax penalties are criminal in nature, it is necessary to consider the legal classification of the offence under national law, the very nature of the offence, and the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned is liable to incur.",

Furthermore, these criteria are alternative and not cumulative ones: for Article 6 to apply in respect of the words \u201ccriminal charge\u201d, it suffices that the offence in question should by its nature be \u201ccriminal\u201d from the point of view of the Convention, or should have made the person concerned liable to a sanction which, by virtue of its nature and degree of severity, belongs in general to the \u201ccriminal\u201d sphere. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d (see Jussila v.

The Court reiterates that the CONSOB, an independent administrative body, has the task of protecting investors and ensuring the effectiveness, transparency and development of the stock markets (see paragraph 9 above). These are general interests of society, usually protected by criminal law (see, mutatis mutandis, Menarini Diagnostics\u00a0S.r.l., cited above, \u00a7 40; see also Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Stenuit v. France, report of the European Commission of Human Rights, 30\u00a0May 1991, \u00a7 62, Series A no.\u00a0232A). In addition, the Court considers that the fines imposed were essentially intended to punish, in order to prevent repeat offending. They had therefore been based on rules whose purpose was both deterrent, namely to dissuade the applicants from resuming the activity in question, and punitive, since they punished unlawful conduct (see, mutatis mutandis, Jussila, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038). Thus, they were not solely intended, as the Government claimed (see paragraph 91 above), to repair damage of a financial nature. In this respect, it should be noted that the penalties were imposed by the CONSOB on the basis of the gravity of the impugned conduct, and not of the harm caused to investors.",

Romania, no. 28183/03, \u00a7\u00a052, 4\u00a0October 2007). However, the fine which the CONSOB was entitled to impose could go up to EUR 5,000,000\u00a0(see paragraph 20 above), and this ordinary maximum amount could, in certain circumstances, be tripled or fixed at ten times the proceeds or profit obtained through the unlawful conduct (see paragraph 53 above). Imposition of the above-mentioned pecuniary administrative sanctions entails the temporary loss of their honour for the representatives of the companies involved, and, if the latter are listed on the stock exchange, their representatives are temporarily forbidden from administering, managing or supervising listed companies for periods ranging from two months to three years. The CONSOB may also prohibit listed companies, management companies and auditing companies from engaging the services of the offender, for a maximum period of three years, and request professional associations to suspend, on a temporary basis, the individual\u2019s right to carry out his or her professional activity (see paragraph 54 above). Lastly, the imposition of financial administrative sanctions entails confiscation of the proceeds or profits of the unlawful conduct and of the assets which made it possible (see paragraph 56 above).",

This last penalty was such as to compromise the integrity of the persons concerned (see, mutatis mutandis, Dubus S.A., loc. ult. cit.), and, given their amount, the fines were of undeniable severity and had significant financial implications for the applicants.

As to the statements signed by the Administrative Director of the Registry of the First Section of the Court of Appeal and submitted by the applicants (see paragraph 142 above), the Government argued that they did not reflect the reality of the situation.

In those statements, dated 6\u00a0September 2013, the President of the First Section of the Court of Appeal indicated that, at the relevant time, he had not been assigned to that body (he had taken up his duties on 1 March 2013), but that he had been able to reconstitute the sequence of events by examining the registers and case files, and on the basis of information provided directly by the staff of the registry and by the judges who had dealt with the cases in question.

It can be inferred from the wording of the reservation that Italy intended to exclude from the scope of that provision all offences and proceedings which were not classified as \u201ccriminal\u201d under Italian law. However, a reservation which does not refer to or mention those specific provision of the Italian legal order which exclude offences or proceedings from the scope of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 does not afford to a sufficient degree a guarantee that [it] does not go beyond the provision expressly excluded by the Contracting State (see, mutatis mutandis, Chorherr v.

Moreover, only the criminal procedure could result in the imposition of punishments involving a custodial sentence. The Government referred to the case of R.T. v.\u00a0Switzerland ((dec.), no.\u00a031982/96, 30\u00a0May 2000), in which the Court stated that the imposition of penalties by two different bodies (one administrative, the other criminal) had not been incompatible with Article 4 of Protocol No. 7.

Either ex officio or following a communication from another national or foreign public authority or a denunciation from a private party, the CONSOB may start a secret, pre-investigative proceeding (fase preistruttoria), during which the supervised person may be submitted to the powers set out in Article 187-octies of the TUF. Since this pre-investigative stage has no time-limit, no clear line is drawn between the CONSOB\u2019s general supervisory function and its punitive function, with the risk that the blurring of these functions may be instrumentalised to take advantage of the supervised person\u2019s legal obligations to inform, communicate documents and cooperate with CONSOB\u2019s supervisory activities. Within the punitive proceedings, there is a formal and organic separation between the Ufficio Insider Trading (Insider Trading Office, or ITO), which is responsible for bringing charges against the suspected person and assessing their written defence, the Ufficio Sanzioni Amministrative (Administrative Sanctions Division, or ASD), which is responsible for the inquiry and the final report containing the formal accusation and the proposed level of sanctions to be imposed, and the CONSOB as a Commission, which is responsible for the final administrative decision. However, this formal and organic separation does not guarantee an effective separation between prosecutorial and adjudicatory functions, as required by Article 187 septies no. 2 of the TUF itself. There are four reasons to support this conclusion. First, the CONSOB\u2019s chairman has the tasks of supervising the preliminary investigation and giving instructions about the functioning of the divisions and directives for their coordination. Second, the CONSOB\u2019s chairman is directly involved in the exercise of the most important inspection powers and other investigative powers attributed to the CONSOB by Articles 115 and 187 octies of the TUF, upon proposal of the competent directorates. Third, the CONSOB as a Commission may exercise extremely intrusive investigative powers, such as the power to seize property. Fourth, the CONSOB\u2019s decision may be motivated per relationem, with reference to the preceding procedural acts, and may even be taken by tacit consent of the members of the Commission. All things considered, the CONSOB as a Commission is very far from being an impartial body vis-\u00e0-vis the investigatory and prosecutorial bodies of the ITO and ASD. This basic systemic failure of the administrative proceedings is compounded by the grave inequality between the parties.",

In sum, the laudable intentions of the Italian legislature when it introduced the new version of Article 187-septies no. 2 of the TUF in 2005 has been thwarted in practice, both by case-law and by administrative rulings. The succession of two stages of written defence submissions before the ITO and the ASD, which brings no real added value to the proceedings, does not compensate for the lack of a true adversarial presentation and examination of the evidence and for the inequality of arms between the parties.",

As a matter of fact, the court of appeal rejected the appeals on the basis of the prosecutorial evidence collected by the administrative body, in spite of the circumstance that it had been collected in secret, without an adversarial confrontation of the witnesses, and was disputed both in its material and its subjective relevance. The court of appeal satisfied itself with the appellants\u2019 written submissions and the written evidence of the prosecution. And that was all! It heard no witnesses, it questioned none of the applicants and it collected no expert opinions. Instead, the court of appeal relied on, and even transcribed word for word in its judgments, the testimonies given by the witnesses Claudio Salini, responsible for the Markets Division, and Antonio Rosati, director general of the CONSOB, as the main items of evidence on which to ground the conviction. To put it in legal jargon, the court of appeal performed nothing more than a mere review (reformatio) of the logical consistency of the appealed decision, avoiding a genuine reexamination (revisio) of the case.",

It is even more evident that the applicants expected that the witnesses be summoned by the court of appeal, as it could have done using its powers under the law, either at the appellants\u2019 request or of its own motion, even without specifying the arguments to be proved. The fact that the requests for the production of testimonial evidence were made on condition that the court found it \u201cnecessary\u201d (ove occorresse) or that the documentary evidence was considered \u201cpossibly insufficient or unusable\u201d (eventuale insufficienza o inutilizzabilit\u00e0 dei documenti), clearly does not change the appellants\u2019 intention or the nature of their request.

Court questioning of the applicants was also crucial, given that their individual and allegedly deceitful mens rea was in dispute. It other words, it was of paramount importance to assess whether the CONSOB was aware of the legal solution conceived by Mr Grande Stevens and found it unnecessary to make that solution public, in view of its incipient, uncertain and conditional nature and in order to avoid an artificial impact on the market, which was already very unstable. Were this version of the facts to have been confirmed, the CONSOB\u2019s conduct would have been shown to have created the circumstances for the offence itself to be committed, thus entrapping the applicants and subsequently punishing them for what it knew to have still been a mere intention at the material time (Cogitatio poenam nemo patitur). It is not the mere lack of a formality (namely, a public audience) that is striking in this case, as the majority seems to state. It is much more than that. The truly shocking aspect is the total lack of an adversarial examination of the disputed evidence with regard to crucial facts in a hearing before a court of law. The court of appeal unreservedly accepted and endorsed the testimonial evidence collected by the prosecutorial body without giving the applicants an opportunity to conduct an effective cross-examination of the witnesses on the facts of the case. Although these shortcomings were challenged before the Court of Cassation, it did not repair them, rejecting the procedural complaints as belated, and in any case maintaining that the entire procedure as governed by CONSOB Resolution no. 15608 was entirely capable of ensuring compliance with the principles of a fair trial.",

Firstly, the CONSOB decision itself took into consideration Mr Grande Stevens\u2019 activity as an administrator (amministratore) of IFIL Investments s.p.a. in order to aggravate his penalty. Secondly, the legal quality in which Mr\u00a0Grande Stevens acted makes all the difference, since it is crucial in order to qualify his conduct as a principal offender who had the power to take the decision to disseminate the information, rather than as a mere accessory offender, who had power only to give a legal opinion to those in charge of taking the above-mentioned decision. By changing this quality, the court of appeal changed an essential fact of the accusation, which is obviously relevant for the assessment of the objective wrongfulness and the subjective guilt of Mr Grande Stevens\u2019s conduct, and did so without the consent of the appellant. Thirdly, the new fact was also relevant from the perspective of the liability of the legal persons involved in the proceedings, since the charging of Mr Grande Stevens as an \u201cadministrator\u201d of IFIL Investments s.p.a. engaged the latter\u2019s liability under Article 187 quinquies of the TUF.",

According to Article 187-quinquies of the TUF, the legal person\u2019s administrative liability does not have a fixed upper limit, since it depends on the number of natural persons who committed the offence on behalf of the legal person. However, it is hard to understand how a penalty based on conduct consisting in disseminating allegedly false information by a single natural person can be almost double a penalty based on conduct consisting in disseminating the same information by that same person, but with the participation of another natural person. In addition, the CONSOB ordered, and the court of appeal upheld the order, that the two companies were to pay the penalties imposed on the persons employed by them, as a jointly liable entity, pursuant to section 6 (3) of Law no.\u00a0689/1981. According to the established case-law of the Court of Cassation, Article\u00a0187-quinquies of the TUF and section 6 of Law no.\u00a0689/1981 may be applied to the same legal person for the same facts, since the first regards the \u201cdirect administrative liability of the legal person\u201d while the second is a \u201cspecial case of debt without responsibility, as the entity is liable for the breach committed by one of its internal bodies and it is directly liable as an adiectus solutionis causa\u201d. Furthermore, the two companies were also charged with an additional \u201cadministrative\u201d offence under Article 25-sixies of Legislative Decree no. 231 of 8 June 2001. In practical terms, the two companies could have had to pay three different pecuniary penalties of enormous proportions for the same fact. Already in its conceptual structure, this punitive system calls into question the rights of legal persons under both Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 7 of the Convention. For the purpose of this opinion, it is sufficient to consider that IFIL Investments s.p.a. and Giovanni Agnelli & Co. were acquitted by the court of appeal\u2019s judgment of 28\u00a0February 2013 and this judgment is final in this part. The court of appeal concluded that no illegal conduct, let alone any \u201cadministrative\u201d offence, could be imputed to these commercial enterprises. In the light of Article\u00a0187-quinquies no. 4 of the TUF, the defences of IFIL Investments s.p.a. and Giovanni Agnelli & C., which were sufficient to negate their \u201cadministrative\u201d liability under Article 6 of Legislative Decree no. 231 of 8\u00a0June 2001, should also be considered sufficient to exclude the \u201cadministrative\u201d liability of the same legal persons under Article 187-quinquies of the TUF.",

Indeed, administrative sanctions are established \u201cwithout prejudice to the penal sanctions applicable when the action constitutes a criminal offence\u201d (Salve le sanzioni penali quando il fatto costituisce reato).

The Government have further elaborated on this interpretation by the Court of Cassation, adding that the criminal offence of Article 185 of the TUF is a \u201cconcrete risk of harm offence\u201d (reato di pericolo concreto), which means that it has to be established that the dissemination of false information caused an actual risk that the price of the specific financial instrument would be altered, whereas no actual impact on the price of that financial instrument is required for the offence to be committed, and the administrative offence of Article 187 ter of the TUF is an \u201cabstract risk of harm offence\u201d (reato di pericolo astratto), thus including any conduct which can theoretically influence investors\u2019 choices, regardless of whether false or misleading news has actually led to investment choices which otherwise would not have been taken.",

These two guarantees are not enough, as the present case proves. Although the criminal and administrative proceedings had as their subject matter exactly the same factual situation, the Court of Cassation and the Turin Court of Appeal repeatedly, but unconvincingly, stated that the principle of speciality did not apply to them. Both the criminal offence of Article 185 and the administrative offence of Article 187 ter are conduct-based offences which protect the same \u201clegal interest\u201d (bene giuridico), namely the transparency of the market, the difference between them being that the former is a \u201cconcrete risk of harm offence\u201d and the latter an \u201cabstract risk of harm offence\u201d. Thus, it is obvious that the principle of speciality applied, since the provision of concrete risk of harm is special in relation to the provision of abstract risk of harm concerning the same \u201clegal interest\u201d, and therefore criminal proceedings should prevail over, and exclude, administrative proceedings. The material accumulation of criminal and administrative sanctions not only overburdens the State with two autonomous investigations, with the risk of different pronouncements on the same facts, but also clearly frustrates the principle of speciality.",

Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 also prohibits the \u201cdouble prosecution\u201d of the same idem. Hence, criminal proceedings may not be opened for the same idem where the administrative decision has been definitely confirmed by the courts and become res judicata.

In order to ensure the integrity of European markets and to enhance investor confidence in those markets, States have created very broad administrative conduct-based offences, which punish the abstract risk of harm to the market with severe, undetermined pecuniary and non-pecuniary penalties, which are classified as administrative sanctions and applied by \u201cindependent\u201d administrative authorities in inquisitorial, unequal and prompt proceedings. These authorities combine punitive and prosecutorial powers with a broad power of supervision over a particular sector of the market, and exercise the latter in such a way as to pursue the former, sometimes imposing on the supervised/suspected person an obligation to cooperate in the bringing of charges against him or her. The succession of three, or even four, stages of written defence pleadings \u2013 twice before the administrative authority, once before the court of appeal and again before the Court of Cassation \u2013 is an elusive guarantee which does not compensate for the intrinsic unfairness of the proceedings. The temptation has clearly been to outsource conduct which cannot be dealt with through the classical instruments of criminal law and procedure to these \u201cnovel\u201d administrative proceedings. Nevertheless, market pressure cannot prevail over the international human rights obligations of the States bound by the Convention. The punitive nature of the offences and the severity of the punishment cannot be eluded, and clearly call for the protection afforded by the procedural guarantees of Article 6 and the substantive guarantees of Article 7 of the Convention.",
