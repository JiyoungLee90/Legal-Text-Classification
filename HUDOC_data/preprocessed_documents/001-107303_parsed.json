She has difficulty in trusting anyone, if that is possible at all. She is mistrustful, negative towards others who are or could become traitors; she sees hidden meaning in everything.

It is difficult to assert that this all amounts to a definitive paranoia, but the respondent \u2013 even if she is not in paranoia \u2013 is surely approaching it.

It is, however, an entirely different thing to deprive someone of legal capacity. Divesting someone of legal capacity entails serious consequences. The person concerned is not able to take any legal action and is thus deprived of his or her independence in all legal spheres. Such persons are put in a situation where they depend on others to take decisions concerning various aspects of their private life, such as, for example, where to live or how to dispose of their assets and all income.

In the absence of any rulings by the domestic courts, the judgment of the majority takes it upon itself to rule not only on the legality of the proceedings under Croatian law and the legitimate aim behind them, but also on their proportionality. The majority concludes that the proceedings did not comply with the relevant procedure and conditions prescribed by law, did not pursue a legitimate aim and were not necessary in a democratic society.",

The reasoning of the majority implies that merely instituting proceedings to divest someone of his or her legal capacity may be found to be a violation of the Convention, without the national courts having had the possibility to redress the interference, unless the latter recognise the violation.",

We are not able to conclude, however, that national law was in conformity with the requirements of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. According to the Court\u00b4s case-law, the expression \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2 requires not only that the interference should have some basis in domestic law; it also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring it to be accessible and foreseeable to the person concerned as well as compatible with the rule of law (see, mutatis mutandis, Uzun v. Germany, no 3523/05, \u00a7 60, 2 September 2010). Depending on the circumstances of the case, the rule of law may require that domestic law provide adequate protection against arbitrary interference with Article 8 rights enabling the Court to be satisfied that there exist effective guarantees against abuse (see Uzun, \u00a7 63).",

In this connection not only are procedural guarantees that the person concerned may adequately take part in the proceedings necessary, but we also consider it indispensable, in order to avoid abuse, for the national law to provide that a court decision be given on the well-foundedness of an application to divest a person\u2019s legal capacity \u2013 at least on a provisional basis - within a reasonably short time-limit. The Croatian Family Act contains no guarantees as to the speediness of such proceedings and there is no evidence that the Croatian courts attempted, of their own motion, to expedite proceedings which have now been pending for more than three years. Accordingly, Croatian law did not, in our opinion, comply in the present case with the requirement under Article 8 \u00a7 2 that the interference be \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, and on that ground we can agree that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in respect of the second applicant as well.",
