Large-capacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives... All these problems are exacerbated when the numbers held go beyond a reasonable occupancy level; further, in such a situation the excessive burden on communal facilities such as washbasins or lavatories and the insufficient ventilation for so many persons will often lead to deplorable conditions.",

Complaints which have as their source specific events which occurred on identifiable dates cannot be construed as referring to a continuing situation (see Nevmerzgitskiy v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a058825/00, 25 November 2003, where the applicant was subjected to force-feeding, and Tarariyeva v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no.\u00a04353/03, 11 October 2005, where the applicant\u2019s son was denied medical assistance). However, in the event of a repetition of the same events, such as an applicant\u2019s transport between the remand prison and the courthouse, even though the applicant was transported on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked variation in the conditions of transport to which he had been routinely subjected created, in the Court\u2019s view, a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d which brought the entire period complained of within the Court\u2019s competence (see Vlasov v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 78146/01, 14 February 2006, and Moiseyev v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004). Similarly, in a situation where the applicant\u2019s detention in the police ward was not continuous but occurred at regular intervals when he was brought there for an interview with the investigator or other procedural acts, the Court accepted that in the absence of any material change in the conditions of his detention, the breaking-up of his detention into several periods was not justified (see Nedayborshch v.\u00a0, no. 42255/04, \u00a7\u00a025, 1\u00a0July 2010). In another case, the applicant\u2019s absence from the detention facility for carrying out a certain procedural act did not prevent the Court from recognising the continuous nature of his detention in that facility (see Romanov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a063993/00, \u00a7\u00a073, 20 October 2005, where the applicant spent one month out of the remand prison in a psychiatric institution). Nevertheless, where an applicant was released but subsequently re-detained, the Court limited the scope of its examination to the later period (see Belashev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a028617/03, \u00a7\u00a048, 4 December 2008; Grishin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a030983/02, \u00a7\u00a083, 15\u00a0November 2007; and Dvoynykh v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a072277/01, \u00a7\u00a046, 12\u00a0October 2006).",

Different types of detention facilities have different purposes and vary accordingly in the material conditions they can offer. Thus, temporary detention wings located inside police stations are designed for short-term custody only and often lack the amenities indispensable for prolonged detention, such as a toilet, sink, or exercise yard (see for example Shchebet v.\u00a0, no. 16074/07, \u00a7\u00a089, 12 June 2008), whereas in correctional colonies \u2013 in contrast to remand prisons \u2013 the restricted space in the dormitories is compensated for by the freedom of movement enjoyed by the detainees during the day-time (see Nurmagomedov v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no.\u00a030138/02, 16 September 2004). The difference in material conditions of detention creates the presumption that an applicant\u2019s transfer to a different type of facility would require the submission of a separate complaint about the conditions of detention in the previous facility within six months of such transfer (see Volchkov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a045196/04, \u00a7\u00a027, 14\u00a0October 2010; Gultyayeva v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a067413/01, \u00a7\u00a0148, 1 April 2010; Maltabar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a082-84; and Nurmagomedov (dec.), cited above). Only in a few exceptional cases, having regard to the allegation of severe overcrowding as the main characteristic of the detention conditions in both facilities, has the Court recognised the existence of a \u201ccontinuous situation\u201d encompassing the applicant\u2019s stay both in police custody and in the remand prison (see Lutokhin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a012008/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a040-42, 8 April 2010; Seleznev, cited above \u00a7\u00a036, 26 June 2008; and Guliyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a024650/02, \u00a7\u00a033, 19\u00a0June 2008).",

It has been noted that there is no legal requirement on the prosecutor to hear the complainant or ensure his or her effective participation in the ensuing proceedings that would entirely be a matter between the supervising prosecutor and the supervised body. The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint. Moreover, the Court has already seen cases in which an applicant did complain to a prosecutor but his complaint did not elicit any response (see Antropov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a022107/03, \u00a7\u00a055, 29 January 2009).

The Russian Government, however, did not submit a single judicial decision showing that the complainant had been able to vindicate his or her rights by having recourse to this remedy. The Court, for its part, has not noted any examples of the successful use of this remedy in any of the conditions-of-detention cases that have previously come before it. Moreover, as the Court has noted in previous conditions-of-detention cases, the malfunctioning of such a preventive remedy in a situation of overcrowding is to a large extent due to the structural nature of the underlying problem. As the applicants rightly pointed out, even if they were to obtain a judgment requiring the prison authorities to make good a violation of their right to an individual sleeping place and to the sanitary norm of floor surface, their personal situation in an already overcrowded facility could only be improved at the expense and to the detriment of other detainees.",

The Court found that, while the possibility of obtaining compensation was not ruled out, the remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, in particular because the award was conditional on the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities. Even in cases where the claimant was able to prove that the actual conditions of detention deviated from, or fell short of, the standards required by applicable Russian laws, the Russian courts have routinely absolved the State of tort liability, finding that the inadequacy of material conditions was not attributable to some shortcoming or omission on the part of the prison authorities but rather to a structural problem, such as insufficient funding of the penitentiary system. Moreover, the level of the compensation was unreasonably low in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (see, for instance, Roman Karasev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a030251/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a081-85, 25\u00a0November 2010; Shilbergs v. , no. 20075/03, \u00a7\u00a7 71-79, 17 December 2009; Skorobogatykh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a017-18 and 31-32; Kokoshkina v.\u00a0Russia, no. 2052/08, \u00a7\u00a052, 28 May 2009; Aleksandr Makarov, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a077 and 87-89; and Benediktov, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a029 and 30, both cited above).

The certificates merely affirmed that the design capacity had not been exceeded, without indicating the actual cell population on any given date or referring to any documents on which that affirmation was founded. The fact that they were issued approximately three years after Mr Fetisov\u2019s detention had ended further undermined their evidentiary value: as the Court has pointed out on many occasions, documents prepared after a considerable period of time cannot be viewed as sufficiently reliable sources, given the length of time that has elapsed (see Novinskiy v. , no. 11982/02, \u00a7\u00a0105, 10 February 2009, and Shilbergs, \u00a7\u00a091, both cited above).",

The Court considers it regrettable that the extent of the Government\u2019s disclosure was restricted to just three extracts which appeared to have been chosen to reflect the situation in Mr Fetisov\u2019s cell on the day of his transfer or on the following day. On those dates cell 245, having four sleeping places, accommodated four persons and cell 291, having eight places, housed as many inmates. Even in the absence of similar documents covering other dates, useful information about the situation in other prison cells and the overall prison population may be deduced from the extracts submitted. It appears that the  prison was not generally plagued with the overcrowding problem, because no other cell had been filled beyond its design capacity.",

According to the statements, the cell was equipped with sixteen bunk beds and its population varied from 20 to 25 persons. The Court however finds the statements unconvincing for the following reasons. Firstly, although they were prepared more than six months after their authors had stayed in the cell, the statements were strikingly similar in their content to the point that many phrases were repeated verbatim, thus suggesting that they were not drafted spontaneously. Secondly, the cell records produced by the Government indicated that only seven \u2013 out of eight \u2013 inmates who had given the statement had shared the cell with Mr Fetisov in the winter of 2006-2007, whereas the author of the eighth statement had first moved into the cell in the mid-spring of 2007. Accordingly, the number of statements does not support the conclusion that there were more than eight cellmates in cell 291 at any given point. Had the cell population been larger than eight persons, surely it must have been possible to compile a verifiable list of their names or obtain further written statements. Thirdly, as noted above, the extracts from the prison register demonstrated that the prison had not been generally overcrowded. Even though the Government did not submit any reliable data covering the periods between September and December 2006 or between January and May 2007, it is highly improbable that the prison population could have spiked in those periods so sharply as to result in Mr\u00a0Fetisov\u2019s cell being filled to three times its design capacity. Besides, the statements listed the number of sleeping places, which was twice as large as that listed in the register. As that number obviously could not have fluctuated so significantly over a relatively short period of time, this factual inaccuracy further undermines the credibility of the statements.",

This information is too generic to be of any real evidentiary value (compare Rokhlina v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no.\u00a054071/00, 9\u00a0September 2004). The list of residents of cell 68 in the period from November 2007 to January 2008 contained eight names, including that of Mr Savinov. Two individuals were mentioned only by their first name and thus cannot be identified. The Court requested the Government to produce the cell records of their remaining five individuals, from which it became apparent that only three of them had actually shared the cell with Mr\u00a0Savinov and that the other two had been held elsewhere. In these circumstances, the Court does not consider the list to be credible. It follows that cell 68 actually accommodated four persons (Mr Savinov and three others), which is consistent with the entries in the prison population register.",

As the Court has pointed out above, the statements by the prison governor and warders are of little evidentiary value because of the two-year gap between the period under examination and the time of their drafting and also because of their vague wording and lack of references to any verifiable sources of information. The extracts from the prison population register are an important and reliable piece of evidence but the Government did not explain why they chose to submit just four extracts covering some random dates in 2007. The extent of their disclosure was obviously insufficient to make reliable findings of fact in respect of the entire fourteen-month period of Mr Balammedov\u2019s detention. Nevertheless, it appears from the extracts that the  prison did not suffer from overpopulation on those dates and even had some spare capacity which could be used to accommodate new inmates. In these circumstances, Mr Balammedov\u2019s affirmation that cell 1/3 had been filled to more than forty to sixty per cent beyond its design capacity and that such overcrowding had only occurred in between the dates on the extracts, appears implausible.",

By contrast, the applicants Mr Fetisov, Mr Savinov, Mr Shakurov, Mr Korobeynikov, Mr Balammedov, as well as Mr Telyubayev during his stays in the Yekaterinburg and Chelyabinsk facilities, had at their disposal at least four square metres of floor surface and a quantity of sleeping places sufficient for them and their cellmates (see paragraphs 98, 103, 118, 121, 125, 107 and 110 above). It cannot be said that the overall dimensions of their cells were so small as to restrict the inmates\u2019 freedom of movement beyond the threshold tolerated by Article 3.",

It is recalled that the Committee for the Prevention of Torture expressed strong concern and objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements frequently encountered in Central and Eastern European prisons, because the dormitories in question had been found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions. The Committee also noted that such accommodation inevitably implied a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives (see paragraph 29 of the 11th General Report, cited in paragraph 67 above). In Mr Balammedov\u2019s case, however, the Court was unable to establish that the dormitories were filled beyond the design capacity. Although premises shared by up to a hundred inmates undoubtedly restricted the privacy of the inhabitants, the floor plans submitted by the Government demonstrated that the toilet and washing facilities were located in a separate annex and that the lavatory pans were sufficient in number.",

Furthermore, the cell in which Mr Telyubayev was detained in  prison IZ-56/1 offered an extremely restricted personal space to detainees. Nevertheless, taking into account the cumulative effect of those conditions and in particular the brevity of Mr Telyubyev\u2019s stay at the Orenburg prison, the Court does not consider that the conditions of the applicants\u2019 detention, although far from adequate, reached the threshold of severity required to characterise the treatment as inhuman or degrading within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.
