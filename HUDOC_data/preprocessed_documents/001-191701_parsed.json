Furthermore, they stated, inter alia, that the main comment was that if the Minister intended to change the Committee\u2019s list of proposed candidates, such a change had to be specifically reasoned on the basis of their qualifications. Furthermore, it was noted that perhaps the candidates should be informed about the changes, at the latest before it was sent to Parliament or processed by it. On 28 May 2017 these views were reiterated by one of the lawyers in an email to the Permanent Secretary of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. He stated inter alia that if the Minister of Justice considered that there were flaws in the Committee\u2019s procedure or in its opinion, the Minister had two options. Firstly, the matter could be referred back to the Committee. Secondly, the Minister could herself remedy the flaws, which meant that the Minister had to evaluate all the candidates in the light of the Minister\u2019s objective and on the basis of lawful criteria. However, the lawyer suggested that the standard thing to do was to request the Committee to conduct a new evaluation. Furthermore, the lawyer noted that the Minister\u2019s decision to appoint judges was an administrative act and therefore it had to be performed in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act No.\u00a037/1993 (see paragraph 62 below). Lastly, he proposed that it might be wise to inform the candidates about the changed emphasis and give them an opportunity to present new information that could be relevant for the evaluation.",

Every candidate\u2019s points for each criterion had been registered in an evaluation table and the candidates had been ranked in accordance with their overall score. The Committee\u2019s conclusion had been to apply the same weight as had previously been applied for each criterion. As regards the second question, the Chairman explained that the Committee had not found that there had been numerous equally qualified candidates or that it had been impossible to name one more qualified than another. In this instance, fifteen positions had been advertised and the Committee had concluded that fifteen specific candidates had been more qualified than others for the positions. Therefore it had not been necessary to list more candidates. The Committee\u2019s evaluation table had clearly showed the ranking of the candidates. However, the Minister\u2019s idea had been that she be able to choose from among, for example, 20\u00a0candidates for the fifteen vacant posts. According to this idea, the candidate ranked 20th in the Committee\u2019s assessment could thus be chosen over candidates ranked 5th, 10th or in any position whatsoever. The Chairman stated that this idea would not have been in conformity with the purpose behind the prior Judiciary Act as it had been described in the preparatory works to the Act. The Chairman furthermore stated that the intention behind the legislative framework requiring a separate expert committee to assess candidates for judicial posts, and not the Minister himself or herself, was to safeguard judicial independence in the light of the developments in other European countries.",

Thus, the Minister had to ensure that her own investigation and assessment were based on similar expertise as members of the Evaluation Committee had in their work and that the Minister followed the Rules No. 620/2010, set by the Ministry itself (see paragraph 58 below) on the elements to be taken into account in such an assessment. The Supreme Court then emphasised that this was even more important when the law stipulates that the assessment report of the Committee limits the powers of the Minister and prohibits him or her from appointing a candidate to the post of judge that the Committee has considered not to be the most qualified, unless the Minister receives the consent of Parliament. The court stressed that in appointing judges, the Minister was not appointing persons to offices that are accountable to the Minister, but rather members of another branch of government which has a monitoring role vis-\u00e0-vis the other branches and is guaranteed independence by Article 61 of the Constitution and Section\u00a024 of the prior Judiciary Act.",

On the basis of such a comparison, the Minister should then have reasoned her decision to seek the approval of Parliament for her proposal to depart from the Committee\u2019s conclusions. Only in this manner could Parliament have sufficiently served its role in the process and taken a position on the Minister\u2019s assessment which departed from the assessment of the Committee.

Her proposal to include the four candidates had not been based on any new documents or an independent investigation of the facts on her part.

Although the Minister had not expressed herself in a manner directed at the reputation or personal honour of the plaintiffs, the Supreme Court concluded that it could not be disregarded that she should have been aware of the fact that her actions had unjustifiably been to the detriment of the reputation of the plaintiffs and thus caused them injury.

His claims were based on the ground that the procedure leading up to the appointment of A.E., one of the judges in his case before the Court of Appeal, had violated the new Judiciary Act and the Administrative Procedures Act. Furthermore, he argued that the Minister of Justice\u2019s proposal to Parliament, for the appointment of A.E., had violated the general principle of domestic law that authorities should appoint the most qualified candidate for office. Therefore, A.E.\u2019s appointment had not been in accordance with the law as required by Article 59 of the Constitution and Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. This had also resulted in him not enjoying a fair trial before an independent and impartial tribunal as stipulated in Article\u00a070 (1) of the Constitution and Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

In case that fails and the appointment is thus unlawful \u201cthe judge in question is not a lawful holder of judicial power and a court\u2019s judicial rulings in which he has participated constitute a dead letter\u201d, as is argued in [the applicant\u2019s] observations before the Supreme Court. The conclusion drawn from the cited words cannot be sustained unless it would be considered that a person\u2019s appointment as a judge under these circumstances would be a nullity (\u201cmarkleysa\u201d), thus not only that flaws in the appointment process would result in its annulment. It must be taken into account that in the aforementioned assessment report of the Evaluation Committee of 19 May 2017 it was concluded that all the 33 candidates fulfilled all the requirements provided for by law to hold the office of a judge in the Court of Appeal, a fact that has not been challenged. The appointment of the judges was conducted in accordance with the formal procedural rules of Chapter III of Act No. 50/2016, as well as temporary provision IV of the same Act, however with the exception that during the Parliamentary procedure on the Minister of Justice\u2019s proposals on the appointment of the judges, the requirements of the second paragraph of the temporary provision were not followed in that the Parliament should have voted on each and every judge separately, but not all the judges at the same time, as was in fact done. This issue, however, has already been addressed in the aforementioned judgment of the Supreme Court [of 19 December 2017], where it was concluded that this was a defect which did not have significance. Taking this into account, as well as the fact that all the fifteen judges were appointed to office by letters signed by the President of Iceland on 8 June 2017, co-signed by the Minister of Justice, it cannot be concluded that the appointment of [A.E.] was a nullity nor is it accepted that judicial rulings of the Court of Appeal, which she delivers along with others, are for that reason a \u201cdead letter\u201d.",

Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, it must be recalled that in the aforementioned judgments of the Supreme Court [of 19 December 2017] it was concluded that such flaws were in the procedure of the Minister of Justice preceding the appointment of the fifteen Court of Appeal judges that the State was liable in damages. In this case, this finding has in no way been challenged and these judgments have, therefore, evidentiary value in this respect in accordance with Section 116 (4) of the Civil Procedure Act. In this regard, it must also, in particular, be emphasised that it cannot be accepted, as was argued in the aforementioned memorandum of the Minister of Justice of 30 May 2017, that by only increasing the weight ascribed to judicial experience from that which such experience was ascribed by the Evaluation Committee in its internal table, relied upon in its assessment report of the 19th of the same month, but relying in other respects on the \u2018sufficient investigation\u2019 of the Committee as to each assessment factor, the finding could be made that four named candidates for the post of judge in the Court of Appeal, but not others, would be removed from the group of the fifteen most qualified, and four specific named candidates would be moved up into that group rather than others. When assessing the consequences of the said flaws in the Minister of Justice\u2019s procedure, account must be taken of the fact that the appointment of all the fifteen judges of the Court of Appeal for an indefinite term, which in no way has been annulled by a court, became a reality upon the signing of their letters of appointment, dated 8 June 2017. As stated above, all of them fulfilled the requirements of Section 21 (2) of Act No. 50/2016, for being appointed to the office of judge, including the requirement of item 8 of the said paragraph, that is being considered to be qualified to hold these offices in the light of their professional experience and legal knowledge. From that time, the judges have held positions, cf. Article 61 of the Constitution, which preclude them from being discharged from office except by a judicial decision. From the time the appointment of these judges took effect, they have, according to the same provision of the Constitution, cf. Section 43 (1) of Act No. 50/2016, been under the main obligation in the performance of their official duty to follow only the law. They have also been afforded, in accordance with the last mentioned provision of law, independence in their judicial work but also the duty to perform it under their own responsibility and never follow instructions from others in their work. With reference to all of the above, there is not a sufficient reason to justifiably doubt that [the applicant] enjoyed a fair trial before independent and impartial judges, in spite of the flaws in the procedure by the Minister of Justice.\u201d",

Section 228 of the Act states that when a District Court judgment has not been appealed or the time limit to appeal has passed, the Committee on Reopening of Judicial Proceedings (Enduruppt\u00f6kunefnd) can approve a request of a person who considers that he or she has been wrongly convicted or convicted of a more serious offence than he or she committed, to reopen the judicial proceedings before the District Court, if certain conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are, inter alia, that new evidence has come to light which could have had great significance for the conclusion of the case if it had been available before the judgment was announced (item a) or that there were serious defects in the processing of the case which affected its conclusion (item d). The State Prosecutor can request a reopening to the advantage of the convicted person if he considers that the conditions in paragraph 1 of Section 228 of the Act are fulfilled. In accordance with Section 229 of the Act, the request for reopening shall be in writing and sent to the Committee on Reopening of Judicial Proceedings. It shall include detailed reasoning on how the conditions for reopening are considered to be fulfilled. According to Section\u00a0231 of the Act, the Committee on Reopening of Judicial Proceedings decides whether proceedings will be reopened. If a request for reopening is approved the first judgment remains in force until a new judgment is delivered in the case. Section 232 of the Act states that the Committee on Reopening of Judicial Proceedings can accept a request for the reopening of a case which has been finally decided in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court and a new judgment be delivered if the conditions of Section 228 are fulfilled. A case will not be reopened in the Court of Appeal unless the time limit to request leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has expired or the Supreme Court has rejected leave to appeal.",

The Court of Appeal referred three questions to the EFTA Court. The third question was put forth in case the first two questions would be addressed by the EFTA Court after 16\u00a0January 2017. The third question concerned the principle of loyalty laid down in Article 3 of the EEA Agreement and the possibility for the EFTA States to question the validity of the decisions of the EFTA Court. In essence the question raised the issue whether, from 17 January 2017, the EFTA Court would be lawfully composed in a manner that ensures its independence and impartiality. The reason for the question was that by an ESA/Court Committee Decision of 1 December 2016, the regular judge of the EFTA Court in respect of Norway had been reappointed for a three-year term of office as of 17 January 2017.

This principle is reflected, inter alia, in Articles 2 and 15 of the Statute of the Court and Article 3 RoP. Second, it is vital not only that judges are independent and fair, they must also appear to be so.

All member states have some form of a constitution which, by differing means, (e.g. by long custom or a popular vote) is accepted as being the legitimate foundation of the state. The constitutions of all member states recognise and create (whether explicitly or implicitly) the role of a judiciary which is there to uphold the rule of law and to decide cases by applying the law in accordance with legislation and case law. Thus, the fact that a constitution creates a judiciary to carry out this role must itself thereby confer legitimacy upon the judiciary as a whole.

As the CCJE has pointed out, each system has advantages and disadvantages. It can be argued that appointment by vote of Parliament and, to a lesser degree, by the executive can be seen to give additional democratic legitimacy, although those methods of appointment carry with them a risk of politicisation and a dependence on those other powers. To counter those risks, the CCJE has recommended that every decision relating to a judge\u2019s appointment or career should be based on objective criteria and be either taken by an independent authority or subject to guarantees to ensure that it is not taken other than on the basis of such criteria. The CCJE has also recommended the participation of an independent authority with substantial representation chosen democratically by other judges in decisions concerning the appointment or promotion of judges. The constitutional legitimacy of individual judges who have security of tenure must not be undermined by legislative or executive measures brought about as a result of changes in political power.\u201d",

Austria, no. 7360/76, Commission report of 12 October 1978, Decisions and Reports (DR) 15, pp. 70 and 80). Also, in countries where the law is codified, the organisation of the judicial system cannot be left to the discretion of the judicial authorities, although this does not mean that the courts do not have some latitude to interpret relevant domestic legislation (Co\u00ebme and Others, cited above, \u00a7 98, and Savino and Others v.

In this regard, the Court emphasises that the requirement that a tribunal be established by law is closely connected to the other general requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1, on the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, both also being an integral part of the fundamental principle of the rule of law in a democratic society. In short, \u201cwhat is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public\u201d (Morice v France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7 78, 23 April 2015).",

It follows that a violation of this principle, like the principles under the same provision that a tribunal shall be independent and impartial, does not require a separate examination of whether the breach of the principle that a tribunal be established by law rendered a trial unfair. Furthermore, in the light of the requirement that a tribunal shall be established in accordance with national law, the Court is called upon to examine whether the domestic law has been complied with in this respect. The findings by the national courts are therefore subject to European supervision.

In this context, the concept of a \u201cflagrant\u201d breach of domestic law therefore relates to the nature and gravity of the alleged breach. Furthermore, in the Court\u2019s examination of whether the establishment of a tribunal was based on a \u201cflagrant\u201d violation of domestic law, the Court will take into account whether the facts before it demonstrate that a breach of the domestic rules on the appointment of judges was deliberate or, at a minimum, constituted a manifest disregard of the applicable national law (see also in this context, Judgment of the General Court of the European Union, cited above, \u00a7 77 (see paragraph 69 above)).",

Therefore, the Convention question before the Supreme Court was whether these violations of national law, viewed as a whole, were such that the participation of A.E., as a judge in the case of the applicant before the Court of Appeal, had had the result that his criminal charge was not determined by a tribunal established by law. In other words, the issue to be examined by the Supreme Court was not whether A.E.\u2019s appointment was, as such, a \u201cnullity\u201d under Icelandic administrative law, or whether her judgments would thus constitute a \u201cdead letter\u201d, but rather whether, assessed objectively, the overall process of her appointment as a judge had constituted a flagrant breach by the Minister of Justice and Parliament of the applicable rules in force at the material time in light of the Court\u2019s case-law flowing from Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

It follows that a violation of this principle, like the principles under the same provision that a tribunal shall be independent and impartial, does not require a separate examination of whether the breach of the principle that a tribunal be established by law rendered a trial unfair. Therefore, it is immaterial in the Court\u2019s assessment whether the violations adduced by the Supreme Court of the applicable rules in the appointment process had an impact on the fairness of the applicant\u2019s trial, as is argued by the Government. The mere fact that a judge, whose position is not established by law within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, determines a criminal charge, suffices for a finding of a violation of that provision in conformity with the fundamental principle of the rule of law.",

The Minister of Justice removed from the list of fifteen candidates, assessed as the most qualified by the Committee, four candidates ranked numbers 7, 11, 12 and 14 in the Committee\u2019s internal ranking, and placed four other candidates on her own list who were ranked lower at numbers 17, 18, 23 and 30 respectively. Although the Minister of Justice was statutorily authorised under domestic law to propose different candidates than those proposed by the Committee, provided that her choices were approved by Parliament, the Supreme Court found that the Minister had proceeded in this manner without an independent examination of the merits of the candidates in question and without any further collection of evidence or other materials to substantiate her conclusions. Therefore the breaches of national law by the Minister of Justice in the process of appointing the four judges in question, including A.E., were fundamental and formed an integral part of the appointment process in the assessment and selection of these judges to the newly established appellate court.",

This finding was once again confirmed by the Supreme Court in the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraph 50 above), the court finding that it could not accept, as had been argued by the Minister of Justice in her memorandum to Parliament of 30 May 2017 (see paragraph 18 above), \u201cthat by only increasing the weight ascribed to judicial experience from that which such experience was ascribed by the Evaluation Committee in its internal table, relied upon in its assessment report ..., but relying in other respects on the \u2018sufficient investigation\u2019 of the Committee as to each assessment factor, the finding could be made that four named candidates for the post of judge in the Court of Appeal, but not others, would be removed from the group of the fifteen most qualified, and four specific named candidates would be moved up into that group rather than others\u201d. It follows in the Court\u2019s view that these violations of national law by the Minister, as confirmed by the Supreme Court, lay at the core of the process of selecting the candidates for the vacant posts in the new Court of Appeal, thus constituting a defect of a fundamental nature in the overall process of appointment of the four judges.",

In fact, it transpires from the documents before the Court, and the factual findings by the Supreme Court in its judgments of 19\u00a0December 2017, that the Minister of Justice had received expert advice from lawyers within the administration to that effect before submitting her proposal to Parliament (see paragraph 13 above).",

As also found by the Supreme Court, the Minister did not provide a sufficient justification for her decision to remove the candidates placed numbers 7, 11, 12 and 14, respectively, in the opinion of the Committee and include rather candidates placed lower in the Committee\u2019s ranking at numbers 17, 18, 23 and 30.

Moreover, deviating from the general rules in the appointment of judges in Iceland as a new Court of Appeal was to be established, Parliament had decided that with the enactment of the new Judiciary Act, and in particular temporary provision IV, the Minister of Justice would not solely be vested with the nominating authority to the President of Iceland. Therefore, in accordance with temporary provision IV to the new Judiciary Act, the Supreme Court interpreted the provision in the applicant\u2019s case to require that Parliament itself was to vote on each and every candidate in a separate vote. By failing to do so, Parliament, by a divided vote along party-political lines (see paragraph 22 above), also departed from the applicable rule for the appointment of fifteen judges to the new Court of Appeal set by itself in primary legislation.",

Taking account of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in the applicant\u2019s case, which found a breach of this provision as regards the requirement of separate voting by Parliament on each judicial candidate, it must therefore be concluded that this legislative framework was intended to minimise the risk of party-political interests unduly influencing the process by which the qualifications of each candidate to the newly established Court of Appeal were to be evaluated and ultimately confirmed by the legislative branch, the Parliament.",

Therefore, the Court finds that the failure of Parliament to adhere to the national rule of separate voting on each candidate, as confirmed by the Supreme Court, also amounted to a serious defect in the appointment procedure, having an impact on the integrity of the process as a whole, in particular as regards the four candidates selected by the Minister of Justice whereby she departed from the assessment of the Committee. This defect was furthermore compounded by the fact, as confirmed by the Supreme Court, that in the preparation of the proposals submitted to Parliament, the Minister had herself violated the Administrative Procedures Act in failing to sufficiently substantiate her decision to depart from the assessment made by the Evaluation Committee as regards the four particular candidates. The Court recalls that the Supreme Court held in its judgments of 19 December 2017 (paragraph\u00a034 above) that only by the Minister fulfilling her statutory duties under the Administrative Procedures Act and the general principle of domestic law that only the most qualified candidate should be selected for office could Parliament have sufficiently served its role in the process and taken a position on the Minister\u2019s assessment which departed from the opinion of the Committee as regards the four candidates in question.",

Indeed, the Court finds that the process was one in which the executive branch exerted undue discretion, not envisaged by the legislation in force, on the choice of four judges to the new Court of Appeal, including A.E., coupled with Parliament failing to adhere to the legislative scheme previously enacted to secure an adequate balance between the executive and legislative branches in the appointment process. Furthermore, the Minister of Justice acted, as found by the Supreme Court, in manifest disregard of the applicable rules in deciding to replace four of the fifteen candidates, considered among the most qualified by the Committee, by other four applicants, assessed less qualified, including A.E. The process was therefore to the detriment of the confidence that the judiciary in a democratic society must inspire in the public and contravened the very essence of the principle that a tribunal must be established by law, one of the fundamental principles of the rule of law. The Court emphasises that a contrary finding on the facts of the present case would be tantamount to holding that this fundamental guarantee provided for by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention would be devoid of meaningful protection. Therefore, the Court concludes that there has been a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the present case.",

Portugal [GC], nos. 55391/13, 57728/13 and 74041/13, \u00a7\u00a0222, 6 November 2018). In this regard, the Court emphasises the importance of ensuring that domestic procedures are in place whereby a case may be re-examined in the light of a finding that Article 6 of the Convention has been violated. As the Court has previously stressed, such procedures may be regarded as an important aspect of the execution of its judgments and their availability demonstrates a Contracting State\u2019s commitment to the Convention and to the Court\u2019s case-law (Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no. 19867/12, \u00a7 99, 11 July 2017).",

This argument is dismissed on the grounds that the flaws in the appointment process were not such that the appointment of A.E., while susceptible of being annulled, would constitute a \u201cnullity\u201d.

It noted that the appointment of all fifteen judges had become a reality upon the signing of their letters of appointment by the President. From that time, those judges had held positions which precluded them from being discharged from office except by a judicial decision. Once appointed, they were under the obligation to follow only the law in the performance of their official duty, and they were afforded independence in their judicial work.

The Supreme Court found, referring to the Evaluation Committee\u2019s report, that all 33 candidates fulfilled all the requirements to hold the office of judge of the Court of Appeal. In this context it is important to note that the requirements to which the Supreme Court was referring were requirements of a substantive nature. Such requirements are crucial parts of the rules on the selection of judges (compare Fedotova, cited above, \u00a7 42, and Ilatovskiy, cited above, \u00a7 40). As a result of fulfilling the substantive requirements, any of the candidates, once appointed, would have the legitimacy to serve as a judge and decide cases (see opinion no. 18/2015 of the Consultative Council of European Judges of 16 October 2015, point 14, quoted in paragraph 70 of the present judgment). Moreover, all candidates were assessed by the Evaluation Committee. However, the conclusions of that Committee were not binding on the Minister. The fact that some candidates were preferred above others, was a matter of assessment of their respective qualities. On this issue, the Evaluation Committee and the Minister could legitimately have different opinions. It is true that, as established by the Supreme Court, the Minister did not perform her assessment in accordance with the relevant rules. In the relationship between the candidates and the State, not only have the flaws in the selection process been established, but also the consequences thereof have been repaired (see the Supreme Court judgments of 19\u00a0September 2017 ordering the State to pay compensation for non-pecuniary damage to two disappointed candidates; see paragraphs 31-35 of the present judgment), or are in the process of being repaired (proceedings instituted by two other disappointed candidates, currently pending before the Court of Appeal; see paragraphs 52-54 of the present judgment).",

Indeed, the \u201cflagrant breach of domestic law\u201d test, in its common understanding, applies to very different situations from the one at hand. In a number of cases the Court held that it could not question the interpretation of domestic law by a domestic court unless there had been a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d or a \u201cflagrant breach\u201d of domestic law (see, specifically with respect to the requirement that a tribunal must be established \u201cby law\u201d, Lavents, cited above, \u00a7 114; Accardi and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 30598/02, ECHR 2005II; Jorgic v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a074613/01, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2007III; DMD GROUP, a.s., v.\u00a0Slovakia, no.\u00a019334/03, \u00a7 61, 5 October 2010; Kontalexis v.

The Court nowadays uses a somewhat different test, that of an \u201carbitrary or manifestly unreasonable\u201d interpretation by the domestic court (see, among others, Radomilja and Others v. Croatia [GC], nos. 37685/10 and 22768/12, \u00a7 149, 20\u00a0March 2018; S., V. and A. v. Denmark [GC], nos. 35553/12 and 2 others, \u00a7\u00a0148, 22\u00a0October 2018; and Molla Sali v. Greece [GC], no. 20452/14, \u00a7\u00a0149, 19\u00a0December 2018). The present case has nothing to do with an erroneous interpretation of domestic law. In any event, the majority do not question the interpretation of domestic law by the Supreme Court; they rather rely on its findings in this respect (see paragraphs 107, 113, 115 and 118 of the judgment).",

Nothing is said about the general measures that may have to be adopted in order to ensure that violations similar to the one that occurred in the present case will not occur in other cases. We note that the issue raised by the applicant in the present case may arise anew in any of the cases that are brought, or will be brought, before the Court of Appeal. It will be for the competent authorities, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, to tackle this thorny issue.",

The question will undoubtedly arise whether and to what extent court decisions can be challenged on the basis of a flaw in the procedure for appointing a judge to sit on the bench, a flaw which may have occurred a long time before the case arrived before that judge. May we predict that this is an issue that, sooner rather than later, will return to the Court, in the framework either of its contentious jurisdiction or of its newly acquired advisory jurisdiction?",
