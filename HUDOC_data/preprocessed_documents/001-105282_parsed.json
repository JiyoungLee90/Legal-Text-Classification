Since, in the Court\u2019s view, the length of the proceedings in the present case was also mainly caused by repeated remittals owing to the incomplete findings of fact and not by the failure of the domestic authorities to give their decisions within the statutory time-limits, it considers that the applicant, in order to exhaust domestic remedies, was not obliged to bring an action for failure to respond or use an appeal for failure to respond more assiduously.",

That approach was followed by county courts and the Supreme Court after a constitutional complaint, as a remedy for the length of proceedings, was replaced by a request for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time when the new Courts Act entered into force on 29\u00a0December 2005 (see paragraph 35 above).",

Nevertheless, that was after the applicant in the present case lodged her application with the Court on 30\u00a0April 2007. In this connection the Court reiterates that the issue whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is normally determined by reference to the date when the application was lodged with the Court (see Baumann v. France, no.\u00a033592/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001V). While it is true that this rule is subject to exceptions which may be justified by the specific circumstances of each case (see, for example, Brusco v.  (dec.), no.\u00a069789/01, ECHR 2001IX; and Nogolica v. Croatia (dec.), no.\u00a077784/01, ECHR 2002VIII), the Court considers, having due regard to the subsidiary character of the Convention machinery, that in the present case there are no special circumstances to justify making an exception to that rule. Therefore, the applicant was not bound to lodge a constitutional complaint or a request for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time in order to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

As neither constitutional complaint nor a request for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time alone could be considered effective remedies for the length of administrative proceedings in the period before 20 June 2007 (see paragraphs 49-51 above), it follows that the aggregate of available remedies did not in the present case satisfy the requirement of \u201ceffectiveness\u201d under Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Bo\u017ei\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 36).",
