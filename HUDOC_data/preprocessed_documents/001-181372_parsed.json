Thus the electoral threshold means that political parties must be representative, to some extent, of the electorate, as required by the sovereignty principle. in the case of independent candidates, however, such a criterion would be absurd; ... they are asked to submit support lists comprising the signatures of a minimum 4% of all the voters registered in the permanent electoral lists of the boards to which they submit their candidacies, [and the total number should not be lower that] 2,000 electors in the case of the Chamber of Deputies and 4,000\u00a0electors in the case of the Senate. Consequently, for general elections, the legislature had laid down this precondition, which is necessary in order to stand as an independent candidate, and simultaneously in order to exercise the right to be elected. Nevertheless, in relation to by-elections, the legislature failed to lay down the requisite conditions for this category of persons standing for election, providing that the category of candidates for by-elections comprised only political parties and organisations of citizens belonging to national minorities having passed the legal electoral threshold at the general elections, whether individually or in the framework of a political or electoral alliance. That being the case, it is a case not of setting limits on or circumscribing the manner of exercising the right to be elected, but of annulling that right by failing to recognise it, [by an] unlawful absence of regulation.",

It provides for forty-three constituencies nationwide, each made up of several wards. The Law defines a single-member ward (colegiu uninominal) as a unit of an electoral constituency in which one mandate only is assigned. Section 29 (1) of the Law provides that each entity participating in the election (a political party, a political or electoral alliance or an organisation of citizens belonging to a national minority) can put up one candidate only in an electoral ward. In particular, section\u00a030 of the Law lays down that an independent candidate must prove that he or she is supported by at least 4% des electors registered on the electoral rolls in the ward in which he or she is proposing to stand, provided that this proportion amounts to at least 2,000 voters in the case of the Chamber of Deputies and 4,000 in the case of the Senate. The Law also provides that by-elections should be held where elections are cancelled in a given constituency or where a deputy\u2019s or senator\u2019s seat has fallen vacant.",

The threshold is set, as a general rule, at 5% of votes validly cast at the national level, and there is also a requirement on obtaining at least six single-member wards for the Chamber of Deputies and three single-member wards for the Senate. The threshold is slightly higher for political and electoral alliances, and a special threshold is set for organisations of citizens belonging to national minorities. Section 48 of the Law provides that votes should be distributed in two stages. The first distribution of votes takes place at constituency level, according to the individual constituency\u2019s electoral quotient; section 48 (3) provides that that quotient should be calculated on the basis of the number of votes validly cast for political formations which have passed the electoral threshold and the number of Deputies and Senators to be elected in the constituency. Section 48 (4) governs the assignment of seats to independent candidates. The latter are assigned a seat if they have obtained a majority of the votes validly cast in the ward in which they were standing. Under section 48 (5), unused votes and votes falling below the electoral quotient for a given constituency are redistributed at national level during the second stage.",

The Constitutional Court ruled that the Venice Commission\u2019s recommendation had been complied with because Law no.\u00a035/2008 had been amended under an organic law, thus satisfying the criterion of a level higher than an ordinary law. The Court takes note of the Constitutional Court\u2019s conclusion inasmuch as, under the Romanian system covered by the Venice Commission\u2019s recommendations, organic laws require a broader consensus since they are enacted on a majority of the members of both chambers of Parliament, unlike ordinary laws, which are enacted on a majority of members present (see paragraph\u00a016 above). The Court also has regard to the particular context of by-elections, noting that they are not designed to be held at regular, foreseeable intervals, are random in nature and depend on parliamentary seats falling vacant. Furthermore, the Court notes that the legislative procedure for amending the Electoral Law began in August 2008 and ended with the enactment of Law no.\u00a0323/2009 of 20 October 2009 (see paragraph 18 above), and that the by-elections in issue in the present case were held in January 2010.",

The domestic authorities examined all his pleas and dismissed his appeal by a reasoned decision. The Court observes in particular that in its decision of 14 January 2010 the Romanian Constitutional Court held that the restrictions imposed during the by-elections had been justified by the need to preserve the structure of Parliament as it had emerged from the general elections (see paragraph 9 above). Like the Romanian Constitutional Court, the Court does not challenge the aim of preserving the structure of Parliament and preventing the fragmentation of the political spectrum emerging from the general elections, which aim could justify the restriction on candidates from parties unrepresented in Parliament wishing to stand in the by-elections.",

In the instant case, in order to justify the limitation imposed during the by-elections, the Constitutional Court had taken into account the electoral threshold which political parties had to pass in order to enter Parliament.
