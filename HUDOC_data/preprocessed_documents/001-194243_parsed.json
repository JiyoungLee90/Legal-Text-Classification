The Court also found in subsequent cases concerning the Transdniestrian region that up until at least July 2010, the \u201cMRT\u201d was only able to continue to exist, and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region, because of Russian military, economic and political support (see Ivan\u0163oc and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 116-20; Catan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0121-22; and Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110).

The Court notes that while describing the various violations of his rights, the applicant noted inter alia, that his case had not been examined by a judge authorised to adopt a lawful decision. The Court, being the master of characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case, considers that the complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 2 and 3 are to be examined under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. It thus finds that, read together, the complaints under Articles 5 and 6 concerned the lawfulness of the decision adopted by an \u201cMRT\u201d court convicting him to 15 days\u2019 detention.

Estonia [GC], no.\u00a064569/09, \u00a7 120, 16 June 2015). One of the requirements flowing from the expression \u201cprescribed by law\u201d is foreseeability. Thus, a norm cannot be regarded as a \u201claw\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct; he must be able \u2013 if need be with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2007IV, Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, \u00a7 141, ECHR 201, and Delfi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0121).",
