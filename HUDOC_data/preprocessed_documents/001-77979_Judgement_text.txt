The case originated in an application (no. 15464/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Kazimierz Drabicki (“the applicant”), on 8 October 2001.
The applicant was represented by his son, Mr J. Drabicki. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 28 November 2005 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the applicant’s complaint concerning the length of proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1926 and lives in Rzeszów.
In 1992 the applicant, who was a pensioner, received from the Social Security Board (Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych) a substantial amount of money (over 57,000,000 old Polish zlotys) by way of adjustment of his pension.
Subsequently, the Social Security Board found that the sum had been awarded to the applicant by mistake and started to deduct money from his pension. The applicant instituted proceedings against the Board. According to the applicant, in 1996 the Rzeszow Court of Appeal allowed his action and found that the Board’s deductions had been illegal.
On 28 July 1997 the Social Security Board instituted civil proceedings against the applicant in the Rzeszów District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) claiming the remaining sum of PLN 10,000.
Between 7 November 1997 and 24 February 1998 the court held four hearings.
On 10 March 1998 the court gave judgment in which it allowed the plaintiff’s action. The applicant appealed against the judgment.
On 9 June 1998 the  (Sąd Wojewódzki) held a hearing at which it dismissed the applicant’s appeal. On 6 August 1998 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).
On 11 April 2001, sitting in camera, the Supreme Court refused to entertain the cassation appeal.
On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings.
