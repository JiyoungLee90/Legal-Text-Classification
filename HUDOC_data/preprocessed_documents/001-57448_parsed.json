The appeal proceedings commenced on 18 April 1975 after this challenge had been rejected by the Court of Cassation, but the accused applied for an adjournment. On the evidence of a medical certificate, he claimed that he was in hospital being treated for renal colic and was thus unable to appear. The court found that he was deliberately refusing to appear (contumace) and proceeded with the hearing. Thereupon the defence entered a fresh challenge in respect of the presiding judge and lodged an objection impugning the Assize Court of Appeal on grounds of bias; the challenge and the objection were dismissed by the Court of Cassation on 28 April. In the absence of the applicant, the proceedings then resumed before the Assize Court of Appeal, which refused to hear some of the defence witnesses. Considering that they could no longer perform their duties in these circumstances, the applicant's principal counsel withdrew from the case, and the defence was from then on conducted by a single lawyer who had been instructed not long before.",

There had also been an abuse of powers, since the matter had been one, not of requiring Mr. Bozano to leave French territory, but of handing him over to the country which was more likely than any other to extradite him to Italy; and a manifest error of judgment, inasmuch as the order complained of was based on the applicant's behaviour in France - the use of a false document had seemed to him to be the only way of escaping prosecution for a crime of which he held he was innocent, and the investigating judge had found that there were a considerable number of extenuating circumstances in relation to the offence (see paragraph 19 above). The authorities should have looked at the whole case to determine whether Mr. Bozano's presence amounted to a threat to public order. The order complained of had not complied with the provisions of Community law (Article 48 of the Treaty of Rome and EEC Directive 64/221). Furthermore, the authorities had disregarded all the formal requirements of Directive 64/221 and the Decree of 5 January 1970: Mr. Bozano had not been served with a refusal to issue a residence permit, had not been able to submit his observations to the Deportation Board, had not been informed of the reasons of public policy on which the administrative decision was based, and had not been given a reasonable period to leave French territory. Only urgency could have absolved the executive from its duty to comply with these mandatory rules, but there had been no such urgency in the instant case nor had it been relied on at any time.",

The Government also relied on two judgments, dated 5 December 1978 and 20 February 1979. In the first of these (Berrebouh), the Indictment Division of the Lyon Court of Appeal had held that \"in order to ensure immediate enforcement of a deportation order where this is dictated by the same need to protect public order as prompted the decision to deport in the first place, the taking into custody of a deported alien\" cannot be made conditional on \"a prior finding that he has refused to comply voluntarily with the order and has thereby committed a criminal offence punishable under article 27(1) of the Ordinance of 2 November 1945\" (translation) (Juris-Classeur p\u00e9riodique, 1979, jurisprudence, no. 19207).

As to the Limoges Administrative Court, it did not rule on the lawfulness of the police action of 26-27 October 1979, since the applicant had not made any submissions on the point; the court took them into account in its judgment of 22 December 1981 only as revealing the ministerial authority's motives at the time the order of 17 September 1979 was made.

Moreover, Mr. Bozano stated that on 20 September he had applied for a residence permit at Haute-Vienne Pr\u00e9fecture, which had refused to issue him an acknowledgement of receipt of his application (see paragraph 20 above). That such an application was indeed made seems to be confirmed by the letter Mr. Yves Henry, the applicant's lawyer, sent to the Prefect on 27 September (ibid.). The Government did not dispute that the application was made, but stated that there was no trace of it in the official archives and that in any case the deportation order of 17 September was a bar to issuing the permit sought.

Mr. Bozano was not even able to speak to his wife or his lawyer and at no time was any offer made to him that he should be expelled - if necessary under supervision - across the frontier of his choice or even across the nearest frontier, the Spanish border. On the contrary, he was forced to travel from  to the customs post at Moillesulaz - some twelve hours and several hundred kilometres away -, handcuffed and flanked by policemen who in due course handed him over to Swiss colleagues (see paragraphs 25-26 above). Mr. Bozano's precise, detailed description of the events strongly suggests that this is what happened.

Depriving Mr. Bozano of his liberty in this way amounted in fact to a disguised form of extradition designed to circumvent the negative ruling of 15 May 1979 by the Indictment Division of the Limoges Court of Appeal, and not to \"detention\" necessary in the ordinary course of \"action ... taken with a view to deportation\". The findings of the presiding judge of the Paris tribunal de grande instance - even if obiter - and of the Limoges Administrative Court, even if that court had only to determine the lawfulness of the order of 17 September 1979, are of the utmost importance in the Court's view; they illustrate the vigilance displayed by the French courts.",
