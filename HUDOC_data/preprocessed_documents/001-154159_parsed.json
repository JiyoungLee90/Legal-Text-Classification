However, it emphasises that, in order to enable the Court to examine the merits of a complaint about conditions of detention under Article 3 of the Convention, an applicant must provide an elaborate and consistent account of the conditions of his or her detention mentioning the specific elements, such as for instance the dates of his or her transfer between facilities, which would enable the Court to determine that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded or inadmissible on any other grounds (ibid., \u00a7 122). The Court points out in this connection that the applicant\u2019s initial description of his grievance was limited to a statement that he had shared a sleeping place with two or three inmates and that the dates mentioned by him were erroneous (see paragraph 23 above).",

Given that the applicant did not contest their authenticity, the Court is satisfied that those extracts were the original documents which had been prepared during the periods under examination and which showed the number of sleeping places in the cells where the applicant had stayed and the actual number of inmates who had been present in those cells on those dates. The Court, accordingly, lends credence to the primary documents produced by the Government (see Fetisov and Others v.
