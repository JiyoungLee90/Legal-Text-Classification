The \u201cproposal for registration\u201d of 19 May 1964, signed by an inspector, I.K., states that the applicant was approached about collaboration with the secret police and that \u201che gladly agreed to it, [saying] that he would do anything for the [security] service, as long as his father and the school do not find out\u201d. A \u201cquestionnaire\u201d with a handwritten date of 10\u00a0February 1965, states, inter alia, that the applicant was recruited on the ground of \u201ccompromising material\u201d and that he had not received any material benefit in exchange for his collaboration. That the applicant was recruited on the ground of compromising material is also noted in another questionnaire of 10 January 1968 where, next to the pseudonym \u201cLambe\u201d, there is a handwritten note \u201cand Lamda\u201d. The record contains a number of reports of various dates between 1964 and 1966, composed mostly by the inspector who relied on \u201cLambe\u201d as a source of information, about conversations and statements of some high-school and university students on certain political and social issues at the time. \u201cLambe\u201d provided the information mostly verbally; only a few reports in the file are based on his letters (which were not in the file). There are also copies of two payment receipts dated May and December 1965 and a proposal of 1983 for deregistration of the collaborator \u201cLamda\u201d. The deregistration referred to a person with the applicant\u2019s name but who in the 1970s was a student at the Technical Faculty, and who in 1983 was working in the municipal branch of the Communist Party.",

From four reports, it is apparent that also later on, as a student in Skopje, he gave information about students of various faculties, of which in the personal record there are five reports concerning a number of individuals whom the [secret police] monitored and had information that they were dissatisfied with the authorities in view of their weak interest in the situation of the Macedonians in the Aegean [in Greece] and Pirin [in Bulgaria] Macedonia, as well as for various wrongs committed against Macedonians in the western part of Macedonia.

A democratic state based on the rule of law has sufficient means at its disposal to ensure that the cause of justice is served and the guilty are punished - it cannot, and should not, however, cater to the desire for revenge instead of justice. It must instead respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as the right to due process and the right to be heard, and it must apply them even to those people who, when they were in power, did not apply them themselves. A state based on the rule of law can also defend itself against a resurgence of the communist totalitarian threat, since it has ample means at its disposal which do not conflict with human rights and the rule of law, and are based upon the use of both criminal justice and administrative measures...",

Secondly, the right of defence, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed. Revenge may never be a goal of such measures, nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed.

In addition, in this case the applicant was lustrated for having collaborated with the communist-era secret police and not, like in the Polish cases, for submitting a false declaration in that regard (which the Court considered to be analogous to, inter alia, the criminal offence of perjury, see Matyjek, \u00a7 52). Lastly, any doubts as to whether those subject to lustration could be held criminally liable for submitting false declarations (see paragraph 79 in conjunction with paragraph 97 above) were dispelled by rather general findings of the public prosecutor in the applicant\u2019s case, who made it clear that such conduct could not constitute a criminal offence (see paragraph 60 above).",

From their content it seems that the statements critical of the Constitutional Court were prompted by its decisions to first suspend and then invalidate certain provisions of the Lustration Act (see paragraphs\u00a012 and 15-16 above). This would appear to have reinforced the preconceived opinion of the ruling party\u2019s leaders that the court was against them because the majority of its judges had been appointed during the term of the former President of the Republic, whose party had been in opposition since July 2006, and because it had invalidated some other reform legislation of their Government.",

In that letter, which was directed at the opponents of lustration, the Prime Minister used the initial findings of the Commission to denounce the applicant as a collaborator of the secret police of the former regime, who, still controlled by a certain \u201ccentre of power\u201d, was the one behind the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions invalidating a number of legislative reforms of his Government (see paragraph 32 above).",

In view of the nature of his grievances, the applicant should have availed himself of the civil avenue of redress by bringing an action under section 177 of the Civil Proceedings Act, before an ordinary (civil) court, whereby he could have asked for a declaratory judgment establishing the authenticity or otherwise of the data in his file (see paragraph 105 above). The Government added that once thereby obtained, the declaratory judgment could serve as a ground to seek reopening of the lustration proceedings. The applicant had instead pursued only the administrative avenue of redress, and had asked the Administrative Court to adjudicate on the authenticity of the files as well as on the veracity of his statement (see paragraph 43 above). This claim had fallen short of the competency of the Administrative Court, which was empowered to review only the lawfulness of administrative acts (see paragraph 85 above).",

Apart from these wide-ranging employment restrictions, a further consequence of the Commission\u2019s decision is that in the eyes of society the applicant was and continues to be stigmatised as informer of the secret police of the former oppressive regime, and thus inherently unworthy of performing any public function in a democratic State based on the rule of law.

However, the domestic authorities, including the courts, were not called on by the terms of the applicable domestic law to address that issue, since, as the Supreme Court intimated, given the statutory definition of collaboration (see the preceding paragraph), the presence or absence of compulsion was not relevant for the adoption and legality of the contested decision.

While it is true that the findings of the domestic authorities suggest that he had continued to collaborate as an adult, his contact with the secret police ceased at the latest in 1983, if not earlier (see paragraphs 34 and 38 above). That was some twenty seven years before the lustration proceedings were instituted against him (see, a fortiori, Sidabras and D\u017eiautas, cited above, \u00a7 60, and \u017di\u010dkus, cited above, \u00a7 33). Therefore, and having regard to the nature of his involvement with the former secret police, the Court is not persuaded that after twenty seven years the applicant posed such a threat, if any, to a democratic society as would justify an interference in the form of five-year long wide-ranging restrictions on his professional activities and the related stigma of a collaborator which he would continue to carry even longer. That is especially so because the domestic authorities did not make any assessment of the possible threat posed by the applicant (see S\u00f5ro, cited above, loc. cit.).",
