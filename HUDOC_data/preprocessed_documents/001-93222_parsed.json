They did not do so, as in one of the applications examined in Velikovi and Others (see \u00a7\u00a7 226-228) \u2013 the case of Tzilevi. The Court considers that as a result the applicants forewent the opportunity to obtain between 15% and 25% of the amount which in accordance with relevant regulations represented the value of the property at the time, as that was the rate at which bonds were traded until the end of 2004. The fact that bond prices rose at the end of 2004 cannot lead to the conclusion that the authorities would have secured adequate compensation. Indeed, the applicants could not have foreseen bond prices or legislative amendments and the Court cannot speculate whether they would have waited four or more years before cashing their bonds. Furthermore, the legislation on compensation changed frequently and was not foreseeable (Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 191 and 226). As the Court ruled in Velikovi and Others, the applicants\u2019 failure to use the bond compensation scheme must be taken into consideration under Article 41, but cannot affect decisively the outcome of their Article 1 Protocol 1 complaint.",
