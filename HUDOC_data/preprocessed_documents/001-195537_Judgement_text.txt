The case originated in three applications against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”). The application numbers and the dates on which they were lodged with the Court, as well as the applicants’ personal details, are listed in the appended table.
The applicants were represented by lawyers from NGO Materi Chechni. The Russian Government (“the Government” ) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
Notice of the complaints was given to the Government.
The Government did not object to the examination of the applications by a Committee.
The applicants are Russian nationals who at the material time lived in the Chechen Republic. They are close relatives of individuals who disappeared in that region between 2000 and 2004 after allegedly being unlawfully detained by State agents. The applicants received no reliable news of their missing relatives thereafter.
In each of the cases, the applicants complained of the respective disappearance to law-enforcement bodies, and an official investigation was instituted. The proceedings in respect of each case, after being suspended and resumed on several occasions, are still pending, without any tangible results having been attained.
Summaries of the facts in respect of each application are set out below. Each account of events is based on statements provided to the Court and the domestic investigating authorities by the applicants, their relatives and/or neighbours, and other witnesses. The Government did not dispute the principal facts of the cases, as presented by the applicants, but contested the involvement of State agents in the incidents in question.
The applicant is the wife of Mr Khamzat Beldurov, who was born in 1963. At the material time they resided in Sernovodskaya (also known as Sernovodsk), Chechnya.
On 8 January 2002 Mr Beldurov left his home in Sernovodskaya to look for a job in Nazran, in the neighbouring region of Ingushetia, and never returned. The whereabouts of Mr Beldurov remain unknown.
According to the applicant, at some point after Mr Beldugov’s disappearance, an anonymous man informed her that around the time of her husband’s disappearance he had allegedly seen him getting into a car at a military checkpoint located at the border of Chechnya and Ingushetia.
On 11 November 2002 the sister of Mr Khamzat Beldurov, Ms Z.B., complained to the authorities that “in January 2002 Khamzat Beldurov had left home in search of work and has not returned since” and requested that criminal proceedings be opened.
On 14 November 2002 the criminal search unit of the Sunzhenskiy district police department opened operational search file no. 23005.
On 15 November 2002 the police interviewed the applicant, who stated that the complaint had been lodged with a delay as her husband would leave home for months at a time, taking on seasonal construction work in Ingushetia. About three to four months after Mr Beldurov had left in search of work, in April or May 2002, his identity documents had been found in a market in Ordzhenikidzevskaya, Ingushetia, and brought to her by an anonymous man. According to some rumours, in the summer of 2002 Khamzat Beldurov had been detained in the Republic of Abkhazia on suspicion of participation in illegal armed groups, but had then been released.
On various dates in November and December 2002 the police interviewed a number of Mr Beldurov’s relatives, none of whom had any information concerning either the circumstances of his disappearance or his whereabouts.
On 7 January 2003 Mr Beldurov’s name was put on the list of missing persons.
On 26 December 2005 the Achkhoy-Martan inter-district prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. 59023 under Article 105 of the Criminal Code (murder). It appears that the decision had been preceded by another complaint from the applicant or her relatives.
On 3 January 2006 the investigators examined the crime scene at the applicant’s house.
On 3 January 2006 the applicant was granted victim status and on 9 January 2006 she was questioned. She confirmed her previous statement, adding that the man who had brought her husband’s identity documents to her in 2002 had been called Ruslan.
On various dates between January and March 2006 the investigators questioned a number of Mr Beldurov’s relatives and neighbours. No new information was received.
On various dates in the spring of 2006, a number of law-enforcement agencies in Chechnya and Ingushetia replied to the investigators’ requests for information on Mr Beldurov, stating that they had neither arrested nor detained him.
On 26 April 2006 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators. It is unclear whether the applicant was informed thereof.
On an unspecified date in 2007 the applicant spoke with the investigators and they assured her that the proceedings were in progress and a number of steps were being taken to establish her husband’s whereabouts.
On 27 May 2009 the applicant wrote to the Chechnya Ombudsman asking for information on the progress in the investigation. Her request was forwarded to the investigators, who on 11 August 2009 informed her that the proceedings in the criminal case had been suspended on 26 April 2006.
On an unspecified date in June 2016 the investigation was resumed and the applicant and several of her relatives were questioned again. No new information was obtained.
It appears that the investigation is still pending.
On an unspecified date in 2009 the applicant challenged the decision of 26 April 2006 to suspend the investigation before the Achkhoy-Martan District Court (“the court”). On 24 August 2009 the court dismissed the complaint, finding that the suspension had been lawful. On 7 October 2009 the Chechnya Supreme Court quashed that decision and remitted the case for a fresh examination. On 19 November 2009 the court dismissed the case in view of the applicant’s decision to discontinue the proceedings.
The first applicant is the mother of Mr Ibragim Nurkayev, who was born in 1978, the second applicant is his father and the third applicant is his brother.
In the evening of 14 July 2000 (in the documents submitted the date was also referred to as 15 July 2000) Mr Nurkayev left his home in Zenitnaya Street in Grozny and never returned. Shortly after he had left the house, the first applicant heard gunfire and went outside to check what was going on. She saw an armoured personnel carrier and a UAZ minivan (tabletka) driving away from their house.
The whereabouts of Mr Nurkayev have remained unknown ever since.
According to the applicants, they did not have the opportunity to report the disappearance to the authorities for several months, as the lawenforcement agencies had stopped functioning owing to intensive military operations in Grozny. It was only on 2 January 2001, when temporary departments of the police started operating, that they managed to make a request that criminal proceedings be instituted.
On 17 January 2001 the applicants were informed by a letter that on 8 January 2001 the Staropromyslovskiy district police department in Grozny (hereinafter “the police”) had refused to open a criminal case into Mr Nurkayev’s disappearance for lack of evidence of a crime. The letter further stated that that their complaint had been forwarded to the police criminal search unit “for organisation of the search”. The applicants were not provided with a copy of the refusal.
According to the applicants, between 2001 and April 2006 they complained to various other authorities of the disappearance of Ibragim Nurkayev, but to no avail. They did not furnish copies of those complaints.
On 19 April 2006 the applicants again complained to the police of Ibragim Nurkayev’s disappearance, requesting that a criminal case be opened.
On 4 April 2006 the police again refused to open an investigation for lack of evidence of a crime, stating that Mr Nurkayev had left home “of his own free will”. It is unclear whether the applicants were informed of that decision.
On 24 April 2006 the police inspected the crime scene at the applicants’ house.
On 24 April 2006 the police interviewed several of the applicants’ neighbours and relatives, all of whom stated that they had learnt of Ibragim Nurkayev’s disappearance from others.

On 11 September 2006 the first applicant was granted victim status in the criminal case and questioned. She stated that her son Ibragim had left home on the evening of 14 July 2000 to fetch cigarettes from a friend and had not returned. Due to the curfew, they had started searching for him the following day. She had no idea as to what could have happened to her son.
On 11 September 2006 the investigators questioned the second and third applicants, whose statements were similar to that of the first applicant.
Between 17 September and 3 October 2006 the investigators questioned several of the applicants’ neighbours, all of whom stated that they had learnt of Ibragim Nurkayev’s disappearance from others and that they had no information on either possible reasons for his disappearance or his whereabouts.
On various dates in September and October 2006 the investigators sent information requests to law-enforcement agencies in Chechnya and other regions of Russia asking whether Ibragim Nurkayev had been detained or arrested by them. The replies received were in the negative.
On 4 November 2006 the investigation was suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators. The applicants were informed thereof.

On 5 August 2011 the court dismissed the complaint, finding that on 26 May 2011 the investigators had already resumed the investigation.
The applicant is the wife of Mr Ibragim Altyyev, who was born in 1974.
Mr Ibragim Altyyev, who was a taxi driver in Grozny at the material time, went to work on 29 December 2004 and did not return home.
The following day, two unidentified men contacted the applicant and gave her Mr Altyyev’s passport and some documents from his car. On the same date, the car was found abandoned in the Zavodskoy district in Grozny.
According to the applicant, she learned from an eyewitness, Mr R.B., that her husband had been abducted by a group of armed men in camouflage uniforms, who had driven around in a Gazel minivan and a VAZ-21099 car. The men had stopped Mr Altyyev’s car on a street in Grozny, grabbed him and his passenger, and driven off. Mr R.B. was subsequently questioned by the investigators (see below).
The whereabouts of Mr Altyyev have remained unknown ever since.
According to the applicant, she had hoped that the abductors would release her husband and out of fear for his life, she did not lodge an immediate abduction complaint with the authorities. Then on 18 May 2005 and on an unspecified date in August 2005 she officially complained of her husband’s disappearance to the Leninskiy district police department (“the police”) and requested that an investigation be opened.
On 9 February 2006 the applicant again complained to the authorities of her husband’s disappearance and requested that a criminal case be opened. She stated, amongst other things, that according to the police, her complaint of August 2005 had been lost in their office.
On 10 March 2006 a police officer interviewed the applicant’s mother, Ms Z.N. She submitted that during the evening of 29 December 2004 the applicant had told her that she (the applicant) had learned from two men of the circumstances of her husband’s abduction and that those two men had brought his documents to her. Later on, in 2006, the witness had found out that those men had been Mr R. and Mr Kh.
On the same date, 10 March 2006, the applicant was interviewed. Her statement concerning the circumstances of the abduction was similar to the account of the incident submitted to the Court. She stated additionally that she had waited about eight months before complaining about the abduction for the first time, as she had been hoping that her husband would be released by the abductors. She also stated that in the autumn of 2004 her husband had been in a fight with a police officer, but that conflict had been resolved amicably.
On 11 March 2006 the ROVD interviewed the eyewitness, Mr R.B. He stated that at the end of 2004 he had seen a group of armed men in camouflage uniforms, in a Gazel minivan and a VAZ 21099 car, stopping a taxi on a street in Grozny.
