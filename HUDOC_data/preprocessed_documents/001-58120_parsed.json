In addition, according to the \u201cgenerally recognised rules\u00a0of international law\u201d there may be special circumstances which absolve the applicant from the obligation to exhaust the domestic remedies at his disposal. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the\nGovernment was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement. One such reason may be constituted by the national authorities remaining totally passive in the face of serious allegations of misconduct or infliction of harm by State agents, for example where they have failed to undertake investigations or offer assistance. In such circumstances it can be said that the burden of proof shifts once again, so that it becomes incumbent on the respondent Government to show what they have done in response to the scale and seriousness of the matters complained of.",

In reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case. This means amongst other things that the Court must take realistic account of the general legal and political context in which the remedies operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant (see the above-cited Akdivar and Others judgment, p.\u00a01211, \u00a7\u00a069; and the above-mentioned Aksoy judgment, p. 2276, \u00a7\u00a053).

As this investigation indicated, complaints that the security forces had destroyed villagers\u2019 houses did not in practice receive the serious and detailed consideration necessary for any prosecution to be initiated. In fact, no investigation had taken place to \nverify what occurred in the village and the hamlets (see paragraphs\u00a027\u201330 above).

The Contracting States have primary responsibility for securing to everyone within their jurisdiction the Convention rights and freedoms (Article 1). The machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights. The Strasbourg review plays a role only as a system for dispute settlement that operates once all effective domestic remedies have been exhausted and the respondent State has been afforded a proper opportunity to put right the matter complained of under the Convention (Article 26) (see, amongst other authorities, the Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 22, \u00a7 48; and the Van Oosterwijk v. Belgium judgment of 6\u00a0November 1980, Series A no. 40, p. 17, \u00a7 34).
