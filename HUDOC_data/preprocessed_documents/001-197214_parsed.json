In particular, a parent cannot be entitled under Article 8 to have such measures taken as would harm the child\u2019s health and development (see, for instance, V.D. and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 72931/10, \u00a7\u00a0114, 9 April 2019).

Croatia, no.\u00a036216/13, \u00a7 143, 14 March 2017). In particular, children having the right to express their own views should not be interpreted as effectively giving them an unconditional veto power without any other factors being considered and an examination being carried out to determine their best interests (A.V. v.

After P. failed to comply, the bailiff \u2013 accompanied by a psychologist, other specialised authorities and the applicant \u2013 went to P.\u2019s house on 9 February 2016 and tried to enforce the judgment, but this was frustrated by the children\u2019s strong opposition to leaving P.\u2019s house (see paragraph 37 above).

Therefore, the authorities\u2019 failure to react to the applicant\u2019s complaints about alienation and to examine the custody case in an urgent matter must be seen as having substantially contributed to the eventual difficulties in enforcing the judgment mentioned above. Moreover, the authorities made only two attempts to enforce the judgment in the first year of the enforcement proceedings (2016). More importantly, in 2016 they did no preparatory psychological work with the children or their parents to facilitate the enforcement, despite there being clear signs that the children had been psychologically alienated from their mother (see paragraphs 28-30 above) and that complex preparations for the enforcement were therefore necessary (see, for instance, Miju\u0161kovi\u0107 v.
