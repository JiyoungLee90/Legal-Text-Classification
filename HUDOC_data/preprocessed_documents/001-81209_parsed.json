The  had not relied on a specific provision of the Political Parties Act of 1990 to justify its refusal to register the association, which was only natural in view of the text of section 1(3) of that Act. That court's proposition that only political parties could pursue political goals showed a fundamental lack of understanding of the role of non-governmental organisations in a democratic society. These were frequently founded in order to promote various causes and influence public policies. Their goals were thus often political. The fundamental difference between them and political parties, however, were not these goals, but the means to achieve them. Political parties participated in elections and in the government, whereas associations did not. They merely influenced public opinion on various issues, thus indirectly shaping the government's policies. Likewise, the Plovdiv Court of Appeals' holding that the association's aims fell under the proscription of Article 12 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution of 1991 was erroneous. The association's aims, as was apparent from the wording of its articles, consisted of various reform ideas, but did not amount to a concrete and coherent political programme and ideology. There was no reason why such ideas could not be backed by various entities in a pluralistic society. It was important to underscore that the association's articles contained no language pointing to an intention to participate in elections or in the government, which were indeed goals solely characteristic of political parties. On the other hand, Article 12 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution of 1991 was not framed with sufficient precision, as it could be read as prohibiting to associations all types of political goals. Nor did it make clear what was exactly prohibited: political goals or also political activities. The interference had also been arbitrary, as evidenced by the lack of genuine reasons for the Supreme Court of Cassation's judgment, whose holding was packed in just four lines.",

The association had not engaged in any action which could characterise it as propagating violence or undemocratic principles. The idea of a monarchy and the related insignia were not undemocratic or violent, as evidenced in particular by the fact that the name of the coalition which had ruled the country as between 2001 and 2005 had been \u201cNational Movement Simeon\u00a0II\u201d, after the former heir to the throne Simeon Saxe-Coburggotski, who had become prime minister.

The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others, \u00a7 92; and The Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army, \u00a7 61, both cited above).",

However, the Court notes that it is primarily for the national courts to interpret and apply domestic law (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, \u00a7 55; and Tsonev, \u00a7 45, both cited above). Firstly, it is prepared to accept that their holding that the aims of the association were contrary to the Constitution of 1991 did not go so far as to become arbitrary. Secondly, it is true that their categorization of these aims as \u201cpolitical\u201d within the meaning of Article 12 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution of 1991 and their holding that the association could not pursue them without being a political party may appear questionable in view of the construction of this Article by the Constitutional Court and the tenor of the other relevant provisions of domestic law (see paragraphs 17, 19 and 22 above). However, the Court is mindful that legal opinions on the exact purport of such a wide notion open to largely diverse interpretations \u2013 \u201cpolitical\u201d \u2013 may differ. It is therefore likewise prepared to accept that these holdings were not as patently unreasonable as to become arbitrary.

It is not possible to attain absolute rigidity in the framing of laws, and many of them \u2013 especially a national constitution \u2013 are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The level of precision required of domestic legislation depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question and the field it is designed to cover (see Maestri, cited above, \u00a7 30 in fine). It must also be borne in mind that, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, its application involves an inevitable element of judicial interpretation, since there will always be a need for clarification of doubtful points and for adaptation to particular circumstances. The mere fact that such a provision is capable of more than one construction does not mean that it fails to meet the requirement of \u201cforeseeability\u201d for the purposes of the Convention.

An organisation may campaign for a change in the legal and constitutional structures of the State if the means used to that end are in every respect legal and democratic and if the change proposed is itself compatible with fundamental democratic principles (see Yazar and Others v. Turkey, nos.\u00a022723/93, 22724/93 and 22725/93, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2002II; Refah Partisi (The Welfare Party) and Others v.

Monarchy is not incompatible in itself with the principles of democracy, as shown by the example of a number of member States of the Council of Europe. Nor has it been argued that the Constitution of 1879 was undemocratic. It provided for a parliamentary monarchy, separation of powers, universal suffrage, and enshrined a number of fundamental rights (see paragraph 23 above).",

For instance, in the present case these courts deemed that a campaign for changes in the constitution and the form of government fell within that category. In another recent case these same courts had, more questionably, stated that the \u201cholding of meetings, demonstrations, assemblies and other forms of public campaigning\u201d by an association campaigning for regional autonomy and alleged minority rights also amounted to political goals and activities within the meaning of Article 12 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution of 1991. The Court found this holding unwarranted (see The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 19, 21 and 73). The  has, for its part, adopted a different definition of \u201cpolitical\u201d, which was centred on \u201cparticipation in the process of forming the bodies through which ... the people exercise[d] its power\u201d (see paragraph 22 above). Against this background and bearing in mind that this term is inherently vague and could be subject to largely diverse interpretations, it is quite conceivable that the Bulgarian courts could label any goals which are in some way related to the normal functioning of a democratic society as \u201cpolitical\u201d and accordingly direct the founders of legal entities wishing to pursue such goals to register them as political parties instead of \u201cordinary\u201d associations. A classification based on this criterion is therefore liable to produce incoherent results and engender considerable uncertainty among those wishing to apply for registration of such entities.",

However, under Bulgarian law, as it stood at the material time and as it stands at present, associations may not participate in national, local or European elections (see paragraph 21 above). There is therefore no \u201cpressing social need\u201d to require every association deemed by the courts to pursue \u201cpolitical\u201d goals to register as a political party, especially in view of the fact that, as noted above, the exact meaning of that term under Bulgarian law appears to be quite vague. That would mean forcing the association to take a legal shape which its founders did not seek. It would also mean subjecting it to a number of additional requirements and restrictions, such as for instance the rule that a political party cannot be formed by less than fifty enfranchised citizens (see paragraph 19 above), which may in some cases prove an insurmountable obstacle for its founders. Moreover, such an approach runs counter to freedom of association, because, in case it is adopted, the liberty of action which will remain available to the founders of an association may become either nonexistent or so reduced as to be of no practical value (see, mutatis mutandis, Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, p. 23, \u00a7 56; Sigur\u00f0ur A.

Article 12 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution stipulates that \u201cassociations ... may not pursue political goals or carry out political activities that are characteristic solely of political parties\u201d. A simple reading of that provision would imply that all other political goals are accepted. This is exactly what one would expect in a normal democratic order. The question is: on what basis, by whom and in what manner can this be decided?",

Fine. But if we look at the lex specialis in that respect \u2013 the Persons and Family Act of 1949 \u2013, we see that it does not cover all these aspects. I would specifically point to the lack of clearly listed legal grounds for nonregistration or dissolution and of a procedure for challenging and making decisions in disputes of this kind. Maybe this is the reason why the courts have had to rely only on the general provisions of the Constitution. This in itself is acceptable, but leaves the courts to decide on rather abstract and even speculative grounds and allows them rather broad powers of discretion.",

                        "content": "My second point is that freedom of association is closely linked to freedom of speech and opinion. Very often an association is created to express certain views and opinions. Therefore, the statutes of the association inevitably reflect certain views and goals which might also be regarded as political; all this depends very much on interpretation. Because of the close link between freedom of expression and freedom of association, the most appropriate and best way of assessing the nature of the association and its conformity with the Constitution and the Convention is to conduct an assessment based not just on a formal reading of the association's goals as set down in the statutes, but also on the means the association intends to employ and, especially, its actions and activities in real life. Hence, an assessment of the legality of an association in abstracto, such as has been conducted here, confers an undue degree of discretion on the authorities.",
