Thus, the proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case ended on 16 July 2004. Excluding the period of time from 20 November 2003 to 18 March 2004 when the case was not pending, the aggregate length of the proceedings amounted approximately to five years and eight months, during which period the case was considered four times at the first instance and three times at the appeal instance.",
