The applicant also contested the expert assessment regarding the value of the house to be demolished pursuant to the expropriation decision. The expert had not used the \u201cmethod of prospective use\u201d for determining the value of the house and land. The expert valuation was based on the premise that the land\u2019s use was for a summer cottage use rather than for the use relating to multi-storey blocks of flat; this premise was inappropriate, given that the property was already surrounded by similar blocks of flats.

While it was available to the parties within a one-year time-limit, the proceedings, once launched, could last indefinitely at a number of levels of jurisdiction (see paragraphs 38-43 above). In the Court\u2019s view, such a situation created an uncertainty that would render the six-month rule nugatory (see Denisov v. Russia, (dec.), no.\u00a0, 6\u00a0May 2004). However, what matters in the context of the present complaint is that the applicant had the benefit of appeal proceedings against the judgment of 13\u00a0April 2005. Following the appeal decision, it became final and enforceable under Russian law. There was no ascertainable date after which it could have been safely concluded that the judgment was no longer amenable to review. Thus, even though it appears that the applicants had in fact lodged an application for review without delay after the appeal decision, there are no convincing circumstances which would have called for a suspension of the enforcement to enable a reviewing court at one or several levels of jurisdiction to have another look at the expropriation case.",

The Court also observes that, even though it was related to a larger town planning scheme (see paragraph 18 above) it cannot be said that the expropriation of the applicants\u2019 land sought to address any important general problem. The relevant administrative decision referred to the aims of \u201cimproving the architectural appearance of the town and the resettlement of inhabitants from housing that no longer [met] sanitary requirements\u201d. There is nothing to suggest that the applicants\u2019 house was dilapidated so as to become unsuitable for living in it, in which case it might be subject to the demolition procedure for decrepit housing instead of the expropriation procedure used in this case (see paragraph 19 above). At least one of the available valuations clearly stated that the house was habitable, although it required some superficial repairs (see paragraph 27 above). As to the aesthetic element of the town planning scheme in question, there is nothing in the available material or the Government\u2019s submissions to substantiate the preference in favour of replacing individual residential houses with blocks of flats or to address the precedence of this consideration over the legitimate interests that the owners\u2019 of these houses had.",

However, having examined the requirements of the investment contract and the other pertinent factors, the Court is not satisfied that it was convincingly shown by the domestic administrative and judicial authorities that the reasons for using the expropriation procedure had a proper reasonable basis and were compelling (compare Tkachevy, cited above, \u00a7 50).",

However, it observes that Russian law did not prevent them from disputing the expert report by other means, which were not limited to another expert assessment (compare Vrzi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a043777/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011314, 12 July 2016). The applicants did make submissions in their statement of appeal and some calculations and related explanations, contesting the expert report and putting forward a different valuation of the property (see paragraph 36 above). In particular, the first applicant argued that the expert should have used the \u201cmethod of prospective use\u201d for determining the value of the house and land. Furthermore, she argued that the expert valuation was based on the premise that the land\u2019s use was for a summer cottage use rather than for the use relating to multi-storey blocks of flat; this premise was inappropriate, given that the property was already surrounded by similar blocks of flats. Those submissions do not appear to be devoid of substance or substantiation. It was thus incumbent on the domestic court to assess the counterarguments and provide reasons for dismissing them in so far they were directly related to the subject matter of the case, namely the market value of the properties to be expropriated.",
