Moreover, at the hearing on 28 January 2004 the District Court had not properly explained to the applicant what a default judgment would mean for him. The Regional Court considered that, as the applicant was not a lawyer, he could not have known that a decision in absentia would necessarily be to his detriment. Therefore, as the caution provided for in Articles 70 to 78 had not been issued in the present case, the Regional Court held that there were grounds, under Articles 233 and 241 of the CCP, for setting aside the decision of 19 March 2004.

The Supreme Court also found that, according to the record of the hearing of 28 January 2004, the judge had warned the applicant that \u201cin the event of a refusal to take part in the hearing, a decision [would] be given in absentia\u201d. The applicant had therefore been sufficiently informed of the consequences of his conduct. Lastly, the Supreme Court pointed out that a court could give a decision in absentia if a lawyer or a party failed to appear at a hearing, on condition that the party had been summoned in accordance with the rules set out in Articles 70 to 78 of the CCP.

Article 6 \u00a7 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights (see ibid.). Thus, the questions of personal presence, the form of the proceedings \u2013 oral or written \u2013 and legal representation are interlinked and must be analysed in the broader context of the \u201cfair trial\u201d guarantee of Article 6. The Court should establish whether the applicant, a party to the civil proceedings, was given a reasonable opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations made or evidence adduced by the other party and to present his case under conditions that did not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent (see Ternovskis v. Latvia, no. 33637/02, \u00a7 65, 29\u00a0April 2014, and Larin v. Russia, no. 15034/02, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, 20 May 2010).",

As the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective, this right can be regarded as effective only if the applicant is in fact \u201cheard\u201d, that is, his or her observations are properly examined by the courts (see Ternovskis, cited above, \u00a7 66). In this connection, The Court notes that Article 6 requires and allows the States to organise their legal systems in a manner which facilitates expeditious and efficient judicial proceedings, including provision for the possibility of issuing default judgments. However, that cannot be done at the expense of other procedural guarantees (see A\u017edaji\u0107 v. Slovenia, no. 71872/12, \u00a749, 8 October 2015, and Gankin and Others v.

In fact, Article 6 \u00a7 1 is intended above all to secure the interests of the parties and those of the proper administration of justice (see Nider\u00f6st-Huber v. Switzerland, 18 February 1997, \u00a7 30, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I). Consequently, it falls within the responsibility of the domestic authorities to ensure that the standards set by Article 6 \u00a7 1, and, in particular, the protection of the equality of arms, are respected.",

This is borne out by the absence of detailed provisions such as paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 6 applying to cases of the former category. Thus, although these provisions have a certain relevance outside the strict confines of criminal law, the Contracting States have greater latitude when dealing with civil cases concerning civil rights and obligations than they have when dealing with criminal cases (see, for example, Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03233, Series A no. 274; Jokela v. Finland, no. 28856/95, \u00a7 68, ECHR\u00a02002IV; and Milovanova v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 16411/03, 2 October 2007). Nevertheless, certain principles concerning the notion of a \u201cfair hearing\u201d in cases concerning civil rights and obligations emerge from the Court\u2019s caselaw. It is clear that the requirement of \u201cequality of arms\u201d, in the sense of a \u201cfair balance\u201d between the parties, applies in principle to such cases as well as to criminal cases (see Dombo Beheer B.V., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a032-33). Moreover, the Court considers it necessary, when examining proceedings that fall within the civil-law aspect of Article 6, to draw inspiration from its approach to criminal-law matters (see Dilipak and\u00a0Karakaya v. Turkey, nos.\u00a07942/05 and 24838/05, \u00a7 80, 4 March 2014; see also Carmel Saliba v.\u00a0Malta, no. 24221/13, \u00a7\u00a7 67, 70, and 73, 29\u00a0November 2016).",

A question as to whether the assistance of a lawyer is necessary for a fair trial must be determined on the basis of the specific facts of each case, such as, the importance of what is at stake for the applicant in the proceedings, the complexity of the relevant law and procedure, and the applicant\u2019s capacity to represent him or herself effectively (see, mutatis mutandis, Steel and\u00a0Morris, cited above, \u00a7 61, and N.J.D.B. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a076760/12, \u00a7 73, 27 October 2015). In this context, it must be ascertained whether the applicant\u2019s appearance before the courts without the assistance of a lawyer would be effective, in the sense of whether he or she would be able to present his or her case properly and satisfactorily (see, mutatis mutandis, Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 24, Series A no. 32).

In this context the Court finds it difficult to subscribe to the Government\u2019s argument that the participation of a lawyer in another hearing before the Supreme Court was not a good reason for an adjournment and that the applicant\u2019s request had merely been an attempt to cause a delay in the proceedings. Such an overly formalistic and inflexible approach was at odds with the due diligence principle that the domestic courts must apply so as to secure the genuine and effective enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under Article 6 of the Convention.",

It appears, however, from the case file, that while informing the applicant of the risk of a default judgment, the first-instance judge did not explain to him that firstly, a default judgment implied an automatic rejection of his action without giving any reasons (see Article 229 \u00a7 1 cited in paragraph 20 above), and secondly, that no standard appeal procedure applied to a default judgment (see Articles 236, 241, and 366, cited in paragraph 20 above). The appellate and cassation courts in the course of the proceedings to set aside the default judgment concluded that the applicant had been warned of the possible consequences of his actions (see paragraphs 15-17 above). The Court, however, considers that the applicant, while at the hearing in the absence of his lawyer, was not informed in an adequate and understandable manner of the consequences of his actions. In such circumstances it remains to be seen whether or not domestic law provided the applicant with appropriate means of securing a fresh adversarial hearing with his participation.",

Articles 236 and 241 of the CCP provided for the procedure for setting aside default decisions (see paragraph 20 above). However, even though those provisions could, in principle, have offered adequate redress to a person against whom a default decision had been issued, they could not do so for the applicant himself. Notably, the appellate and cassation courts in their respective decisions of 10 May and 16\u00a0September 2005 concluded that the participation of a lawyer in another hearing was not a valid reason for setting aside a decision in absentia and that under Article 232 of the CCP any refusal, for whatever reason, to take part in a hearing was unjustified. Thus, it could not fall within the exhaustive list of valid reasons for reexamination listed in Article 233. In these circumstances, the Court concludes that the applicant, given the domestic courts\u2019 application of the rules on re-examination of in absentia judgments, had no possibility to obtain a re-opening of his case.",

In the Court\u2019s view, since the lack of a reply to the adjournment request of 22 January 2004 could have implied a tacit dismissal of that request by the District Court, the lawyer had to act diligently and advice the applicant on all possible legal strategies, including the legal steps he should have undertaken in the former\u2019s absence during the scheduled hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, Hermi v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a018114/02, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2006-XII).
