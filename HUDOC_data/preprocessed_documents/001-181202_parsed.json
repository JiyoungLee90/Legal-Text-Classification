In particular, the psychiatrists at the hospital had interrogated her (buvau kamantin\u0117jama) about the Ojas Meditation Centre and its practices, forced her to promise not to meditate, alleged that sex orgies had taken place there, that meditation was harmful for her mental health, that she should follow the Catholic religion which is traditional in Lithuania and that meditation was not compatible with her \u201csocial status\u201d.

However, the court found that as of 8 May 2003 she had no longer been in need of medical support. That was confirmed by the applicant\u2019s medical file, where doctor D.\u0160. had noted on 8\u00a0May at 8.15\u00a0a.m. that \u201cthe patient is responding to meaningful contact, is correctly orientated (pacient\u0117 prieinama prasmingam kontaktui, orientuota teisingai)\u201d.

All that meant that the applicant\u2019s state of health had no longer corresponded to that set down in Article 27 of the Law on Mental Health Care to permit her further forced hospitalisation. Despite that, the applicant had been held against her will and treated at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital until 26 June 2003, without the hospital ever asking for a court order. That had been in breach of the twoday time-limit set in Article 28 of the Law on Mental Health Care.",

The court also considered that the consent given on 7\u00a0May 2013 by the applicant\u2019s cousin, E.\u0160., for the applicant to be put in hospital and treated could also not be considered as an act of agreement expressed by the applicant.",

That conclusion was based on the applicant\u2019s medical file, which contained the following records for 26\u00a0May and 20 and 23 June 2003: \u201c ... absence of a critical attitude towards attending [the Ojas Meditation] Centre\u201d; \u201cduring psycho-correction expressed opinion in categorical terms about attending the Ojas Centre, argues, that \u2018it is a personal matter\u2019\u201d; \u201cwhen efforts were made during psycho-correction to get the applicant to form a critical attitude (suformuoti kritik\u0105) towards non-traditional religious beliefs, [the applicant] for a long time remained uncritical and also categorical\u201d.

Her condition that day had corresponded to the domestic legal requirements for involuntary hospitalisation (see paragraph 68 below). However, the hospital had not provided any evidence that her treatment from 8\u00a0May had been indispensable.

The Court of Appeal relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s practice in case no.\u00a03K-3110/2004 of 11 February 2004 to the effect that it was obligatory to follow the procedure set out in Articles 16 and\u00a028 of the Law on Mental Health Care, both when providing a patient with the necessary help (b\u016btinoji pagalba) and when placing that person in hospital without his or her consent.

The appellate court relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in case no.\u00a03K-3-630/2004 of 24\u00a0November 2004, where it had found that in cases where there was no direct mention of a person in a publication, the process of identification was based on the aggregate evidence of the presence of features which could sufficiently describe the person in mind (see paragraph\u00a063 below). In the particular case of the applicant, the Court of Appeal also referred to her open letter of 14\u00a0August 2003 to the Srov\u0117s journalists (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above), where she had acknowledged that the television broadcast had been instigated by members of her family, that she had not been shown in the programme in person, and that she had been given a different name. The Court of Appeal considered that the fact that the main character of the programme (laidos heroj\u0117) had studied in the United States was not sufficient to establish that the programme was about the applicant. As the applicant had not established that the information disclosed during the broadcast had allowed her to be identified, her claim for breach of privacy had to be dismissed.",

In particular, she had not begun court proceedings against the journalists whose television show, Srov\u0117s, had been based on the interview with the applicant\u2019s psychiatrist, doctor\u00a0D.\u0160. On that point the Government noted that domestic law allowed individuals to bring a claim directly against a producer and/or broadcaster of a television programme, irrespective of who else might have contributed to the dissemination of the information in question (see paragraph 72 above). Accordingly, and notwithstanding the applicant\u2019s belief that the breach of her right to privacy was linked to the actions of the psychiatrist, the impact on her privacy that she had purportedly experienced had been caused by the journalists and the television channel which had broadcast the Srov\u0117s programme. The Government also referred to several Supreme Court rulings from 2005 and argued that there was a plentiful amount of Lithuanian caselaw showing that journalists could be brought to justice for breaching the right to privacy, proving that such an action was an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention. It was therefore not reasonable to shift all the responsibility for the public dissemination of information which the applicant saw as concerning her private life to the hospital, or, all the more so, to the State, only because the applicant had chosen to bring her claim for responsibility against the hospital during the domestic proceedings. The Government underlined that domestic law aimed at enabling plaintiffs to approach alleged violations of their rights in the most effective way, considering all the relevant factors showing wrongful behaviour. In this case, neither the hospital nor the psychiatrist had been able to control the scope of the information broadcast, in contrast to the actual broadcaster of that information.",

Because of the complexity and considerable scope of the court proceedings against Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she had decided to seek compensation for breach of privacy from the hospital alone. The applicant noted that she had learned about the unlawful disclosure of information of a private nature by her psychiatrist, while she was being unlawfully held in the hospital. The fact that the psychiatrist had disclosed confidential information about her to the journalists and her mother had caused the applicant a tremendous shock, emotional suffering and distress. The subsequent dissemination of that information by the journalists had only increased the damage. In such a manner, the major breach of her right to privacy had been caused by the fact that a public hospital had revealed confidential information to the journalists. Lastly, the applicant relied on a Supreme Court ruling and implied that in the case of a breach of privacy a claim may be lodged against the person who disclosed confidential information, rather than the broadcaster who made that information public (she referred to Varapnickait\u0117-Ma\u017eylien\u0117 v.

The Court further notes that the applicant voiced the same complaints in the Lithuanian courts, where, among numerous other grievances, she argued that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital had been responsible for the breach of her right to privacy (see paragraphs 24 and 43 above). The applicant has also pleaded to the Court that the disclosure by the public hospital\u2019s psychiatrist of information about the applicant\u2019s health led her to lose faith in the whole health-care system (see paragraph 87 below). In the particular circumstances of this case, the Court is therefore ready to accept the applicant\u2019s argument that she saw the hospital where the psychiatrist doctor D.\u0160. worked as primarily responsible for the breach of the applicant\u2019s right to privacy and that therefore she was not obliged to bring an action against the Srov\u0117s journalists who had made the interview with the psychiatrist public (also see Sejdovic v.

The Government submitted that, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lithuanian society had experienced fundamental institutional, cultural and societal changes. The influx of new religious movements had not been smooth due to impediments related to the relative sensitivity of religious attitudes in a transforming society. In fact, society\u2019s initial attitude to new religious movements had been rather negative. Among other reasons, that had been caused by a lack of information about those movements or by unfavourable coverage in the media. More thorough coverage was therefore necessary to establish a link between society, which was largely uninformed about such things, and new religious movements, the Osho movement being one of them. Taking into account the secrecy of that movement in Lithuania, as well as the controversy surrounding the registration of the Ojas Meditation Centre as a religious community, the Srov\u0117s programme had contributed to a debate of great public importance. Furthermore, even if the broadcast could be considered as \u201cexaggeratedly provocative\u201d, that did not rebut its informational function because the local leader of the Osho movement in Lithuania, M.V., and close relatives of the applicant had been interviewed.

However, the first-instance court had merely established that the applicant\u2019s mother had already been aware of her daughter\u2019s aggravated condition on 7\u00a0May 2003, as well as of her being transported to the hospital for further treatment (see paragraph\u00a033 above). The Court of Appeal had referred to the applicant\u2019s previous history of mental disorders, stating that the provision of information about the applicant\u2019s health to her relatives could not be considered as a violation of her privacy. Indeed, the applicant\u2019s mother had known of the applicant\u2019s prior treatment (see paragraph\u00a048 above) and the disorder at issue had been similar in nature to the earlier episodes, especially because some of them had also clearly related to her religious activities (on this last point the Government referred to information in paragraph 6 above).",

The protection of personal data, not least medical data, is of fundamental importance to a person\u2019s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. It is crucial not only to respect the sense of privacy of a patient but also to preserve his or her confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, \u00a7 95, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I; P. and S. v. Poland, no. 57375/08, \u00a7 128, 30 October 2012; and L.H. v. Latvia, no. 52019/07, \u00a7 56, 29 April 2014). Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from revealing such information of a personal and intimate nature as may be necessary in order to receive appropriate treatment and, even, from seeking such assistance, thereby endangering their own health and, in the case of transmissible diseases, that of the community. The domestic law must therefore afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such communication or disclosure of personal health data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees in Article 8 of the Convention (see Z v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a095).",

Likewise, information regarding a mental health related condition by its very nature constitutes highly sensitive personal data regardless of whether it is indicative of a particular medical diagnosis. Disclosure of such information falls therefore within the ambit of Article 8 (see, more recently, Surikov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a042788/06, \u00a7\u00a075, 26\u00a0January 2017).",

That being so, the Court considers that it is only required to examine the actions of those two actors as that was the main element underlying the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention. Although in their observations to the Court the Government laid much emphasis on the Srov\u0117s broadcast of 17\u00a0June 2003 (see paragraph 20 above), the Court will have regard to that programme and the journalists\u2019 actions only in so far as they provide the context for the aforementioned conduct by the hospital and its personnel. For the same reason, the Court also does not find the question of whether the applicant could have been recognised by viewers of the Srov\u0117s programme to be of critical importance, given that it is the matter of the hospital disclosing private information about the applicant to the journalists and her mother which is at the heart of the applicant\u2019s complaint.",

For her part, the psychiatrist, doctor D.\u0160., testified at the hearing that when the journalists had come to that hospital, she had been asked by the hospital\u2019s administration to meet them and told that the \u201ctalk would be about Mockut\u0117\u201d (see paragraph 34 above), an aspect of the case which the Court finds particularly disturbing. Even though doctor D.\u0160. denied to the Vilnius Regional Court that she had talked with the Srov\u0117s journalists about the applicant\u2019s health, that was overruled by that court, which held that the psychiatrist, without obtaining the applicant\u2019s consent, had revealed information to the journalists about her diagnosis, acute psychosis, the fact that she was being treated at that psychiatric hospital, and that she had studied in the United States (see paragraph 35 above). That conclusion does not appear to have been overruled by the Court of Appeal, which only disagreed about the fact that the excerpts of the psychiatrist\u2019s interview shown during the broadcast had been sufficient to identify the applicant (see paragraph 47 above). The Court further observes that in one of those excerpts the psychiatrist used such statements as \u201cit does not appear that this young woman would participate in orgies\u201d and that \u201cshe is not hypersexual\u201d (see paragraph 20 above). In this context it recalls the State\u2019s obligation to protect information about a person\u2019s sexual life and moral integrity (see the case-law in paragraph 94 above). In deciding whether there was interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her privacy, the Court also notes that under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was adopted in 2007, the States\u2019 have a duty to protect persons with disabilities from unlawful attacks on their honour and reputation (see Article 22 of the CRDP, cited in paragraph 73 above). Examining further, the Court observes that the psychiatrist also discussed the applicant as manifesting secretive behaviour, which was a trait of those belonging to sects (see paragraph 20 above). At this juncture the Court is also mindful of the applicant\u2019s argument that she experienced emotional insecurity because she was afraid of which of the additional facts the psychiatrist had forced out of her might have been revealed to the journalists (see paragraph 87 in fine above; also see Surikov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a075).",

In fact, Article 52 of the Law on the Health System explicitly forbade health-care specialists from violating the rules of confidentiality of information about a person\u2019s health which they had acquired in the course of their professional activity (see paragraph\u00a060 above). Furthermore, under Articles 2 and 11 of the Law on the Legal Protection of Personal Data, information about a person\u2019s religious beliefs, health or sexual life was attributed particular protection, and it could only be released provided that the person had undisputably agreed to such disclosure (see paragraph 61 above). The duties to protect the confidentiality of all personal data relating to a person with disability, as well as to protect such persons from attacks on their honour or dignity, have been underlined within the framework of the United Nations and by Council of Europe institutions (see Article 22 of the CRPD, cited in paragraph\u00a073 above, point 7.4.c of the Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation\u00a01235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above, and Article\u00a013 of the Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2004)10, cited in paragraph 76 above).",

In fact, the Court notes that all the relevant domestic and international law cited above expressly prohibits the disclosure of such information to the point that it even constitutes a criminal offence (see paragraph 62 above). Even if there were exceptions to the rule of non-disclosure, none of those have been argued by the Government, which instead pleaded a legitimate aim of informing society about new religious movements.

Even though the domestic courts had confirmed the illegality of the applicant\u2019s stay at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, the applicant\u2019s claim of allegedly improper medical treatment had been rejected by the Court of Appeal (see paragraph\u00a051 above). In fact, the psychiatrists\u2019 actions and methods applied when treating the applicant had been in line with the existing legislation and legal acts. The Government also drew an analogy with the Court\u2019s case-law under Article\u00a03 of the Convention, where it had held that it was for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used to preserve the physical and mental health of patients (they relied on Herczegfalvy v. Austria, 24\u00a0September 1992, \u00a7 82, Series A no. 244). Even though the case at issue was of a different nature, the Government suggested that a similar approach could be followed. The priorities of medical science and the professional application of medical methods should prevail over the wishes of an individual to choose his or her own way of behaving, unless abusive conduct by medical personnel was clearly established, which had obviously not been the case here. In the instant case, the psycho-correction methods applied by the psychiatrists had been used in order \u201cto form a critical, not a negative, attitude towards religion\u201d (emphasised by the Government).",

The Court has frequently emphasised the State\u2019s role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society. It also considers that the State\u2019s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State\u2019s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see Leyla \u015eahin v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a044774/98, \u00a7\u00a0107, ECHR\u00a02005XI, and the case-law cited therein). The Court has also held that the State enjoys only a limited margin of appreciation and must advance convincing and compelling reasons to justify any interference with the freedom of individual conscience (see Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v. Russia, no.\u00a072881/01, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR 2006XI; also see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan v.\u00a0Armenia [GC], no.\u00a023459/03, \u00a7\u00a0123, ECHR 2011).

To hold so would mean that the State could exclude certain beliefs by withholding recognition. The Court has already held that punishing those who manifest religious beliefs which have not been recognised by the State constitutes a violation of Article 9 (see Masaev v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 6303/05, \u00a7\u00a026, 12 May 2009).",

The applicant\u2019s claims were however contested by the Government, which, in turn, relied on the conclusions by the Court of Appeal and asserted that the applicant had been able to practise her religion during her stay at that institution (see paragraph\u00a050 above). The Court therefore finds that it has been presented with diverging accounts of the applicant\u2019s factual situation in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital. The Court points out that in principle it is not its task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts (see Kyriacou Tsiakkourmas and Others v.

It has also held that the position of inferiority and powerlessness which is typical of patients confined in psychiatric hospitals calls for increased vigilance in reviewing whether the Convention has been complied with (see Herczegfalvy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a082).",

The Court notes that, after the applicant was placed in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she was forcibly administered drugs, physically restrained, and various restrictive treatment regimes were applied to her during the fiftytwo days of her stay at that institution (see paragraphs 12 and 14-18 above; on the issue of the consent to treatment, or lack of it in the applicant\u2019s case, also see paragraphs\u00a038 and 51 above; also see point 101 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The Government have not suggested that the applicant could have left the hospital to practise her religion with the circle of people with whom she shared it, even though she had clearly indicated to the psychiatrists that attending the Ojas Meditation Center \u201cbrought her peace\u201d (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 57 above; also see Kokkinakis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031 and Sinan I\u015f\u0131k, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038). In fact, the Vilnius Regional Court, which also relied on the CPT standards, had clearly ruled out any possibility for the applicant to leave the hospital for 52\u00a0days of her stay therein (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). This view also appears to be corroborated by the CPT, which, having reviewed the situation at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital in general, noted that although only few patients therein were formally considered as involuntary, in reality even \u201cvoluntary\u201d patients were not free to leave (see point 100 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph\u00a077 above). It is also plain from the applicant\u2019s statements in her open letter (see paragraph 22 above) and in those made to the domestic court (see paragraph 43 above), to this Court (see paragraph 109 above), as well as from her medical records and other documents (see paragraphs 15, 17, 37, 42 and 50 above), that in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had to submit and subordinate her wishes to unyielding authority of the psychiatrists who were trying to \u201ccorrect\u201d the applicant so that she abandoned her \u201cfictitious\u201d religion, and whom she felt constrained to obey, even on pain of receiving a diagnosis which would make her unemployable (on the issue of undue influence and freedom of religion see Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24\u00a0February 1998, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a038 and 45, 51-53, Reports 1998I; also see the extracts from the Lithuanian Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling in paragraph 65 above). The applicant therefore has demonstrated that pressure was exerted on her to change her religious beliefs and prevent her from manifesting them (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36 and\u00a0112).",

While it is for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used, if necessary by force, to preserve the physical and mental health of patients who are entirely incapable of deciding for themselves, the Court must nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity has been convincingly shown to exist (see Herczegfalvy, cited above, \u00a7 82). In this case the psychiatrists who attended to the applicant admitted themselves that the applicant\u2019s life \u201chad not been in danger\u201d for all fifty-two\u00a0days of her stay at the Vilnius Psychiatric hospital. This view was also confirmed by the court-appointed experts (see paragraph 31 above).",

Be that as it may, it recalls having already had an occasion to examine a case concerning the applicant associations\u2019, who were religious associations or meditation associations belonging to the Osho movement, complaint that the information campaign by the respondent Government had aimed to denigrate the Osho movement\u2019s teachings (see Leela F\u00f6rderkreis e.V. and\u00a0Others v. Germany, no.\u00a058911/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070 and 71, 6\u00a0November 2008). The Court does not fail to observe that in that case it acknowledged that the applicant associations retained their freedom of religion, both as regards their freedom of conscience and the freedom to manifest their beliefs through worship and practice. Even so, given that the terms used to describe the applicant associations\u2019 movement, such as \u201csects\u201d, \u201cpsycho-sects\u201d, \u201ccults\u201d or similar, may have had negative consequences for them, in that case the Court thus proceeded its analysis on the premise that such labelling constituted an interference with the applicant associations\u2019 right to manifest their religion or belief, as guaranteed by Article 9 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a083 and 84). The Court then ultimately accepted, with certain provisos, that the German Government\u2019s public campaign in no way amounted to a prohibition of the applicant associations\u2019 freedom to manifest their religion or belief (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0100 and\u00a0101). That being so, the Court finds that the circumstances examined in the instant case, which concerns the applicant who was an individual with a history of mental troubles, and in a particularly vulnerable situation under effective control of the psychiatrists who worked on her with the view that she became critical towards her religion, were therefore more grim than those examined in Leela F\u00f6rderkreis e.V. and Others where the applicants were a group of religious associations or meditation associations, and thus all the more so amounted to an interference with the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 9 of the Convention.",

Given that the applicant\u2019s psycho-correction treatment lasted longer than 7-8\u00a0May 2003 (see paragraph 29 above) and, in fact, continued throughout her stay at that institution, the Court finds that the interference was not \u201cprescribed by law\u201d. In the context of the lawfulness of involuntary psychiatric detention, the Court also notes the CPT report which details numerous drawbacks related to the authorisation for holding a person in a psychiatric hospital, including the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital where the applicant had been held, including the lack of appropriate judicial involvement (see points 96, 98 and\u00a099 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph\u00a077 above). The need for judicial approval for compulsory admission and continued placement at the psychiatric institution has also been underlined by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see point\u00a07.1.b of the Recommendation\u00a01235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above; also see the extract from United Nations Special Rapporteur Mr\u00a0D.\u00a0P\u016bras\u2019 report in paragraph 74 above, regarding the practice of deprivation of liberty in closed psychiatric institutions). In this particular case, the Vilnius Regional Court and the Court of Appeal both concluded that domestic legal procedures for the applicant\u2019s forced hospitalisation and treatment had not only been breached, but outright disregarded (see paragraphs 32 and 45 above).",

Regarding the situation of the applicant in the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the needs of psychiatric treatment might necessitate discussing various matters, including religion, with a patient, when he or she is being treated by a psychiatrist. That being so, it does not transpire from Lithuanian law that such discussions might also take the form of psychiatrists prying into the patients\u2019 beliefs in order to \u201ccorrect\u201d them when there is no clear and imminent risk that such beliefs will manifest in actions dangerous to the patient or others (in this context see, mutatis mutandis, Biblical Centre of the Chuvash Republic v. Russia, no.\u00a033203/08, \u00a7\u00a057, 12\u00a0June 2014). On this last point, the Court refers to its earlier finding that the applicant\u2019s behaviour did not require her hospitalisation after 8\u00a0May 2003 (see paragraph 128 in limine above). The Court further reiterates the principle of the States\u2019 limited margin of appreciation to justify interference with the freedom of individual conscience (see paragraph 118 above). Notwithstanding that limited margin of appreciation which is applicable to manifestation of religious beliefs, the Court has also emphasised the primary importance of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the fact that a State cannot dictate what a person believes or take coercive steps to make him change his beliefs (see Ivanova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a079 in fine; also see paragraph 119 above). Lastly, the Court has never held in its case-law that the scope of the States\u2019 margin of appreciation could be broader or narrower depending on the nature of the religious beliefs.",

The first hospitalisation took place after the applicant had joined a religious community. Later in the same year she joined another religious group. According to the psychiatrists, her condition worsened after participating in certain \u201creligious\u201d activities in a forest (see paragraph 6). The applicant admitted that her mental condition in 1992 could have been linked to her spiritual practices (see paragraph 110). In February 2003 the applicant made her first visit to the Ojas Meditation Centre. Three months later, at work, she suddenly felt exhausted and agitated, drove home, left her car in the middle of the street, returned to her apartment, undressed completely, and began screaming on her balcony. Subsequently, she had to be taken by force to a psychiatric hospital, and was later diagnosed with a transitory psychotic disorder, a serious mental illness (see paragraphs 10-11 and 18).",

As the Court has reiterated on many occasions, it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case. As a general rule, where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and it is for the latter to establish the facts on the basis of the evidence before them (see, for example, Kudrevi\u010dius and Others v.

However, in the circumstances of the present case such an evidential basis was lacking. In our opinion, the majority\u2019s assessment of facts was inaccurate and their conclusions did not meet the required level of proof. Rather, the majority, in an uncritical manner, took the applicant\u2019s own assertions for granted and relied again on the Regional Court\u2019s judgment, although that judgment was quashed by the Court of Appeal, which disagreed with how the lower court had established the relevant facts. Therefore, we cannot accept the majority\u2019s finding in the said paragraph that the applicant \u201chas demonstrated that pressure was exerted on her to change her religious beliefs and prevent her from manifesting them\u201d.

This is clear from the medical records (see paragraphs 15-18 of the judgment) and concurs with the Government\u2019s observations (see paragraph 116). The psychiatrists obviously wanted the applicant to reflect on her own mind and behaviour, and such reflection naturally forms part of psychiatric treatment. In a setting of compulsory treatment it seems evident that the patient, at least to some extent, has to \u201csubmit and subordinate her wishes to the authority of the psychiatrists\u201d. After all, that is what psychiatric treatment is about. The applicant\u2019s attitude towards her beliefs had to be addressed in order to find out the causes of her psychotic behaviour and her serious mental disorder, particularly in view of the several previous psychiatric treatments she had already undergone and which, at least in part, related to her spiritual practices. Any possible ground and reason for a person\u2019s mental problems needs to be addressed in psychiatric treatment, whether relating to personality, business, sport, other leisure activities or beliefs, be it religious or non-religious beliefs. Furthermore, the Court has acknowledged in its case-law that, in principle, it is for the domestic medical authorities to decide, on the basis of the recognised rules of medical science, on the therapeutic methods to be used to preserve the physical and mental health of patients who are incapable of deciding for themselves, and for whom they are therefore responsible (see, inter alia, Dvo\u0159\u00e1\u010dek v. Czech Republic, no.\u00a012927/13, \u00a7 88, 6 November 2014, and Herczegfalvy v.\u00a0Austria, 24 September 1992, \u00a7 82, Series A no. 244).",

The majority, from the fact that there was a \u201crestrictive regime\u201d at the hospital and that the applicant could not leave its premises for 52 days, seem to draw the untenable inference that she could not practise her religion. However, a restrictive regime in a psychiatric hospital was not of itself problematic under Article 9 as long as the applicant, within the institution, could practise her religious beliefs, as she was actually able to do. Practising a religion is possible in many different ways and situations, even when someone is confined for medical reasons. If this were not so, each deprivation of liberty would automatically entail a violation of a detainee\u2019s Article 9 rights (see in this respect S\u00fcveges v. Hungary, no. 50255/12, 5 January 2016, where the Court found that a restriction on attending religious ceremonies was a direct consequence of the applicant being put under house arrest, and was satisfied that the interference with his \u201cconfessional rights\u201d was not such as to impair the very essence of his rights under Article 9 of the Convention).",

However, the majority then continued by observing that the applicant\u2019s life had not been in danger for the whole period of her stay in the psychiatric hospital, thereby insinuating that her medical treatment, due to the lack of such a danger, had not been shown to be appropriate. We cannot agree with placing the threshold of therapeutic necessity as high as a risk to life, because psychiatric treatment to address a less serious form of physical or psychological risk may, and often does, also constitute such a necessity.",

That can be deduced from the references to Gorzelik and Others v. Poland ([GC], no. 44158/98, \u00a7 95, ECHR 2004-I), Sidiropoulos and Others v. Greece (10 July 1998, \u00a7 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV) and Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v.

Armenia ([GC], no.\u00a023459/03, \u00a7 123, ECHR 2011), concerned an Article 9 case, but the narrow margin of appreciation was applied in that case only because there was an established consensus against the respondent State\u2019s position.

The conclusion that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her religion was not in accordance with the law was based on (i) the involuntary nature of the applicant\u2019s hospitalisation (see paragraph 128), which is not a matter to be discussed under Article 9 of the Convention; and (ii) the fact that the domestic law does not prescribe that psychiatrists can \u201c[pry] into the patients\u2019 beliefs in order to \u2018correct\u2019 them when there is no clear and imminent risk that such beliefs will manifest in actions dangerous to the patients or others\u201d (see paragraph 129). On the later point we find, as argued above, that any attempt to \u201ccorrect\u201d or change the applicant\u2019s beliefs was not proven in the present case, and furthermore it was not at all shown that the psychiatrists in the psychiatric hospital had deviated from the prescribed medical protocol in the applicant\u2019s particular situation.",
