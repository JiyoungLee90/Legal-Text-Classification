With regard to the second applicant, the Government argued that, even after 7\u00a0August 2008, a constitutional appeal had not been effective in his case in view of the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law on this matter.

It is true that the first applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention ended on 14 December 2007. He was therefore not required to pursue the avenue of a constitutional appeal. Nevertheless, since the applicant lodged his constitutional appeal after the Constitutional Court had become operational (see Cvetkovi\u0107 v. Serbia, no. 17271/04, \u00a7 42, 10\u00a0June 2008), and the Constitutional Court did examine his case on its merits, its decision must be taken into account (see, mutatis mutandis, Predi\u0107-Joksi\u0107 v.\u00a0Serbia (dec.), no. 19424/07, \u00a7 23, 20 March 2012, and Vujovi\u0107 and Lipa D.O.O. v.\u00a0Montenegro, no. 18912/15, \u00a7 32, 20 February 2018).

Moreover, he expressly relied on the Court\u2019s case-law concerning that matter, notably Ilijkov v. Bulgaria (no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26 July 2001), and J\u0117\u010dius v. Lithuania (no. 34578/97, \u00a7\u00a094, ECHR\u00a02000IX).

In particular, justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see Tase v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a029761/02, \u00a7 40, 10 June 2008). Furthermore, while it is true that by reason of their particular gravity and public reaction to them, certain offences may give rise to a social disturbance capable of justifying pre-trial detention, this ground can be regarded as relevant and sufficient only provided that it is based on facts capable of showing that the release of the accused would actually disturb public order (see Letellier v. France, 26\u00a0June 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 207).",

It considers, having examined all the material submitted to it, that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. The national courts assessed the need to continue the applicants\u2019 pre-trial detention from a rather abstract and formalistic perspective, relying solely on the severity of the potential sentence and the nature of the alleged crime (see paragraphs 8 and 15 above). The authorities thus extended the applicants\u2019 detention pending trial on grounds which cannot be regarded as \u201csufficient\u201d to justify their duration.",
