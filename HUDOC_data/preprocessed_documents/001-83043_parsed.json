As a result, they claimed EUR 2,500 for the funeral costs and the remaining EUR 28,800 concerned the total salary that he would have received if he had reached the average age of 70. In this latter context, the applicant\u2019s successors referred to an expert report of 2004 which concerned the applicant\u2019s unpaid salary between his dismissal and the date of his death. The non-pecuniary damage was for the emotional stress allegedly caused by the applicant\u2019s illness and his subsequent death. According to a medical report of 2004, the stress caused by the impugned proceedings affected his medical treatment. The applicant\u2019s successors further claimed 8,162,906 Macedonian denars in respect of pecuniary damage for the alleged violations of Articles 6 (the alleged unfairness of the proceedings), 7 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

However, regard being had to the above criteria and in particular the scope of work done by the applicant\u2019s representative (the preparation and submission of the application and the replies to the Government\u2019s observations), it considers reasonable to award the sum of EUR 600 for the proceedings before the Court.",
