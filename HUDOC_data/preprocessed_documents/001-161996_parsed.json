Under such circumstances, the Court is convinced that the two crimes of which the applicant was convicted did not arise from identical facts or facts which were substantially the same; thus, they did not constitute the \u201csame offence\u201d for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (see Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, \u00a7 82).",

In this context, the Court also reiterates that it is not its role to determine what sentence is appropriate for what offence, and that matters of appropriate sentencing largely fall outside the scope of the Convention (see Sawoniuk v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 63716/00, ECHR 2001-VI).

The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to delay the execution of that judgment did not explicitly indicate whether the applicant had to continue complying with the injunction during that delay (see paragraph 15 above). In their observations the Government stated that the delay of the execution had not affected the annulment of the suspension of the applicant\u2019s sentence, and thus he was no longer obliged to comply with the injunction after 4 July 2007 but continued to do so \u201cvoluntarily\u201d (see paragraph 39 above). However, in fact, after that date the local prison department continued to hold regular interviews with the applicant, who reported to its office every two months (see paragraph 17 above).

To put this in other terms, unless there is a preceding norm of criminal law there are no facts to speak of. Thomas Hobbes, for example, understood this when he wrote: \u201cCivil laws ceasing, crimes also cease\u201d. For the purpose of criminal law, there are no \u201cfacts\u201d unless they are seen through one of the major premises reposing in substantive criminal law. If the legal qualification of the \u201cfacts\u201d is altered, different facts come into purview. Other facts evaporate.
