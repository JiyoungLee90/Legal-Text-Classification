As regards the charge under Article 316 \u00a7\u00a01 it was stated that, after being taken to the PDFOC on a suspicion of illegally carrying a firearm, the applicant, while in the courtyard of the PDFOC building, disobeying the lawful orders of the PDFOC officers to step out of the police car and to enter the building, had punched officer A.H. in the shoulder, as a result of which the officer had fallen down.

Impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias and its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways. The Court has thus distinguished between a subjective approach, that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction or interest of a given judge in a particular case, and an objective approach, that is determining whether he or she offered sufficient guarantees to rule out any legitimate doubt in this respect (see Kyprianou v.

In this respect even appearances may be of some importance (see Kyprianou, cited above, \u00a7 118). This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Micallef, cited above, \u00a7 96; Morice, cited above, \u00a7 76; and Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e S\u00e1, cited above, \u00a7 147).",

Thus, Judge Z.V. and Investigator A.V. are lineal consanguine relatives of the first degree (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramljak v. Croatia, no. 5856/13, \u00a7\u00a034, 27 June 2017). As regards the involvement of A.V. in the proceedings at issue, the Court notes at the outset that, according to Article 90 \u00a7 1(3) of the CCP, A.V. was a participant and therefore a party to the criminal proceedings, which would appear to justify the judge\u2019s recusal under that provision. This element, however, was considered irrelevant and not a factor preventing the judge from sitting on the case (see paragraph 52 above). Having regard to A.V.\u2019s actual involvement in the proceedings, it is true that the investigative team was composed of numerous investigators and there is no indication that A.V. had been involved in any specific investigative measure taken in respect of the applicant. Nevertheless, taking into account the nature of criminal case no. 62202608 and its distinctive context, the Court does not find this to be decisive in the particular circumstances of the present case. It is to be noted that criminal case no.\u00a062202608 was instituted to investigate the leaders and supporters of the political opposition in connection with the protest movement which unfolded in Armenia following the presidential election and culminated in the events of 1 and 2 March 2008, including the applicant, who showed his support for that movement and, as a consequence, stood trial (see paragraphs 8, 34, 36 and 38 above and paragraphs 116-128 below). The son of the trial court judge was involved in the investigation of that criminal case which, given the particular, politically-sensitive context and the importance of appearances, understandably raised doubts in the applicant\u2019s mind as to impartiality of the judge.",

Firstly, during the interview of 6 June 2008, while being charged with illegal possession of a weapon and assault on a police officer, he had been asked questions almost exclusively related to his speech at Freedom Square and unrelated to the charges against him. Secondly, on 13 June 2008 a new charge had been brought against him under Article 300 of the CC for usurpation of power which had been built entirely on the speech he had made at Freedom Square. The text of that speech had been included among the evidence in the criminal case against him.

The applicant lastly alleged that he had been considered as number one political prisoner in Armenia, referring in this connection to reports by international organisations and embassies regarding his criminal case, as well as various media publications alleging political motives behind his prosecution. In sum, his prosecution, detention and conviction amounted to an interference with his Article 11 rights. Such interference had been arbitrary since it had pursued disguised aims and could not be considered lawful. Furthermore, it did not pursue a legitimate aim and was not necessary in a democratic society, since his speech at Freedom Square had not incited violence, public disorder or hatred.",

Armenia, no. 34320/04, \u00a7\u00a7 87-90, 10 April 2012; Virabyan v. Armenia, no. 40094/05, \u00a7\u00a7 203-210, 2 October 2012, which concerned similar allegations but in the context of Article 14 of the Convention; and Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 241-243, which concerned the same protest movement as in the present case).\u00a0 In the case of Hakobyan and Others, in particular, the Court found that during a period when opposition rallies had been held in protest against the results of the presidential election of 2003 there had been an administrative practice of deterring or preventing opposition activists from participating in those rallies, or punishing them for having done so, by resorting to the procedure of short-term imprisonment under the Code of Administrative Offences, including on such grounds as using foul language or disobeying police orders in circumstances unrelated to the rallies. Finding that the applicants, three opposition supporters, had fallen victim to that practice, the Court rejected the factual basis for their convictions on those grounds and concluded that the true reason for their imprisonment was to prevent or discourage them from participating in the ongoing opposition protests (see Hakobyan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 90-99). A similar conclusion was reached in the case of Virabyan in respect of the applicant\u2019s arrest on suspicion of illegal possession of a weapon and subsequent administrative proceedings for alleged disobedience against police (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0203210). The Court has applied a similar approach in the context of Article 11 also in a number of cases against other countries (see Nemtsov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 1774/11, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a066-71, 31 July 2014; Karpyuk and Others v.\u00a0Ukraine, nos. 30582/04 and 32152/04, \u00a7\u00a7 194-206, 6 October 2015; and Huseynli and Others v.

As already noted in the case of Mushegh Saghatelyan, this was a period of increased political sensitivity in Armenia involving opposition rallies held in protest against an allegedly unfair presidential election result. The response of the authorities that followed, including the arrests and detention of scores of opposition supporters, was condemned by the PACE and described as a \u201cde facto crackdown on the opposition\u201d. The charges brought against many of them, especially those under Articles 225 and 300 of the CC and those based solely on police evidence, were suspected to have been \u201cartificial and politically motivated\u201d (see Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 125-131 and 243). Moreover, there was evidence suggesting that some opposition activists, including some unnamed high-level public officials who had been sacked from their posts after denouncing the election and declaring their support for the protest movement, may have fallen victim to arrests and prosecutions on \u201cseemingly artificial charges\u201d already in the period from 20 to 29 February, that is before the events of 1 March 2008 and institution of the main criminal case no. 62202608 against the leaders and supporters of the opposition (see paragraph 70 above). Bearing in mind the description of the general context provided in the above-mentioned reports by various Council of Europe bodies, which are cause for grave concern and call for special vigilance and scrutiny on the part of the Court in dealing with the applicant\u2019s particular case, the Court will refer in this connection to the following factors.",

The precise nature and source of that information were never revealed or examined at any stage of the proceedings. Thus, it is not clear on what grounds the applicant and those accompanying him were believed to be illegally armed and, moreover, to have the intention, as it was stated in very vague terms, to \u201cdestabilise the situation in Yerevan\u201d. No details of that plan were provided, including the manner in which such destabilisation was to be carried out or the motives behind it, including whether it was in any way linked to the ongoing protest movement. It is notable that the allegation that the applicant was part of an armed group planning to destabilise the situation in Yerevan was never investigated or even brought up during the ensuing investigation and the case was treated as an ordinary case of illegal possession of a weapon without any wider context, which gives an impression that no such information ever existed and that it was simply used as a pretext to stop and search the applicant.",

However, as already noted above, the materials of the case are silent as to when this information came to light (see paragraph 87 above). According to the applicant, this information was provided to the arresting officers already at the time of the police operation which, assuming this had been the case, would suggest that the applicant was taken into custody arbitrarily. However, even assuming that this information had come to light only upon verification at the PDFOC, a question would still arise as to why it had been impossible to verify this information on the spot and thereby prevent the applicant\u2019s unnecessary deprivation of liberty. It is notable that this initial reason for taking the applicant into custody was almost immediately forgotten once new grounds for prosecuting him emerged following his arrest. The applicant was never even questioned in connection with that initial suspicion but instead a criminal case was instituted on a different ground, namely alleged illegal possession of another pistol found after a search of one of the cars conducted at the PDFOC (see paragraph 24 above). All the above factors, as well as the striking vagueness of all the official documents concerning the initial reasons for the applicant\u2019s arrest (see paragraphs 86-87 above), prompt the Court to believe that there were no genuine reasons for taking the applicant into custody and the fact that he was arrested on such precarious grounds actually gives an impression that the intention was to deprive the applicant of his liberty at any cost and that his arrest may have been effected in bad faith (compare with Virabyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 205-207, and Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7 249).",

Moreover, during one of his interviews the applicant, while facing those charges, was asked questions almost exclusively related to the speech he had given at Freedom Square on 22 February 2008 (see paragraph 42 above). Furthermore, at a later stage a charge was brought against the applicant under Article\u00a0300 of the CC of \u201cusurpation of power\u201d which, even if drafted in a rather vague manner, can be understood to have concerned the applicant\u2019s involvement in the protest movement led by Mr Ter-Petrosyan, including the support shown by the applicant to that movement through his participation in the assembly at Freedom Square and the speech he had given there (see paragraph 43 above). While that charge was eventually dropped, the investigator requested an extension of the applicant\u2019s detention with reference to that charge, as well as to the main criminal case instituted to investigate the protest movement (see paragraph 44 above).",

Thus, the sole basis for the applicant\u2019s eventual conviction was an act which he had allegedly committed after having been taken into custody, namely an assault on two police officers (compare with Virabyan, cited above, \u00a7 209). Moreover, that conviction was based exclusively on the testimony of the police officers concerned and the findings of fact made in that respect by the domestic courts appear to have been a mere and unquestioned recapitulation of the circumstances as presented in that testimony (compare with Hakobyan and Others, cited above, \u00a7 98, and Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7 243). Thus, the manner in which the proceedings relating to that charge were conducted is strikingly similar to other cases where opposition activists had been prosecuted and convicted for similar acts, in similar circumstances and on the basis of similar evidence, which points to the existence of a repetitive pattern and casts doubt on the credibility of the criminal proceedings against the applicant (see Hakobyan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 97-98; Virabyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 204-209; and Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7 253).",

The applicant alleged that the interference had been unlawful and arbitrary since his prosecution had been a disguised way of preventing him from participating in the rallies and punishing him for having done so. The Court reiterates that the essential object of Article 11 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the exercise of the rights protected (see Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a011002/05, \u00a7 37, 27 February 2007). It notes that it has already found instances of similar interferences to be unlawful and arbitrary and therefore not in compliance with the requirement that any interference be prescribed by law (see Hakobyan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 107-108, and Huseynli and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 98-100).",
