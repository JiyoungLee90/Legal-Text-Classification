They further pointed out that the investigation had not obtained any evidence of the allegedly increased security measures on the motorway on the date of the abduction; the applicant\u2019s allegation of the abductors\u2019 passage through the roadblock was substantiated only by his own statement and that of Mr Kh.Kh. and not by any other piece of evidence. Referring, inter alia, to the Court\u2019s findings in the cases of Shafiyeva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 49379/09, 3 May 2012, and Tovsultanova v. Russia, no.\u00a026974/06, 17 June 2010, the Government asserted that the applicant failed to make a prima facie case of his brother\u2019s abduction by State agents.",

Russia, no. 54765/09, \u00a7 135, 18 April 2013 and Turluyeva, cited above, \u00a7 82, and the ones perpetrated prior to 2009 see Ibragimov and Others v. Russia, no. , \u00a7 82, 29 May 2008; Abdulkadyrova and Others v. Russia, no. , \u00a7\u00a0120, 8 January 2009; and Kosumova and Others v. Russia, no. , \u00a7 67, 7 June 2011). Adjudicating on those cases the Court bore in mind the difficulties associated with obtaining the evidence, and the fact that, often, little evidence could be submitted by the applicants in support of their applications. The prima facie threshold was reached primarily on the basis of witness statements, including the applicants\u2019 submissions to the Court and to the domestic authorities, and other evidence attesting to the presence of State agents in the area concerned at the relevant time. The Court relied on references to military vehicles and equipment; the unhindered passage of the abductors through military roadblocks, in particular during curfew hours; conduct typical of security operations, such as the cordoning off of areas, checking of identity documents, searches of premises, questioning of residents and communication within a chain of command; and other relevant information about special operations, such as media and NGO reports. Given the presence of those elements, it concluded that the areas in question had been within the exclusive control of the State authorities in view of the military or security operations being conducted there and the presence of servicemen. If the Government failed to rebut this presumption, that would entail a violation of Article 2 in its substantive part. Conversely, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Tovsultanova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 77-81; Movsayevy v. Russia, no. 20303/07, \u00a7 76, 14 June 2011; and Shafiyeva, cited above, \u00a7 71).",

On the other hand, the Government stated that according to the information obtained by the investigation, the allegation of the abductors\u2019 passage through the roadblock was based only on the statements of the applicant and of one other person and not on any other evidence (see paragraph 86 above) and that moreover, the investigators had established that no roadblocks, other than the only stationary checkpoint at the entrance to Grozny, had been in place on the motorway on the date of the abduction (see paragraph 25 above).

However, the Court observes that the documents submitted did not contain any features, such as the descriptions of insignias, special vehicles or other peculiarities such as a chain of command, or the use of technical equipment or specialised weapons allowing for a reasonable presumption that the perpetrators belonged to State authorities. None of witnesses to the incident pointed out any features indicating that the culprits belonged to State authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Suleymanov v. Russia, no. 32501/11, \u00a7\u00a7 133-34, 22\u00a0January 2013, and Shafiyeva, cited above, \u00a7 71). It is also noteworthy that no curfew was in force at the time and no other restrictions were imposed on driving around in civilian vehicles. These considerations along with the fact that the applicant and his relatives were inconsistent in their description of the circumstances of the abduction in their initial complaints of the incident, the fact that they did not mention therein the abductors\u2019 alleged passage through the roadblock (see paragraphs 16-18 above) and that it remained unclear whether the roadblock had indeed been put in place on that date (see paragraph 25 above) - all these factors do not enable the Court to conclude that only State agents or persons acting with their consent could be the sole possible perpetrators of the abduction or that the domestic authorities had been aware of the risk to Mr Rustam Kagirov\u2019s life.",

In spite of the very serious nature of the allegation of the abduction and the detailed information, the authorities opened the criminal investigation only a month later, on 19 June 2009 (see paragraph 21 above). Further, having obtained witness statements concerning the alleged passage of the abductors through the roadblock on the motorway, the investigators took the first step to verify it almost a month and half after the abduction (see paragraph 24 above). A month later, in the end of August 2009, the supervising body criticised the pace of the investigation and instructed the investigators to take basic steps to clarify the circumstances of the abduction (see paragraph 27 above).",

The decision to suspend the investigation of such a life-threatening crime was taken in a situation where no urgent steps had been taken to verify the important information received at the very beginning of the investigation (see, for example, paragraphs 17 and 28). It is noteworthy, that the applicant directed the investigators attention to the information concerning the culprits once again in July 2009 (see paragraph 23 above), but only three months later did they try to verify it (see paragraph 28 above). The Court observes that in such a situation the investigators should not have left the responsibility for the taking of any investigatory procedures, such as obtaining important evidence, to the next of kin (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, \u0130lhan, cited above, \u00a7 63). Furthermore, from the documents submitted it follows that in November 2009 the head of the investigations department criticised the investigators yet again for failure to take the most important investigative steps and reiterated his orders. Those orders were carried out either with a significant delay or not at all (see paragraphs 27, 34, 37 and 39 above). Therefore, it does not appear that the investigators took all reasonable steps to secure the evidence and to verify the witnesses\u2019 allegations concerning possible involvement of State agents in the abduction (see paragraphs 60 and 62 above). In the absence of any explanations for such a failure, the Court concludes that the authorities failed to demonstrate diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious matter (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. , \u00a7 94, ECHR 2004-XII).",

Each time, the investigation was stayed without the necessary steps having been taken and each time it was resumed upon the supervisors\u2019 criticism. These premature suspensions in the situation when vital steps had not been taken undermined the investigators\u2019 ability to identify and punish the perpetrators (see \u00d6gur, cited above, \u00a7 88).",

According to the Government, the applicant should have sought judicial review of the decisions of the investigating authorities as part of the exhaustion of domestic remedies.

Assuming that the applicant\u2019s request on the progress of the proceedings and the follow up on the evidence submitted to the investigation (see paragraph 23 above), it would have been sensible to presume that the necessary steps would be taken. However, in the end of November 2009 the investigators again suspended the proceedings without having taken the remedial measures and without informing the applicant of their failure to take those steps (see paragraphs 28 and 33 above).",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the authorities cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin to request particular lines of inquiry or investigative procedures (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0130lhan, cited above, \u00a7 63): they must show their commitment to take all steps of their own motion and to demonstrate that they have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the identity of the person responsible will risk falling below this standard (see, for example, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 106, ECHR 2000VII, and Tanrikulu, cited above, \u00a7 109).",

This failure to act in a timely manner led to unnecessary protractions and a loss of time because steps which could have yielded results were not taken. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that any appeals by the applicant against the investigators\u2019 decisions would have had any prospects of spurring the progress of the investigation or effectively influencing its conduct. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their objection as regards the applicant\u2019s failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
