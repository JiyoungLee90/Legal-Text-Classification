Although the applicants were responsible for minor delays (see paragraphs\u00a010 and 12 above), the Court considers that the bulk of the delay occurred as a result of the manner in which the Mon\u00e7\u00e3o Court handled the case. In particular, the Court notes that the first-instance judgment was issued on 3\u00a0March 2012 (see paragraph 19 above), four years and ten months after the claim against the applicants had been lodged. The Court also notes, inter alia, that it took six months for the Mon\u00e7\u00e3o Court to notify the applicants that they had failed to register their counterclaim with the Land Registry Office (see paragraph 12 above), and at least seven months to hold the videoconference (see paragraph 15 above).",
