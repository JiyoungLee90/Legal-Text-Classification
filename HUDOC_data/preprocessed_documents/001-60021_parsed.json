The Investigating Judge issued a search warrant ordering a house search at the premises of the SDBV company, a private company (Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung) for which the applicant acted as general manager. The seizure of documents relating to the real estate investment projects was also ordered. That same day the warrant, search and seizure were executed, the latter in the presence of the Investigating Judge. Later in the day the Investigating Judge questioned the applicant and ordered his detention on remand as he found that there existed a danger of the applicant absconding and collusion. As regards the risk of collusion, the Investigating Judge found that there was the danger that the applicant would attempt to influence the employees of the SDBV company and to remove documents which had not been found at the house search.",

However, the danger of collusion continued to exist as the applicant might try to influence witnesses not yet heard and to remove any traces of the offence. There was also a danger of his committing further offences. On 20 November 1991 the applicant appealed.

The Investigating Judge found that this measure was necessary because co-suspects were still at large, several witnesses had not yet been heard and there was a risk that the applicant could influence them. The Investigating Judge stated that the validity of this order would expire at the latest when the two-month statutory time-limit for detention on remand based on the risk of collusion would end. The applicant appealed against this decision. He submitted that he did not oppose this measure in principle, however, the measure constituted an unnecessary limitation on his defence rights and the Investigating Judge had failed to order this measure within 14 days as prescribed by law.",

As regards the complaint about the surveillance of the applicant\u2019s contacts with counsel, the Review Chamber found the Investigating Judge\u2019s decision to be correct. This order did not involve any criticism of counsel or any reproach of conduct contrary to law or the disciplinary rules of the members of the bar, but merely had the purpose of preventing any contact whatsoever with third persons in order not to endanger the success of the criminal investigation. The present case concerned the complicated business relations of the SDBV and several other companies managed by the applicant, and the flow of money between them. Further witnesses could only be identified after all the documents seized had been examined and the applicant was to be prevented from influencing them. Furthermore, the decision had been taken within the time limit prescribed by S. 193 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Review Chamber also found the applicant\u2019s complaint that he did not have sufficient access to his case-file unfounded. The Investigating Judge had granted access to the file to the official receiver of the SDBV company and the applicant\u2019s defence counsel, the latter also being given the possibility to make copies of the documents in the file. The applicant\u2019s counsel visited him repeatedly and could have given him copies if he so wished. Moreover, when questioned by the Investigating Judge, the applicant was informed of the contents of the file and about the statements of witnesses already heard.",

In particular, such a step is unnecessary if, like in the present case, those submissions contain no new aspects (see No. 20055/92, Moser v. Austria, Dec. 13.4.94, unpublished).",

The domestic court dealing with such matters must provide the \u201cguarantees of a judicial procedure\u201d. The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties - the prosecutor and the detainee (Grauzinis v. Lithuania, no.\u00a037975/97, \u00a7 31, 10.10.2000).

According to the Court\u2019s case-law, it follows from the wording of Article 6 \u2013 and particularly from the autonomous meaning to be given to the notion of \u201ccriminal charge\u201d \u2013 that this provision has some application to pre-trial proceedings (Imbrioscia v. Switzerland judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, p. 13, \u00a7 36). It thus follows that, in view of the dramatic impact of deprivation of liberty on the fundamental rights of the person concerned, proceedings conducted under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention should in principle also meet, to the largest extent possible under the circumstances of an on-going investigation, the basic requirements of a fair trial, such as the right to an adversarial procedure. While national law may satisfy this requirement in various ways, whatever method is chosen should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment thereon (see, mutatis mutandis, Brandstetter v. Austria judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no. 211, p. 27, \u00a7 67 and Garcia Alva v. Germany, no. 23541/94, \u00a7 39, 13.2.2001).",

The intervention of one organ satisfies Article 5 \u00a7 4, on condition that the procedure followed has a judicial character and gives to the individual concerned guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (Jecius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-IX). Nevertheless, a State which sets up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of applications for release from detention must in principle accord to the detainee the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (Toth v.

The Government submit that such a failure is not in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 because this provision would only require that the comments are served on the detainee if they contain relevant new information.

But even if it is not always necessary that the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for criminal litigation, they have to be \u201ctruly adversarial\u201d and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties (Grauzinis v.

If a lawyer were unable to confer with his client and receive confidential instructions from him without surveillance, his assistance would loose much of its usefulness, whereas the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective (S. v. Switzerland judgment of 28 November 1991, Series A no. 220, p. 16, \u00a7 48). In the latter case the Court noted that the risk of collusion merits consideration, however the possibility of several defence counsel collaborating with a view to co-ordinating their defence strategy was not sufficient to restrict the accused\u2019s rights of defence (loc. cit., p. 16, \u00a7 49).",

Surveillance by the investigating judge of the contacts of a detainee with his defence counsel is a serious interference with an accused\u2019s defence rights and very weighty reasons should be given for its justification. This was so in the case of Kempers v. Austria where the applicant was suspected of being the member of a gang and utmost confidentiality was necessary in order to catch the other members (No. 21842/93, Kempers v. Austria, Dec. 27.2.97, unpublished). In the present case such extraordinary features cannot be made out. The Court finds that the domestic courts essentially relied on a risk of collusion, but this was the very reason for which detention on remand had already been ordered. The restriction on contacts with defence counsel for a person who is already placed in detention on remand is an additional measure which requires further arguments. The Court cannot find that the Austrian courts or the Government have furnished convincing arguments in this respect. ",
