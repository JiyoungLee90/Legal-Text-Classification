Having presented one party's view, it also informed the reader of the other party's story and referred to some documents which suggested that the second applicant had also breached certain legal obligations (see paragraph 10 above). In view of the above, the Court is satisfied of the newspaper's good faith and that it had acted in consonance with principles of responsible journalism (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.  [GC], no. 21980/93, \u00a7 63, ECHR 1999III), albeit resorting to \u201ca degree of exaggeration or even provocation\u201d, which had to be protected (see Prager and Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 26\u00a0April 1995, Series A no. 313, \u00a7\u00a038).",

This is of particular relevance to the phrases in the article \u201cthe neighbours say that he rents them to earn a fortune\u201d, \u201che told [the second applicant] that he would achieve his aim at any price\u201d and that \u201che would make her life impossible\u201d. The Court reiterates that \u201cpunishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person ... would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so\u201d (see Jersild\u00a0v.
