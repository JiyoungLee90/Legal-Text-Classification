Nonetheless, those rights are not absolute. There is room for \u201cimplied limitations\u201d, and Contracting States are given a margin of appreciation in this sphere (see Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a024833/94, \u00a7 63, ECHR 1999I; Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a0201, ECHR 2000IV; and Podkolzina v. Latvia, no. 46726/99, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2002II). However, in the last resort it is for the Court to determine whether or not the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with. It must satisfy itself that the conditions imposed on the rights to vote and to stand for election do not curtail those rights to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see Mathieu-Mohin and\u00a0Clerfayt, cited above, \u00a7 52). In particular, any conditions imposed must not thwart the free expression of the people in the choice of the legislature \u2013 in other words, they must reflect, or not run counter to, the concern to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of an electoral procedure aimed at identifying the will of the people through universal suffrage (see Hirst (no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7 62).",

Turkey, 30\u00a0January 1998, \u00a7 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I; Chassagnou and Others v.

The right to stand as a candidate in an election, which is guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and is inherent in the concept of a truly democratic regime, would be merely illusory if one could be arbitrarily deprived of it at any moment. Consequently, while it is true that States have a wide margin of appreciation when establishing eligibility conditions in the abstract, the principle that rights must be effective requires that the eligibility procedure contain sufficient safeguards to prevent arbitrary decisions (see Podkolzina, cited above, \u00a7 35). This principle requiring prevention of arbitrariness is equally relevant in other situations where the effectiveness of individual electoral rights is at stake (see, mutatis mutandis, Kovach v. Ukraine, no. 39424/02, \u00a7\u00a055, ECHR 2008).",

In particular, one-third of the members of each commission at all levels, including the CEC, were nominated by or on behalf of the parliamentary-majority party. In addition, another member, nominally representing independent members of parliament formally unaffiliated with any political party, was appointed \u201cin agreement\u201d with the majority party. Thus, seven out of eighteen CEC members, four out of nine members of each ConEC, and three out of six members of each PEC were either directly or indirectly appointed by the ruling party. In addition, chairmen of all commissions at all levels were appointed from among the members nominated by the ruling party. Pro-ruling-party forces thus had a relative majority vis-\u00e0-vis the representatives of any other political force in electoral commissions at every level, including the CEC which examined the applicants\u2019 complaint in the present case. While, at least at CEC level, this majority was not sufficient to automatically secure the qualified majority of at least two-thirds of the attendant members\u2019 votes required for a decision (see paragraph 35 above), the Court takes note of the reports that commission members appointed by theoretically \u201cindependent\u201d sections of the parliament or some small parties tended, in reality, to vote in line with the governing party (see paragraph 54 above).",

The Court reiterates that, ultimately, the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of an electoral commission is to ensure the effective administration of free and fair voting in an impartial manner, which is achievable by virtue of a structural composition that guarantees its independence and impartiality but which would become impossible to achieve if the commission were to become another forum for political struggle between various political forces (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0108).",

Nevertheless, having regard to the above considerations in the context of electoral complaints lodged by opposition candidates in general, the Court finds that the method in question was one of the systemic factors contributing to the ineffectiveness of the examination by the CEC of the applicants\u2019 election-related complaint in the present case. It falls to the Committee of Ministers to supervise, in the light of the information provided by the respondent State, the execution of the Court\u2019s judgment and to follow up on the implementation of general measures and evolution of the system of electoral administration in line with the Convention requirements.

In particular, many of the observers claimed that there had been serious discrepancies between the numbers of voters attending various polling stations and the numbers of ballots found inside the ballot boxes. However, it has not been shown that the CEC expert group took any steps to actually investigate this matter. One obvious step would have been to review the attendance lists in the affected polling stations and examine whether the relevant numbers were consistent. Instead, the CEC presented somewhat dubious reasons for discrediting those statements. For example, the Court notes that the CEC described the statement made by three observers in Polling Station no. 25 as their \u201csubjective opinions\u201d (see paragraph 24 above), when it was clear that the statement in question did not contain any opinions but was rather a firsthand observation including specific factual information requiring further investigation as to its veracity (see paragraph 17 above).",
