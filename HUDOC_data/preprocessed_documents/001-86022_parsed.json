The police officers had intervened to protect the applicant from further attacks. It endorsed the lower court\u2019s reasoning that the applicant had not been beaten in the police station while in custody. It established that even if the lower court had heard the witnesses proposed by the applicant, they would not have altered its findings, as it had found that the police officers who had arrested him had not used any force and had not inflicted any injuries on him.",

They further submitted that the injury, if any, was caused by K. P., who had hit the applicant with a stick. This version was confirmed by the civil courts\u2019 findings, and partly by the applicant\u2019s statement (see paragraph 6 above) that he had received blows from K. P. when he had returned the sheep. The applicant for his part argued that the injuries had been caused by the police at the scene and while in police custody. He so contended in the criminal complaint before the public prosecutor and also in his application before the Court.

It has reached no conclusion on the substance of that complaint. Making an assessment on an equitable basis, it awards the applicant the sum of EUR 3,000, plus any tax that may be chargeable. In this later respect, it is to be noted that the award is made for the applicant, while it is payable to his sisters who were allowed, by the Court\u2019s admissibility decision of 18 September 2006 given in this case, to pursue the application which the applicant had brought himself.",

These amounts are to be paid into the bank account of the ERRC, exclusive of any tax that may be chargeable. Since no claim has been made in respect of any costs and expenses incurred in the domestic proceedings, the Court does not make any award under that head.",
