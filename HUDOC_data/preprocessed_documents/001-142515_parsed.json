The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair.

The Court notes that cellar no.10, where the drugs were found, was not owned by the applicant and it was secured by a padlock which locking system, as established by the Bureau, was damaged and could have been opened with any object (see paragraph 10 above). In such circumstances, the applicant\u2019s fingerprint found on one of the packages in that cellar constituted, in the Court\u2019s view, the principal evidence in the case, as it established a direct link between the applicant and the drugs. That was confirmed by the trial court according to which the applicant\u2019s fingerprint found on one of the packages outweighed the fact that the cellar no.10 did not belong to him (see paragraph 23 above).

At the same time, he sought that these witnesses be examined. Apparently, these requests concerned witnesses who had participated in or experienced the critical events at first hand.

It also gave no reason for refusing to examine the experts who had drawn up the fingerprint report SK-164/2003. Assuming that it regarded unnecessary to hear them in person because it had their written reports, which had been based on scientific methods (see paragraphs 27 and 39 above), the Court considers that it did not make their questioning unnecessary \u2013 otherwise there would be no need to question any witness who had given written submissions to the prosecution during the pre-trial investigation. Even if there were no inconsistencies or irregularities in the report, questioning of experts might reveal possible conflicts of interests, insufficiency of materials at their disposal, or flaws in the methods of examination (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, \u00a7 714, 25 July 2013). The same concerns the Court of Appeal\u2019s refusal to examine the neighbours.
