In particular, the Government argued that the applicant in application no. 58969/12 could no longer claim to be a victim of the alleged violations because Russian courts had awarded him compensation for the unlawful criminal proceedings against him. In this respect, the Court reiterates the well-established principle of its case-law that an applicant may lose his victim status if two conditions are met: first, the authorities must have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, the breach of the Convention and, second, they must have afforded redress for it (see Sakhnovskiy v. Russia [GC], no.\u00a021272/03, \u00a7 67, 2 November 2010). The first condition was not met in the applicant\u2019s case. There was no acknowledgement of a violation of his right related to the material conditions of his detention in the IVS facility, as well as the length of his pre-trial detention (see appended table for details). The applicant thus did not lose his victim status under Article 3 of the Convention and the Government\u2019s admissibility objection in respect of application no. 58969/12 should be dismissed. The Government also argued that applicant in application no. 69047/13 had failed to comply with the six-month requirement. The Court observes that the applicant raised the present complaints to the Court for the first time in a letter which he dispatched on 23\u00a0October 2013. The fact was confirmed by a copy of the payment slip indicating the international shipment to the Court on that date. A copy of the payment slip was forwarded to the Government. The letter arrived to the Court on 25 October 2013. The period of detention in respect of which the applicant complained ended on 11 June 2013. It follows that applicant in application no. 69047/13 complied with the six-month time-limit and the Government\u2019s objection to that effect should be rejected.",
