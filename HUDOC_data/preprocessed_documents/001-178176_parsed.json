However, that interference had been lawful and had pursued a legitimate aim. In particular, the Government argued that the confiscation, as a sanction for the administrative offence in question, had been prescribed by Romanian Customs Regulations, which had been sufficiently clear, accessible and foreseeable. The Government further submitted that the confiscation had had a legitimate aim, namely the protection of the general interest of checking certain goods prior to their entry into commercial circulation and ensuring a functioning customs regime, which entailed the adequate collection of taxes and other contributions. As to proportionality, the Government stated that Romania\u2019s geographical position at the border of the European Union called for strong enforcement of border crossing legislation as an obligation flowing from its status as a Member State. Referring to the legal framework applicable in the case (see paragraphs 12 above), the Government contended that once the commission of an offence had been uncovered, the authorities had no other choice but to apply a fine and to confiscate undeclared goods. Nevertheless, the authorities had applied the minimum fine provided for by law in the current case.",

The Court must examine in particular whether the interference struck the requisite fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the public and the requirements of the protection of the applicant\u2019s right of property, having regard to the margin of appreciation left to the respondent State in that area.

Moreover, according to the Romanian Integrated Customs Tariff and the EU Common Customs Tariff, silver in the form carried by the applicant was free from duties (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above). Those elements distinguish this case from certain others, in which the confiscation measure applied either to goods whose import was prohibited or to vehicles used for transporting prohibited substances or trafficking human beings (see the cases referred to in Ismayilov, cited above, \u00a7 35, and Grifhorst, cited above, \u00a7 99).",

The silver he transported had been lawfully acquired and he was allowed to take it into Romania as long as he declared it to the customs authorities. It follows that the only criminal conduct which could be attributed to him was the failure to make a declaration to that effect to the customs authorities.",

It has not been convincingly shown or indeed argued by the Government that the fine alone, equivalent to EUR\u00a0750, was not sufficient to achieve the desired deterrent and punitive effect and prevent future breaches of the declaration requirement. In those circumstances, the Court concludes that the confiscation of the two silver ingots that should have been declared, as an additional sanction to the fine, was disproportionate in that it imposed an excessive burden on the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Ismayilov, cited above, \u00a7 38, and Boljevi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 45).",
