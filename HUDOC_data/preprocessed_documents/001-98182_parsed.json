The investigation had been opened several weeks after she had lodged her official complaint about the abduction and then it had been suspended and resumed a number of times, thus delaying the taking of the most basic steps.

The investigation in the criminal case was instituted on 31\u00a0January 2003, that is one month and thirteen days after the authorities were informed about the incident. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were either delayed or not taken at all. For instance, as can be seen from the decision of the town court of 14 May 2004, by that date the investigators had not identified or questioned key witnesses to the abduction (see paragraph 51 above). Further, the investigators had not taken such crucial steps as identifying the APCs used by the abductors and questioning their drivers; they had not questioned any representatives of local military and law-enforcement agencies about possible involvement of their personnel in the abduction; they had failed to take any measures to establish the whereabouts of the purple VAZ car which had been taken away by the abductors and had failed to question any of the local residents to establish the whereabouts of the key witnesses to the abduction. In addition, it does not appear that the investigators attempted to take any steps to identify the driver and the passengers of the bus which had also been stopped at the checkpoint by the military servicemen or any other local residents who had been present at the checkpoint during the incident (see paragraph 9 above) and to question them about the events. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.
