The Court has held that the practice of keeping defendants in detention without a specific legal basis or clear rules governing their situation \u2013 with the result that they may be deprived of their liberty for an unlimited period without judicial authorisation \u2013 was incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see Khudoyorov v. , no. 6847/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0146-148, ECHR 2005...; Je\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-64, and Baranowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-58).",

It reiterates that for the detention to meet the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d, it must have a basis in domestic law. The Government, however, did not point to any legal provision which permitted a defendant to continue to be held once the authorised detention period had expired. The Russian Constitution and the rules of criminal procedure vested the power to order or prolong detention pending trial in prosecutors and courts (see paragraph 36 above). No exceptions to that rule were permitted or provided for, no matter how short the duration of the detention. As noted above, in the period until 3 April 2001 there was neither a prosecutor\u2019s order nor a judicial decision authorising the applicant\u2019s detention. It follows that the applicant was in a legal vacuum that was not covered by any domestic legal provision.",

Any system of mandatory detention pending trial is incompatible per se with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it being incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish and demonstrate the existence of concrete facts outweighing the rule of respect for individual liberty (see Rokhlina v.\u00a0, no. 54071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005). In the present case, apart from a blank reference to the applicant\u2019s \u201ccharacter\u201d in just one decision, the domestic authorities did not mention any concrete facts warranting the applicant\u2019s detention.",

Estonia, no. 55939/00, \u00a7 64, 15\u00a0February 2005; Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v. Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7 83, 21 December 2000). In the present case, during the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention, the authorities did not consider the possibility of ensuring her attendance by the use of other \u201cpreventive measures\u201d which are expressly provided for by Russian law to secure the proper conduct of criminal proceedings. At no point in the proceedings did the domestic courts explain in their decisions why alternatives to the deprivation of liberty would not have ensured that the trial would follow its proper course. This failure is made all the more inexplicable by the fact that the new Code of Criminal Procedure expressly requires the domestic courts to consider less restrictive measures as an alternative to custody (see paragraph 37 above).",
