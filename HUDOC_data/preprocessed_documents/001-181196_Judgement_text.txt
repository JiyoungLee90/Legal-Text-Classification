The case originated in seventeen applications against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Russian nationals. Application numbers, dates of their lodging and of communication, the applicants’ names, their personal details and the names of their legal representatives are set out in the appended table below.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 18 January 2017 the complaints concerning absence of the applicants and/or their lawyers from appeal hearings in criminal cases were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court. The parties submitted written observations on the admissibility and merits.
Between 2005 and 2012 the applicants were charged and subsequently convicted of different criminal offences. Their cases were examined by appeal courts in the absence of the applicants and/or their lawyers. Convictions were upheld.
Information relevant to the criminal proceedings against the applicants appears in the appended table below.
