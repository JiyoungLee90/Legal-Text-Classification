Facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction, or even the bringing of a charge, which is the next stage of the process of criminal investigation.

No witnesses were questioned at that hearing and the only documents examined by the court were the report on the arrest, the decision to open criminal proceedings into the murders, the record of the applicant\u2019s questioning and his birth, marriage and medical certificates (see paragraph 9 above).

In the long term, however, the requirements of the investigation no longer suffice to justify continued detention: in the normal course of events the risks alleged diminish with the passing of time as inquiries are effected, witness statements taken and evidence collected. The reference to the risk of interfering with the proceedings therefore becomes less relevant. After the completion of the investigation it may no longer be sufficient to outweigh, on its own, the applicant\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial (see Kemmache v.

Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2000-III). There is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.

At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right of judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 is primarily intended to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. However, if the detention is confirmed by a court it must be considered to be lawful and not arbitrary, even where appeal is available. Subsequent proceedings are not so much concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention. Therefore, the Court would be less concerned with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and gave the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees (see, Lebedev v. , no. 4493/04, \u00a7 96, 25 October 2007).",

He and his counsel had attended the first-instance hearings and had had an opportunity to make written and oral submissions. A less stringent standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d therefore applied to the subsequent appeal proceedings at issue in the present case (see case-law in paragraph 151 above). The Court notes that in the case of Mamedova v. Russia, which, like the present case, concerned appeal proceedings, it found that the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement was not complied with where the appeal proceedings lasted thirty-six, twenty-six, thirty-six, and twenty-nine days, stressing that their entire duration was attributable to the authorities (see Mamedova, cited above, \u00a7 96; see also, for longer delays, Ignatov v. , no. 27193/02, \u00a7\u00a7 112-114, 24 May 2007; Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 98-102; and Lamazhyk v. , no. 20571/04, \u00a7\u00a7 104-106, 30 July 2009).

The Court is not convinced by that argument. It appears from the judgment of the Supreme Court which interpreted the applicable provisions of Russian law that the validity of the list of jurors was not conditional on its prior publication (see paragraph 74 above). The Court has no reason to disagree with that interpretation. It reiterates that it is primarily for the domestic courts to interpret national law, including the rules governing their own constitution and procedure, and that its supervisory role will only come into play in cases of flagrant disregard of the applicable laws (see Lavents v.\u00a0Latvia, no. 58442/00, \u00a7 114, 28 November 2002, with further references).",

The administration of justice, including trials, derives legitimacy from being conducted in public. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, publicity contributes to fulfilling the aim of Article 6 \u00a7 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Gautrin and Others v.\u00a0France, judgment of 20 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, \u00a7\u00a042, and\u00a0Pretto and Others v.

The Court reiterates in this connection that the mere presence of classified information in a case file does not automatically imply a need to close a trial to the public, without balancing openness with national security concerns. It may be important for a State to preserve its secrets, but it is of infinitely greater importance to surround justice with all the requisite safeguards, of which one of the most indispensable is publicity. Before excluding the public from criminal proceedings, courts must make specific findings that closure is necessary to protect a compelling governmental interest and limit secrecy to the extent necessary to preserve such an interest (see Belashev v. , no. 28617/03, \u00a7 83, 4 December 2008, and Romanova v. , no. 23215/02, \u00a7 155, 11\u00a0October 2011).",

Nor did the Moscow City Court respond to the applicant\u2019s request to hold the trial publicly subject to clearing the courtroom for a single or, if need be, a number of secret sessions to read out classified documents (see paragraph 51 above). Indeed, it follows from the applicant\u2019s submissions, not contested by the Government, that only about sixty documents out of more than seven thousand in the case file were classified as secret. The Court cannot but find that in such a situation the decision of the Moscow City Court to close the entire trial to the public was not justified. Finally, the decision to hold the trial in camera appears particularly striking in the light of the fact that none of the classified documents was eventually examined by the trial court (see paragraph 74 above).",

This principle requires that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility and should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of their evidence, by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 127).

They also testified that Mr G. was afraid of being killed by the applicant. In the circumstances of the present case (see paragraph 196 above) it is difficult to assess what weight was attached by the jury to Mr P.\u2019s and Mr\u00a0S.\u2019s corroborative testimony. It is however worth noting that Mr P. and Mr S. were both hearsay witnesses whose second-hand testimony must have carried less weight than statements by Mr K. made from his personal knowledge (see, for similar reasoning, Mirilashvili v. , no. 6293/04, \u00a7\u00a0218, 11\u00a0December 2008). Indeed, the truthfulness and accuracy of Mr G., whose statements against the applicant, not delivered under oath, were repeated by Mr P. and Mr S., could not be tested by cross-examination, and his demeanour when giving those statements could not be observed by the jury. Moreover, as regards Mr P., the Court has earlier found that a higher degree of scrutiny should be applied to assessment of statements by co-defendants because the position in which the co-defendants find themselves while testifying is different from that of ordinary witnesses (see Vladimir Romanov v. Russia, no.\u00a041461/02, \u00a7 102, 24 July 2008).
