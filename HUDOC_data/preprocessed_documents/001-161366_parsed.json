The night before Christmas Eve 2002 was marked by bad luck for the PSD in Suceava, as thieves visited their headquarters. On the morning of 24 December some of the members of this party arrived at the headquarters located in the centre of Suceava ... [and] noticed that the headquarters had been ravaged. After checking inside, they realised there had been a burglary and that the thieves had stolen two televisions and approximately ROL 17,000,000. While searching for valuables, the thieves vandalised the offices, breaking all the doors, and yanking the televisions from the electric sockets. Following an investigation by the Suceava police, the main suspect was identified as S.A., who has been missing from his place of residence since that date. S.A. (see photo) fled in order to avoid criminal investigation for the offence of aggravated theft and so a general search has been instituted and his photograph has been sent to judicial service police officers throughout the country. In a case where someone tries to avoid \u2018getting nicked\u2019 [p\u00e2rnaie] by fleeing, despite being sought by the police, a countywide search is launched. If the person is not found within ninety days, the police launch a national search.

The plaintiff never provided the relevant official information that could have served as a basis for retraction. The Court itself accepts that at the time it was written the facts presented in the article were accurate (\u00a7 28). The Court claims, however, that \u201cthe courts referred to the fact that a retraction should have been published once the applicant had become aware of the error contained in the article\u201d (\u00a7 29). We do not find such a limited approach in the domestic judgments quoted, where the main reference is to the notification by the father. At the time of that notification, as the present judgment clearly states, the contested information was correct. Moreover, the plaintiff in the domestic proceedings at no point requested rectification, even though he had thirty days to avail himself of that remedy. Instead he asked for damages for the defamation contained in the original publication which informed about the position of the police. The injured party initiated an action for damages as the original publication had allegedly damaged his reputation. During the proceedings it was shown that the police made a mistake. The injured party did not alter his plea and did not request rectification. Nevertheless, the journalist was ordered to pay damages for reputational injury for what he had failed to do during the proceedings, where he had not even been asked to act in any given manner. Furthermore, we also entertain serious doubts about the assumption that journalists have a duty of rectification whenever they become aware of an error in their article, especially if that error is not of their making. Such a duty is even more problematic in the absence of any request for a rectification when the error becomes known (if it really is an error on the part of the journalist, a very big \u201cif\u201d in this case).",

In the present case, the Court allegedly relies on a concept of \u201cresponsible journalism\u201d with reference, mutatis mutandis, to \u201cPentik\u00e4inen v.\u00a0Finland [GC], no. 11882/10, \u00a7 90, 20 October 2015 and the case-law cited therein)\u201d. More specifically, the Court refers to the duty of the journalist (or newspaper) to enable a defamed person to present his or her reply in a manner compatible with the editorial practice of the newspaper concerned (see Kaperzi\u0144ski v. Poland, no. 43206/07, \u00a7 66, 3\u00a0April\u00a02012). Needless to say, in the present case the right of reply was allowed, so the Kaperzi\u0144ski requirement of responsible journalism was satisfied. But perhaps there is something else in the general principles of Pentik\u00e4inen (even if it is quoted without going into specifics, mutatis mutandis) that justifies the non-violation of Article 10. The \u201ccase-law cited\u201d in Pentik\u00e4inen is Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, \u00a7\u00a065, ECHR\u00a01999III; Fressoz and Roire v.

Further, the present case does not involve someone being charged with criminal acts in the absence of a factual basis at the material time (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, \u00a7 66). At the material time the information was correct. It accurately reported the facts of the police search. The injured party could have asked the police for a rectification (possibly at their own expense) after the search had been called off. Arguably he could also have asked the newspaper after the cancellation of the search, but he failed to do so, even during the criminal procedure. We cannot see why it should be a matter of journalistic ethics to provide rectification ex officio and proprio motu where the police mistake comes to the journalist\u2019s attention in a criminal case against him. Of course, we would have given thought to that possibility had the Court given us reason to believe that such an obligation exists.",
