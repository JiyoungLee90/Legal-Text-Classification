Whilst noting that in none of the three domestic case-law examples, at least in the procedural stage as submitted by the Government, were the plaintiffs successful in obtaining damages for harm to their health which occurred when they were in detention (see paragraphs 65-67 above), the Court is not ready to conclude that such actions did not have any chances of success.

The responsibility of the Contracting States is incurred by the actions of their organs. A lawyer, even if he or she is officially appointed to represent an accused in court proceedings, cannot be considered as an organ of a State. It follows from the independence of the legal profession from the State that the conduct of legal assistance is essentially a matter between the defendant and his counsel, whether counsel be appointed under a legal-aid scheme or privately financed, and, as such, cannot, other than in special circumstances, incur the State\u2019s liability under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Rutkowski v.

Two appeals on points of law were submitted by the applicant. Given that one of them was printed, the Supreme Court made the reasonable assumption that the applicant had been assisted by a lawyer in writing it. Furthermore, in none of his appeals did the applicant request to attend the Supreme Court hearing. Admittedly, the applicant had indicated such a wish, but only on 5 January 2004. However, in the view of the Government, this request was submitted far too late and was completely unsubstantiated.

Regard must be had in assessing this question to, inter alia, the special features of the proceedings involved and the manner in which the defence\u2019s interests are presented and protected before the appellate court, particularly in the light of the issues to be decided and their importance for the applicant (see Kucera v. Austria, no. 40072/98, \u00a7 25, 3 October 2002). Even so, in the instant case it must be recalled that the applicant had been convicted of murder and sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment. Taking into account the gravity of what was at stake for the applicant, the Court considers that respect for the right to a fair trial, guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, required that the applicant be taken to the hearing at the Supreme Court, especially when the applicant had expressly requested to be present (see, in this connection, Sejdovic, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 83 in fine and 86).",

However, this complaint had been submitted too late, since the applicant was perfectly aware that the three-month time-limit for submitting an appeal on points of law had already expired.

Poland (nos. 29692/96 and 34612/97, \u00a7 50, 18 December 2001), where the applicant could have obtained access to the highest court only through a lawyer, in the present case Lithuanian law allowed the applicant to lodge an appeal on points of law by himself. The applicant\u2019s cassation appeal was found to be in compliance with procedural requirements and was accepted for examination by the Supreme Court.

Neither does it appear that there was any explicit disagreement between her and the applicant on the substance or strategy of his defence. Whilst it is unclear how much time the lawyer S.K. spent on the applicant\u2019s case, it may be concluded that she was a priori prepared to assist the applicant, and this is, without doubt, a relevant consideration. In such circumstances the Court cannot hold that the arrangements made at the appellate stage of the proceedings were insufficient and did not secure effective legal assistance to the applicant.",

For the Court, the letter of 12 September 2003 by the Chairman of the Tel\u0161iai District Court had already given the applicant a reasonable expectation that a lawyer would be appointed to assist him before the Supreme Court (see paragraph 12 above). Admittedly, the Chairman of the Tel\u0161iai District Court did inquire into the manner in which the free legal aid was to be provided, given that he wrote to the applicant\u2019s previous lawyer S.K. and the \u0160iauliai Regional Bar (see paragraphs 13 and\u00a014 above). However, as it appears, those efforts were to no effect, because eventually no lawyer was appointed. Whilst having been notified of the fact by the applicant on 1 December 2003, the District Court took no further steps. The circumstance that the applicant has sent the latter document after the deadline to lodge a cassation appeal had already expired is of no consequence to the Court. It is reasonable to assume that until 20\u00a0November 2003, when the applicant lodged a cassation appeal on his own and which was the last day for that procedural step, the applicant had been waiting for a lawyer to appear and to assist him with drafting.",

The Court understands the applicant\u2019s distress when he had to prepare his cassation appeal and his defence strategy without any legal aid. The fact that the applicant refused a lawyer\u2019s presence at the hearing before the Supreme Court is of no significance. It is natural that the applicant perceived as a mere formality participation at the hearing of a lawyer who had not helped him with drafting the appeal on points of law. Taking into account that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Sakhnovskiy, cited above, \u00a7 95), the circumstances of the case required that the applicant would be provided with proper and genuine legal backing.",

Turning to the applicant\u2019s assertion that he could not have confidence in the lawyers assigned on the basis of the free legal aid scheme, the Court reiterates that the relationship between a lawyer and his client should indeed be based on mutual trust and understanding (see Sakhnovskiy, cited above, \u00a7 102). As concerns the present case, the Court notes that on appeal the applicant was offered only a ten-minute break to communicate with the newly-appointed lawyer and to explain his position, immediately before the start of the hearing (see paragraph 22 above). Given the complexity of the case and the seriousness of the charges against the applicant, it is the Court\u2019s view that the time allotted was clearly not sufficient for the applicant to discuss the case and make sure that J.S.\u2019s knowledge of the case and the applicant\u2019s position were appropriate. Even so, it must be observed that the applicant had not been content with his two previous lawyers, I.S. and Z., and was merely lukewarm towards lawyer R.\u0160. In this context the Court draws particular attention to the fact that the applicant\u2019s criticism as to the allegedly poor quality of legal assistance was based mainly on his own theories that lawyers who were not being paid by the applicant would be less diligent and would defend him less fervently than those who would receive more pay. In other words, there was no manifest failure by legal aid counsels to provide the applicant with effective representation so that intervention would be required under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) (see Kamasinski, cited above, \u00a7 65, Series A no. 168; Sejdovic, cited above, \u00a7 95).",

He also alleged that he was not able to participate effectively in the trial on 11 June 2003 as he was feeling tired after the transfer from the prison. He further complained that he had had no opportunity to question two witnesses, J.P. and A.M., and that the courts had refused to call additional witnesses and experts and to examine certain evidence.",
