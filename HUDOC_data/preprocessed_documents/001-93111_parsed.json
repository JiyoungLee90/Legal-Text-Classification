Another delay of over a year and three months resulted from the transfers of the case between the  and the prosecution authorities (see paragraphs 13-16 above). Nor can the Court overlook the fact that on 29 October 2003, that is almost three years after the trial had commenced, the  decided to change the composition of the bench, which resulted in the trial having to restart (see paragraph 18 above). In this respect, the Court reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v.  (No. 2), no. 72159/01, \u00a7 57, 4 March 2004). The Court observes that the principle responsibility for the delay caused by the change in the composition of the  rests ultimately with the State (see Sidorenko v.
