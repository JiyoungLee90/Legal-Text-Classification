The report pointed out that the newspaper Vatan had been published since 1975 and that the name had become recognisable long before the applicant company had applied for registration. In that connection, the report noted that in view of the last paragraph of Article 7 of Legislative Decree no. 556, which made reference to the recognisability of a trademark, it should be accepted that it was Ba\u011f\u0131ms\u0131z Gazetecilik that had actually made the name a recognised brand. It concluded accordingly that the Patent Institute should have refused the applicant company\u2019s request for registration pursuant to Article 7 of Legislative Decree no. 556.",

Noting that its rights to the trademark at issue were still valid, it argued that Turkish law provided for the absolute protection of a registered trademark. The applicant company also challenged the application of section 31(2) of the Turkish Patent Institute Act to its case, stating that the said regulation had entered into force after it had lodged its case.

Turkey [GC], no. 2334/03, \u00a7 40, 19 February 2009). In the present case, the applicant company brought proceedings for the prevention of the unauthorised use of its registered trademark and requested the protection of its related rights. Its claim was dismissed by the domestic court, which found that the defendant party could use the trademark. On the other hand, a counterclaim lodged by the other party was accepted and the applicant company\u2019s trademark registration was annulled. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant company could not have been expected to initiate proceedings for compensation against the domestic authorities on account of their annulment of its trademark registration, as such a case did not offer reasonable prospects of success. In that connection, it notes that that annulment had been made on the basis of the Ankara Intellectual Property Court\u2019s judgment dated 17 February 2005, which concluded that the applicant company had failed to use the trademark for five consecutive years and that accordingly, the condition for annulment of a trademark registration under Article 14 of Legislative Decree no.\u00a0556 had been met. Moreover, as noted below (see paragraph 47 below), the applicant company\u2019s complaint does not concern the annulment of its trademark but its unlawful use by a third party, for which it brought a case before the competent domestic court. The Court therefore concludes that the applicant company has complied with the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies. It consequently rejects the Government\u2019s objection in this respect.",

In that connection, they maintained that although the protection provided to a trademark was obtained by registration, there were a number of exceptions to that principle, such as Article 6 bis of the Paris Convention. They also stated that by the time Ba\u011f\u0131ms\u0131z Gazetecilik had lodged an application with the Ankara Intellectual Property Court, the applicant company had not been using the trademark for five consecutive years. Accordingly the domestic court\u2019s judgment, which had annulled the registration of the trademark in the name of the applicant company, had been in compliance with the law, specifically Article 14 of Legislative Decree no. 556. The Government maintained that the interference in question had been both in the public interest and proportionate. Lastly, in relation to the retrospective application of the Turkish Patent Institute Act, the Government stated that Article 76 of the Code of Civil Procedure as in force at that time (Law no. 1086) provided that judges should deliver their judgments ex prorio motu, in accordance with Turkish law. They argued that accordingly the civil courts and the Court of Cassation should deliver their decisions taking account of the Laws that were in force at the time of those decisions.",

It is important to note in this respect that the Ankara court came to that conclusion, not only because the applicant company had not used the trademark since April 1999, but also because the name \u201cVatan\u201d was already well-known as a newspaper before the applicant company applied in November 1998 for registration of its name \u201c\u00d6zlenen Gazete Vatan\u201d.",
