Indeed, according to the Constitutional Court, those values constituted principles of professional conduct which could not be included in \u201cpre-prepared guidelines because it [was] not possible to identify and classify every example of inappropriate conduct which might provoke a negative reaction in society\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 5).

It concluded that \u201cthe provisions in this area [could] not but be of general scope because a specific directive would have the effect of legitimising conduct which had not been foreseen, but nonetheless attracted society\u2019s opprobrium\u201d.

That said, the guidelines passed by the National Council of the Judiciary in 1990 had stated that a judge\u2019s membership of lawful associations which, like the Freemasons, were governed by specific rules of conduct could be problematical for him or her (see paragraph 18 above).

In that connection the Court notes that these guidelines had been passed in the context of an examination of the specific question of judges\u2019 membership of the Freemasons and that the National Council of the Judiciary, the body responsible for supervising the discipline and independence of judges, had the power to enact such provisions.

The rapporteur left positively no room for equivocation that the guidelines were exclusively aimed at asserting the functional incompatibility between the holding of judicial office and membership of Italian Masonic lodges. \u201cApplying the above standpoint of the , it is to be excluded that judges can be members of associations that, through the bonds of hierarchy and professed and practised ideologies, may induce citizens to believe that the exercise of judicial power can be distorted to the advantage of the association or its individual members.

The requirement of clarity obviously appears necessary to a higher degree in the context of Article 7. And yet the Court has accepted as sufficiently precise, in an Article 7 case, a criminal statute which read: \u201cAny person who is a public officer and abuses his office in any manner other than that defined in this Code ...\u201d (the criminal penalties are then listed) [See Ugur v.
