Suddenly two Niva cars (one white and one blue) drove up. Six military personnel jumped out of them. They were wearing camouflage uniforms and masks ... Some of them were not wearing masks. They looked Slavic and spoke Russian without an accent. I have seen only Federal Security Service members wear such uniforms. The people who got out of the blue Niva were wearing dark uniforms. The driver did not wear a uniform. He spoke like a local. All the men assaulted the [young man] and started beating him. Somehow, he managed to break free and started running down the road. I saw one of the servicemen shoot at him ... A bit later [the young man] stumbled and fell down. I cannot say whether he was wounded. [The other men] caught up with him and beat him again. They opened the back door of the white Niva and pushed him in. They then left ... I have no doubt that they were with the Federal Security Service.

The abductors, who arrived in civilian vehicles, acted as an organised group and did not hesitate to block traffic in the vicinity of the airport, within a few hundred metres of a traffic police station, in broad daylight, in the presence of witnesses and two traffic police officers. The abductors were in dark-green camouflage uniform and openly carried machine guns. Subsequently, in spite of the applicants\u2019 complaint that the abductors must have been State agents (see paragraphs 15, 16, 22, 27, 29, 43, 45 and 48 above), the authorities took no active steps to verify that information other than sending formal information requests. In contrast, several weeks before and after the abduction, the applicants\u2019 house was searched by the police on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities (see paragraphs 17, 27, 35, 41, 42, 44, 46 and 48 above). Furthermore, the investigators took no meaningful steps to check whether the abduction could have been perpetrated for other reasons, such as a blood feud, or for ransom, if it was related to drug trafficking, or simply owing to hostility towards Mr Ibragim Kushtov. No serious steps were taken to verify or discount such motives and no information was obtained indicating that the abductors could have been anyone other than State agents (see, by contrast, Zubayrayev v. Russia, no. 67797/01, \u00a7\u00a081, 10\u00a0January 2008). Lastly, the procrastination of the authorities in their investigation, along with the applicants\u2019 allegations that law-enforcement officers had been involved in the incident, provide the Court with grounds for concluding that the applicants have made a prima facie case that their relative Mr Ibragim Kushtov was abducted by State agents. The Government\u2019s statement that the investigators have found no evidence that members of lawenforcement authorities were involved in the disappearance is insufficient to discharge them of the above-mentioned burden of proof. Having examined the documents submitted by the parties, and drawing inferences from the Government\u2019s failure to provide another explanation for the events in question, the Court finds that Mr Ibragim Kushtov was detained on 25\u00a0January 2006 by State agents (see, in respect of a similar situation, Askhabova, cited above, \u00a7 135).",

However, the Court has already found that he was under the control of State agents after the abduction. The period of time which has elapsed since the person was detained, although not decisive in itself, is a relevant factor to be taken into account. It must be accepted that the more time that goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she is dead. The passage of time may, along with other elements of circumstantial evidence before the Court, provide grounds to conclude that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. Such an interpretation is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life as afforded by Article 2 of the Convention, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a023657/94, \u00a7 86, ECHR 1999IV, and Timurta\u015f v.

In the case at hand, as in many similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigation has been ongoing for a number of years without bringing about any significant developments as to identifying the perpetrators or discovering the fate of the applicants\u2019 missing relative. While the obligation to investigate effectively is one as to means and not results, the Court notes that the criminal proceedings have been plagued by a combination of defects similar to those enumerated in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 12325). For instance, the investigation had a significant period of inactivity which further diminished the prospects of solving the crime. No meaningful steps were taken to verify the applicants\u2019 allegations concerning Mr Ibragim Kushtov\u2019s detention on FSS premises (see paragraphs 45, 51 and 52 above) or to identify and question the traffic police officers in the silver VAZ-21099 car about the circumstances of the incident (see paragraphs 8 and 43 above). No steps were taken to identify and question the policemen who were patrolling near the airport on the date of the abduction or the drivers of local law-enforcement agencies concerning their deployment for special operations on that date.",
