The boundaries between the State's positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition. The Court has held that not all regulation of names will necessarily constitute an interference. While it is true that an obligation to change one's name would be regarded as an interference, the refusal to allow an individual to adopt a new name cannot necessarily be considered an interference (see Stjerna, cited above, pp. 60-61, \u00a7 38). The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In particular, in both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the competing interests; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see, among other authorities, Evans v. the  [GC], no. 6339/05, \u00a7\u00a075, ECHR 2007-...).",

In that case the prejudice caused by the refusal to register the forename chosen for the applicants' child, \u201cFleur de Marie\u201d, was found not to be sufficient to raise an issue of failure to respect the applicants' private and family life as the alternative name \u201cFleur-Marie\u201d was allowed. In reaching that conclusion, the Court attached weight to the fact that the French Court of Appeal and Court of Cassation had found the name \u201cFleur de Marie\u201d to be eccentric and excessively whimsical (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 10-11) and likely to harm the interests of the child.

The Court observes, as noted by the applicants, that the chosen forename \u201cAxl\u201d cannot be seen to differ vastly from names which are commonly used in , such as \u201cAlf\u201d and \u201cUlf\u201d (see\u00a0paragraph 20 above). The name was not ridiculous or whimsical, nor was it likely to prejudice the child, and it appears that it has not done so. It was also pronounceable in the Finnish language and used in some other countries. Had a vowel not been elided, it would automatically have been officially registered as a forename. The name cannot therefore be deemed unsuitable for a child. The Court attaches particular importance to the fact that the name \u201cAxl\u201d was not \u201cnew\u201d since three persons named \u201cAxl\u201d were to be found in the official Population Information System when the applicants' son was born, and, subsequently, at least two other children have been given the name. At least four of them were Finnish nationals. It is therefore apparent that the name had already gained acceptance in Finland, and it has not been contended that this has had any negative consequences for the preservation of the cultural and linguistic identity of Finland. It is true that the margin of appreciation which a State enjoys in this particular sphere is wide. However, given the above considerations, in particular the fact that the name \u201cAxl\u201d had been accepted for official registration in other situations, it is difficult for the Court to accept the national authorities' grounds for not registering the same name for the applicants' child.",

[GC], nos.\u00a039221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7\u00a0249, ECHR 2000VIII). It is not for the Court to make an additional award for non-pecuniary damage in this connection.
