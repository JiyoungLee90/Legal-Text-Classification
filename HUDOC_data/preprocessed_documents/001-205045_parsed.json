In the light of the consistent statements of M.D. throughout the proceedings and the fact that they were corroborated by the statements made by N.G., R.G. and N.\u00dc.E., the trial court found it established that the applicant had insulted M.D. and had attempted to assault him with an adze. It also took account of the statements made by Y.A. and S.A., finding that the fact that the witnesses testifying in favour of the applicant were his relatives did not mean that they would not tell the truth. As a result, it went on to hold that the offence of defamation had been committed mutually by both the applicant and M.D. and accepted that the applicant had attempted to commit the offence of attempted intentional bodily harm as a result of unjust provocation by M.D. It thus reduced the applicant\u2019s sentence.",

The Court further notes that the trial court did not inform the applicant or his lawyer of that hearing with a view to allowing them to put the questions they wished to address to the witnesses in person. The Court has already examined a similar situation in its judgment in \u00dcrek and \u00dcrek v. Turkey (no.\u00a074845/12, \u00a7\u00a066, 30 July 2019) and established that such a practice is of itself contrary to the principle of equality of arms. In the same judgment, the Court went on to hold that the right laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention would be devoid of substance if the taking of witness statements in the presence, and under the supervision, of a trial judge in the absence of the applicant and his or her lawyer could be regarded as a substitute for the applicant\u2019s right to confront that witness in person and put questions to him or her directly (see Dimovi\u0107 and Others v. Serbia, no. 7203/12, \u00a7\u00a061, 11\u00a0December 2018, where the examination of witnesses by the investigating judge was not of itself considered to be a sufficient counterbalancing factor by the Court in its examination under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention). Nonetheless, it went on to hold that it could not be ruled out that in certain, albeit exceptional, cases such a possibility might be regarded as a relevant procedural safeguard under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention.",

Secondly, mention should also be made of the relatively minor character of the offence of which the applicant was convicted and the trivial nature of the dispute relating to the factual circumstances giving rise to the criminal proceedings against him. Another noteworthy aspect is the trial court\u2019s awareness of the handicap caused to the defence by the applicant\u2019s inability to put questions to the witnesses in person; it not only acknowledged that fact, but also appears to have clarified the points on the basis of which the applicant wished to put questions to the witnesses heard in his absence. More importantly, the trial court accepted that both the applicant and the victim had insulted each other, thereby recognising and accepting the factual circumstances as put forward by the applicant by putting questions to the witnesses in person. On that basis, the trial court also reduced the applicant\u2019s sentence for the offence of defamation and further found it established that he had attempted to commit the offence of causing bodily harm as a result of the victim\u2019s unjust provocation, which resulted in the reduction of his sentence for that offence too. Given that the trial court accepted and reduced the applicant\u2019s sentence on the basis that both he and M.D. had made insulted each other, it appears that it put in place sufficient counterbalancing factors to compensate for the applicant\u2019s inability to put questions to the witnesses in person. It is significant that before the Court the applicant did not contend that the trial court had left unanswered any other aspects duly raised by him during his trial in connection with his inability to put questions to the witnesses.",
