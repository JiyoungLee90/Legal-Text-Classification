However, in the Court's opinion, the domestic authorities failed to take adequate steps in order to ensure their attendance. It observes that the defendants on numerous occasions failed to appear at hearings. It is true that the court subjected them to police supervision and, subsequently, ordered that A.P. be detained on remand (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). Nevertheless, those measures were afterwards lifted within a relatively short time (paragraphs\u00a015 and 19) and the defendants continued to obstruct the proceedings. Moreover, the court decided to sever the charges against M.W. only on 6\u00a0March 1998 when the proceedings had already been pending for 6 years. The Court notes further that the hearings were frequently adjourned due to the absence of the witnesses. However, the trial court reacted to that behaviour only on two occasions when it decided to impose fines on them (see paragraphs 12 and\u00a026 above). Accordingly, the Court considers that, the courts did not avail themselves of the measures available to it under national law to discipline the participants to the proceedings and to ensure that the case be heard within a reasonable time. It finds that the overall length of the proceedings is not explained satisfactorily in the Government's observations.",
