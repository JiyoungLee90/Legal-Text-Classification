The Court finds that this was the first occasion on which the applicant was personally present before a person clearly acting in a judicial capacity since his detention had been ordered by an investigator on 24 September 1998 (see paragraphs 8 and 15 above). Thus, it considers that on that date the lack of access to a judicial officer who could consider the merits of the detention (see Aquilina v.  [GC], no. 25642/94, \u00a7\u00a7 47-50, ECHR 1999III), a situation which had existed since 24\u00a0September 1998, ended for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Accordingly, the time-limit for submitting the related complaint to the Court expired six months after 4\u00a0May 1999 (see G.K. v. Poland (dec.), no. 38816/97, 8 December 1998; Bagi\u0144ski v. Poland (dec.), no. 37444/97, 21 January 2003; Oratowski v.\u00a0Poland, (dec.), no. 40698/98, 6\u00a0February 2003; Al Akidi v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 35825/97, 19 September 2000; and Hristov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no.\u00a035436/97, 19 September 2000). The applicant introduced his first letter to the Court on 24 April 2000.",
