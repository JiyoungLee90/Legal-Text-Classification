However, while the latter three doctors considered that the degree of force required to cause these fractures fell outwith the normal handling of a small baby although not within the category of abusive handling, Dr B. took the view that it might not be completely outside the normal range of handling (for example, catching a child who was slipping).

Given all the concerns, it was difficult to conceive of a risk assessment report that would have resulted at that time in an immediate and unsupervised return to parental care. The Government submitted that by the end of the family's stay at the Centre, the local authority was not in a position to conclude that the second applicant would not be in danger were he to be returned home and, consequently, they could not responsibly have consented to his being returned to his parent's care.

There were also concerns that such a placement would not have been in his best interests, as the relatives to whom the local authority had spoken did not accept that he was at risk from his parents and his growth and feeding problems necessitated proper feeding management by appropriate carers.

Nevertheless, the authorities opted for care proceedings, sending the family without proper notice to a Centre far from their home where they had to live for three months in substandard and distressing conditions in an area plagued by drug and gang activity. This failure of notice or prior discussion excluded the family from the decision-making process and no convincing explanation was given for the haste. Moreover, the stay at the Centre proved to be a profoundly disturbing move for all concerned. The first applicant's partner had to give up his employment to participate in the assessment and conditions in the Centre were poor. If the first applicant did not make negative statements about the conditions at the time, it was so as not to influence negatively the report which the Centre was producing.

In the present case, the Court observes that O.D. was not diagnosed with any medical condition at birth. In January 1997, when O.D. was five months old, he was examined by a Dr S., a paediatrician. The first applicant raised the possibility of Osteogenesis Imperfecta. As a consequence, Dr S. looked at O.D.'s bones but considered that they were normal. On 30 April 1997 Dr C., a professor of paediatric radiology, also examined O.D. but noted that his bone texture was normal and there was nothing to indicate Osteogenesis Imperfecta. While at the Centre in Bristol O.D. was seen by a consultant clinical geneticist, who reported that Osteogenesis Imperfecta or some other collagen abnormality was no more than one possible explanation for O.D.'s medical history. He also commented that it would be rare to have O.D.'s degree of growth retardation in the absence of multiple long fractures. He noted that further tests could be conducted, such as a skin biopsy, but that the diagnostic value of the test had a detection rate of only 87%. On the family's return from , Dr L., a radiologist and acknowledged expert in bone disease instructed by O.D.'s parents, reported that there was no evidence of abnormal bone morphology or density to suggest bone fragility and, as a consequence, non-accidental injury was the likely cause of the fractures. He was sceptical about taking a skin biopsy as the test was equivocal. At the hearing in August 1997 Dr R., a consultant paediatrician, and Dr. G., an orthopaedic surgeon, both indicated that in their opinions it was unlikely that O.D. had Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Finally, as late at 31\u00a0October 1997, Dr Si., a consultant paediatrician instructed by the guardian ad litem, noted that the lack of further injury in spite of O.D.'s increased mobility was further evidence against Osteogenesis Imperfecta.",

Clearly, a considerable number of medical experts were consulted by the parties in the course of the investigation into O.D.'s injuries, and in their opinion there was no evidence to suggest Osteogenesis Imperfecta or to indicate that further investigations were desirable. In view of this evidence, the Court does not consider that the social or medical authorities can be faulted for not reaching an earlier diagnosis of Osteogenesis Imperfecta or, in the absence of a diagnosis, acting on the basis that the injury could have been caused by O.D.'s parents. Moreover, in view of the medical evidence, the Court does not consider that the social or medical authorities can be faulted for not conducting further investigations, such as the skin biopsy referred to in the report of the clinical geneticist. In any case, even if a skin biopsy had been conducted, there was a good chance that the results would have been inconclusive as one expert indicated that the test was only 87% accurate and even the first applicant's expert was sceptical about its benefits.",

The Court would note, however, that it has not been explained to its satisfaction why it was necessary to relocate the family far from their home for the purposes of the risk assessment with all the disruption that entailed. That being said, it will focus on what it perceives to be a number of fundamental errors made by the local authority in conducting those investigations and assessments, including at the Family Assessment Centre.\u00a0First, the local authority clearly was to blame for the wrong assessment being conducted at the Family Assessment Centre. The Court observes that the applicants remained at the Centre for twelve weeks, at considerable inconvenience to themselves, and during this time they co-operated fully with the assessment. Following their stay at the Centre, however, the local authority concluded that O.D. could not safely be placed with his parents until they had undergone a psychological assessment and a proper risk assessment had taken place. Consequently, O.D. was removed from his parents' care and spent the next four months with foster carers. It is therefore clear, and the Government have accepted, that the failure to conduct a risk assessment during the twelve-week stay in the Centre was a relevant factor in the decision to place O.D. in foster care in August 1997. It is significant that the Risk Assessment report, when finally produced, recommended the speedy return of O.D. to his parents. While the final report was not made public until 20 November 1997, the NSPCC had informed the local authority as early as 27 October 1997 that O.D. should be returned without delay to his parents. While it is impossible to say with certainty, the Court finds that there is a very real chance that had the proper assessment been conducted while the applicants were at the Centre, O.D. may never have been placed in foster care.",

The Court appreciates that the local authority had to make a difficult decision under considerable time pressures. It recalls, however, that the local authority was required by law to give proper consideration to placing O.D. within the family, and could only exclude this option if it was not reasonably practicable or in the interests of O.D.'s welfare. While it is clear that the local authority had some understandable concerns about a family placement, the Court finds that it dismissed this option too quickly without giving it proper consideration.",

They saw no reason why the courts should not have recognised a duty of care as existing before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force and submitted that their approach violated the applicants' Convention rights. They also pointed out that, even following the Human Rights Act, its provisions could not help parents who had to rely on the law of negligence as opposed to section 7 to vindicate their Convention rights. As regards the second applicant, it was not necessary to show damage in order to be a victim; therefore, in order for Article 8 to have been violated, it was not necessary to show the very specific kind of clinically diagnosed psychiatric damage required in English law. He had been entitled to a determination that the local authority had breached his right to respect for family life and also the possibility of obtaining an enforceable award for compensation, yet because he could not demonstrate a recognised psychiatric disorder, he was unable even to obtain a determination that his rights had been violated.

The Court considers that the right to bring a claim in negligence, and to appeal against an unfavourable decision, would normally constitute an effective domestic remedy, even if it does not always produce the outcome that the applicant hopes for. In the present case the second applicant's claim was not successful because there was no evidence to suggest that he suffered from a recognised psychiatric disorder which had been caused by the period of separation from his parents and he could not, therefore, show that he had suffered justiciable damage. By definition, the domestic courts are not in a position to assess non-justiciable damage and the Court considers that it is reasonable for claims to be rejected on that ground.",
