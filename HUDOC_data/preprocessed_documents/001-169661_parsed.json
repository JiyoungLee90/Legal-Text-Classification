The District Court further held that the inaction of the bailiffs service had led to an unjustifiably long delay in the enforcement of the judgment, which violated the applicant\u2019s right to judicial protection, including her right to have the judgment enforced. It therefore found the bailiffs service\u2019s inaction unlawful and ordered it to remedy the above violations.",

They included subjecting a respondent to an administrative fine or imposing criminal responsibility on them, enabling a plaintiff to challenge the lawfulness of bailiffs\u2019 decisions before a court, the putting into practice of an algorithm developed by the Federal Bailiffs Service for organising and carrying out searches for a respondent and his property, a child or a respondent in a civil case, and the exchange of information in digital format between the Federal Bailiffs Service and the Ministry of Internal Affairs.",

However, nothing had been done after that to have the judgment of 27 December 2012 enforced. The applicant noted, in particular, that on 25 March 2014 the bailiffs service of Grozny had found that the Moscow bailiffs service had failed to take all the measures provided by the law on enforcement proceedings necessary for the enforcement of the judgment, including, inter alia, the involvement of the local police in carrying out the enforcement measures, questioning A.A.\u2019s partner O.S. and instituting a search for A.A. and the child. Furthermore, on 11 March 2015 the District Court had granted the applicant\u2019s claim and found the inaction of the bailiffs service of Grozny to be unlawful. Moreover, the bailiffs had lost the enforcement file and had had to apply to the District Court for a duplicate of the writ of execution. The domestic authorities had become more active only in August 2015 after the application had been communicated to the Russian Government. For almost two years therefore no measures had been taken by the authorities to enforce the judgment of 27 December 2012, and the measures that had been taken since then had shown that the domestic authorities had to some extent handled their responsibility to enforce the judgment in a purely formal way. The applicant noted that the Government had failed to show that the mechanisms aimed at the enforcement of judgments, on which they had relied in their submissions, had been used in the present case.",

The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and cooperation of all concerned are always important ingredients. Whilst the national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such cooperation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited, since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, as should be, more particularly, the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see Strumia v.
