Since the Handyside v. the United Kingdom case (judgment of 17 December 1976, Series A no. 24, \u00a7 48), the Court has repeatedly said that the Convention the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights.

It has thus succeeded in promoting concepts which go beyond the interests, and even rights, of the individual by adopting a realistic and pragmatic approach that seeks to provide solutions that are balanced or will be beneficial in the long term (see, mutatis mutandis, Wittek\u00a0v. Germany, no. 37290/97, \u00a7 61, 12 December 2002; Prince Hans-Adam of Liechtenstein v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 42527/98, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2001-VIII; and Gorzelik and Others v. Poland, no. 44158/98, \u00a7\u00a069, 20 December 2001). In these judgments, the Court adopted a pragmatic approach against the complex historical political background that required a precise evaluation of the competing interests and even of the individual rights and freedoms. The Court correctly perceived the individual interest as being relative and having to yield to interests that affected the community as a whole and were of vital importance to the group, nation or State.",
