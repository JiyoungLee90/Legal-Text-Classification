The expert opinion was issued on 2 February 2007 and consisted of 34 pages. According to the expert opinion, the experts examined in detail the applicant's medical records and concluded that the applicant suffered from neurocirculatory dystonia accompanied by high arterial pressure, a condition which was primarily caused by the emotional stress experienced by him as a result of the drastic change in his lifestyle brought about by his arrest. This diagnosis was confirmed by the fact that arterial pressure was quickly normalised after taking necessary medications and that no serious disorders had been revealed by various tests (ECG, echo tests, blood tests and biochemical tests). The analysis of medical records showed that the applicant's complaints of feeling unwell were often of a \u201csubjective character\u201d and were not confirmed by laboratory tests and examinations carried out in response to his complaints. Since the applicant's condition had not seriously deteriorated during the previous three years and since he could usually be quickly relieved of feelings of discomfort by taking calmative and vasodilator medications, the applicant's condition could be characterised as belonging to a group of widespread ordinary \u201cfunctional\u201d conditions caused by emotional stress. The experts further dismissed the opinion of Dr Thomas, noting that it was based on misrepresented facts and contained recommendations inconsistent with his own analysis. In conclusion, the experts noted that the applicant's general condition was satisfactory, that he did not suffer from any serious diseases, and that his medical supervision and treatment had been carried out by well-qualified doctors and had been adequate.",

Further, he noted that the applicant had been documented as \u201chaving very mild coronary artery disease affecting only one vessel for which no intervention was required\u201d and that, as a result, the applicant had been \u201cquite correctly placed on anti-hypertensives, Aspirin and a Statin\u201d.

Approximately 4.5\u00a0sq. m of the total floor area was occupied by the furniture. The window was 0.7\u00a0m high and 1.1\u00a0m wide.

None of these subsequent examinations revealed any serious heart condition.

It appears that the documents in Dr Dymond's possession were translations of the same documents that were submitted by the parties to the Court and were summarised in paragraphs 49-74 above. However, it does not appear that Dr Dymond was aware of the medical practices and terminology used by Azerbaijani doctors, which may have affected the comprehensiveness of his opinion. In particular, the Court notes that Dr\u00a0Dymond criticised the Azerbaijani doctors for the use of terminology which, according to him, was not \u201cfamiliar to contemporary cardiologists\u201d and which, therefore, limited his understanding of the applicant's medical records. Specifically, he criticised the use of the terms \u201cstenocardia\u201d (otherwise known as angina pectoris, denoting a symptom of chest pain) and \u201cneurocirculatory dystonia\u201d (explained above). The Court notes, however, that both of these terms are widely used and understood by medical practitioners across the entire area of the former Soviet\u00a0Union\u00a0(see,\u00a0for example, Kalashnikov, cited above, \u00a7 30; Nevmerzhitsky\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a054825/00, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2005II; Hummatov\u00a0v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, \u00a7 41, 29\u00a0November\u00a02007; and Katcheishvili v.  (dec.), no. 55793/09, 24\u00a0November 2009). The Court also notes that medical terminology used by practitioners in different countries is not uniform and accepts that a qualified physician in one country may not necessarily be familiar with certain terminology used in foreign countries. The mere fact that Dr\u00a0Dymond was unfamiliar with most of the medical terms in the applicant's medical file could not justify a conclusion that the doctors who had examined the applicant were underqualified or that he was deprived of \u201cmodern cardiological care\u201d.",

Moreover, the Court reiterates that Article 3 does not require the medical assistance available in custody or in prison hospitals to be at a level which is better than that of the best medical institutions for the general public; it does not even necessarily require such medical assistance to be always at the same level as the general level nationwide (see, mutatis mutandis, Testa v. Croatia, no. 20877/04, \u00a7 46, 12 July 2007). In the present case, it appears that the applicant has been examined by some of the best specialists available in the country.",

Moreover, it does not appear that, apart from the attacks described in the present application, the applicant experienced any subsequent emergencies or was otherwise exposed to severe or prolonged pain owing to a lack of adequate medical assistance.

For example, the Court notes that, on some occasions, medications were given to him by unqualified warders, that there were certain delays in responding to some of his health-related complaints, and that a full copy of his medical file was provided to him only belatedly. On the other hand, the Court cannot lose sight of the applicant's own uncooperative behaviour towards medical personnel, seeing that on several occasions he refused to take medications prescribed to him. Having regard to the relevant circumstances as a whole, the Court considers that, despite certain shortcomings, the applicant received an acceptable level of attention from a number of qualified experts, was prescribed the necessary medications, was hospitalised for a period of two months, and was examined at reasonably regular intervals when not hospitalised.",

Turkey, 22 October 1997, \u00a7 51, Reports\u00a0of Judgments and Decisions 1997VI). Neither is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or taken before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or discontinuing suspicions which provide the grounds for detention. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 300A). However, the requirement that the suspicion must be based on reasonable grounds forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention. The fact that a suspicion is held in good faith is insufficient. The words \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d mean the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 182).",

Although the applicant argued that these statements were false and improbable, the Court considers that, within the meaning of the previously cited case-law, such evidence objectively linked the applicant to the alleged criminal offence and was sufficient to have created a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d against him.

In view of the fact that in October 2005 the applicant had already complained, in a timely manner but unsuccessfully, about this matter before the domestic courts (see paragraph 24 above), the Government failed to explain the aim pursued by the prosecuting authorities in questioning the applicant's assistant about this matter such a considerable time after the applicant's arrest, when this matter was no longer reviewable under the domestic procedure. In such circumstances, as it appears that the record of this questioning cannot be placed in any context relevant to the stage reached in the domestic criminal proceedings by February 2007, the Court doubts that it was procured for bona fide purposes and does not find this evidence to be convincing.",

In such circumstances, the Court finds it suspicious that, instead of the above statement of 13 February 2007, the Government failed to submit any official records contemporaneous to the time of the applicant's arrest, such as copies of the relevant extracts of the original record book of the MNS checkpoint containing the original entry relating to the time of the applicant's entrance into the MNS building.

In this connection, the Court reiterates that, in order to determine whether there has been a deprivation of liberty, the starting-point must be the specific situation of the individual concerned and account must be taken of a whole range of factors arising in a particular case such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, \u00a7 92, Series A no. 39). The Court must look behind appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of (see Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium, 24\u00a0June\u00a01982,\u00a0\u00a7 38, Series A no. 50). The right to liberty is too important for a person to lose the benefit of the protection of Article 5 even if he or she gave himself or herself up to be taken into detention (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp\u00a0v.\u00a0Belgium, 18 June 1971, \u00a7 65, Series A no. 12). In the present case, the Court notes that, although the applicant was not handcuffed, placed in a locked cell or otherwise physically restrained within several hours after entering the MNS premises, he had been accompanied there by two senior MNS officers and, once inside, was no longer free to leave. Moreover, a letter informing the applicant's family about his arrest had been sent out several hours before the formal record of his arrest was drawn up. He was not questioned for several hours after he had been brought to the MNS building and, therefore, it could not be argued that his presence during this period was required by the obligation to appear for questioning as a witness (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Iliya Stefanov\u00a0v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 65755/01, \u00a7\u00a7 71-75, 22 May 2008). The Court also observes that, although the Government disputed the time of the applicant's de facto arrest, they appeared to accept, and in any event did not expressly dispute, that the applicant had in fact been \u201cdeprived of his liberty\u201d from the moment he had entered the MNS building. Accordingly, the Court considers that, from around 2 p.m. on 19 October 2005, the domestic authorities apparently considered the applicant to have been arrested and that he was \u201cdeprived of his liberty\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1.",

It appears that when he was asked to go to the MNS building by two MNS officers, he was not clearly apprised of the authorities' intention to arrest him on suspicion of committing a criminal offence. In this connection, referring to the general principles stated above (see paragraphs 145-47 above), the Court further reiterates that national authorities which are competent to deprive a person of his or her liberty are normally expected to act in good faith in their dealings with the latter. Thus, the intention to deprive or otherwise affect an individual's physical liberty should not, in the normal course of events, be consciously hidden by the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis \u010conka v. , no.\u00a051564/99, \u00a7 41-42, ECHR 2002I, and Bozano, cited above, \u00a7 55), and the individual should be able to resort, if need be, to the available and legitimate remedies aimed at opposing the authorities' actions and preserving his or her liberty (see Giorgi Nikolaishvili v. Georgia, no.\u00a037048/04, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2009..., with further references). Even accepting that a short period may elapse between a person's de facto arrest and the formalising of that person's status as an arrested person (compare, mutatis mutandis, I.I. v. , no. 44082/98, \u00a7 90, 9 June 2005), and that there was a reasonable suspicion against the applicant in the present case, the Court cannot overlook the fact that for several hours the applicant was de\u00a0facto deprived of his liberty in the absence of a formal decision confirming his status as an arrested person, apparently without a lawyer's assistance, the possibility of immediately informing his family, or any sense of certainty as to his personal liberty and security. No explanation has been forthcoming from the Government or the domestic authorities as to whether the delay in formalising the applicant's arrest and ensuring his rights as an arrested person was in any way compatible with \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d (see, in this connection, the requirements of Articles 90, 91 and 153.2 of the CCrP). Having regard to these considerations, the Court finds that the circumstances of the applicant's arrest and the first few hours of his detention were not devoid of arbitrariness.",

Article 148.4 of the CCrP stated that, within forty-eight hours after his or her arrest, a person so detained must be brought before a judge who should either remand the person in custody or release him or her. Furthermore, Article 153.3.4 of the CCrP unequivocally required the arrested person's release, if no court order remanding him or her in custody was issued within forty-eight hours after the arrest. Accordingly, beyond the initial forty-eight-hour period, an arrested person could be detained only on the basis of a judicial order remanding him or her in custody. It does not appear that this period could be extended under any circumstances, or that it was simply a non-mandatory indicative deadline, and the Government did not submit any arguments or evidence to that end (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Kaiser v. , no. 17073/04, \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 33, 15\u00a0March 2007).",

Thus, in the event of the expiry of the last detention order issued at the investigation stage and following the referral of the case file to the trial court, the period of detention without a court order appears to be limited in principle to a maximum of thirty days. Therefore, at least in theory, it cannot be said that detention without judicial authorisation could potentially last for an unlimited or unpredictable time (compare, for example, Baranowski and J\u0117\u010dius, both cited above, where there were no such time-limits).",

In the present case, the Government appeared to rely on Article 158.4 of the CCrP to justify the applicant's continued detention after 19 April 2007 by the fact that he had been given access to the case file during the period in question. The Court cannot accept this argument. Firstly, it appears that, pursuant to Articles 284-289 and 292 of the CCrP, defendants were given access to the case file following the termination of the pre-trial investigation, but prior to the issuance of the bill of indictment and the referral of the case to the trial court (see paragraphs 93-94 above). The Government did not explain how, in such circumstances, the applicant's detention following the sending of the case for trial could be justified by Article 158.4 of the CCrP. Secondly,\u00a0in any event, having analysed this provision, the Court does not see how it could be interpreted as providing for the applicant's detention without a court order. Lastly, even assuming that this provision permitted the applicant's continued detention, it did so by reference to matters wholly extraneous to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see J\u0117\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7 59, and Gigolashvili, cited above, \u00a7 33).

The Court notes that, in the present case, under the domestic rules of criminal procedure only the courts had the power to order or prolong detention on remand. No exception to that general rule was permitted or provided for, no matter how short the duration of the detention. However, the domestic law apparently lacked clear rules governing the situation of a detainee following the referral of the case file to the trial court, and more specifically during the period before the trial court's preliminary hearing, but after the expiry of the last detention order issued at the investigation stage. As demonstrated in the present case, this statutory lacuna resulted in situations where defendants were detained without judicial authorisation.",

In this connection, the Court notes that, while the severity of the sentence faced is one of the relevant elements in the assessment of the risk of absconding, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81). Moreover, the risk of absconding, which may justify detention, cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the sentence faced. It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Panchenko v. , no. 45100/98, \u00a7 106, 8\u00a0February\u00a02005, and Letellier, cited above, \u00a7 43). In the present case, however, the judicial decisions did not go any further than listing the above-mentioned grounds, including the risk of absconding, using a stereotyped formula paraphrasing the terms of the CCrP (compare Giorgi Nikolaishvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 23-24, 28, 76 and 79). They failed to mention any case-specific facts relevant to those grounds and to substantiate them with relevant and sufficient reasons. The Court also notes that the courts extending the applicant's detention repeatedly used the same stereotyped formula and their reasoning did not evolve with the passing of time to reflect the developing situation and to verify whether these grounds remained valid at the later stages of the proceedings.",

This means that the competent court has to examine not only compliance with the procedural requirements of domestic law but also the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the arrest, and the legitimacy of the purpose pursued by the arrest and the ensuing detention (see Brogan and Others, cited above, \u00a7 65). Although it is not always necessary for the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 to be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question. The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties. In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), a hearing is required (see Assenov and Others\u00a0v.\u00a0Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 162, Reports 1998VIII). The possibility for a detainee to be heard either in person or through some form of representation features among the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty (see Kampanis v. Greece, 13\u00a0July 1995, \u00a7 47, Series A no. 318B). Moreover, equality of arms is not ensured where a detainee or his or her counsel is denied access to those documents in the investigation file which are essential in order to challenge effectively the lawfulness of the detention (see Lamy v. Belgium, 30\u00a0March\u00a01989, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 151).",

The presumption of innocence enshrined in paragraph 2 of Article 6 is one of the elements of the fair criminal trial that is required by paragraph\u00a01 (see\u00a0Allenet\u00a0de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, \u00a7 35, Series\u00a0A\u00a0no.\u00a0308).

Switzerland, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 62), but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see\u00a0Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041, and Daktaras v. Lithuania, no.\u00a042095/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-43, ECHR 2000-X). The Court stresses that Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 cannot prevent the authorities from informing the public about criminal investigations in progress, but it requires that they do so with all the discretion and circumspection necessary if the presumption of innocence is to be respected (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038).",

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Khuzhin and Others v. , no. 13470/02, \u00a7 94, 23\u00a0October\u00a02008, with further references). Whether a statement by a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Butkevi\u010dius v.

It was particularly important at this initial stage, even before the applicant had been formally charged, not to make any public allegations which could have been interpreted as confirming the guilt of the applicant in the opinion of a State law-enforcement authority.",

While this evidence could have formed the basis for a reasonable suspicion against the applicant, at that stage various factual allegations made by Mr Yusifov were uncorroborated by any other evidence and were far from being established as true. In such circumstances, the Court finds unclear and questionable the actual reasons that made it necessary to disclose this (still unconfirmed) testimony to the public in such great detail and at such an early stage in the course of the investigation. In the Court's opinion, at the relevant time, a brief description of this evidence would have sufficed for the declared purpose of merely informing the public about the nature of the accusations against the applicant. Having examined the text of the impugned statement of 20 October 2006, the Court considers that, although at the beginning it clearly attributed the allegations to Mr\u00a0Yusifov, the wording used subsequently to convey the content of his testimony was set out as though describing facts that had actually taken place. It should be kept in mind that the impugned statements were intended for the general public, consisting largely of lay people who could find it difficult to differentiate between descriptions of established facts and mere allegations simply from the context of the impugned statements. As the detailed narrative of this information continued through several paragraphs, it lacked sufficient qualification or reservation to sustain the notion that these were merely allegations by a single witness which were yet to be confirmed by the investigation, and not established facts.",

Even leaving aside the question whether, on 20 October 2005, the prosecuting authority had any concrete evidence to back up these specific remarks, the Court considers that the remarks were in complete disregard of the applicant's presumption of innocence, as they constituted an unequivocal declaration that he had committed criminal acts and were made without the necessary discretion and circumspection.",

This state of affairs was described by his lawyer as a breach of the applicant's procedural rights as an arrested person (this issue was discussed in paragraph 165 above in the context of the complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention), but not as a breach of his right to respect for his private and family life.
