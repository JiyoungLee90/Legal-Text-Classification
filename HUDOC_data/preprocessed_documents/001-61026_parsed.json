In these circumstances, \u201crespect\u201d for the applicant\u2019s \u201cprivate and family life\u201d required the State to enable him to return by taking measures to reunite the family in France.

By a letter of 17 November 1997, the applicant\u2019s lawyer was advised that the consulate in Algiers would be instructed to issue a visa to the applicant on request. The applicant had paid several visits to the French consulate in Algiers at the end of 1997. In spite of several letters and telephone calls from the applicant\u2019s lawyer, it was only on 4 February 1998 that the Algerian Visa Section informed him that a special visa had to be issued in view of the applicant\u2019s particular circumstances. The visa required the Minister of the Interior\u2019s consent, which was sought only on 10\u00a0February 1998, once a copy of the applicant\u2019s passport had been sent. Assuming that receipt of a copy of the passport was a precondition for the issue of a visa, it would appear that the lawyer had been so advised only belatedly. The minister\u2019s consent was obtained on 20 February 1998, no doubt because early consultations about the applicant\u2019s situation had been held with the Ministry of the Interior at the end of October or the beginning of November 1997. Although the Court well appreciates that it takes some time to process and issue a valid residence permit, there were undoubtedly some delays attributable to the administrative services concerned during the period of three and a half months between 11 October 1997 and 4 February 1998.",

The Court also notes that the applicant and his counsel took a whole series of steps, both in Algeria and in France, to make the situation progress as rapidly as possible. Nonetheless, delays lasting for at most three and a half months cannot be considered so excessive as to interfere with the applicant\u2019s right to a private and family life, even in the particular circumstances of the case where considerations such as administrative difficulties (see paragraph 42 above) \u201ccannot be allowed to play a more than a secondary role\u201d (see Olsson (no. 1), cited above, p. 37, \u00a7 82).",

France (dec.), no.\u00a042216/98, 14 November 2000).
