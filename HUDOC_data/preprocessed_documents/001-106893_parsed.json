The question whether that provision (in combination with Article 7 of the Civil Code) is in fact applicable to situations under Article 78 of the Civil Code is a matter of debate in legal writings (answered in the affirmative by Riemer, RDS 97/1978 I p. 95 n. 81 and Commentaire bernois, n. 40 on Articles 76-79 Civil Code; and in the negative by Heini/Scherrer, Commentaire b\u00e2lois, 3rd edition, n.\u00a03 on Article 78 of the Civil Code; Heini/Portmann, SPR II/5, 3rd edition, n. 169; Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Perrin, Droit de l\u2019association, Zurich 2004, p. 208). The Federal Court has settled the matter in the affirmative, at least for other legal entities (Federal Court Judgment 73 II 81 concerning a foundation and Federal Court Judgment 80 II 123 concerning a cooperative entity). The question can, however, remain undecided in the present case. The Cantonal Court examined this question and arrived at the conclusion that the applicant association\u2019s unlawful aim was predominant in comparison with its other constitutional aims, because the association had been set up above all with that aim in mind. The applicant association has not disputed this, but has merely asserted that its other aims are \u2018essential\u2019. Moreover, it does not claim that the conditions of Article 20 paragraph 2 of the Code of Obligations are met, in particular that the association would nevertheless have been constituted without the constitutional clause that is null and void; it has simply claimed that it \u2018could continue to operate\u2019 even in the absence of the constitutional aim that has been declared unlawful, but that is not decisive for the purposes of Article 20, paragraph\u00a02, of the Code of Obligations.",

Those two situations are not covered by the guarantee of the right to freedom of assembly and association (Article\u00a011, paragraph 1, ECHR), but fall within the admissible restrictions to that right (Article 11, paragraph 2, ECHR; see the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights of 13\u00a0February 2003 in the case of Refah Partisi (The Welfare Party) and Others against Turkey, concerning the dissolution of a political party and the right to freedom of assembly and association). The fact that in the case of the dissolution of a political party it was necessary, as the applicant alleged, to adopt particular restraint or lay down strict demands is correct (see judgment of 13 February 2003, cited above; Jens Meyer-Ladewig, EMRK, Baden-Baden 2003, n. 22 on Article\u00a011 ECHR with references concerning the relationship with freedom of expression under Article 10 ECHR), but it is not decisive in the present case as the applicant association, in spite of a certain political component in its aim and the implementation thereof, is not a political party and, moreover, there is not a sufficiently close connection with freedom of expression\u201d.",

The fact of whether or not the association existed would have had no effect on that procedure.

For pluralism is also built on the genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs, artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively.",

Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, ECHR 2004I). That case-law thus clearly leads to the conclusion that an association having an unlawful constitutional aim may be dissolved only in exceptional circumstances, when three concurrent conditions are met: (1) the declared aim in question must run counter to national security, public safety, public order, criminal law, public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others; (2) the dissolution must be strictly necessary, in a democratic society, to ensure that the values in question are respected; and (3) the members of the association would not have created it were it not for the said aim. In order for the dissolution of an association to be justified, the unlawful constitutional aim must therefore be connatural to the association and constitute the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the coming-together of its members, without which it would never have been formed.",

The members of the association took possession of those buildings unlawfully, by force and against the will of the lawful owners, who filed criminal complaints and sought intervention by the authorities following the occupation of their properties, then after their initial failure used the traditional legal avenue of claims for possession to put a stop to the occupation. At no time, during the period of almost twenty years in which the buildings were occupied, could the applicants avail themselves of a statutory or contractual basis to justify their occupation, since they failed to adduce evidence of a tacit lease agreement between the association and the owners (see the judgment of the Lease and Rent Tribunal of 3 September 2007) and the \u201ctolerance\u201d by the public authorities was not legally pertinent for the provision of a statutory basis on which to justify the occupation.",
