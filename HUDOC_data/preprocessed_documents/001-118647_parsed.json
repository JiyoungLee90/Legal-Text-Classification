The court noted that an \u2018element\u2019 had occurred in the investigation pointing to the risk that the applicant might abscond by leaving the country; however, this circumstance was not specified. The court also held that because the applicant\u2019s immunity had been removed only a short time before, several further steps of investigation were still outstanding and that therefore the risk of collusion or interference was real.",

Indeed, his condition had only improved in the prison hospital, in a different environment, and once he had been returned to the penitentiary institution his ailment had started to deteriorate rapidly. His extreme loss of weight had not been as intended and had certainly not been the result of the use of the stimulation belt. His counsel had repeatedly warned the prison authorities about the potential danger of such a drastic weight loss, but his detention conditions, including his nutrition, had not improved.

Upon the doctor\u2019s recommendation he had been permanently placed in a larger cell, and a prolongation of his open-air stays had been permitted when the medical expert had stated that it would improve his condition.

In this context and to the extent that such conditions may be regarded as an interference with Article 8 rights they may be considered justified in terms of the second paragraph of that Article (see A.B. v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a037328/97, \u00a7\u00a7 92 and 93, 29\u00a0January 2002).",

Moreover, regular phone calls and correspondence remained at their disposal, and extra phone calls were authorised on a case-by-case basis. While accepting that in principle the ailments of those relatives with whom a detainee desires to keep contact may warrant special considerations, the Court finds that in the particular case neither the child\u2019s age nor her illness made it vital to afford the applicant extended possibilities for phone calls. Therefore, denying the applicant extra phone calls on a general basis cannot be considered as a disproportionate measure in the circumstances.",

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law. In particular, its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (cf. Ilhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, ECHR 2000\u2013VII, \u00a7 97).",
