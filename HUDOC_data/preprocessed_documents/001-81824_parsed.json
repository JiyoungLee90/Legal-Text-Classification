The court can either render a decision on the merits or remit the case to the authority for reconsideration. A court usually sends a case back to an administrative authority for instance when the issuing of the decision calls for the acquisition of new evidence or involves the exercise of discretion within the competence of the authority. If an administrative court has ruled on the substance of the appeal and remitted the case to the authority, the authority is obliged to follow the ruling of the court. The decision-making may involve the exercise of discretion by the administrative authority as prescribed by law, and the authority may also take into account changes in circumstances which have taken place after the administrative court\u2019s decision and which have an effect on the case. The discretionary power of the administrative authority is not only restricted by legislation and the court\u2019s ruling but also by common principles of administrative law, especially the principles of equality, objective consideration, proportionality and expediency. These principles were originally established by case-law. Now they are contained in the Administrative Procedure Act (hallintolaki, f\u00f6rvaltningslagen; Act no. 434/2003), which entered into force on 1\u00a0January\u00a02004.",

It could also take into account changes in the circumstances which had occurred after the court\u2019s decision. In addition, the authority had a reasonable time to choose the most suitable means to give effect to the decision concerned (see Hornsby v. Greece, cited above, p.\u00a0511-512, \u00a7\u00a043). After this case had been returned to the Health Board for the first time, it had rendered the following decisions: On 9 September 1993 it ordered the neighbours to provide the dog yard with walls and to build a separate yard to be used by puppies. On 24 August 1995 it decided that no measures had to be taken as there was no nuisance. The official reporting on the case made a reservation to the decision. On 22 January 1998 the Health Board held an inspection and noted that the walls had been altered. On 27\u00a0January\u00a02000 it upheld its previous decision as there were no new facts in the case. On 14 August 2003 it ordered that the walls be altered. On 10\u00a0June 2004 it approved a proposal to rebuild the walls. On 12\u00a0August\u00a02004 it found that the existing dog yard must not be used. In June\u00a01995 the second applicant admitted that the dogs had not caused any health hazard, which apparently resulted in the Health Board\u2019s decision of 24\u00a0August 1995 not to take any measures. The Health Board had not given as detailed orders as requested and it had refused to indicate time-limits. Furthermore, it had apparently found that the circumstances had changed somewhat in relation to the original situation.",

Greece, judgment of 27\u00a0August\u00a01991, Series A no. 209, p. 20, \u00a7 59). However, that right would be illusory if a \u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants - proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious - without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Golder v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21\u00a0February 1975, Series A no. 18, pp. 16-18, \u00a7\u00a7 34-36).

The effective protection of a party to such proceedings and the restoration of legality presuppose an obligation on the administrative authorities\u2019 part to comply with a judgment of that court. The Court observes in this connection that the administrative authorities form one element of a State subject to the rule of law and their interests accordingly coincide with the need for the proper administration of justice. Where an administrative authority refuses or fails to comply, or even delays doing so, the guarantees under Article 6 enjoyed by a litigant during the judicial phase of the proceedings are rendered devoid of purpose.",

Since the beginning of the 1980s the property, which at the time belonged to the estate of the first applicant\u2019s deceased husband and the second applicant\u2019s late father, had been rented out on a weekly basis. Following the distribution of the estate in the mid 1990s the first applicant has been the sole owner of the property. From the beginning of the 1990s the property has been rented out during 20 per cent of the year, producing a gross income of EUR 5,000-9,000 per year. Had there been no private nuisance, the applicants estimated that the property would have been rented out during 70 to 80 per cent of the year and for a higher rent than the one applied. From the beginning of the 21st century the first applicant had tried to sell the property but to no avail owing to the private nuisance and the ongoing proceedings.",

The applicants\u2019 calculations that they could have received a four times higher rent income had the situation been different was rejected by the Government, because the applicants might have chosen to spend more time at the property themselves or might have sold it. Moreover, tourist flows were difficult to estimate. As to the applicants\u2019 argument that a new owner would de facto become involved as a party to the proceedings with the neighbours, the Government were not convinced that that would necessarily be the case. Lastly, the Government considered that there was no direct causal link between the alleged violation and the alleged damage. Accordingly, no award should be made. Were the Court to find one or several violations, the applicants should be awarded a reasonable compensation for non-pecuniary damage which, depending on the violation or violations found, should not exceed EUR 6,500.",

She has however not sufficiently substantiated the alleged difficulties in selling the property. The claim brought by the second applicant must be rejected as he was never an owner of the property, which up until the mid 1990s was owned by the estate and thereafter by the first applicant. It is to be noted that the first applicant and her family already had accommodation and therefore, contrary to the Government\u2019s submissions, the Court considers it reasonable that she would have attempted to rent out the real property to a stable degree. According to the applicants, the rental activities had generated an annual gross income of EUR 5,000-9,000 when the property had been rented out during 20 per cent of the year and they estimated that had there been no private nuisance the property could have been rented out during 70-80 per cent of the year. The\u00a0Court is not ready to accept this approach, which it considers rather speculative. Moreover, no documentation of the income actually generated during the period in issue, such as for instance tax declarations or leases, has been submitted in support of the claim. Having regard to the circumstances, and deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards the first applicant the sum of EUR 5,000 for pecuniary damage suffered as a result of the non-compliance by the Health Board of judicial decisions.",
