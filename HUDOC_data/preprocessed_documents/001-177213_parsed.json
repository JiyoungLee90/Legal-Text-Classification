However, the Court has held that independence is one of the most important constitutive elements of the notion of a \u201ccourt\u201d, as referred to in several Articles of the Convention (see\u00a0De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, 18 June 1971, \u00a7 78, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a012). In the Court\u2019s opinion, it would be inconceivable that Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention should not equally envisage, as a fundamental requisite, the impartiality of that court (see D.N. v. Switzerland [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a042).",

When taking a decision on detention on remand and other pre-trial decisions of this kind the judge summarily assesses the available data in order to ascertain whether the prosecution have prima facie grounds for their suspicion; when giving judgment at the conclusion of the trial he must assess whether the evidence that has been produced and debated in court suffices for finding the accused guilty. Suspicion and a formal finding of guilt are not to be treated as being the same (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7 97, 26\u00a0July 2001).",

He merely assessed whether there was a reasonable suspicion of the applicant having committed a criminal offence and whether there were additional risks warranting the applicant\u2019s detention. While ordering the applicant\u2019s detention after the quashing of the applicant\u2019s conviction, Judge D. found himself in the same position as any other judge who had to rule on a detention matter after the conviction of a defendant had been overturned.
