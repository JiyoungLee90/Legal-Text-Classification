In any event, the applicant considered that the domestic courts had failed to display the necessary diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. He pointed out that the first-instance judgment of the Rijeka County Court of 8 June 2010 had been quashed by the Supreme Court on 10 May 2011 and that after that there had been no activity in the conduct of the proceedings, while at the same time he had been held in detention. The decisions of the domestic courts did not indicate, nor did they justify, such protracted proceedings, although his detention had been extended twice beyond the maximum statutory time-limits. The applicant also pointed out that it had taken the Rijeka County Court one year and ten months to adopt a first-instance judgment, after which it took one year for the case to be decided on appeal before the Supreme Court. After the Supreme Court had quashed the first-instance judgment no hearing was held in the proceedings, no evidence was taken and there was no other activity. However, during that whole period he had been kept in detention. Therefore, the applicant considered that the domestic courts had not acted with due diligence and had not given sufficient weight to his arguments that his detention was no longer reasonable or necessary; nor had they given any consideration to releasing him by imposing less severe preventive measures such as bail or police supervision.",
