The case originated in an application (no. 42478/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Lyubov Nikolayevna Mirvoda (“the applicant”), on 12 November 2004.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Bychkovskiy from Miusinsk. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 8 November 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the non-enforcement of the judgments in the applicant's favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Krasnyy Luch, the Lungansk region.
On 23 October 2000 the  (Краснолуцький міський суд Луганської області) gave two judgments in favour of the applicant against the State Open Joint Stock Mining Company Krasnolutska (ДВАТ Шахта „Краснолуцька” ДП ДХК „Донбасантрацит”). By these judgments the court awarded the applicant UAH 932.04 in salary arrears and 8,850 kilos of coal, respectively. The judgments became final and the enforcement writs were transferred to the Krasnyy Luch Bailiffs' Service (Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Краснолуцького міського управління юстиції) for enforcement.
On 28 October 2004 the judgment awarding the applicant salary arrears was enforced in full. The judgment awarding the applicant coal has been partly enforced. To present day the applicant has received 2,950 kilos of coal. In accordance to the Government, the enforcement is impeded by the debtor's economic hardships.
