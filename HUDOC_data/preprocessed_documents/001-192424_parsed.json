The Court has held that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider with regard to public officials than in relation to a private individual, and that, while a public official is certainly entitled to have his reputation protected, the requirements of that protection have to be weighed against the interests of open discussion of political and social issues, since exceptions to freedom of expression must be interpreted narrowly (see, for example, Janowski, cited above, \u00a7 33).",

It is thus of the view that, whether or not the national authorities\u2019 interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression might have been justified, in principle, to protect K.T.\u2019s good name and reputation, a sanction such as the one imposed on the applicant was manifestly disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",
