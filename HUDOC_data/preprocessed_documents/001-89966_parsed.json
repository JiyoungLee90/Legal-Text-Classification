Furthermore, in considering whether a particular form of treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3 (see Raninen v.

Even so, this space was still comparable to the one to which the applicant in the above Kalashnikov case had been confined. Furthermore, it was significantly smaller than the 4 sq. m minimum requirement for a single inmate in multi-occupancy cells according to the CPT standards (see the relevant CPT reports at paragraphs 35-37 above) and even smaller than the 2.5 sq. m minimum required at the material time under the domestic law.

Therefore, while the length of a detention period may be a relevant factor in assessing the gravity of suffering or humiliation caused to a detainee by the inadequate conditions of his detention (see, for example, Kalashnikov, cited above, \u00a7 102, and Dougoz, cited above, \u00a7 48), the relative brevity of such a period alone will not automatically exclude the treatment complained of from the scope of Article 3 if all other elements are sufficient to bring it within the scope of that provision.",

This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5: by virtue of paragraph 2 any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with paragraph 4. Whilst this information must be conveyed \u201cpromptly\u201d, it need not be related in its entirety by the arresting officer at the very moment of the arrest. Whether the content and promptness of the information conveyed were sufficient is to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0182, p.\u00a019, \u00a7\u00a040, and Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1994, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0300A, p.\u00a031, \u00a7\u00a072).",

On the other hand, it is evident from the written statement made by the applicant at the police station following his arrest that he was aware of the charge against him and consequently of the reasons why he had been brought to the police station.

It follows that the guarantees of that provision are not applicable to the applicant\u2019s administrative detention, which, as already indicated above, was imposed under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a).

Furthermore, it had not been public since it had been held in camera in a judge\u2019s office. The speed with which the proceedings had been conducted, the failure to provide him with adequate time and facilities to prepare his defence and the fact that he had been denied the right to call or examine witnesses or give evidence in his defence had put him at a significant disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent. The materials of the case against him had not been revealed to him prior to the hearing and the court had failed to provide a reasoned decision. The hearing had taken place immediately after his questioning at the police station and he had been denied access to a lawyer prior to and during the trial.",

The administrative case against the applicant was examined in an expedited procedure under Article 277 of the CAO. The applicant was similarly taken to and kept in a police station \u2013 without any contact with the outside world \u2013 where he was presented with a charge and in a matter of hours taken to a court and convicted. The Court therefore does not see any reason to reach a different finding in the present case and concludes that the applicant did not have a fair hearing, in particular on account of not being afforded adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence.",

While accepting this approach, I would have preferred to examine separately the complaints relating to the lack of legal assistance. The applicant submitted having been denied access to a lawyer prior to and during the trial (paragraph 78). For the same reasons expressed in my partly dissenting opinion in the Galstyan case, to which I refer, I find that there has been a violation of Article 6 paragraph 1 taken together with Article 6 paragraph 3 (c) also in this respect.",
