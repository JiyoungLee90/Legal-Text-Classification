Although it is not always necessary for the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 to be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see Reinprecht v. Austria, no. 67175/01, \u00a7 31, ECHR 2005- ..., with further references). The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties. In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), a hearing is required (see Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999II). The opportunity for a detainee to be heard either in person or through some form of representation features among the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty (see Kampanis v.

Given that neither the applicant nor his counsel were present at the examination of the applicant's appeal on 14 August 2003, whereas the prosecutor was present and made submissions, the Court considers that those proceedings did not meet the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4. The Court also notes that there is nothing in the appeal decision of 14 August 2003 to suggest that the appeal court examined whether the applicant's counsel had been duly notified of the appeal hearing and, if he had not, whether the examination of the appeal should have been adjourned or whether the applicant should have been brought to the hearing.",
