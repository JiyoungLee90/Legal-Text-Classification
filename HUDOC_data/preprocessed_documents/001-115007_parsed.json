A group of five officers was given the task of carrying out the actual arrest. At about 8.30 p.m. that group arrived at the applicant\u2019s home in a block of flats in , where they joined the two officers previously sent there. The officers had three cars. One of them was a Volkswagen Transporter minivan that they parked at fifteen to twenty metres from the front entrance of the applicant\u2019s building. Shortly before 9\u00a0p.m. four officers went up to the applicant\u2019s flat, two remained in the minivan, and one was left at the building\u2019s entrance. The four officers who went up rang the applicant\u2019s doorbell. His fourteenyear old daughter answered the door. The applicant showed up at the door moments after that. The officers told him that he was to accompany them to the police station. The applicant went back in, took his passport and a jacket, and followed the officers down. Two officers escorted the applicant in the lift. The two others went inside his flat and remained there until about 11.00 p.m. to prevent the persons present in the flat \u2013 the applicant\u2019s family and two neighbours \u2013 to make telephone calls. Downstairs, the two officers escorting the applicant were joined by the officer who had remained near the building\u2019s entrance. When the group was five or six metres from the minivan, one of the officers who was inside the vehicle opened its side sliding door. At that point, the applicant abruptly tried to move to the back of the minivan instead of its door. The two officers who were escorting him grabbed him by the arms and placed them behind his back. The applicant resisted the officers\u2019 attempt to push him into the minivan. One officer tripped him and the applicant fell, face down, on the minivan\u2019s floor, his legs remaining outside. The officer inside the minivan tried to pull him in. The minivan set off and, at the same moment, an officer who remained on the street pushed its side sliding door to close it. As the applicant\u2019s feet were still hanging outside, he was hit by the door. The officers inside the minivan kept on trying to close the minivan\u2019s door and handcuff the applicant, who resisted, keeping his arms under his body and trying to get up. The door could not be closed as the applicant\u2019s feet protruded outside. The officers eventually managed to pull the applicant\u2019s legs in and handcuff him. A hood was then placed on his head to blind him, so that he could not see where he was being taken.",

The injuries to the wrists had been caused by handcuffs. The injuries to the nail of the left index finger had been caused by a frontal traumatic impact to the finger. As the injury had been inflicted a long time before the examination which had noted it, its exact cause could not be determined: it could have consisted of a blow to the distal phalange, the insertion of an object under the nail, or the removal of the nail by the application of pressure to its extremity. The hematoma on the left thumbnail had been caused by a blow or by the pressing of the thumb between hard blunt objects.

The court started by setting out its findings of fact (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above). It went on to hold that, based on those findings, the officers\u2019 actions could not be regarded as a criminal offence because, although causing the applicant bodily harm, they had been justified under Article 12a of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 75 below). The court reproduced in its judgment the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning his ill-treatment inside the minivan and in Koprivshtitsa, and said that those allegations, if true, meant that the applicant would have had injuries all over his body and would carry horrifying marks of illtreatment. However, the findings of Dr D.D. (see\u00a0paragraph 20 above) had not revealed such marks and were fully consistent with the version put forward by the three accused officers. Dr\u00a0D.D. had not recorded multiple injuries to the applicant\u2019s head, but only one injury to the central parietal area. It was implausible to assume that all of the alleged numerous blows to the applicant\u2019s head had been administered to a single spot. There were no recorded injuries to the front or the back of his torso, belly or feet, or injuries to his eyes caused by pressing. It could therefore be accepted that the officers\u2019 account as to the amount of force that they had used to restrain the applicant and handcuff him was truthful, and that the use of force has stopped after the applicant had been subdued. The officers\u2019 aim had been to arrest the applicant, who they believed had committed a criminal offence, and to bring him before the appropriate authority \u2013 colonel B.B. The officers had also sought to prevent the applicant from alerting his accomplices. In view of his resistance, there had been no other way of carrying out the arrest. The use of force had also been justified under section 78(1)(1) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997 (see paragraph 71 below) because the applicant had failed to heed a lawful order and had put up resistance. The three officers had not used disproportionate force. The applicant had been arrested in relation to a very serious offence \u2013 the assassination of a former prime minister \u2013, had resisted arrest, and had not sustained very serious injuries. The use of force had stopped immediately after he had been subdued. Since the officers\u2019 actions had not constituted an offence and had amounted to a lawful use of force, the applicant\u2019s civil claim was to be rejected.",

The court went on to say that the indictment did not contain factual allegations in respect of one of the three officers, who was therefore to be acquitted on the basis that he had not used any force in respect of the applicant. The court did not agree with the lower court that Article 12a of the Criminal Code was applicable, holding that this provision referred exclusively to the arrest of offenders who have been convicted by means of a final decision, which was not the case of the applicant. However, it went on to say that the officers\u2019 actions were not criminal because they had constituted a lawful and proportionate use of force within the meaning of section 78(1)(1) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997 (see paragraph 71 below). The applicant had failed to heed a lawful order and had resisted the officers\u2019 efforts to put him into the minivan and to handcuff him inside the minivan. The officers had stopped using force immediately after handcuffing the applicant. Lastly, the court noted that during the preliminary investigation the applicant had given evidence that he had been subjected to violence in the house in Koprivshtitsa, where the three officers had left him.

The Bureau was to be a permanently acting body having its own administration (new section\u00a034b(3)). In carrying out its functions it could (a) ask the relevant authorities to provide it with information in relation to the use of special means of surveillance; (b) check whether those authorities kept accurate records; (c) access premises containing such records or material obtained though surveillance; (d) give mandatory instructions for improvements in the use of special means of surveillance and in the storage and destruction of material obtained though such means; and (e) inform the prosecuting authorities and the heads of the relevant authorities of instances of unlawful use of such means or of irregularities in the storage or destruction of material obtained though such means (new section 34g). The Bureau was to submit to Parliament an annual report setting out aggregated data on the matters that it was overseeing (new section 34b(5)).

In that latest report the commission said, inter alia, that it had received a number of complaints from individuals, and had taken measures to examine them. It had carried out inspections in seven towns, and had noted many irregularities, such as insufficiently reasoned applications for judicial authorisation of secret surveillance, failures to destroy material obtained through such surveillance within the statutory timelimits, and failures to report back to the court which had authorised surveillance. The commission went on to say that the lack of proper recordkeeping made it difficult to oversee the operation of the system as a whole. It also noted the very low percentage of refused applications for judicial authorisation of secret surveillance. The total number of requests in 2011 had been 13,846. Only 116 had been refused, chiefly on purely technical grounds. 7,881 persons had been subjected to surveillance. 747\u00a0requests had yielded material subsequently used in criminal trials. The analysis of the available data showed that the authorities were not using secret surveillance as a means of last resort, but routinely, mainly because it was an almost effortless way of gathering evidence. It was therefore necessary to tighten up the relevant regulations and to strengthen judicial control. The commission made a number of specific proposals in that respect.",

However, it starts by noting that there is no indication \u2013 and the Government have not sought to argue \u2013 that the applicant had any injuries before being taken into custody. It appears \u2013 in particular from the findings of the Military Court of Appeal \u2013 that some of the applicant\u2019s injuries might have been caused during his arrest, through efforts to make him get into the police minivan, and others later (see paragraph 63 in fine above). However, it cannot be overlooked that the military courts did not try in their judgments to account for all injuries found on the applicant (see paragraphs 56 and 63 above). Even if the applicant was hurt in the process of being put into the minivan, this could not provide a complete explanation of all of his numerous injuries\u00a0\u2013 in particular those to his head and to his fingers and fingernails. It\u00a0should moreover be emphasised that a State\u2019s responsibility under the Convention is not to be confused with individual criminal responsibility (see, among other authorities, Av\u015far v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7 284, ECHR\u00a02001VII (extracts), and Imakayeva v. Russia, no. 7615/02, \u00a7 116, ECHR 2006XIII (extracts)). The corollary of that is that acquittal by a domestic criminal court bound by the presumption of innocence and having regard to the high criminal standard of proof does not absolve the respondent State of its responsibility under the Convention (see\u00a0Ribitsch\u00a0v.\u00a0, 4 December 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 3234, Series A no. 336). The\u00a0Court\u2019s approach to issues of proof differs from that of the domestic criminal courts. For instance, the distribution of the burden of proof in the proceedings before the Court is intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a0147, ECHR 2005VII). The Court has thus held that where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused (see, among many other authorities, Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999V; Toteva\u00a0v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 42027/98, \u00a7 50, 19 May 2004; and Vladimir\u00a0Georgiev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 61275/00, \u00a7 36, 16 October 2008).",

Bulgaria, no. 31365/02, \u00a7\u00a7 5657, 15 January 2009, with further references). The burden to show that this was the case is on the Government (see Altay\u00a0v.\u00a0, no. 22279/93, \u00a7 54, 22 May 2001, and Rashid v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a047905/99, \u00a7 46, 18 January 2007).

While some of them\u00a0\u2013 for instance, some of those to his arms, wrists and lower legs \u2013 may have been the inevitable result of the arresting officers\u2019 efforts to make him get into the police minivan and handcuff him, others \u2013 for instance, that to his head \u2013 appear to be the result of a blow with a blunt object. The Court is not persuaded that even the injuries allegedly caused when the officers were trying to put the applicant into the minivan could be regarded as necessary, for two reasons. Firstly, they were quite severe and widespread. Secondly, the operation for the applicant\u2019s arrest was planned in advance and was carried out by special forces of the police; they could have therefore taken measures to minimise any attendant injury (see Rashid, \u00a7 51, and Georgi\u00a0Dimitrov, \u00a7 58, both cited above).",

It was not contested that these injuries were sustained while the applicant was at the hands of the police. In these circumstances, the Government are under an obligation to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused (see Ribitsch, cited above, \u00a7 34). However, neither their observations, nor the findings made during the domestic proceedings contain an explanation of the origin of those injuries. The Court notes in this connection that when referring the case back for additional investigation, the Sofia Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office observed that no information had been gathered about the officers in charge of the applicant between his arrival in Koprivshtitsa and his return to Sofia the next day (see paragraph 49 above). It later went on to note that the charges against the officers did not specify which of them had administered which blows to which parts of the applicant\u2019s body (see paragraphs 51 and 52 above). In spite of the referrals, it does not seem that these points were subsequently elucidated. In their judgments acquitting the officers, the Sofia Military Court and the Military Court of Appeal did not seek to explain the origin of each of the many injuries found on the applicant, accepting instead, without any detailed analysis of the manner in which each of them had been caused, that all had been inflicted when the officers had tried to put the applicant into the minivan and handcuff him (see paragraphs 56 and 63 above). The Military Court of Appeal went on to observe that not all of the injuries found on the applicant had been caused by the three accused officers. However, as already noted, it does not appear that the authorities tried to make any findings in that respect. In view of those considerations, the Court concludes that the Government have not provided a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused.",

It cannot be overlooked in this connection that the criminal charges against the applicant and his two coaccused \u2013 who were also illtreated, albeit to a lesser degree\u00a0\u2013 rested to a large extent on the confessions obtained from them while they were detained. When examining those criminal charges, the Sofia Court of Appeal, whose ruling was fully upheld by the Supreme Court of Cassation, said that it could not have regard to those confessions because they had been obtained as a result of serious physical violence \u2013 especially in relation to the applicant \u2013 whose effects had not subsided for several months (see paragraphs 40 and 43 above).",

The Court has already had occasion to observe that artificially depriving detainees of their sight by blindfolding them for lengthy periods may, when combined with other illtreatment, subject them to strong psychological and physical pressure (see \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a046221/99, \u00a7 183, ECHR 2005IV). Indeed, blindfolding may in some circumstances amount in itself to treatment proscribed under Article 3 (see\u00a0Martinez Sala and Others v. Spain, no. 58438/00, \u00a7\u00a7 123 and 125, 2\u00a0November 2004, and Petyo Petkov v. Bulgaria, no. 32130/03, \u00a7\u00a7 3940, 7\u00a0January 2010). In the instant case, there is no indication that the applicant was hooded with a view to preserving his anonymity (contrast Petyo Petkov, cited above, \u00a7 43) or the anonymity of the officers who arrested him (contrast \u00d6calan, cited above, \u00a7 184). It should be noted in this connection that at the relevant time Bulgarian law did not contain any provisions allowing the hooding of detainees (see Petyo Petkov, cited above, \u00a7 42). This illegal measure rather appears to have been designed to disorient the applicant \u2013 according to the findings of the , its purpose was to prevent him from knowing where he was being taken (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a09 in fine above). The Court also takes note of the manner in which the applicant was placed under arrest, the fact that he was taken to a \u201csecret base\u201d used by the police instead of a regular place of detention, and the fact that he was interrogated there for a long time during the night (see\u00a0paragraph 15 above).",

Ukraine, no. 38812/97, \u00a7\u00a7 12627, ECHR\u00a02003V). It is significant in this connection that the Sofia Court of Appeal found evidence of an attempt to delay the proper medical examination of the applicant (see paragraph 41 above). Indeed, later this caused the medical experts difficulties in their efforts to establish the exact origin and time of the applicant\u2019s various injuries (see paragraphs 45 and 48 above). The Court has had occasion to emphasise the importance of proper medical examinations, carried out by a properly qualified doctor, as an essential safeguard against ill-treatment of persons in custody (see, as a recent authority, Eri\u015fen and Others v. Turkey, no. 7067/06, \u00a7 45, 3 April 2012). It has also explained that prompt forensic examination is crucial as signs of injury may often disappear quickly and certain injuries may heal within weeks or even a few days (see Rizvanov v. Azerbaijan, no. 31805/06, \u00a7 47, 17 April 2012). Chiefly for this reason, a failure to secure the forensic evidence in a timely manner is one of the most important factors in assessing the overall effectiveness of an investigation into allegations of illtreatment (ibid., \u00a7 59, citing Mammadov v. Azerbaijan, no. 34445/04, \u00a7\u00a074, 11 January 2007). The Court would add that in cases where there exist legitimate doubts as to the impartiality and independence of the healthcare staff of a detention facility and the completeness of their forensic findings, the persons concerned should be allowed timely access to outside experts.",

It must have been obvious to those authorities that at least some of the applicant\u2019s injuries were indicative of deliberate illtreatment, which, coupled with the manner in which the applicant had been arrested, interrogated and subjected to covert surveillance \u2013 which appear to have been all tainted by illegality \u2013, should have at least prompted them to inquire into that possibility and try to determine whether police officers bore direct or indirect responsibility for that and, if so, which ones. The need for such inquiries must have become even more glaring later, in 2006 and 2007, when the Sofia Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Cassation specifically found that the applicant had been seriously illtreated in order to confess, that his confession should not therefore be taken into account, and that the remaining evidence was not sufficient to prove the charges against the applicant to the requisite standard (see paragraphs 40 and 43 above). Those rulings were public and were moreover admitted in evidence by the Military Court of Appeal (see\u00a0paragraph 61 above). However, the military prosecuting and investigating authorities apparently chose to ignore them, with the result that only some of the officers involved in the initial arrest operation against the applicant were investigated (see paragraph 63 in fine above).",

However, in those cases there had either been no criminal proceedings against the officers concerned (see Krastanov, cited above, \u00a7 41) or the officers had been finally convicted in connection with the illtreatment in issue (see Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 26 and 28). Here, by contrast, the officers charged with illtreating the applicant were finally acquitted and the civil claims against them were rejected on the basis that the force that they had used against the applicant had been lawful (see paragraphs 56 and 63 above). The Court notes in this connection that under the Bulgarian rules of civil procedure, the final judgment of a criminal court is binding on the civil court which examines the civil consequences of the criminal act in relation to the points whether the act was perpetrated and whether it was unlawful (see\u00a0paragraphs 91 and 92 above), whereas claims under section 1 of the 1988 Act or section 49 of the 1951 Act can be entertained only if the conduct to which they relate was unlawful (see paragraphs 84 and 90 above). The Court is not aware of any judicial precedents in which victims of police violence have been able to prosecute successfully claims under those provisions even though \u2013 as in the case at hand \u2013 the officers alleged to have illtreated them had been finally acquitted and exonerated of liability for their actions. The Government have not provided any examples showing otherwise. The case on which they rely (see paragraphs 6669 above) is not such an example because the claim brought by the applicant\u2019s coaccused was rejected and because there is no indication that the officers who had ill-treated him were tried and finally acquitted.",

However, the Court has not been presented with any examples in which the courts have awarded compensation under that provision in relation to specific incidents of deliberate illtreatment suffered in detention. Moreover, such claims cannot be regarded as an effective remedy in that respect because the cause of action which underlies them is not a breach of the right not to be subjected to illtreatment, but the fact that the proceedings have resulted in an acquittal and that the charges are retrospectively considered to have been \u201cunlawful\u201d (see paragraph 88 above). They are therefore not an avenue whereby those who have been illtreated by the authorities can vindicate, as such, their rights under Article\u00a03 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Dimitrov and Hamanov v.

The Court reiterated this finding in Goranova-Karaeneva v. Bulgaria (no.\u00a012739/05, \u00a7\u00a7 6063, 8 March 2011), and went on to hold that the remedy under section 2(1)(7) of the 1988 Act, which was put in place in March 2009 (see paragraph 86 above), could not be regarded as effective in respect of surveillance carried out before its introduction. In the absence of effective domestic remedies, the applicant should have raised his complaint about the secret taping of his interrogation \u2013 a specific event that occurred on an identifiable date \u2013 not more than six months after he learned about it on 11 March 2003 (see paragraphs 26 and 29 above, and, mutatis mutandis, Petkov and Others v.

The fact that he did not have knowledge of the exact content of the recording is immaterial because the lack of such knowledge could not prevent him from formulating a complaint under Article 8 of the Convention in relation to the secret taping of his interrogation. Nor can the Court accept that the criminal proceedings against the applicant constituted an obstacle to his raising grievances in this respect. It follows that the complaints concerning the secret taping of the applicant\u2019s interrogation have been introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

It follows that his complaints in that respect cannot be regarded as having been raised out of time.

Moreover, the amendments had been merely cosmetic and had not provided real safeguards against abusive surveillance, or the possibility for those concerned to learn about such surveillance and seek redress in respect of it. Although in 2008 Parliament had created a National Bureau for Control of Special Means of Surveillance, in 2009 that Bureau had been abolished and replaced by a Parliamentary subcommission, which lacked the necessary personnel or budget to be able to discharge its tasks effectively. That subcommission could not be expected to monitor the many thousands of instances of covert surveillance which took place annually.

However, it went on to find problems with (a) the lack of review by an independent body of the implementation of surveillance measures or of whether the material obtained through such measures would be destroyed within the statutory timelimit if the surveillance had proved fruitless; (b) the lack of sufficient safeguards in respect of surveillance carried out on national security grounds and not in the context of criminal proceedings; (c) the lack of regulations specifying with an appropriate degree of precision the manner of screening of such material, or the procedures for preserving its integrity and confidentiality and the procedures for its destruction; (d) the lack of an independent body overseeing and reporting on the functioning of the system of secret surveillance; (e) the lack of independent control over the use of material falling outside the scope of the original application for the use of surveillance measures; and (f) the lack of notification of the persons concerned, even where such notification could be made without jeopardising the purpose of the surveillance (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 8591). On that basis, the Court concluded that Bulgarian law did not provide sufficient guarantees against the risk of abuse inherent in any system of secret surveillance (ibid.,\u00a0\u00a7 93).",

The Court was faced with the same argument in the case of GoranovaKaraeneva (cited above, \u00a7\u00a061). It observed that that provision had come into force long after the applicant had lodged her application, whereas the assessment whether effective domestic remedies existed was normally to be carried out with reference to the date on which the application had been lodged with the Court. The Court went on to say that even if it were to make an exception from that rule, it was not persuaded that the new point 7 could provide an effective remedy to the applicant, chiefly because the Bulgarian courts appeared consistently to construe amendments to the liability provisions of the 1988 Act as conferring substantive rights and not having retrospective effect (see also paragraph 87 above). It was therefore highly unlikely that those courts would allow a claim in respect of events which predated the coming into force of point 7 by several years. The Court observed that the Government had not cited any examples to show otherwise, and concluded that in the circumstances of the case the possibility of bringing a claim under the new point 7 was not an effective remedy. The Court also noted that the Government had not referred to another remedy, and that it was not aware of any (see GoranovaKaraeneva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 6264).",

The Government have not provided any examples of awards of damages under that provision in relation to secret surveillance predating its coming into force \u2013 or, indeed, any secret surveillance; on the contrary, as recently as June 2012 they acknowledged that they were not aware of caselaw under that provision (see paragraph 93 above).",

It is true that under the new section 34h of the Special Surveillance Means Act 1997, as amended, a special parliamentary commission has to notify those unlawfully subjected to secret surveillance, if this can be done without harming certain countervailing interests (see paragraph 82 above). However, that cannot be taken into account, because that opportunity arose long after the lodging of the application, and because it is unclear whether it applies to past instances of secret surveillance.",

The presumption of innocence enshrined in paragraph 2 of Article 6 is one of the elements of the fair criminal trial that is required by paragraph 1 (see, among many other authorities, Deweer v.

Be that as it may, it cannot be overlooked that several months ago, in May 2012, the Bulgarian Parliament enacted amendments to sections 72 and 73 the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 2006, which came into force on 1 July 2012 and appear \u2013 especially in the light of the explanatory notes to the amendment bill \u2013 to deal with the points raised by the applicant (see paragraph 74 above). The Court therefore does not consider it necessary to indicate any general measures at national level that could be called for in the execution of this judgment (see, mutatis mutandis, Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7\u00a7 12124, ECHR 2006II).",

There is therefore no basis to indicate general measures at national level that could be called for in the execution of the present judgment. In any event, it cannot be overlooked that following the Court\u2019s judgment in Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above), Bulgaria has taken certain general steps to remedy the problems highlighted in that case: its Parliament enacted changes to the Special Surveillance Means Act 1997, the 1988 Act, and its standing rules, and set up a special parliamentary commission whose task is to oversee the use of special means of surveillance and the storing and destruction of material obtained through such means and to protect individuals against the unlawful use of such means (see paragraphs 8083 above, and contrast Greens and M.T. v. the United Kingdom, nos. 60041/08 and 60054/08, \u00a7\u00a7 11015, ECHR 2010... (extracts)). As already noted, those developments are still under review by the Committee of Ministers in the exercise of its duty under Article 46 \u00a7 2 of the Convention to supervise the execution of the Court\u2019s judgment in Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, and the Committee has yet to make a pronouncement on them (see paragraph 93 above, and Greens and M.T., cited above, \u00a7 114). It may fall to the Court at some future point, in the exercise of its supervisory role and in the context of a new application under Article 34 of the Convention, to assess the compatibility of the new regime with the requirements of the Convention (ibid.). However, it does not consider that it is appropriate for it to give instructions in that respect in the present case.",

He pointed out that he had been arrested at night, without being told for what reason, had been hooded, had been subjected to serious deliberate violence causing him intense pain in the police minivan on the way to Koprivshtitsa, and had been taken not to a regular place of detention but to a house where he had been tortured, and then again hooded on the way back to Sofia, which had caused to feel terror and apprehension as to what awaited him next. After that he had not been given timely medical attention, had been refused contact with a lawyer of his own choosing, and only allowed to contact his wife to tell her that he was in custody but not where. He had suffered additional frustration and feelings of injustice from the slow and ineffective investigation of his illtreatment and from the lack of any redress in respect of it.

That stigma, taken up by the media, would continue to haunt him for the rest of his life.

Moreover, in De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium ((Article 50), 10 March 1972, \u00a7 16, Series A no. 14, cited in Anguelova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, \u00a7 172, ECHR 2002IV), it held that Article 41 (former Article 50) of the Convention does not require applicants to exhaust domestic remedies a second time before submitting their just satisfaction claims, and that the wording of that provision \u2013 where it refers to the possibility of reparation under domestic law \u2013 lays down a rule going to the merits of the just satisfaction issue. In more recent cases the Court did not distinguish between admissibility and merits in this context, preferring to emphasise that if a person, after exhausting the domestic remedies in vain before complaining to the Court, were obliged to do so a second time before being able to claim just satisfaction from the Court, the total length of the procedure under the Convention would scarcely be in keeping with the idea of the effective protection of human rights (see Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v.
