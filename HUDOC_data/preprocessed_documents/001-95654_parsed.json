In that case, the Court found that the applicant's right of access to a lawyer had been restricted during his police custody, pursuant to section 31 of Law no. 3842, as he was accused of committing an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. As a result, he had not had access to a lawyer when he made his statements to the police. No justification had been given for denying the applicant access to a lawyer other than the fact that it was a requirement of the relevant legal provisions.
