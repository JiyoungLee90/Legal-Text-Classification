The effect of the Omar and Gu\u00e9rin judgments would be to oblige the State to do away with arrest warrants completely, or make them ineffective de facto, which is not what Mr Gu\u00e9rin sought in his application and his memorials (see paragraph 20 of the judgment). But in paragraph 46 the majority were mainly influenced by the fact that Mr\u00a0Gu\u00e9rin was ill, and had been prevented by force majeure from complying with the arrest warrant fortuitously issued against him, and accordingly considered that he should have been deemed to be a convicted person not subject to an arrest warrant.",

It no doubt seems difficult to go so far as to extend application of Article 583 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which allows an appellant to wait until the day before the hearing in the Court of Cassation before surrendering to custody, to cases where an arrest warrant has been issued at the hearing, because the time which would then elapse between delivery of the decision and its execution would be likely to be too long. But it would be perfectly conceivable, despite the fact that there is no provision which governs this situation, for the Court of Cassation to make the admissibility of an appeal, or its consideration of the merits of the appeal, subject to enforcement of the warrant within a reasonable time to be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case. It will be seen that the circumstances of the present case fully justify changing the emphasis of the case-law in such a way.",

But, apart from the fact that the issue of an arrest warrant is usually justified precisely because the defendant is not in court when the judgment is read out, punishing such absence by ruling the appeal on points of law inadmissible seems rather excessive in relation to the fundamental right of access to a court. The defendant is not required by any statutory provision \u2013 except in the case of the adjournment of an appeal on points of law (Article 469-3) \u2013 to be present when the decision is read out, although his presence is desirable for many reasons that it is unnecessary to rehearse here. It may be justified in certain cases to issue an arrest warrant when the court finds that the person concerned obviously has different views about the desirability of his presence. But to rule an appeal on points of law inadmissible where the warrant has not been complied with within the five days following delivery of the judgment is excessive in relation to the fundamental right to lodge such an appeal.\u201d",

You should, therefore, in any case, condemn as disproportionate to the aim of preventing disorder, the sanction of inadmissibility on account of a presumed intention to abscond established by the case-law of the Court of Cassation, based exclusively on an arbitrary analysis of the appellant\u2019s attitude during the five days allowed for the lodging of an appeal after delivery of the judgment.\u201d",
