The novice soldiers setting off \u2013 \u201cbut you\u2019ll soon be back\u201d, people tell them to console them \u2013 already seemed during these ritual send-offs to be plunging into war by donning \u201cinvisible khaki\u201d. It was a time when war seemed rather attractive; the congratulations and praises made it seem like a warm nest, almost as warm as a mother\u2019s arms, into whose embrace they would have liked to run. What we saw at each of these ceremonies shows that the thing has become a collective hysteria and that this hysteria has also spawned its own indispensable attributes: the traditional drum and clarinet, the famous three-crescented flag, sometimes accompanied by the corn-ear flag of the RP [Welfare Party] or the rose-bearing flag of the BBP [Great Union Party] ... Warm-up ceremonies are organised for those setting off for the war, the exaltation felt on killing a man is the exaltation of winning a match and, what is more, the killer justifies his act by speaking of the love he has for his fatherland and his nation. In short, it can\u2019t be said that what we\u2019re doing is right... Those verses, written by a fallen soldier, are carved on his own tombstone. He will no longer see those who gather to give the conscripts a send-off, no longer hear the drum, the clarinet or the gunfire, not be able to read the verses written on his tombstone, on seeing which he would perhaps have felt repelled by the determinism they convey. Because from now on he is reduced to a title: a martyr... It is because the State does not recognise as such the war which is etched deeply into the collective life and the collective memory that, apart from a small minority, those who return from it after losing an arm, a leg or an eye receive no allowance. These people who are no longer capable of meeting their own needs are being deceived by talk of fictitious jobs. \u2018There is a war, but not officially; you are war-wounded, but you count for nothing.\u2019\u201d",

This could present serious problems as far as the equitable, impartial and independent administration of justice is concerned. Quite often the reason for the establishment of such courts is to enable exceptional procedures to be applied which do not comply with normal standards of justice. While the Covenant does not prohibit such categories of courts, nevertheless the conditions which it lays down clearly indicate that the trying of civilians by such courts should be very exceptional and take place under conditions which genuinely afford the full guarantees stipulated in article 14. The Committee has noted a serious lack of information in this regard in the reports of some States parties whose judicial institutions include such courts for the trying of civilians. In some countries such military and special courts do not afford the strict guarantees of the proper administration of justice in accordance with the requirements of article 14 which are essential for the effective protection of human rights.\u201d",

In the final analysis, the Committee took the view that \u201cmilitary courts should not have the faculty to try cases which do not refer to offences committed by members of the armed forces in the course of their duties\u201d. In its 1999 report on Poland the Committee expressed its views even more incisively, stating that it was \u201cconcerned at information about the extent to which military courts have jurisdiction to try civilians; despite recent limitations on this procedure, the Committee does not accept that this practice is justified by the convenience of the military court dealing with every person who may have taken some part in an offence primarily committed by a member of the armed forces\u201d (Concluding Observations of the Human Rights Committee: Poland, Doc.

In all circumstances, the State shall ensure that civilians accused of a criminal offence of any nature are tried by civilian courts\u201d. A similar position had previously been adopted by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (see, for example, Cantoral Benavides v. Peru, judgment of 18 August 2000, series C no. 69, \u00a7 75), which had emphasised that military courts had been set up by various laws with the aim of maintaining order and discipline within the armed forces. Their jurisdiction should therefore be reserved for military personnel who had committed crimes or lesser offences in the performance of their duties.",

In the case-law of the Court, when a civilian is put on trial in a military court or a court where a military judge sits, the Court tries to ascertain whether the military judge offers sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of his impartiality. In Incal v. Turkey (judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV) the Court gave a negative answer to this question, because a. the military judge who was a member of the State Security Court belonged to the army and took his orders from the executive; b. he was subject to military discipline and assessment reports were compiled on him by the army; c. decisions pertaining to his appointment were taken by the army\u2019s administrative authorities; d. the term of office was only four years and could be renewed.",
