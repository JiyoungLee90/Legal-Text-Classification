For that reason, the Court does not consider it appropriate, as it has done in other cases of the same type (see, for example, Kirilova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria (just satisfaction), nos. 42908/98, 44038/98, 44816/98 and 7319/02, \u00a7 27, 14 June 2007, and Dichev, cited above, \u00a7 42), to instruct the Government to deliver to the applicant the property due to her. The Court is of the view that the respondent Government must pay the applicant a sum corresponding to the current average value of a garage in Sofia. Taking into account the information submitted by the applicant and other data available to it related to the property market in Sofia, it assesses that value at EUR\u00a011,000.",

However, the Court is unable to follow the method suggested by the applicant (see paragraph 26 above), for several reasons. Firstly, it is unclear whether the applicant would have let the garage out had it been delivered to her, or would have used it herself. Secondly, the applicant would have inevitably experienced some delays in finding suitable tenants, would have incurred expenses to maintain the property, and would have been subject to taxation on any rent. Lastly, in view of the economic realities in Bulgaria, it is unrealistic to assume that rent throughout the period since 7 September 1992 would have been equal to that charged at present (see Kirilova and Others (just satisfaction), \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02830, and Dichev, \u00a7 43, both cited above). Thus, having regard to the number of imponderables involved, the Court must rule in equity. It awards the applicant EUR 4,000 under the present head, plus any tax that may be chargeable.",
