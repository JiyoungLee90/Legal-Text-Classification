In Diyarbak\u0131r they reported to Saraykap\u0131 gendarme command. They went to the Security Directorate and explained that they knew where to find certain individuals connected with the terrorists. They went along with police teams and apprehended the four individuals. The village guards took delivery of them in order to take them back to Hazro.

The Av\u015far family was also in contact with the PKK, especially Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far who met with the terrorists in Lice.

After a while, some of the village guards said that they would be late returning to Hazro and decided to go back and hire two cars so the suspect could go onto Lice. They left the suspect and Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far, who was blindfolded, by some ruined buildings. They talked. Then Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far tried to attack him and run away. The suspect, alone and disabled, fired a few warning shots from his Browning pistol. Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far fell down covered in blood. The suspect panicked and ran away to the road, in tears. When his friends returned, he told them an accident had happened. They drove back to Diyarbak\u0131r, the suspect stopping to throw the gun into the river. They handed over the four suspects to the convoy from Hazro and made an excuse to leave. They deposited the car 21AF989 somewhere near the Hazro gendarmerie and returned to their villages.",

He suggested that if they took Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far, who had a relationship with the PKK, the gendarmes could interrogate him to find where the body was. The others agreed and went to the Av\u015far business premises. They introduced themselves as security officials and were going to take Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far to the gendarmerie. An argument broke out, the shop people requesting that the police be brought. Feyzi G\u00f6k\u00e7en went to look for the police.

In front of the gendarmerie, Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu and his friend said that they would take Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far to be interrogated. They drove off. They stopped at a ruined building on the Lice road. Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu and his friend took the victim inside. He and Feyzi G\u00f6k\u00e7en waited by the car. He did not know what was talked about but he did hear mention of some 3 billion Turkish lira (TRL). Sometime later, Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu came and told him to shoot Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far. He did so. When they arrived back in Diyarbak\u0131r, he gave Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu his gun. Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu was driving. The other man wore glasses.",

Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far then came with them in the Toros car. The accused, Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu\u2019s friend, who was introduced as \u201cM\u00fcd\u00fcr\u201d (director) and Aziz Erbey got into a taxi.

He remained near the car. He could hear Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu asking the victim about the PKK. A sum of 3 billion lira was mentioned. He heard nothing about \u00d6mer\u2019s brother. There were two gun shots. He saw \u00d6mer come out with a pistol and bloodstains on his trouser legs. Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu said \u00d6mer had killed the victim. On the way back to Diyarbak\u0131r they were stopped by the police. Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu\u2019s friend showed his ID. There was some mention about the number plate of the car and that the car should be held. Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu drove on anyway and they arrived at the Saraykap\u0131 gendarmerie. The police arrived later looking for the car but did not find it. Captain Gul asked what had happened but the accused said that he did not know anything and should ask Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu. When the incident was discovered, someone whom he did not know told him what he should say in the preliminary investigation.",

It was clear from the file and evidence that the Hazro district gendarme commander sent four village guards to  to apprehend four suspects. They took \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r with them. They stayed overnight, looking for a remaining suspect the next day. \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r believed that Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far knew the place where his brother and uncle were buried and at 11.00 hours took the others to the Av\u015far business premises, which had been shown to him by Ferit Ak\u00e7a. While Ferit and \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r stayed by the car, the others went in and said that they were police officers and that Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far was wanted to give a statement in the Saraykap\u0131 court buildings. When there was resistance, the accused Zeyyat Ak\u00e7il went out to find a police officer and returned with the confessor, Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu, and an unidentified person. He introduced himself as a police officer and flashed an identity card. When the deceased resisted, they pulled their guns, and that caused him to go along with them. They all went together to the gendarme command in Saraykap\u0131. The man described as the \u201cspectacled director\u201d, Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu, Feyzi G\u00f6k\u00e7en and \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r took Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far in the white car to a ruined building for interrogation. Feyzi G\u00f6k\u00e7en stayed by the car. Following a talk inside the building, Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu and the director walked out. \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r went inside and shot Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far with two bullets in the head. The motivation for this incident \u2013 whether money, or revenge \u2013 was unclear. However none of the accused knew that Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far was going to be killed, including \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r. It was more probable that Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far was there only for interrogation. All the accused had restricted the liberty of the victim. While \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r carried out the killing, deliberately and unpremeditatedly committing a crime under Art. 448 of the TPC, there was no information that the others knowingly took part in, or facilitated, the killing.",

Feyzi G\u00f6k\u00e7en, Ya\u015far G\u00fcnbat\u0131, Aziz Erbey and Zeyyat Ak\u00e7il, provisional village guards, were sent to Diyarbak\u0131r to apprehend four PKK suspects. On the way in the car provided by the gendarmes, they met \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r who joined them as he wanted to go to Diyarbak\u0131r for medical treatment. Three of the suspects were found and handed over that day. With help from the Security Directorate, they found the fourth the next day. At this point, the five guards bumped into Ferit Ak\u00e7a outside the Security Directorate. The uncle and brother of \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r had been killed by the PKK, but their bodies never found. \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r thought that Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far had been involved with the PKK and he might know where the bodies were. Carried away by this idea, \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r took the others along to the Av\u015far shop, which Ferit Ak\u00e7a showed them. They arrived in the white Toros. Feyzi G\u00f6k\u00e7en, Ya\u015far G\u00fcnbat\u0131 and Aziz Erbey entered first, joined later by Zeyyat Ak\u00e7il, and they told Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far that he had to come for interrogation. He resisted. The others present asked for the police and for identity cards to be shown. Aziz Erbey and Feyzi G\u00f6k\u00e7en left to fetch the police. They brought back two people, Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu and a man, with glasses, speaking good Turkish who was addressed as \u201cBoss\u201d. This man was said by \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r to be G\u00fcltekin \u015e\u00fct\u00e7\u00fc. Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu showed his ID card. The accused pulled their weapons when there was continued resistance. Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far agreed to leave. They hired a taxi as they were so many. \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r, Zeyyat Ak\u00e7il, Ya\u015far G\u00fcnbat\u0131, Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu, Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu\u2019s friend and the deceased got into the white Toros and the others into the taxi.",

When there have been criminal proceedings in the domestic court concerning those same allegations, it must be borne in mind that criminal law liability is distinct from international law responsibility under the Convention. The Court\u2019s competence is confined to the latter. Responsibility under the Convention is based on its own provisions which are to be interpreted and applied on the basis of the objectives of the Convention and in light of the relevant principles of international law. The responsibility of a State under the Convention, arising for the acts of its organs, agents and servants, is not to be confused with the domestic legal issues of individual criminal responsibility under examination in the national criminal courts.

It rejects Lt Alt\u0131noluk\u2019s statement by rogatory letter, which was not tested by any questioning or reference to the other evidence before the Diyarbak\u0131r court.

It observes that the Diyarbak\u0131r Criminal Court in its judgment of 20 March 2000 found that the reason for the village guards\u2019 visit to Diyarbak\u0131r was to apprehend four suspects. That court also referred to the car as having been given to them by the gendarmes for carrying out that purpose.

S\u00fcleyman Av\u015far explained that the applicant, his son Beh\u00e7et, had fled to Germany after being found guilty of sympathising with the PKK and had had his photograph taken with the PKK leader \u00d6calan, while working for the newspaper \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem, which was regarded by the authorities as a propaganda tool of the PKK. A daughter had also been charged with offences but acquitted; Mehmet Ali Av\u015far had been sentenced and spent some time in detention for a harbouring offence; while Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far had been detained briefly on one occasion. Captain Mithat G\u00fcl told the Commission Delegates that the family was regarded as organically linked with the PKK. The Court is satisfied that the family would have been a subject of interest to police and security officers in the area.",

This version appears in the statements of the village guards taken by the gendarmes on 7 May 1994. In the statements of 9 May taken by the public prosecutor from Feyzi G\u00f6k\u00e7en, Aziz Erbey, Zeyyat Ak\u00e7il and Ya\u015far G\u00fcnbat\u0131, it is stated that \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r proposed that they take someone into custody from the shop for questioning, without however explaining any purported reason for it, while \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r\u2019s statement alone refers to Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far\u2019s alleged knowledge of where his brother was buried.

The court in its decision of 21 March 2000 found that it was this factor which motivated his proposal to the others to take Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far away from the shop.",

The Court notes however that the fact that their presence would have been known does not prove that they were not there. It considers that the village guards had no reason for going to the judicial buildings, having no authority to take persons to the public prosecutor. The pretext for taking Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far was, according to the village guards, to bring him to the gendarmerie for questioning. The statements taken by the gendarmes have already been commented on by the Court as disclosing a tendency to minimise any official knowledge or participation in the incident. It has already found that the accounts of the Av\u015far family are more credible and consistent in comparison. Their evidence has received recent indirect substantiation in the form of the statement from the NCO on duty at the gendarmerie at the time, who turned out to be called Okan as they had claimed (see paragraph 183). The Court would also observe that if the village guards had been in the part of Saraykap\u0131 accessible to the public, it would have been open to the Av\u015far brothers to approach them and ask for the whereabouts of Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far themselves.",

In such circumstances, he must at that point have had grounds to suspect the involvement of the five village guards, Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu and the seventh person in the abduction of Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far, at least, if not also in his murder. He however permitted the village guards to return to Hazro and took no steps to detain Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu or the seventh person.",

Colonel Metin was the deputy provincial gendarme commander. Both he and Captain G\u00fcl told the Delegates that carrying out investigations was a normal part of his functions as deputy: it could not therefore be regarded as particularly significant.

Captain G\u00fcl\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction on the basis of the victim\u2019s whereabouts sits uneasily therefore with his denial that Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far had ever been brought to the gendarmerie and his denial that he had been told anything about the incident by the village guards.",

He was the intelligence operations NCO at the time, yet had no knowledge about the alleged and known PKK links of the Av\u015far family. Nor had he ever heard of J\u0130TEM, the gendarme intelligence organisation notorious in the region at the time (see the Susurluk report).

However this does not explain why the name Se\u00e7kin was given to the court first or why in his petition to the court in 1998 he appeared to rely on the Susurluk report for the identification. It seems likely that he was simplifying considerably. It is possible that the village guards while in prison heard rumours about the specialist sergeant and put forward a name which was only partly correct. It was perhaps not until the Susurluk report that the full name of the specialist sergeant involved in alleged unlawful activities in Diyarbak\u0131r in 1993-94 was correctly reported. That is however a hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence in the materials before the Court to establish that G\u00fcltekin \u015e\u00fct\u00e7\u00fc was indeed the seventh man involved in the abduction and killing of Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far.

His investigation ceased on 9 May 1994. The public prosecutor took no further investigatory steps concerning the seventh person, relying in the indictment on the accounts of the village guards. On 5 July 1994, the five village guards appeared before the court and retracted their initial statements, supporting the family\u2019s account that a seventh person, a security officer, had been involved. Some four years later, an individual G\u00fcltekin \u015e\u00fct\u00e7\u00fc, an army specialist sergeant, was identified as possibly being that person. He disappeared abroad after a rogatory letter had been issued for his statement to be taken. Five years, ten months after the commencement of the proceedings the five village guards and Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu were convicted of murder in the case of \u00d6mer G\u00fcng\u00f6r and abduction in the case of the others, receiving prison sentences of 20 and 6 years 8 months respectively. An investigation was now pending into G\u00fcltekin \u015e\u00fct\u00e7\u00fc\u2019s involvement in the incident. The Court is satisfied that there was a seventh person involved in the incident and that he was a member of the security forces.",

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited above, p. 1211, \u00a7 69, and the Aksoy judgment cited above, p. 2276, \u00a7\u00a7 53 and 54).",

The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed.

The gendarmes were aware of Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far\u2019s presence at the gendarmerie and the identity of his abductors. The latter were not required to account for their action and were allowed to leave the gendarmerie with Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far without interference. Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far was not entered into any record as a person detained for any lawful purpose. While it is not established that any gendarme was aware of any intent to kill Mehmet \u015eerif Av\u015far, the circumstances in which he was removed from his shop and not submitted to formal procedure of recorded detention showed that he was at real and immediate risk of arbitrary and unlawful treatment, including, in the circumstances of south-east Turkey at the time, the risk of being killed (see the K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. Turkey and Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey judgments of 28 March 2000, to be published in ECHR 2000-III). The failure of the gendarmes to react to the unlawful activities of the village guards, Mehmet Mehmeto\u011flu and the seventh person, as well as to the complaints of the family of the abducted person, supports a strong inference of connivance or at least acquiescence in those activities.",

This case additionally highlights the risks attaching to the use of civilian volunteers in a quasi-police function. Notwithstanding the official denials that guards were used outside their own villages, it has been established in this case that guards were used regularly on a variety of official operations, including the apprehension of suspects. According to the regulations provided by the Government, village guards were hierarchically subordinate to the district gendarme commander. However, it is not apparent what supervision was, or could be exerted over guards who were engaged in duties outside the jurisdiction of the district gendarme commander. Nor, as the village guards were outside the normal structure of discipline and training applicable to gendarmes and police officers, is it apparent what safeguards there were against wilful or unintentional abuses of position carried out by the village guards either on their own initiative or under the instructions of security officers who themselves were acting outside the law.",

The Court has rightly stressed on each occasion that the main thing is the criminal remedy. On this occasion the criminal remedy worked, but the Court does not find it satisfactory or adequate.
