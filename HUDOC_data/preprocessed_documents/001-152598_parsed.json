Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body before they have had the opportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems (see, for example, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999V). Under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, an applicant should have normal recourse to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the alleged breaches. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.

Russia, no. 21519/02, \u00a7 151, 5 February 2009; Schwabe and M.G. v. Germany, nos. 8080/08 and 8577/08, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2011 (extracts); and Raudevs v. Latvia, no. 24086/03, \u00a7 62, 17 December 2013). Paragraph\u00a01 of Article 5 of the Convention covers the former and paragraph\u00a05 of Article\u00a05 the latter. Moreover, being a remedy of purely compensatory nature, a civil action for damages cannot secure the applicant\u2019s release if his confinement is unlawful, as required by Article 5 \u00a7\u00a04 (see Weeks v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 61, Series A no.\u00a0114, and, more recently, Aden Ahmed v. Malta, no. 55352/12, \u00a7 114, 23\u00a0July 2013 and the references cited therein). Accordingly, a civil action for damages would normally have no bearing on the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of an applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see L.M. v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 32863/05, \u00a7 84, 12 June 2014). There might be exceptions to this rule. Thus, complaints about short periods of detention or certain kinds of non-compliance with the formalities of the domestic law in exercising detention procedures may be adequately protected by recourse to a retrospective remedy (see M. v. Ukraine, no.\u00a02452/04, \u00a7\u00a084, 19\u00a0April 2012).",

Nor were there any mechanisms in place for him to seek his release from the psychiatric hospital. Accordingly, the applicant had no preventive remedies to exhaust. He did, however, try to seek redress retrospectively, after his discharge from the psychiatric hospital, and instituted several sets of administrative and civil proceedings in respect of his confinement there. The Court observes that none of those proceedings were completed by a final judicial decision adjudicating his claim on the merits. The first question to be answered is whether the above-mentioned proceedings can be regarded as an effective domestic remedy in the circumstances of the present case.

In the latter respect the Court reiterates that, according to its established case-law, an individual cannot be considered to be of \u201cunsound mind\u201d and deprived of his liberty unless the following three minimum conditions are satisfied: firstly, he must reliably be shown by objective medical expertise to be of unsound mind; secondly, the mental disorder must be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement; and thirdly, the validity of continued confinement depends on the persistence of such a disorder (see Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, \u00a7 39, Series A no. 33).",

This rule is applicable even if the purpose of an applicant\u2019s detention is precisely to obtain a medical opinion (see Varbanov v. Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 47 and 48). The particular form and procedure in this respect may vary depending on the circumstances. It may be acceptable, in urgent cases or where a person has been arrested because of his violent behaviour, for such an opinion to be obtained immediately after the arrest. In all other cases a prior consultation is necessary. Where no other possibility exists, for instance due to a refusal of the person concerned to appear for an examination, at least an assessment by a medical expert on the basis of the file must be sought, failing which it cannot be maintained that the person has reliably been shown to be of unsound mind (ibid.).",
