In particular, he alleged that the judges sitting in his cases had lacked impartiality and had not been independent. He further complained that the Supreme Court had refused to consider his cassation appeals against the procedural decisions given by the lower courts. He complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 about the outcome of the proceedings concerning compensation. He further complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that his efforts to institute criminal proceedings against the judge had been to no avail.
