On 2 July 2012 the Cerknica Centre enquired with the applicant as to whether she wanted another contact session to be arranged, but she declined, referring to her poor \u201cstate\u201d. As further noted in the Cerknica Centre\u2019s records, the applicant confirmed that she was aware that the Cerknica Centre would organise another session as soon as possible if she so wished. Following a request by the applicant of 4 July 2012, the fourth contact session took place on 11 July 2012. A social worker from the Kranj Social Work Centre who was supervising the contact session noted in her report that the applicant was tired during the contact session and stopped playing with E. after a couple of minutes. The contact session scheduled for 26 September 2012 was cancelled due to the applicant\u2019s illness.",

Following a request made by the applicant at the IPT meeting in February 2014 for help in establishing her relationship with E., the social worker and the foster parents offered her help with regard to future contact sessions and encouraged her to engage more actively in establishing the relationship.

According to Dr\u00a0M., the applicant\u2019s lack of a realistic understanding of her illness, her negative attitude towards treatment, and her abandonment of E. were all the results of her mental illness.

In particular, it was noted that, notwithstanding the episodes of remission, schizophrenia, like some other mental illnesses, led gradually to a permanent deterioration in a person\u2019s capacities, and such a process would occur despite the applicant\u2019s medical treatment.

According to him, the applicant\u2019s understanding and awareness of the child\u2019s needs had been reduced to an understanding and awareness of her primarily physiological needs. The applicant did not understand the parental role and was unable to see the child as an individual with her own needs and desires. He found that the applicant was properly equipped intellectually, but had emotional problems such as diminished empathy. In his opinion, at that time the applicant was not able to care for or bring up E., and was not a suitable person to do so because she could not be expected to provide a stable environment for the child. He also noted that she had not expressed a wish to have custody of E., but had expressed her desire to have more frequent contact with her. Dr P. found E. lively, communicative and cordial, but restrained in relation to the applicant. The expert concluded that contact with the mother was burdensome and forced upon E.

The court found, on the basis of the new expert opinions (see paragraphs 41 and 42 above), that the applicant had suffered from paranoid schizophrenia for many years before its critical manifestation. It further reasoned that the consequences of the disease in the applicant were a non-critical attitude to the illness, and as a result the applicant was not able to understand her health problems, their seriousness, or the importance of treatment. Equally, her neglectful conduct in relation to E. when she had left her did not reflect the true will and conscious action of the applicant. The court weighed the interests of the child against those of the applicant. It noted that, in the absence of any realistic possibility of the applicant resuming care of the child, it was more appropriate to withdraw her parental rights and provide the child with a substitute family for permanent care and emotional stability. Having regard in particular to the abovementioned expert opinions, the court concluded that the applicant should be divested of her parental rights. It based the conclusion on the fact that she suffered from paranoid schizophrenia which, though controllable, was incurable, could possibly worsen, and would in any event lead to negative personality changes. The court also had regard to fact that the applicant had four children but all the children were cared for by other foster or adoptive parents, and she had spent only a month with E., whereas E. had spent most of her life with the foster family, in an environment where she could be provided with permanent care and emotional stability, something which could not be provided by her mother.",

It held that the fact that her actions had not been deliberate could not be a crucial factor in a decision under section 116 of the Family Act. The main criterion for a decision was the child\u2019s best interests. The court further found that the reason behind the withdrawal of the applicant\u2019s parental rights was the fact that there was no prospect that the family would ever be reunited. During the remission stage of her illness, the applicant could function in her daily life, but she could not take care of her daughter either at that time or in the future. In this connection, the court found that the applicant lacked empathy, did not understand her parental responsibilities, and had been mostly passive during the contact sessions with E. The court noted that the applicant had not abused her contact rights, but had failed to establish proper communication with E., and consequently a basic parent-child relationship. The court rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that E. should remain in foster care, finding that this was only a temporary measure intended to enable parents to exercise their parental responsibilities pending their children being returned to them. Since reunification of the applicant\u2019s family was not likely to happen, protection of the child\u2019s best interests required a more lasting measure aimed at ensuring permanent care and emotional stability for the child. The court concluded that \u201cwhen balancing the child\u2019s interests against the mother\u2019s rights, it was not possible to give priority to the mother\u2019s interest in maintaining her parental rights\u201d.",

She disputed the lower court\u2019s findings concerning the poor quality of the contact she had had with E., and argued that depriving her of her parental rights was unjustified because she had not posed any danger to E., and the court\u2019s preference for adoption over fostering in cases such as hers violated the biological parents\u2019 rights. In her opinion, the lower court\u2019s position implied that people with incurable mental illnesses who presented no danger to their children could not have parental rights just because they were unable to take proper care of their children. She also argued that the concept of proper care had not been defined by any of the lower courts. Furthermore, she pointed out that she wished to maintain contact with E., but had been unable to do so since the Koper Higher Court\u2019s judgment of 21\u00a0October 2014.",

It found that the lower court\u2019s arguments relating to the applicant\u2019s permanent inability to take care of E., the absence of a family bond between her and E., her inability to establish a relationship with E. during the contact sessions, and the benefits of providing E. with a substitute family for permanent care and emotional stability, justified the withdrawal of her parental rights in the child\u2019s best interests. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s opinion, when weighing the child\u2019s interests against the mother\u2019s rights, the interests which should prevail were E.\u2019s interests in her permanent and stable care and upbringing. As regards the applicant\u2019s argument concerning discrimination against mentally ill people, the Constitutional Court found that the withdrawal of her parental rights had not been based on the fact that she suffered from mental illness, but on the fact that she had been permanently incapable of taking care of E. and the finding that there was no prospect that the family would ever be reunited. It was for domestic courts to protect the child\u2019s interests in the most appropriate way. In E.\u2019s case, they had decided that this was possible only by ensuring a permanent and stable substitute family environment. Moreover, the Constitutional Court upheld the Koper Higher Court\u2019s finding that section 116 of the Family Act could be applied to the present case despite the applicant lacking intent as regards her actions threatening E. (see paragraph 45 above). It considered that the Koper Higher Court\u2019s interpretation of the scope of the application of section 116 complied with Article 54 (1) of the Constitution, which provided that parents could be divested of their parental responsibility or have that responsibility limited only on the grounds provided for by law in order to protect a child\u2019s interests. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, that provision did not imply that the State was to protect the child\u2019s interests only when he or she was threatened by the deliberate actions or omissions of his or her parents. The Constitutional Court\u2019s decision was served on the applicant\u2019s representative on 12 January 2016.",

In Dr Z.\u2019s opinion, E.\u2019s contact with someone like the applicant, who did not understand and was not able to react to the child, would be unpleasant, painful and burdensome.

Dr Z. also emphasised the relevance of the applicant\u2019s negative attitude towards E.\u2019s adoptive parents, which could be harmful to E. She observed that, in the past, E.\u2019s adoptive parents had encouraged E.\u2019s contact with the applicant and had not acted as her competition.

It firstly observed that E. had been adopted after the contact proceedings had been initiated (see paragraph\u00a050 above). Consequently, the social work centres had stopped playing a role in arranging the contact, and the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s application in so far as it was directed against them, without any further examination. Furthermore, the adoption had resulted in a different legal basis which the court had to apply in determining contact between the applicant and E. In particular, since the applicant was no longer considered to be E.\u2019s parent, the relevant provision for the regulation of contact became section 106.a of the Family Act, which regulated a child\u2019s contact with people who were not his or her parents (see paragraph 60 below). The court held that it would allow contact between E. and the applicant if it established on a cumulative basis that E. was personally attached to the applicant, had a family-type relationship with her, and that the contact was in E.\u2019s interests.

It is emphasised that when there is no realistic chance that the parents will resume responsibility for the care and upbringing of the child, and the child is, due to the long-term substitute care, attached to the foster parents, the competent authorities should ensure that this relationship becomes permanent, to protect the child\u2019s well-being.

(see paragraph 9 above), but she had refused this and subsequently changed her place of residence, her gynaecologist and the hospital dealing with her pregnancy, and had thereby avoided getting the necessary psychiatric help. The social services, which had initially been unaware of her mental health diagnosis, had been involved in the situation from the beginning, firstly trying to find accommodation for the applicant and E. They had also arranged for home assistance and assistance from the psychiatric hospital, and had later taken E. into foster care and organised contact. The Government drew attention to the fact that from March 2011 until August 2012 the applicant had suffered from positive symptoms of her illness (changes in her behaviour and thoughts), had been hospitalised on four occasions, and had been travelling between Slovenia and France, which, in their view, had made it particularly difficult for the social services to work on the reunification of the family. Only one contact session had taken place during this period, in July 2011 (see paragraph 24 above), when E. had been seven months old and already attached to her foster parents. The Government also argued that contact sessions with E. had been organised every time the applicant had asked for them, and had also continued after the withdrawal of her parental rights. The applicant\u2019s wish to have her relatives present at the contact arrangements had also been accommodated, but this had not led to any improvement in the relationship between her and E.",

However, stricter scrutiny is called for as regards any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by those authorities on parental rights of contact, and as regards any legal safeguards designed to secure the effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between a young child and one or both parents would be effectively curtailed (see Sahin v.

The positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible will begin to weigh on the competent authorities with progressively increasing force as from the commencement of the period of care, subject always to its being balanced against the duty to consider the best interests of the child (see K.\u00a0and T. v.

Norway, no. 52502/07, \u00a7 66, 28 October 2010). However, Article 8 does not require that domestic authorities make endless attempts at family reunification; it only requires that they take all the necessary steps that can reasonably be demanded to facilitate the reunion of the child and his or her parents. Equally, when a considerable period of time has passed since a child was originally taken into public care, the interest of a child not to have his or her de facto family situation changed again may override the interests of the parents to have their family reunited (see R. and H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 35348/06, \u00a7 88, 31 May 2011, and K. and T. v.\u00a0Finland, cited above, \u00a7 155).

(see paragraphs 11 to 14 above) and her departure for France (see paragraph\u00a015 above), the Court finds nothing to indicate that the Cerknica Centre exercised its discretion improperly by promptly searching for suitable long-term care, or that its concerns for E. were not genuine or reasonable. While it is true that it initiated the proceedings to withdraw the applicant\u2019s parental rights on 7 March 2011, just two months after E.\u2019s birth (see paragraph 35 above), the Court cannot ignore the fact that the mere initiation of those proceedings did not have legal consequences for the applicant. In fact, she maintained contact with E. through contact sessions until November 2014 and took part in the IPT group, whose purpose was to monitor the foster care and organise contact sessions between the applicant and E.

The domestic courts dismissed her application for contact after obtaining, inter alia, a report from a court-appointed expert who had examined the applicant and E. and concluded that, due to the applicant\u2019s psychological problems, such as emotional unresponsiveness and a lack of empathy, and her negative attitude towards the adoptive parents, contact would be traumatic and harmful for E.

Finding no realistic possibility of the applicant resuming care of E., and taking into account the negative impact that the contact sessions had on E. and the lack of an emotional connection between them, the domestic courts considered it in E.\u2019s best interests to withdraw the applicant\u2019s parental rights (see paragraphs 43, 45 and 48 above). Those decisions were based on, inter alia, the reports of the court-appointed experts who had examined the applicant and established that she was not in a position to take care of E. In particular, the expert in psychiatry noted that, despite treatment, the applicant would not be able to assume care of E. (see paragraph 41 above). The expert psychologist found that she had diminished empathy, that her understanding of the child\u2019s needs was limited, that the contact was burdensome for E., and that there was no emotional connection between the applicant and E. (see paragraph 42 above). Having regard to the above and the information in the case file, including the Cerknica Centre\u2019s reports and records highlighting the difficulties encountered in trying to assist the applicant and the lack of any significant progress made in establishing ties between the applicant and E. (see paragraph 27 above), the Court does not consider unreasonable the domestic courts\u2019 conclusion that the withdrawal of the applicant\u2019s parental rights was in E.\u2019s best interests.",

Croatia, no.\u00a037956/11, \u00a7\u00a075, 8 January 2013, and X v. Croatia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05153). As regards the consequence of withdrawing the applicant\u2019s parental rights, namely the adoption of E. (see paragraph 68 above), the Court notes that although section 116(2) of the Family Act provided for the possibility to restore parental rights following their withdrawal, section 141 of the Family Act clearly provided that a child could be placed for adoption without the parent\u2019s consent if the latter had been deprived of his or her parental rights (see paragraph 60 above). An earlier Supreme Court decision (see paragraph 62 above), and the reasons given in the Ljubljana District Court\u2019s decision (see paragraph 43 above) clearly indicate that the aim of the proceedings to withdraw parental rights was to provide permanent substitute care for the child, when such care could not be provided in the biological family. The applicant must therefore have been aware of the consequences of the withdrawal of her parental rights, that is E. being made available for a possible adoption, and in fact she does not allege otherwise (see, for instance, the applicant\u2019s reply to the Cerknica Centre\u2019s application in which she argued that the aim of the proceedings was to give E. up for adoption \u2013 paragraph 36 above).",

It notes that it has previously examined applications concerning restrictions on the parental rights of a biological parent with a psychiatric condition, and its assessment was, as in all child-related cases, guided by the child\u2019s best interests (see K. and T. v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0173). In Kocherov and Sergeyeva (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 109-112), for instance, the Court found that the domestic court\u2019s reference to the first applicant\u2019s diagnosis was not a \u201csufficient\u201d reason to justify a restriction on his parental authority, because the domestic courts had not indicated what evidence the first applicant was requested to produce in order to show that his diagnosis would not put the second applicant, his child, at risk. Moreover, the first applicant produced before the domestic courts a report by a panel of experts which unequivocally concluded that his state of health fully allowed him to exercise his parental authority. Similarly, in S.H. v. Italy (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a015, 16, 19, 56 and 57) the Court found a violation of Article 8 because the judicial authorities had allowed the child\u2019s adoption but failed to consider that the family\u2019s difficulties, which partly related to the applicant\u2019s state of mental health, could be overcome by means of targeted social assistance, as found in the expert report produced in the proceedings. In the present case, however, the Ljubljana District Court\u2019s decision to divest the applicant of her parental rights was not based on her psychiatric diagnosis, but on her consequent inability to take care of E., which had been confirmed by all the expert reports produced in the proceedings. The Ljubljana District Court, following the remittal of the case in relation to precisely that point (see paragraph 39 above), acknowledged the fact that the applicant\u2019s problematic behaviour and neglectful conduct in relation to E. was caused by her mental illness. Nevertheless, balancing the competing interests, it concluded that E.\u2019s interest in being provided with permanent care and emotional stability outweighed that of the applicant in retaining legal ties with E.

The Court has previously held that a finding to that effect has to have implications for the degree of protection that ought to be afforded to an applicant\u2019s right to respect for family life when assessing the necessity of an interference (see Aune, cited above, \u00a7 69).",

As regards the applicant\u2019s argument that the foster care could be prolonged, possibly until adulthood (see paragraph 70 above), the Court agrees with the domestic authorities (see, for example, paragraphs 32 and 45 above) that care orders are by their very nature meant to be temporary measures aimed at family reunification (see K. and T. v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7 178). Even in a situation where reunification might be possible at some point in the future, the interest of a child not to have his or her de facto family situation changed after a considerable period of time may override the interests of the parents in having their family reunited (see the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a086 above). By the same token, in view of there being little or no prospect of the biological family\u2019s reunification, the Court considers that E.\u2019s interest in fully integrating into her de facto family weighed particularly heavily in the balance when assessed against the applicant\u2019s wish to retain legal ties with her.",

In particular, the domestic courts acknowledged that, despite the adoption, the applicant could in principle maintain contact with E. under section 106.a of the Family Act (see paragraphs 55, 57 and 60 above), provided that they were personally attached and that the contact would be in E.\u2019s interests. The Court notes that after obtaining the opinion of a court-appointed expert who concluded that E.\u2019s contact with the applicant would be harmful to E., and taking into account the observations of the social worker who had supervised the contact sessions, the Koper District Court concluded that there was no personal connection between E. and the applicant and that contact would not be in E.\u2019s interests \u2013 a finding which was upheld on appeal (see paragraphs 53, 55 and 57 above).

This approach by the Court, which is a well-established standard in the case-law regarding cases of serious interference in the family life of vulnerable parents (where parents are, for example, in harsh socio-economic situations, possibly combined with ethnic origin, have a mild mental disability, intellectual deficiencies or another type of illness accompanied by psychological trauma) corresponds, in my opinion, to the broad consensus among the Contracting States concerning their obligations to provide appropriate and effective assistance in terms of the \u201cspecific measures\u201d which are a necessary adjustment to accelerate or achieve de facto equality of persons with disabilities, while not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden as this is regulated under the CRPD.

During these three weeks the applicant was provided with various forms of social assistance and the services of an employee from a psychiatric hospital. She was referred for an emergency examination by a clinical psychologist, which she declined. In view of these measures by the Cerknica SWC, the majority is satisfied that the authorities responded promptly to the applicant\u2019s difficulties and that there is no indication that they failed to take the necessary measures to assist her prior to her departure for France (on 30\u00a0January 2011), and that, once the applicant had left, the authorities had no choice but to place E. in care.",

Nevertheless, even for this period, I think it needs to be added in more specific terms that the afore-mentioned special measures \u2013 in the sense of increased protection \u2013 included the activities of the Cerknica SWC, which found the option of placing the applicant and the newborn baby in a Crisis Centre in Piran. This was ultimately not a suitable solution. For that reason, and based on an arrangement between the Cerknica\u00a0SWC and the maternity hospital, the applicant was allowed to stay in the maternity hospital until January 2011. The Cerknica SWC then reached an agreement with the applicant\u2019s mother, so that the applicant and her child could stay at the home of the applicant\u2019s mother for three weeks. The Cerknica SWC then helped the applicant to complete the application forms for obtaining parental allowance and childbirth benefit. Via the diplomatic-consular mission, the Cerknica SWC sought the view of the applicant\u2019s husband and father of E. on how he intended to take care of the newborn child. The father\u2019s answer did not help to resolve the situation in any sense, in that he expressed doubts about his fatherhood of E. In this early period, the Cerknica SWC provided the applicant and her child with social assistance in the form of family help at home, which included the possibility of participating in the Tamala association, the community nursing service, where social worker R.V., who knew the applicant\u2019s family history, was employed; in addition, a mobile worker from the Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital was engaged. The Cerknica SWC also wrote the application for admission to the Gorenjska Maternity Home on the applicant\u2019s behalf, because the applicant had failed to do so and the period of agreed accommodation with her mother was running out. The mobile worker who was monitoring the applicant informed two psychiatrists from the Ljubljana Psychiatric Clinics about her mental state. The applicant was offered the possibility of emergency psychological care. The community nursing service sent reports about events in the family to the Cerknica SWC. On 31\u00a0January 2011 the Cerknica SWC was informed that the applicant had gone to France to see her husband and had left E. with the child\u2019s grandmother. Taking into account these facts, which were not disputed in concrete terms by the applicant, I agree with the majority that the welfare authorities showed particular care and afforded to the applicant the necessary increased protection in the period before initiating the proceedings for the withdrawal of parental rights on 7 or 8 March 2011.",

In principle, this act by the welfare authorities and their active role in the court proceedings for withdrawal of parental rights could decisively jeopardise the State\u2019s obligations to put in place special measures and increased protection as regards the family life of the applicant and her child. Concerning this problematic issue, the majority\u2019s reasoning first relies on the \u201cmeasure of discretion\u201d enjoyed by the welfare authorities in searching for suitable long-term care, given the complex family situation and the fact that they are in direct contact with the family. I do not consider that a \u201cmeasure of discretion\u201d at that stage of the process could be an argument to justify early initiation of the proceedings to withdraw parental rights. Two months after the child\u2019s birth and without having at that stage any expert evidence on the (medical) nature of the applicant\u2019s vulnerability nor any other evidence on the prospects of her ability to care for the child in the (near) future, and although aware of her serious psychological problems, the welfare authorities still had an obligation to respect the Convention standards concerning special measures and increased protection for a vulnerable parent and her child, as long as these measures were not disproportionate or did not cause an undue burden in the light of the child\u2019s best interests.",

The majority also took into consideration that, prior to January 2014, the applicant was never refused contact with E; the welfare authorities offered help and counselling on their own motion; the judgment adds that although the sessions often seemed not to help the applicant and her child to form a bond, this was mostly due to the applicant\u2019s passive attitude and E.\u2019s estrangement from her.",

If contacts were merely \u201corganised\u201d by the welfare authority, this could only - given the applicant\u2019s real disability - lead to additional evidence that contacts were not in line with the child\u2019s best interests and, therefore, could only support the pending application for withdrawal of parental rights. Instead, from the Government\u2019s Observations it can be concluded that the contacts were prepared in advance and actively facilitated by the IPT.

After the IPT\u2019s preparatory meeting, the seventeenth contact session took place on 26\u00a0November 2014; however, it was reported that the applicant failed to establish contact with her daughter. The applicant continued to ask for contact sessions (for example, on 22\u00a0December 2014) despite the fact that on 21 October 2014 the court decision on withdrawal of the applicant\u2019s parental rights became final. From that point, the Cerknica SWC instructed the applicant that she had to apply to a competent court in order for decisions to be made on any potential further contact sessions. The applicant had access to a lawyer at that point.",

Generally, the test of arbitrariness is used by the Court when, for example, an applicant claims under Article 6 of the Convention that the national courts wrongly interpreted domestic law. However, if the issue at stake before the Court is a legal concept which is integral to the Convention, as is the case with the principle of the best interests of a child under Article 8 of the Convention, the applicable judicial test is not limited to checks on arbitrariness or unreasonableness. For example, in the present judgment the arbitrariness test was applied in relation to the question whether the domestic courts interpreted section\u00a0116 of the Marriage and Family Relations Act in accordance with the Convention standards on the rule of law.",

Instead, as the Court itself defines \u201cgeneral principles\u201d in relation to the examination of the necessity of interference in a democratic society in section B.3.(c) of the judgment, the judicial test that was actually applied in this case was much more stringent. In the words of the Court in section B.3.(c.), a measure such as withdrawal of parental rights should be applied only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and could only be justified if motivated by an \u201coverriding requirement\u201d pertaining to the child\u2019s best interests. When the Court in paragraph 87 cites its own previous judgment in the case of Y.C. v. the United Kingdom (no. 4547/10, 13 March 2012), it reiterates that it is \u201cincumbent upon the Court to ascertain whether the domestic courts conducted an in-depth examination of the entire family situation and of a whole series of factors, in particular of a factual, emotional, psychological, material and medical nature, and made a balanced and reasonable assessment of the respective interests of each person, with a constant concern for determining what would be the best solution for the child.\u201d Therefore, the strict scrutiny test when examining the withdrawal of parental rights from a person with a disability, usually an irreversible step, calls for protection which goes beyond the usual assessment of the impact of the proposed care measure on the parents and child, and the usual check of whether there was a sufficient evidentiary basis, whether reasons were relevant and sufficient, whether parents had sufficient opportunity to participate in the procedure and whether the children themselves were able to express their views.",
