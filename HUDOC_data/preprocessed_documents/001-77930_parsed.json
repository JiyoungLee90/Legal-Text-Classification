For the rest, it dismissed the applicant company's plea and confirmed the 's judgment. It held that the publisher's liability under section\u00a035 of the Media Act was linked to a media offence, which could be committed not only by an employee of a media company but also by a third person. The commission of such an offence fell within the sphere of risk of a publisher who printed a defamatory statement in its newspaper. Its subsequent liability was based on considerations of causality and did not imply any finding of guilt. The court found that the legislator's choice in favour of the joint and several liability of the publisher reflected the balance struck between the interests involved, namely the interest of the media to exercise the right to freedom of expression, on the one hand, and, on the other, that of the person desirous of protecting his/her reputation, in favour of the interest of the defamed victim to secure financially the proceedings instituted to obtain legal redress. The publisher's strict liability was in line with its obligation to publish the judgment in its newspaper.",

Finland, no.\u00a053678/00, \u00a7\u00a049, ECHR 2004..., with further references). In the present case, the court of first instance found the applicant company jointly and severally liable for the fine and the costs of proceedings which a defamer, whose statements had been printed in one of the applicant company's issues, had been sentenced to pay. However, the applicant company's liability for the fine actually did not eventuate, as the fine, subsequently suspended by the second-instance court for a three-year probationary period, never fell due. The Court, therefore, does not find it necessary to pursue the applicant company's complaint about the fine itself. It will, however, examine under Article 10 of the Convention the applicant company's complaint about liability for the costs of the defamation proceedings. In this connection the Court will take account of the fact that the applicant company was actually called upon to pay the full costs and, in subsequent proceedings for reimbursement brought against the defamer, granted reimbursement of only half of the amount.",

According to the Government, the provision at issue was part of an overall concept under the Austrian Media Act concerning duties and responsibilities of media owners resulting from the connection between the liability of media owners for defamation offences committed in their medium, on the one hand, and, on the other, from the duty to publish the court's decision (section\u00a034) and the right to make a counter-statement (section\u00a013). The Government also endorsed the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, laying down the arguments of shared responsibility of the media owner irrespective of the question of guilt, and carefully weighing it against the protection of the victim of a media offence. Without such shared financial responsibility, a victim, who had no influence on the issue of what and whose statements were published in the medium, would run the risk of not recovering the procedural costs after winning a case. Also, a victim's right to protection of their honour would be impaired if, for economic considerations, he/she had to renounce the enforcement of the right to private prosecution because the incriminated statement was made by a destitute author. In the present case, the applicant company had been free to report on the two private prosecutors and their experiences in . Neither was the author who had written up the article held responsible under criminal law nor was the applicant company sentenced to pay damages. Considering the financial benefit it had achieved from the publication of the impugned statement with an eye-catching title and that the applicant company's newspaper had the highest circulation in , the measures corresponded to a \u201cpressing social need\u201d and constituted the least severe means to require media owners to take over some responsibility for media offences.",

It pointed out that it did not deny its liability for media offences as such, but was limiting its complaint to the specific circumstances under section\u00a035 of the Media, which provided liability merely on account of the publication of a defamatory quotation by a third person regardless of any negligence on the part of the publisher. The applicant company further disputed the Government's argument that the joint and several liability served the protection of the victim's interests. Since the fine imposed on the defamer had to be paid to the State, it rather served the interests of the latter. In addition, the involvement of the media owner in the defamation proceedings entailed the risk of doubling the costs in case of loss of the lawsuit by the private prosecutor. There were more efficient solutions to diminish a private prosecutor's risk to bear the costs of the proceedings, namely by paying such costs from the amount of the fine imposed.",

It notes in this regard that the defamation offence at issue could only be committed via publication in the applicant company's newspaper. Therefore, the legislator's choice to shift the defamed persons' risk to obtain redress for defamation proceeding to the media company, usually in a better financial position than the defamer, does, as such, not appear as an disproportionate interference with the applicant company's right to freedom of expression.",

Norway, no. 26132/95, \u00a7\u00a057, ECHR 2000IV). Punishment for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to the discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so (Thoma v.
