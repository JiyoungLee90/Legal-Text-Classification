The preliminary pleas had been decided on 21 February 1991 and the judgment on the merits had been delivered only one and a half years after the date on which the case was ready for decision. Moreover, the  had waited four months for the parties to submit their observations. It was true that the proceedings before the Court of Appeal had lasted a longer time. The fixing of the date of the first sitting had taken three years and a decision on the merits of the case had not been given until five years later. However, the reasonableness of this delay had to be examined in the context of the national judicial system, in which, unlike in other countries, the right of appeal was automatic. Every litigant who felt aggrieved by a decision given at first instance could lodge an appeal without having to apply for leave to do so. This obliged the Court of Appeal to examine a large number of cases in detail, bearing in mind that its decision would be the final one, and would therefore not be subject to review by any superior authority. The expenses for bringing an appeal were also relatively low, which constituted another factor encouraging citizens to bring their cases before the Court of Appeal. In the \u2019s view, the obligation of the State to organise its judicial system with a view to complying with the \u201creasonable-time\u201d principle was to be balanced against the other privileges that the Maltese system provided to its citizens.",

Regarding violations of the reasonable-time requirement, one of the characteristics of sufficient redress which may remove a litigant\u2019s victim status relates to the amount awarded as a result of using the domestic remedy. The Court has already had occasion to indicate that an applicant\u2019s victim status may depend on the level of compensation awarded at domestic level on the basis of the facts about which he or she complains before the Court (Scordino v.

Remedies available to a litigant at domestic level for raising a complaint about the length of proceedings are \u201ceffective\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention if they prevent the alleged violation or its continuation, or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred (see Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, \u00a7 17, ECHR\u00a02002-VIII; Scordino, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 186-188; and S\u00fcrmeli v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 75529/01, \u00a7 99, 8 June 2006). Lastly, the Court reiterates that the effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant (see S\u00fcrmeli, cited above, \u00a7 98) and that the mere fact that an applicant\u2019s claim fails is not in itself sufficient to render the remedy ineffective (see Amann v.\u00a0Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, \u00a7\u00a7 88-89, ECHR 2002-II).",
