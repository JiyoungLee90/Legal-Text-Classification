Among this documentary evidence, an important role in the prosecution\u2019s submissions was given to three audit reports of 27 June, 11 August and 18 December 2006 concerning the \u201caudit of the financial and economic activities of the Ministries of Health Care and Economic Development\u201d, prepared by a number of employees (sometimes referred to as \u201cexperts\u201d in the relevant court documents) of the Ministry of Finance, the Chamber of Auditors and other State agencies, pursuant to a decision of the Nasimi District Court of 29 November 2005. In sum, these reports concluded that, despite the fact that the State privatisation programme allowed privatisation of State health care facilities only by a decision of the President of the Republic, the applicant had exceeded and abused his official powers and, together with \u201cother persons\u201d, had unlawfully issued instructions and otherwise created conditions for unlawful privatisation of a large number of State-owned health care facilities, plots of land, and other assets. Furthermore, the reports also found that there had been a number of breaches of accounting requirements, instances of mismanagement of State budgetary resources allocated to the Ministry of Health Care, undocumented or improperly documented use of large amounts of money, and so on. It appears that these three reports were among the most decisive pieces of evidence on which the applicant\u2019s eventual conviction was based.

Only these agencies had the authority to dispose of State property. As such, these State agencies had ultimately carried out and approved the sale and privatisation of the assets in question, and officials of these agencies had signed the relevant final acts. The applicant further argued that his role (as Minister of Health Care and Chairman of the State Commission on Reforms in the Health Care System) in the privatisation procedure was limited to merely submitting proposals to the President and the Cabinet of Ministers for items to be included in lists of various assets suggested for privatisation, as well as giving his confirmation to the Ministry of Economic Development on a case-by-case basis that he did not object to the privatisation of specific State-owned facilities which were on the books of the Ministry of Health Care. Therefore, even if the relevant assets had been privatised unlawfully, he could not be held responsible for it, and the officials of the State Committee for Management of State Property and the Ministry of Economic Development were responsible for the entire privatisation process and for any failure to detect abuse or unlawfulness. For these reasons, the applicant repeatedly insisted in his submissions that the court summon and examine as witnesses the Chairman of the State Committee for Management of State Property and the former Minister of Economic Development (the former Minister of Economic Development, Mr Farhad Aliyev, was tried and convicted in separate criminal proceedings at around the same time in connection with, inter alia, charges of alleged corruption and a number of abuses of official power).",

Where the cell accommodated not so many detainees but was rather small in overall size, the Court noted that, deduction being made of the room occupied by bunk beds, a table, and a cubicle in which a lavatory pan was placed, the remaining floor space was hardly sufficient even to pace out the cell (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 145 and 147, with further references to a number of the Court\u2019s relevant earlier judgments).

Lithuania, no.\u00a044558/98, \u00a7 107, ECHR 2001VIII; Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a030138/02, 16 September 2004; Solovyev v.

Having regard to the parties\u2019 submissions concerning personal space in the dormitory and the fact that the inmates in Penal Facility no. 13 have freedom of movement during the day, which compensate for the restricted space in the sleeping facilities inside the dormitory, the Court considers that it cannot be established that the level of alleged overcrowding in the applicant\u2019s dormitory, in itself, constitute illtreatment reaching the minimum level of severity under Article 3.

However, Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation) because in certain instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. A failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information without a satisfactory explanation may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations (see, among other authorities, Ahmet \u00d6zkan and Others v. , no. 21689/93, \u00a7 426, 6\u00a0April 2004, and Kokoshkina v. , no. 2052/08, \u00a7 59, 28 May 2009).

The small number of showers and toilets which did not always have running water caused the inmates difficulty in taking showers and often forced them to stand in long queues to use a toilet. In the Court\u2019s view, this situation could arouse in the applicant feelings of anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing him.",

The Court notes that, following the applicant\u2019s repeated complaints and requests for urgent interim measures, on 25 November 2008 the President of the Chamber decided, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, to request the respondent Government, inter alia, to transfer the applicant to a specialised medical facility and have him examined by a medical panel composed on a parity basis, with a view to establishing the gravity of his medical condition and prescribing necessary treatment (see paragraph 57 above). The respondent Government complied with the interim measures indicated. The applicant\u2019s complaints about various shortcomings in the medical assistance received and his assertion that he urgently needed surgery were not confirmed by the unanimous findings of the medical panel established on a parity basis, which included three doctors appointed by the applicant himself (see paragraph 60 above).",

Exceptions to this principle are possible, but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of proceedings (see, among many authorities, Isgr\u00f2 v. Italy, 19 February 1991, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 194A; L\u00fcdi v. Switzerland, 15 June 1992, \u00a7 47, Series A no. 238; Luc\u00e0 v.

There are two requirements which follow from the above general principle. The first, and preliminary, requirement is that there must be a good reason for the non-attendance of a witness (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 119-20, with further references). The second requirement is that, when a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the pre-trial stage or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (ibid. \u00a7\u00a7 119 and\u00a0143 et seq., with further references). Where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance in the case (ibid., \u00a7 147).",

The courts did not treat these simply as items of information, but to a large extent accepted the factual findings in those reports as true, and relied on those findings as established facts. The Court concludes that in the instant case the conclusions given by the employees of the Ministry of Finance, the Chamber of Auditors and other State agencies who had participated in the preparation of the reports of 27 June, 11 August and 18 December 2006 had a key role in the proceedings against the applicant in connection with the charges related to embezzlement by way of unlawful privatisation and abuse of official authority. Accordingly, whereas the applicant\u2019s conviction on those charges was based to a decisive degree on the conclusions of the authors of those reports, he should have had an adequate opportunity to challenge them as witnesses who had made statements against him. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the applicant expressed a wish to have them examined in open court and, if so, whether he had such an opportunity (compare, mutatis mutandis, Balsyt\u0117-Lideikien\u0117 v. , no. 72596/01, \u00a7\u00a7 62-66, 4 November 2008).",

On each occasion the  either refused those requests without reasoning, or deferred its decision on this matter until a later stage, explaining that the issue of necessity of inviting those witnesses for questioning could be decided only after the court had completed its examination of the evidence produced by the prosecution. In its response to the applicant\u2019s most recent request, of 30\u00a0March 2007, the Assize Court again postponed making a decision on this issue for an indefinite period of time, noting that it would decide whether it was necessary to have those witnesses examined at the court hearings only after the audit reports in question had been fully read out in the course of the subsequent hearings.

In both of the above-mentioned cases the confiscation orders were imposed in separate sentencing proceedings instituted after the proceedings resulting in the applicants\u2019 criminal conviction, unlike in the present case, where both the conviction and sentencing were decided by the trial court in the same proceedings. The Court notes that in the present case the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No.1 is essentially premised on the argument that the confiscation order had been wrongful because it had been imposed following a conviction in the criminal proceedings conducted in breach of Article 6.",

The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s assertion could be true if the criminal proceedings against him amounted to a flagrant denial of justice, that is, were manifestly contrary to the provisions of Article 6 or the principles embodied therein (see, mutatis mutandis, Stoichkov v. , no. 9808/02, \u00a7 51, 24 March 2005, and Tsonyo Tsonev v.  (no. 3), no. 21124/04, \u00a7 59, 16 October 2012, both cases assessing the compatibility with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the prison sentence imposed at the outcome of the proceedings conducted in breach of Article 6). This is a stringent test: a flagrant denial of justice goes beyond mere irregularities or lack of safeguards in trial procedures that result in a breach of Article 6 of the Convention. What is required is a breach of the principles of fair trial that is so fundamental as to amount to a nullification, or destruction of the very essence, of the right guaranteed by that Article (see Othman (Abu Qatada) v. the , no. 8139/09, \u00a7 260, 17 January 2012). Until now, the Court has found that a flagrant denial of justice has occurred or would occur only in certain very exceptional circumstances (see Othman (Abu Qatada), cited above, \u00a7 259, and Tsonyo Tsonev (no. 3), cited above, \u00a7 59, for references to specific cases, with relevant summaries, where the Court found such exceptional circumstances). This is not the case here. Although the proceedings against the applicant were not in conformity with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, the flaws that the Court found in them are not of such a nature as to render the entire trial so fundamentally unfair as to amount to a flagrant denial of justice. In these circumstances, the Court considers that it would be speculative to assume that, had the criminal proceedings complied with the relevant fair trial requirements, the applicant would not have been convicted of the criminal offences with which he had been charged.",

Bearing in mind the above, and having regard to the wide margin of appreciation enjoyed by States in pursuit of a policy on crime designed to combat the most serious crimes, the Court considers that the imposition of a confiscation order in the present case, in itself, was not disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",
