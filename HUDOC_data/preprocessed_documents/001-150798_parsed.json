Furthermore, they submitted that the scope of this right was not the same for prisoners as for other persons. In support of their assertion they cited situations where that right could, in their view, be restricted, and they stated that the authorities\u2019 refusal in the instant case to deliver the publications should be assessed in the light of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. The Government contended that such delivery could be subject to restrictions under the material conditions and according to the formalities prescribed by law. In the present case they considered that the restriction complained of had been lawful and that there had therefore been no violation of the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression. Finally, they stated that the restriction had had the further aim of preventing a terrorist organisation from acquiring supremacy in the prison through the intermediary of those publications, which had rendered the impugned decision necessary. The Government referred in that connection to the Erdem v.\u00a0Germany judgment (no.\u00a038321/97, ECHR\u00a02001VII) and the decision in the case of Fethi Oktay v.\u00a0Turkey ([dec.] no. 24803/05, 16\u00a0December 2008).",

In that regard, although the Government submitted that the publications had contained articles condoning a terrorist organisation and terrorist activities and damaging the reputation of Turkey and members of the law-enforcement agencies (see paragraphs\u00a097-98 above), which were the reasons why they had not been delivered, the Court notes that such a contention is absent from the reasons given for the decisions of the national authorities as examined under the present case. It further notes that in their observations, the Government made no mention whatever of the procedure for translating the publications at issue or of the responsibility for payment of the costs of translation.",

Italy, 15 November 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports 1996V). Law must be able to adapt to changing situations, and the Court accepts that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Silver and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 88, Series A no. 61).",

It further notes that the power of review granted by domestic law to the prison authorities regarding prisoner access to publications only concerned the content of the latter. In the present case those authorities reached a decision without prior assessment of the content of the publications at issue, thus exercising their discretion to deprive prisoners of access to category of publications which they might have liked to read. It transpires from the case file that the prison authorities\u2019 decisions not to deliver certain editions of the Azadiya Welat daily newspaper to the applicants were not based on any of the grounds listed in the relevant law.",
