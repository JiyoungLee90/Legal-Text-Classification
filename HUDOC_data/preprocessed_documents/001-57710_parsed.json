The aggravated fraud of which the accused was strongly suspected had resulted in a loss of more than 2,000,000 Austrian schillings. The file had become exceptionally voluminous on account of the large number of facts and of the contradictions in Mr Toth\u2019s statements and those of his co-accused. The most recent findings of the investigation, and the scope and complexity of the case, made it necessary to leave the prosecuting authorities sufficient time to prepare the indictment and, if necessary, the subsequent proceedings in the assize court. There were grounds for fearing that the accused would evade the trial and commit new offences. Finally, less stringent measures than detention were held to be inadequate.",

There were therefore numerous interruptions because the officers concerned relinquished the file, sometimes for quite long periods, to their colleagues (see paragraphs 20, 24, 28, 31, 39, 43-44, 46 and 48 above). Preferred to the use of copies, which is the practice in other member States of the Council of Europe, such toing and froing of the file occurred both before the indictment and after it (see, mutatis mutandis, the K\u00f6nig judgment of 28 June 1978, Series A no. 27, p. 36, para. 104).

This approach led the Commission to conclude not that he was dealing separately with two different types of proceedings before the Court of Appeal, but that he also complained of his not having been heard when his appeal was before the Court of Appeal. Furthermore, the letters of 5 December 1985 and 4 July 1986 must be viewed as a whole; and the latter was sent less than six months after 22 January 1986, the date on which the Court of Appeal ruled for the first time on an appeal by Mr Toth on his request to be released from detention (see paragraph 33 above).",

Apart from the automatic periodical reviews of the lawfulness of the continuation of detention on remand (Article 194 para. 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), the detainee may, at any time, request his release, which may be granted by the investigating judge with the consent of the prosecuting authority. Where the investigating judge rejects such a request or the prosecuting authority opposes it, an adversarial hearing is held before the Ratskammer to which the detainee (and his lawyer) and the public prosecutor are summoned and where the detainee and/or his lawyer have the possibility to make any submissions in support of the application for release, in other words to contest the investigating judge\u2019s decision to reject the application and/or the position taken by the public prosecutor. Where the decision of the Ratskammer goes against him, the detainee has in addition the right to submit a written appeal to the Court of Appeal. That court decides \"after hearing the submissions of the principal public prosecutor\u2019s office\", in other words after having given him the opportunity to make known - in writing or orally - his point of view. Furthermore, where the appeal (against a decision by the Ratskammer to release a detainee) has been lodged by the prosecuting authority, the detainee too has the possibility of putting forward his submissions provided that the prosecution submissions have been sufficiently brought to his notice - as the Court correctly noted in the Brandstetter judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no. 211, pp. 27-28, para. 67 (see nevertheless my dissenting opinion, which was joined by Judges Vilhj\u00e1lmsson and Bindschedler-Robert).

The purpose of the proceedings in question, as the Court observes, was to obtain a ruling of the Court of Appeal on a request from the investigating judge under Article 193 of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure for a prolongation of the permissible length of detention on remand and thereby to set the framework within which the investigating judge was then free, within the law, to take decisions as to the continued detention of the applicant. The effect of the proceedings was thus to make a decision as to an essential pre-condition, under Austrian law, of his continued detention. This being so, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) required that the applicant should be entitled to take proceedings to contest the \"lawfulness\" of his continued detention in this respect. But at no stage was this requirement satisfied. The applicant was not entitled to intervene in the proceedings before the Court of Appeal and to present his case for opposing the investigating judge\u2019s request and he had no right of appeal against the Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling.",

It is true that the applicant was able to, and did, take separate proceedings under Article 194 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to apply for his release but, as I understand the system, such application had to be made within the framework already established by the Court of Appeal\u2019s prolongation decision under Article 193 and that decision as such was not open to challenge in the proceedings concerning the application for release. What is more, it is apparent that the Court of Appeal in reaching its decision on prolongation took into account not only the complexity and scope of the case and the severity of the sentence risked but also other considerations including the danger of the accused absconding and committing new offences (see paragraphs 22, 26, 30 and 38 of the Court\u2019s judgment). The decision so arrived at could hardly fail to weigh against the applicant in the consideration of the merits of any application for release thereupon to the Ratskammer and in any ensuing appeal to the Court of Appeal. These considerations reinforce the view that Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) was applicable in respect of the prolongation proceedings.",
