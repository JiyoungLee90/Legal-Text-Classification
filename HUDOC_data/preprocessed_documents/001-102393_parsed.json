That case concerned a person who was arrested and transported to a hospital for a narcotic intoxication test without adequate documentation. The administrative courts then proceeded ex officio to question the police officers involved in the incident and, upon finding that a procedural violation had been committed, ordered the police to issue a written apology. The Government considered that the approach adopted by the administrative courts attested to their capacity to conduct an independent and impartial ex officio investigation into the wrongdoings of police officers, which in turn attested to the fact that administrative courts were to be considered an effective and available remedy which offered reasonable prospects of success in cases where it was not compulsory to provide a criminal-law remedy.",

As to which of the procedures should have been used, the applicant referred to the Court's earlier finding that \u201cit is for the individual to select which legal remedy to pursue\u201d (Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 23, Series A no. 32) and accordingly argued that he did not have an obligation to exhaust all available avenues of domestic remedies. In any event, according to the applicant, he had never been informed, either by the Prosecutor's Office or by the Ombudsman's Office, of the availability of administrative proceedings in his case. The applicant further focused on the requirement arising from the Court's case-law that in cases concerning a death in circumstances that might give rise to the State's responsibility the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention and that the next-of-kin could not be obliged to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (Branko Toma\u0161i\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 43). Lastly, the applicant argued that the administrative courts lacked the competence to evaluate the effectiveness of the investigation into the applicant's son's death, since that investigation fell within the realm of criminal law.",

In the context of the present case the Court has no reason to doubt that administrative courts are capable of carrying out an investigation either of their own volition or pursuant to a request by the parties. Nevertheless, the Government have failed to explain, and the example of the domestic case submitted does not clarify how an investigation carried out by administrative courts would be more pertinent than the one carried out by police and prosecutorial authorities within the context of criminal law procedures, which provide for all the legal and practical means necessary for that purpose.",

It has furthermore not been disputed that an adequately carried out criminal investigation could lead to a decision determining the individual responsibility of any State officials who might be held accountable for the applicant's son's death. None of the arguments advanced by the Government suggest that the administrative-law procedures would add anything to the possibilities offered by the criminal law. Even if the possibility of re-examination of the case is triggered by a an administrative act or a judgment awarding damages for a wrongdoing committed by a State institution, any individual responsibility of State officials could only be established following such re-examination, which can require additional investigation by several levels of domestic authorities.

However, even in such situations those concerned are entitled to an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to its effectiveness (see Mikayil Mammadov v. Azerbaijan, no. 4762/05, \u00a7\u00a0102, 17 December 2009, and the jurisprudence cited there). In this regard the Court would point out that this is not an obligation of result, but of means (see, among other authorities, Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2002II) and that Article 2 does not entail the right to have others prosecuted or sentenced for an offence, or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, or indeed in a particular sentence (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

In this respect the Court has previously held that an internal inquiry cannot be regarded as adequate in cases concerning allegations of ill-treatment in contravention of Article 3 of the Convention (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7\u00a7 333-341, ECHR 2007... with further references, Ja\u0161ar v. \u201cthe \u201d (dec.), no.\u00a069908/01, 11 April 2006, and Kopylov v. Russia, no. 3933/04, \u00a7 138, 29\u00a0July 2010). The Court considers that the same conclusion is applicable to complaints under Article 2 of the Convention. Furthermore, the Balvi District Police Department was the same institution which on four occasions decided to terminate the criminal proceedings regarding the events surrounding the death of Valdis Jasinskis (see above, paragraphs 20, 23, 25 and 28). The first time the investigation went outside the recursive route between the Balvi District Police Department and the Balvi District Public Prosecutor's Office was after the applicant's representative sought help from the Office of the Prosecutor General. As a result, the first time anyone outside the Balvi District had access to the case file was more than a year and a half after the applicant's son's death.",
