The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000VII; Rivas v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a059584/00, \u00a7\u00a038, 1\u00a0April 2004; Turan Cakir v.\u00a0Belgium, no.\u00a044256/06, \u00a7\u00a054, 10\u00a0March 2009; Mete and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a0294/08, \u00a7\u00a0112, 4\u00a0October 2011; and Tiziana\u00a0Pennino v. Italy, no. 21759/15, \u00a7\u00a035, 12 October 2017). In the absence of such an explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government (see, among other authorities, El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7\u00a0152, ECHR 2012, and Samesov v. Russia, no. 57269/14, \u00a7\u00a047, 20\u00a0November 2018). That is justified by the fact that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (see, Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7\u00a083, ECHR 2015).",

Otherwise, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would, despite its fundamental importance, be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (see Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 102, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII).

In this connection, the Court observes that the presence of injuries which, according to the applicant, had been inflicted by police officers was confirmed by the medical report of the doctor who had examined the applicant upon the latter\u2019s placement in Tbilisi prison no.\u00a05 on 15\u00a0February 2008, two days after his arrest (see paragraph 13 above). Their existence was never as such called into question (see paragraph\u00a051 above). The evidence available to the domestic authorities, including the statements of the police officers who had arrested the applicant, demonstrated that the applicant had not had those particular injuries before his arrest (see paragraphs 6-7, 18, and 32 above). Therefore his allegations \u2013 as set out in the complaint lodged with the domestic authorities \u2013 that he had been subjected to treatment breaching Article 3 of the Convention by police officers were arguable. The authorities were thus required to conduct an effective investigation.",

In particular, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the first forensic examination to evaluate the applicant\u2019s injuries was ordered only more than six months after the initial allegations (see paragraph 26 above). The forensic expert confined his assessment to the medical documentation available to him.\u00a0While the expert recommended that a panel of experts evaluate the matter with a view to concluding whether the injuries identified in the medical documentation could have been self-inflicted, the second expert examination to that end was commissioned with a further delay of more than four months (see paragraph\u00a029 above).

Therefore, almost eight years elapsed between the applicant\u2019s complaint and the prosecutor\u2019s decision to terminate the investigation. As the Court has emphasised on previous occasions, although there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating allegations of ill-treatment may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see, among other authorities, Mocanu and Others v.

Nor was the question of whether the injuries could have been inflicted prior to the arrest, with a delayed appearance, tested by experts. Furthermore, while the expert who had implemented a drug test in respect of the applicant at the police station stated that he had taken three photographs of the applicant with the intention of sending them to the Ministry of Interior (see paragraph\u00a022 above), the investigating authorities do not appear to have received or sought to obtain those photographs.\u00a0Even assuming that the evidence available to the investigating authorities disproved the applicant\u2019s version of the events as to the exact timing and circumstances in which the injuries had been sustained, the Court observes that no attempt at all was made by the investigating authorities to explore other possible causes of the injuries.",

In view of the evidence, including the arrest and search-of-person report, indicating that the applicant did not have the injuries complained of prior to his arrest (see paragraphs\u00a067, 18, and 32 above), a presumption arises that the applicant sustained the injuries complained of while under the authority of the police. As to whether the Government satisfactorily established that the applicant\u2019s injuries were caused otherwise than by \u2013 entirely, mainly, or partly \u2013 the treatment he underwent while in police custody (see Ribitsch, cited above, \u00a7\u00a034), the Court pays particular regard to the fact that the Government offered only one possible explanation. In particular, their sole hypothesis as to the possible source of the applicant\u2019s injuries being beatings by civilians prior to his arrest (see paragraphs\u00a018, 21,\u00a023, and 47 above) is not convincing precisely on account of the failure of the investigation to test that hypothesis and establish whether the signs of such beating could have manifested themselves after two days (see paragraph\u00a055 above).",
