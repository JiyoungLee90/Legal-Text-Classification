At the time of our visit, she said the beating had occurred over one week ago. She also said the police were from the neighbouring town of , only two kilometres away from Sipahi. She claims that the reason she was beaten is that she had tried to bring across the border some textbooks for the children and some religious crosses, after having visited relatives [on] the Greek side of  over the Christmas holidays. She claims she was detained, beaten, interrogated many times, and released approximately 12-18 hours later.

The applicant agreed to pay the equivalent of 9,000,000 Turkish liras as customs duty and/or fine. Furthermore, various other items were found in her bag, such as books and brochures. It was considered that these contained anti-Turkish, racist and defamatory material liable to incite racial hatred and aggravate inter-communal relations.
