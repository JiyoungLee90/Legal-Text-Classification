It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. In these circumstances and particularly as regards the first set of proceedings, the Court considers that the need to obtain evidence from many sources and to determine the facts and the degree of alleged responsibility of each of the codefendants, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention during the period necessary to terminate the investigation, to draw up the bill of indictment and to hear evidence from the accused. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning organised criminal groups, the risk that a detainee if released might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-accused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is in the nature of things often particularly high.",
