The analysis that the Court expects to find in domestic decisions must go beyond a reference to the dispatch of judicial summonses, and must make the most of the available evidence in order to ascertain whether the absent litigant was in fact informed of the upcoming hearing sufficiently in advance (see Gankin and Others v. Russia, nos. 2430/06 and 3\u00a0others, \u00a7 38, 31 May 2016). The answer to this question enables the courts to determine whether the hearing must be adjourned pending due notification (see Zemlyachenko v. Russia [Committee], no. 23866/06, \u00a7 22, 22 January 2013, and Kokurkhayev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 46356/09, \u00a7 31, 13 December 2011). The courts cannot conclude that the absent litigant had waived the right to personal attendance without ascertaining whether he or she had been made aware of the very existence of that right and, therefore, of the hearing in question (see Dilipak and Karakaya v. Turkey, nos. 7942/05 and 24838/05, \u00a7 87, 4 March 2014). Lastly, the Court reiterates that whenever the domestic courts examine the issue of timely notification of an absent litigant, they are expected to attach special importance and give full effect to the right to present his or her case effectively before the court without a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his or her opponent (see Gankin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 38).",
