Apart from the authorities\u2019 general remark that on 9\u00a0September 2008 the applicant complained of headaches, no information is available as to what necessitated those ambulance calls. Although the domestic investigation acknowledged the fact that the applicant had sustained the aforementioned injuries, it contented itself with a finding that those injuries \u201chad been inflicted in unestablished circumstances\u201d even though the applicant had been held in police custody throughout that time (see paragraph 42 above).",

It is significant that only a day before, on 4 February 2009, the applicant had undergone another such examination which had not revealed any injuries. It can therefore be assumed that he sustained the aforementioned injuries between 4 and 5\u00a0February 2009. Coincidentally or not, that was immediately after the trial court had instructed the prosecution authorities to investigate the applicant\u2019s complaints of ill-treatment (see paragraphs\u00a052-54 above). It does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that the applicant appeared reluctant to pursue his complaint thereafter in the framework of his trial. Given the aforementioned medical evidence, it cannot be ruled out that his further ill-treatment dissuaded him from doing so.",

For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. The authorities must have taken the steps reasonably available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 102 et seq., Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII). For an investigation to be effective, those who bear responsibility for it and those who carry it out must be independent and impartial, in law and in practice. This calls for not only a lack of hierarchical or institutional connection with those implicated in the events but also a practical independence (see, for example, Kolevi v. Bulgaria, no. 1108/02, \u00a7\u00a0193, 5 November 2009). The investigation should result in a reasoned decision to reassure a concerned public that the rule of law has been respected (see, mutatis mutandis, Kelly and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 30054/96, \u00a7 118, 4 May 2001, and Lyapin v. Russia, no. 46956/09, \u00a7\u00a0126, 24 July 2014). Moreover, the notion of an effective remedy in respect of an allegation of ill-treatment also entails effective access for the complainant to the investigation procedure (see Assenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 117).",

Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time. These principles are particularly called for in the case of serious charges, for it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies (see Salduz v.

They also contribute to the prevention of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article\u00a06, in particular equality of arms between the investigating or prosecuting authorities and the accused (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 53, Bykov v.

Looking beyond the appearances and the language used and concentrating on the realities of the situation, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s administrative detention in reality formed part of his detention as a criminal suspect (see Kafkaris v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a021906/04, \u00a7 116, ECHR 2008).",

The Court found, in particular, that the Ukrainian authorities had often resorted to such practice with a view to circumventing the legal requirement of mandatory legal representation where applicable (see, for example, Leonid\u00a0Lazarenko v. Ukraine, no. 22313/04, \u00a7 54, 28\u00a0October 2010, and Nechiporuk and Yonkalo v. Ukraine, no. 42310/04, \u00a7\u00a0264, 21 April 2011). The present case is different since the applicant\u2019s case did not warrant his obligatory legal representation even if he had been formally treated as a criminal suspect from the outset. Without analysing here the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s administrative detention as such, which does not fall within the ambit of his complaints under Article 6, the Court notes that it remained open for the applicant, be it in the context of the administrative offence proceedings or the criminal proceedings, to seek to be legally represented or to waive such legal representation. As already noted, he waived that right on a number of occasions. This would not necessarily raise any issue under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention had his waivers been free and genuine. However, the Court\u2019s findings on the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article\u00a03 of the Convention (see paragraphs 81 and 91 above) indicate that this was not the case. Nor can the applicant\u2019s confessions while he was not legally represented be regarded as having been given in a cognisant and voluntary manner.",
