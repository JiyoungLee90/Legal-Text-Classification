After a number of periods in prison and hospital the applicant was admitted to  (\u201cAshworth\u201d) from prison under sections 47 and 49 of the Mental Health Act 1983 on 19 July 1984. He remained an in-patient until March 1992, when he was discharged by the Mental Health Review Tribunal. About a year later he was arrested and charged with a number of offences and was admitted, from prison, to a medium secure unit in August 1993. In that unit he became increasingly psychotic, aggressive and violent. He was placed in seclusion and transferred to Ashworth on 1 March 1994. While at Ashworth he has been secluded on a number of occasions for the protection of others: between 26\u201330 May 2001, 2\u201320 June 2001, 18 December 2001\u20132 January 2002 and 28 March\u20135 April 2002. Each period of seclusion involved confinement to his bedroom or another room; however, during each period of seclusion, the applicant was allowed periods of association either with staff or other patients. These periods ranged from five minutes to over eight hours. In the first period of seclusion, he had approximately six and a half hours\u2019 association in total; in the second, fifty one hours\u2019 association; in the third, twenty-seven hours\u2019 association; and in the fourth, twenty-one hours\u2019 association.

In relation to those matters where a patient\u2019s human rights are or may be engaged, the arguments for according the Code the greater status are compelling. Where there is a risk that agents of the state will treat its patients in a way which contravenes Article 3, the state should take steps to avoid this through the publication of a Code of Practice which its agents are obliged to follow unless they have good reason to depart from it. Where there is an interference with the rights protected by Article 8, the requirement of legality is met through adherence to a Code of Practice again unless there is good reason to depart from it. The same will apply where the Code deals with the deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5.... We conclude that the Code should be observed by all hospitals unless they have a good reason for departing from it in relation to an individual patient. They may identify good reasons for particular departures in relation to groups of patients who share particular well-defined characteristics, so that if the patient falls within that category there will be a good reason for departing from the Code in his case. But they cannot depart from it as a matter of policy and in relation to an arbitrary dividing line which is not properly related to the Code\u2019s definition of seclusion and its requirements.\u201d",

It is not instruction, but it is much more than mere advice which an addressee is free to follow or not as it chooses. It is guidance which any hospital should consider with great care, and from which it should depart only if it has cogent reasons for doing so. Where, which is not this case, the guidance addresses a matter covered by section 118(2) [of the Mental Health Act 1983 \u2013 see paragraph 22 below], any departure would call for even stronger reasons. In reviewing any challenge to a departure from the Code, the court should scrutinise the reasons given by the hospital for departure with the intensity which the importance and sensitivity of the subject matter requires.",

In considering the frequency of medical review after Day 7 the Trust were in my opinion entitled to take account of three matters in particular. First, as pointed out in the Introduction to the policy, the Code was directed to the generality of mental hospitals and did not address the special problems of high security hospitals, containing as they inevitably do the most potentially dangerous patients in the country. Secondly, the Code did not recognise the special position of patients whom it was necessary to seclude for longer than a very few days. It has been the experience of the Trust that the condition of those secluded for more than a week does not change rapidly, and that it is in any event unsafe to rely on an apparent improvement without allowing enough time to pass to give grounds for confidence that the improvement will endure. Thirdly, the statutory scheme, while providing for the Secretary of State to give guidance, deliberately left the power and responsibility of final decision to those who bear the legal and practical responsibility for detaining, treating, nursing and caring for the patients.",

This is a highly controversial subject, on which professional opinions differ. The 7-day divide between short-term and long-term secluded patients is criticised. So is the practice, adopted at Ashworth, of allowing secluded patients to spend periods of time, sometimes lengthy periods, in closely supervised association with other patients. There are differences of practice, not all of them fully explained, between Ashworth, Broadmoor and Rampton. It is not, however, for the courts to resolve debatable issues of professional practice, but to rule on issues of law. If a practice is supported by cogent reasoned justification, the court is not entitled to condemn it as unlawful. In the present case, even with the intense scrutiny called for, I cannot regard the long and detailed statements submitted by the Trust as failing to show good reasons for adopting the policy it has adopted, even though there are many eminent professional experts who take a different view.\u201d",

For I agree with [the High Court] that the policy must be considered as a whole, that the policy, properly operated, will be sufficient to prevent any possible breach of the article 3 rights of a patient secluded for more than 7 days and that there is no evidence to support the proposition that the frequency of medical review provided in the policy risks any breach of those rights. The patient must be the subject of recorded observation by a nurse at least every 15 minutes and of recorded review by two qualified nurses every 2 hours, one of them (where practicable) not involved in the decision to seclude. In the ordinary course of things it is the nurses who know the patient best, and the nurse in charge of the ward can terminate seclusion at any time. There must be a daily review by a ward manager or site manager of a different ward: these, as the evidence shows, are senior and experienced people. There must be 3 medical reviews each week, one of them involving the patient\u2019s responsible medical officer. There must in addition be a weekly review by a multi-disciplinary patient care team, including the patient\u2019s RMO [Resident Medical Officer]. The seclusion of the patient must be monitored by the hospital\u2019s Seclusion Monitoring Group, which includes the medical director, the hospital director, the head of psychology, the senior nurse, the head of social care, 2 nurses, the ward manager and a non-executive director of the Trust, some of whom must have seen the patient. It reports to the hospital\u2019s Clinical Governance Committee. The Mental Health Act Commission must be informed once a patient has been secluded for 7 days and must thereafter receive regular progress reports: as already noted, it has statutory power to visit and investigate any complaint. The patient may, wherever possible, be visited by a relative. The patient or his representative may appeal to the medical director or his deputy, who must review the case and take account of any representations made. The patient may seek judicial review of the decision to seclude him or continue to seclude him, or to challenge the conditions in which he is secluded. It cannot in my opinion be said, bearing in mind that the standard set must obtain in all member states of the Council of Europe, that a policy containing these safeguards exposes a patient secluded for more than 7 days to any material risk of treatment prohibited by article 3.\u201d",

I would not, for example, understand article 5(4) as enabling a prisoner, lawfully detained, to challenge his prison category. In any event, the Ashworth policy, properly applied as one must assume, does not permit a patient to be deprived of any residual liberty to which he is properly entitled: seclusion must be for as short a period and in conditions as benign as will afford reasonable protection to others who have a right to be protected.\u201d",

It preferred to require the Secretary of State to give guidance and (in relation to seclusion) to call on hospitals to have clear written guidelines. Given the broad range of institutions in which patients may be treated for mental disorder... it is readily understandable why a single set of rules, binding on all, was thought to be undesirable and perhaps impracticable. It is common ground that the power to seclude a patient within the hospital is implied from the power to detain as a \u2018necessary ingredient flowing from a power of detention for treatment\u2019 treatment\u201d: see Auld LJ in R v Broadmoor Special Hospital Authority, Ex p S, H and D (5 February 1998, unreported) and the Court of Appeal judgment in the present case, para 40.

As for the question whether Ashworth was free to depart from the Code as a matter of policy, and not just in relation to individual patients or groups of patients, I do not see why this should be so, provided of course that it can demonstrate that it had a good reason for doing so. The distinction which the Court of Appeal made between a departure in the case of individual patients or groups of patients and a departure which takes the form of a written policy for dealing with a particular form of intervention is elusive, and I do not think that it can be regarded as acceptable. There is an obvious danger that, if the Code could be departed from in the case of individual patients or groups of patients where no written guidance was available, decisions to do this would be open to attack as being arbitrary because their consequences were unregulated and unpredictable. That, precisely, is what Ashworth\u2019s Policy seeks to avoid. Good clinical and medical practice dictates that seclusion should only be used in particular situations to protect others and subject to particular conditions to ensure that the patient is not harmed or secluded for any longer than is necessary. The purpose of the Policy is to ensure that the conditions under which it is to be resorted to are clearly understood and carefully observed so that decisions that are taken about the management of this procedure are consistent and not arbitrary.",

The point that divides us is whether the practice of seclusion carried out at Ashworth in accordance with the Policy is \u201cin accordance with the law.\u201d As his quotation from para 39 of the Court\u2019s judgment in Hewitt and Harman v United Kingdom (1991) 14 EHRR 657 reminds us, it is the quality of the law that matters rather than the form it takes. The touchstones by which its quality is measured are, as Lord Brown says, its transparency, its accessibility, its predictability and its consistency. Where these qualities are present the measure protects against the abuse of power and against conduct which is arbitrary. There is no doubt that the Code satisfied these tests, notwithstanding the fact that there is no statutory obligation to comply with it. In my opinion Ashworth\u2019s Policy, which is careful in all these respects to follow the Code\u2019s example, does so too. It is, of course, true that Ashworth could alter its Policy. But if it did so every departure from the Code would have to be justified in the same way as the Policy itself has had to be justified. I do not think that the fact that Ashworth has its own Policy opens the door to further departures from the Code that could be described as arbitrary.",

Assuming, of course, that Ashworth has shown - as it has - clearly, logically and convincingly that it had cogent reasons for departing from the Code in these particular respects in favour of its own Policy, I would hold that its decision cannot be said to have been unlawful. Concerns that a departure from the Code in this instance will lead to widespread variations in practice and undermine its status generally or that your Lordships\u2019 judgment lowers the protection offered by the law to mentally disordered patients are misplaced, in my opinion. The requirement that cogent reasons must be shown for any departure from it sets a high standard which is not easily satisfied. The protection which the law provides to ensure that any departures are compatible with Convention rights is an additional safeguard. This has been amply demonstrated in practice since the Code was promulgated. Ashworth is the only place where a hospital has departed from what the Code says about seclusion in favour of its own policy. While I would respectfully endorse everything that Lord Brown says in the last paragraph of his speech [paragraph 127, quoted below], I believe that it would be wrong to see this judgment as opening the door to substantial departures from the Code on the part of individual hospitals. The decision of the majority should not be seen as an invitation to other hospitals to do this and resort to their own policies. The status of the Code remains unchanged, and so does the need to show cogent reasons if in any respect it is departed from.",

The only authority for seclusion would be, in the case of patients detained under the 1983 Act, the implied power of control over those lawfully detained; in the case of informal patients, the common law doctrines of necessity and self-defence. The actual use of seclusion in individual cases would not be regulated save insofar as each hospital practising it would be required to adopt, publish and practise a rational policy of its own. That, of course, is precisely what Ashworth does. But by the same token that Ashworth is permitted to adopt its own policy, so too may other hospitals. Much of the factual focus of the appeal was upon those of Ashworth\u2019s patients who are detained for over seven days. But Ashworth\u2019s policy departs from the Code much earlier than this: only for the first 12 hours does Ashworth conduct medical reviews at 4 hourly intervals as specified by the Code; from then until the end of the seventh day such reviews occur twice (rather than six times) a day. Other hospitals too may think it unnecessary to conduct reviews as frequently as provided for by the Code. And of course there is nothing to stop Ashworth altering its policy whenever it thinks it right to do so. The policy of an individual hospital can be changed with infinitely greater ease than the Code itself.",

The reasoning in Miller shows that in a case of a prisoner where solitary confinement is unlawfully and unjustly superimposed upon his prison sentence the added solitary confinement can amount to \u2018prison within a prison\u2019: it is capable of constituting a material deprivation of residual liberty",

There is relevant European authority not placed before the Court of Appeal. In Bollan v , App No. 42117/98, the European Court of Human Rights, albeit in an admissibility decision, considered the point. The complaint was a comparatively weak one: the prisoner had been confined to her cell, unlawfully it was said, for some two hours. The evidence was that she was a heroin addict who objected to that restriction on her residual liberty. In European terms the case simply did not reach the necessary threshold of severity. The European Court of Human Rights dealt with the legal principles arising under the ECHR as follows:",

It will be noted also that the ECtHR observed that in such cases \u2018in appropriate cases, issues may arise however under articles 3 and 8 of the Convention\u2019. To that it must be added that, if substantial and unjust seclusion of a mentally disordered patient cannot in our domestic law be protected effectively under articles 3 and 8, the case for protection under article 5 becomes ever stronger. It follows that a substantial period of unnecessary seclusion of a mentally disordered patient, involving total deprivation of any residual liberty that the patient may have within the hospital, is capable of amounting to an unjustified deprivation of liberty.\u201d",

The majority of those secluded go into and come out of seclusion within seven days. Those who are secluded for more than seven days are likely to be secluded for much longer periods. The common factor in such patients is a danger to others which is not liable to be resolved in the short term, and the decision to terminate seclusion is one to be made over days or even weeks, because of the need to be satisfied of the enduring nature of changes to the patient. Even in such cases, reviews and other safeguards exist to ensure that the patient will not be secluded for longer than necessary, including the possibility of more frequent medical reviews, if necessary.",

Although there had been no alleged ill-treatment in the present case, there was still an obligation to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against conduct that would breach the Convention. MIND also stressed the positive obligation to provide effective protection to vulnerable persons and to take reasonable steps to prevent ill-treatment (Z and others, cited above, \u00a7 73).

The hospital\u2019s approach was to allow secluded patients the most liberal regime that was compatible with their presentation, for instance by allowing as much association and as many visits as possible (see paragraph 31 above). Moreover, patients at Ashworth were already in conditions of high security; the additional restrictions on secluded patients were not as significant as if the patient were being detained in conditions of medium or low security. In this respect, the Government also submitted that the applicant\u2019s seclusion could be distinguished from Schneiter v.  (dec.), no. 63062/00, 31 March 2005, where the Court had found that Article 5 applied to the applicant\u2019s placement in solitary confinement.

It would also be inconsistent with Article 5 \u00a7 4, which required release if detention were unlawful. Article 5 did not need to be extended when Articles 3 and 8 were capable of providing effective protection to secluded patients. Finally, such an extension would be unworkable given the flexibility of the Ashworth seclusion regime, where the precise restrictions imposed as a result of seclusion varied according to the risk a particular patient posed to others. It would be impossible to determine whether seclusion amounted to a deprivation of liberty when the length of periods of seclusion varied, as did the periods of association and time spent outside the seclusion room, especially when any period of association or time spent outside the seclusion room would clearly bring any \u201cdeprivation of liberty\u201d to an end.",

Such measures had to be regarded in normal circumstances as modifications of the conditions of lawful detention and therefore fell outside the scope of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

He absconded but later returned of his own accord. He was then placed in solitary confinement and given forced medication. The solitary confinement lasted eleven days. The last nine days of detention had been found by the domestic courts to be unlawful. To determine whether the applicant had been deprived of his liberty for the other two days, as in Bollan, the Court considered the type, duration and manner of implementation of the measure. In light of those criteria, it took the view that placement in solitary confinement, which involved the removal of all social contact and lasted for several days, could be interpreted as a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1. The Court recalled that, though only two days\u2019 detention was at issue before it, the applicant\u2019s detention had, in reality, lasted eleven days. The Court distinguished Bollan, finding that the circumstances in that case were not comparable to placing in solitary confinement for eleven days a patient who had been confined to a psychiatric institution. Finally, the Court observed that it had been possible for Mr Schneiter to submit further appeals against his solitary confinement; this was an additional factor in favour of the finding that such confinement constituted a further deprivation of liberty. The Court went on to find, however, that the applicant\u2019s detention for the two days in question fell within the terms of the general police clause of the Constitution of the Canton of Berne and was not arbitrary within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Instead, as the information provided by the hospital demonstrates, the very purpose of Ashworth hospital is to house patients who cannot be reached by treatment and whose persistent illness renders them predictably dangerous (see paragraph 30 above) and the aim of seclusion at the hospital is to contain severely disturbed behaviour which is likely to cause harm to others. Moreover, it is not argued by the applicant that any of his periods of seclusion were unnecessary or failed to pursue this aim, nor has he argued that any of the four periods of seclusion had any significant or lasting adverse effects upon him.",

The length of the applicant\u2019s seclusion was foremost a matter of clinical judgment. Seclusion could only continue for as long as those responsible for the applicant\u2019s care judged it necessary. It is true that, in exercising their judgment as to how long to prolong the applicant\u2019s seclusion in each of the four periods, the clinicians at Ashworth would have drawn on their experience that patients who were secluded for more than seven days were likely to be secluded for much longer periods, and that the decision to terminate seclusion was one to be made over days or even weeks (see the evidence submitted by the Government as summarised at paragraph 30 above). However, these considerations speak more to the need to ensure that there are proper safeguards in place to protect the rights of patients who are susceptible to long-term seclusion than to whether seclusion \u2013 either in itself or as practised in the applicant\u2019s case \u2013 is a further deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

The Court accepts Ashworth\u2019s evidence that its approach was to allow secluded patients the most liberal regime that was compatible with their presentation, including seclusion in their own rooms, the continual presence of staff, the opportunity to take meals in the ward, regular visits, and periods of association outside their rooms (see paragraph 31 above). The logs covering the applicant\u2019s four periods of seclusion bear this out. They show that, during each period of seclusion, the applicant enjoyed long periods of association and there was only one day when he was not allowed any association at all (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a06 above). They also demonstrate that seclusion was not applied strictly at Ashworth, but flexibly and with no fixed boundary between periods of confinement and periods of association. For this reason, and for the further reasons given above, the Court is satisfied that the applicant\u2019s seclusion did not amount to solitary confinement of the kind experienced by the applicant in Schneiter, still less a further deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

The Court observes that, as the \u201cCount Me In 2007\u201d census noted (see paragraph 32 above), nationally seclusion had been applied to a limited number of patients: less than three percent of those surveyed. Under the Ashworth policy each case of seclusion required a separate decision by hospital staff. Seclusion was not authorised unless it was considered necessary; for the remainder of the time, the applicant was free to associate under the normal conditions of detention of the hospital and, when each period of seclusion ended, he returned to those conditions of detention. Consequently, the four periods of seclusion must be regarded as additional interferences with the private life of the applicant, which were distinct from the inevitable interference with his private life that arose from his detention in high security conditions at Ashworth.",

Procedural safeguards were also necessary in domestic law to prevent arbitrary or mistaken interferences with Convention rights (T.P. and K.M. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28945/95, \u00a7\u00a7 71-72, 80\u00a0and 83, ECHR 2001V (extracts).

Furthermore, such decisions had to be taken quickly in response to emergency situations, making a relatively wide discretionary power appropriate (X v. the United Kingdom, 5 November 1981, \u00a7 41, Series A no.\u00a046). The foreseeability of seclusion at Ashworth was guaranteed by the clear written guidelines set out in Ashworth\u2019s policy. The requisite protection against arbitrary interference was provided by both the detailed provisions of the Code of Practice, by the hospital\u2019s policy and by the availability of judicial review.

Even if this were so, the frequency of medical reviews was clearly foreseeable as this was set out in Ashworth\u2019s policy. Article 8 did not impose a requirement that such provisions be contained in a national standard. The House of Lords had authoritatively determined the status of the Code: a hospital had to consider it with \u201cgreat care\u201d and could only adopt a policy of less frequent reviews if it had \u201ccogent reasons\u201d for doing so (see Lord Bingham at paragraph 13 above).

There was, moreover, no reason why all 181 psychiatric hospitals in England and  could not reject the Code of Practice and introduce their own policies, as Lord Steyn had recognised in his dissenting opinion in the House of Lords (see paragraph 20 above). Non-binding administrative policies were, in practice, likely to be unenforceable and inaccessible to patients and their representatives and therefore did not provide the necessary legal protection. Those policies were theoretically enforceable in judicial review proceedings but this was theoretical and illusory protection. The State could only meet its obligations to protect vulnerable psychiatric patients by promulgating national minimum standards binding on all psychiatric establishments. The Code of Practice was important and ought to have been binding because it had democratic legitimacy; it regulated the imposition of invasive restrictions on patients\u2019 lives, which were not regulated by the Mental Health Act 1983; it also provided greater detail as regards powers which were set out only summarily in the Act; it had universal application; it applied equally to public and private hospitals; and it applied to all patients admitted to mental health hospitals.",
