They further considered that the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, especially the need to verify evidence from suspects and witnesses, justified holding the applicant in custody. The courts stressed, on several occasions, the applicant's role in the organised criminal group, holding that there was a risk that if released, he would induce witnesses to give false testimony, or otherwise obstruct the proper conduct of the investigation. In one of the decisions dismissing an appeal by the applicant against a decision prolonging his detention, the Court of Appeal noted, that \u201ccertain witnesses in principle admitted that they had been instructed [about what to say] in their testimony\u201d and that \u201cthe testimony of other witnesses was not consistent with the explanations given by the applicant in the course of the investigation.\u201d It did not, however, specify who had exerted pressure on the witnesses or how they had done so.

However, as stated above, while this element is to be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 and may justify a longer period of detention than in a case concerning an individual offender, a member of an organised criminal group is entitled to the protection against unreasonably lengthy detention afforded by this provision (see paragraphs see paragraphs 38 and 43 above). As in other numerous similar detention cases, the authorities did not justify the applicant's continued detention by relevant and sufficient reasons (see paragraphs 3945 above). Moreover, as demonstrated by the ever increasing number of judgments in which the Court has found Poland to be in breach of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7 3 in respect of applicants involved in organised crime, the present case is by no means an isolated example of the imposition of unjustifiably lengthy detention but a confirmation of a practice found to be contrary to the Convention (see, among many other examples, Celejewski v. Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, 4 May 2006; K\u0105kol v.\u00a0Poland, no. 3994/03, 6\u00a0September 2007; Malikowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a015154/03, 16 October 2007 and also Hilgartner v. Poland, no.\u00a037976/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046-48, 3 March 2009). Consequently, the Court sees no reason to diverge from its findings made in Kauczor as to the existence of a structural problem and the need for the Polish State to adopt measures to remedy the situation (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62 ).",
