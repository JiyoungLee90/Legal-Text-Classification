It did not involve penalising the owner of the site maintained, but rather preventing the continuation of an offence. The measure was fully justified in order to protect the public interest and to remedy environmental damage. The strictly remedial scope of an order to demolish an unlawful building had moreover been confirmed by the case-law of the Court itself, notably in Saliba v. Malta (no. 4521/02, 8 November 2005).

The applicant considered furthermore that the judgment was contradictory in so far as it made a mere finding of guilt as regards the offence of maintaining an unlawful building, yet also ordered her to restore the site to its original condition.

The Government, which had taken no action in relation to this house for over thirty years, could not rely on their poor organisation. The general interest required coherent, clear and rapid action on the part of the authorities. The circumstances of the case demonstrated that they had waived their right to take action in the instant case. Accordingly, it must be held that they could not suddenly go back on their decision without breaching the principle of the legitimate expectations of citizens.

The issue that needs to be examined is whether the circumstances of the case, considered as a whole, conferred on the applicant title to a substantive interest protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Zwierzy\u0144ski v.

In this regard, the  cannot properly rely on its internal organisation and a distinction between the town and country planning authorities and the tax authorities. It must therefore be considered that the authorities tolerated the situation for twenty-seven years (1967-94) and continued to tolerate it for ten years after the offence had been established (1994-2004, the year in which the house was demolished). After such a long period had elapsed, the applicant\u2019s proprietary interest in the enjoyment of her holiday home had been sufficiently established and weighty to amount to a substantive interest and therefore a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of the rule expressed in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

It was also intended to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest since it involved bringing the property into conformity with a land-use plan establishing a forested zone in which no building was permitted.

In this regard, the Court must ascertain whether a fair balance was struck between the demands of the general interest and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights.

The applicant, and her father before her, had had peaceful and uninterrupted enjoyment of the holiday home for a total of thirty-seven\u00a0years. The deed of partition drawn up on 6 January 1986 between the applicant and her father had been registered with the Mortgage Registrar at the Ministry of Finance and a registration fee had been paid (see paragraph\u00a08 above). On the death of the applicant\u2019s father in 1993, the notarised deed of distribution specifically referred to the house as a holiday home and the applicant paid the inheritance tax. Since then, the applicant had been paying an annual property tax and second-residence tax on the house (see paragraph 9 above). The water-supply company carried out works to connect the house to the water and drainage system with no reaction from the authorities (see paragraph 11 above). Furthermore, when the offence was established, after twenty-seven years, the authorities then allowed a further five years to elapse before instituting criminal proceedings, thus treating the matter with no particular urgency. It is therefore clear that the authorities knew or should have known of the existence of the applicant\u2019s house for a long time. However, notwithstanding the provisions of the relevant legislation, they failed to take the appropriate action to ensure compliance. They thus contributed to the continuation of a situation which could only be detrimental to the protection of the forested area which that legislation sought to protect.",

However, the provisions of Article 158 clearly indicate that a building erected in contravention of a land-use plan (see paragraph 38 above) cannot be rendered compliant. The applicant\u2019s house was located in a forested area and, under Article 12 of the royal decree of 28 December 1972, that area could incorporate only buildings necessary for the exploitation and monitoring of the timber, as well as hunting and fishing shelters, provided that the latter could not be used as a residence, even on a temporary basis (see paragraph 41 above).",

In those cases, the applicants\u2019 property had been registered in the land register and the parties concerned had obtained from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism a tourist-investment certificate with a view to building a hotel on the land, and the State Planning Agency had awarded them an investment-incentive certificate with a view to building the hotel. Those cases did not therefore involve the merely implicit consent of the authorities, as in the instant case, where the house in issue had been erected without permission by the applicant\u2019s parents.",
