Seeing that these circumstances constitute exceptions to a most basic guarantee of individual freedom, only a narrow interpretation is consistent with the aim of this provision (see \u010conka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, \u00a7 42 in limine, ECHR 2002-I, and Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia, no.\u00a036378/02, \u00a7 396, ECHR 2005-III). The Court notes that the applicant was detained with a view to extradition from Ukraine to . Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f) of the Convention is thus applicable in the instant case. This provision does not require the detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to extradition to be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or absconding. In this connection, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c): all that is required under sub-paragraph (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d (see \u010conka, cited above, \u00a7 38, and Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15\u00a0November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, \u00a7 112). However, any deprivation of liberty under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) will be justified only for as long as extradition proceedings are in progress. If such proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) (ibid., p. 1863, \u00a7 113).",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III, \u00a7 50). Thus, the notion underlying the term in question is one of fair and proper procedure, namely that any measure depriving a person of his liberty should issue from, and be executed by, an appropriate authority and should not be arbitrary (see C. v. Germany, no. 0893/84, Commission decision of 2 December 1985). The words \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d do not merely refer back to domestic law; they also relate to the quality of this law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention. Quality in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible and precise, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7 55, ECHR\u00a02001-II, citing Amuur v. France, cited above, pp.\u00a0850-51, \u00a7 50).",

The Ukrainian legislation establishes a total ban on extradition or expulsion of Ukrainian nationals. In addition to this, under the Refugee Act refugees may not be expelled or forcibly returned to particular countries (see paragraph 29 above). The Court has previously found a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 of the Convention when the authorities applied detention for the purpose of extradition to a Ukrainian national (see Garkavyy v. Ukraine, no.\u00a025978/07, \u00a7\u00a7 70 and 75, 18 February 2010) and to a refugee (see Dubovik v. Ukraine, nos. 33210/07 and 41866/08, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 62, 15 October 2009). In the former case, however, extradition had been excluded from the outset due to the applicant\u2019s nationality, while in the latter it became arbitrary from the moment the decision on granting the applicant refugee status became final and binding.",

The ongoing examination of the applicant\u2019s request for refugee status did not exclude the possibility that he might later be extradited. The Court notes that the examination of any risks and objections linked to the person\u2019s possible removal from the territory of the State is intrinsic to actions \u201ctaken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d. Even if such an examination establishes that such risks and objections are wellfounded and capable of preventing the person\u2019s removal, such a possible future outcome cannot in itself retroactively affect the lawfulness of the detention pending examination of a request for extradition. The Court reiterates that all that is required under 5 \u00a7 1 (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d (see \u010conka, cited above, \u00a7 38). Given that throughout this period of detention it was the authorities\u2019 intention to extradite the applicant, and that there was no legal or factual impediment to ultimate extradition, the detention cannot be considered unlawful or arbitrary within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1. It follows that there was no violation of the above provision during the period in question.",

It was not until 14 July 2010 however that the Deputy Prosecutor of the Odessa Region authorised the applicant\u2019s release. The Court reiterates that some delay in implementing a decision to release a detainee is understandable, and often inevitable in view of practical considerations relating to the running of the courts and the observance of particular formalities. However, the national authorities must attempt to keep this to a minimum (see Quinn v. France, judgment of 22 March 1995, Series A no. 311, p. 17, \u00a7 42; Giulia Manzoni v. Italy, judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, p. 1191, \u00a7 25 in fine; K.-F. v. Germany, judgment of 27\u00a0November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p. 2675, \u00a7 71; and Mancini v.\u00a0Italy, no. 44955/98, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2001-IX). Administrative formalities connected with release cannot justify a delay of more than a few hours (see Nikolov v. Bulgaria, no. 38884/97, \u00a7 82, 30 January 2003). It is for the Contracting States to organise their legal system in such a way that their law-enforcement authorities can meet the obligation to avoid unjustified deprivation of liberty. In the present case it took the domestic authorities two days to arrange for the applicant\u2019s release after they had received notification that the applicant\u2019s extradition was no longer required. Having regard to the prominent place which the right to liberty holds in a democratic society, the respondent State should have deployed all modern means of communication of information to keep to a minimum the delay in implementing the decision to release the applicant, as required by the relevant case-law (see, mutatis mutandis, Eminbeyli v. Russia, no. 42443/02, \u00a7 49, 26 February 2009). The Court is not satisfied that the  officials complied with that requirement in the present case. It follows that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 in respect of this period of his detention.",
