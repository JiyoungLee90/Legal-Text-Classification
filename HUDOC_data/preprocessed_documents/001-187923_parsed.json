These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see\u00a0Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, \u00a7\u00a098, ECHR 2012).

Neither of the parties argued that the applicant was aware that he was not the father of the child when he accepted paternity. On the contrary, in his claim the applicant stated that he had had no doubts about his paternity for many years until 2005 (see paragraph 7 above). In her appeal the child\u2019s mother contended that she had never doubted the applicant\u2019s biological paternity and her grounds of appeal related essentially to a challenge to the reliability of the paternity test which disproved her statement (see paragraph 9 above). In these circumstances it is not clear why the Court of Appeal completely disregarded this important part of the parties\u2019 submissions and examined the appeal on grounds which were never advanced by any party to the dispute. Moreover, in making such a crucial factual finding, which was a totally new finding and, apparently, surprising to both parties, the Court of Appeal provided general reasoning merely based on assumption which were unsupported by any specific evidence. It is important to emphasise that this new factual finding was based on the same file and evidence which had been examined in full trial by the first-instance court. The Court of Appeal, however, overturned the factual conclusions of the first-instance court without reference to any new piece of evidence and without explaining why the factual conclusions of the first-instance court had been defective. Despite the applicant\u2019s appeal on a point of law (see paragraph 11 above), the Supreme Court did not address those issues in the course of review of the case (see paragraph 12 above). In such circumstances it does not appear to the Court that the decision-making process was fair and free from arbitrariness.",
