They had then made him get up, showed him a yellow item and told him that it belonged to him, which he had denied. When he had asked to see a representative from the Ukrainian Consulate he had been beaten again. Subsequently, one of the officers had suggested that he confess to having brought drugs for Z.S. He had promised him a quick release in return. The applicant however maintained his innocence, claiming that he had come to Georgia in order to attend a wedding. According to his statement, he submitted that the interpreter present during the search had translated a couple of sentences into Russian, but had not given him any written translated documents.

He confirmed that immediately after the arrest, he had informed the applicant of his rights in Russian. He had also informed the applicant of his rights during the body search procedure, including the right to call attesting witnesses, but the latter had waived this right by making a written note in the search report. He stated that the investigator and three to four police officers had been present during the search and that the applicant had not shown any resistance during the arrest or search and had followed the police\u2019s instructions, one of which had been to strip naked and do sit-ups. During one of the sit-ups he had seen a yellow balloon with a black string emerge from the applicant\u2019s anus, which had been removed. He denied that there had been any kind of abuse or humiliation of the applicant at the hands of the police officers.",

It concluded that he had come up with his version of the arrest and search in order to evade criminal responsibility and that he had failed to provide evidence to corroborate his allegations.

Letters and complaints subsequently filed with the General Inspectorate of the Ministry of the Interior (see paragraph 28 above), the President of Georgia, the PDO and the Ukrainian Consulate failed to yield any results (ibid.).\u00a0Against this background, and in view of the fact that no judicial appeal could be brought against the prosecutorial refusal of 17\u00a0October 2008 to pursue the complaints of ill-treatment, the Court considers that with that refusal, the applicant should have known that no investigation had been instigated into his allegations and that there was no realistic prospect of one being provided in the future. The six-month time-limit therefore started to run on 17\u00a0October 2008, while the application was not lodged with the Court until 20 January 2011.",

Thus, the ineffectiveness of the first round of investigation and the delay in the initiation of the second round of criminal proceedings, coupled with their overall length, have already prejudiced the potential effectiveness of the reopened proceedings, which leads the Court to the conclusion that the investigation had been ineffective for the purposes of Article 3 of the Convention (see Nicolae Virgiliu T\u0103nase v.

That is so because, as concluded above, the trial was a forum available to him to voice his grievances regarding the manner in which the search had been conducted. It is true that in the context of the criminal proceedings against the applicant, the national courts were under a legal obligation to do no more than examine whether the evidence obtained as a result of the search had in fact been obtained by inhuman and/or degrading treatment (see Articles 12 and 111 of the CPC, cited in paragraph 55 above), without there being a possibility that they could also proceed to holding responsible any perpetrator, if such inhuman and degrading treatment was revealed. However, it cannot be excluded that a finding by the trial court in the criminal proceedings against the applicant on this issue could trigger separate proceedings against a perpetrator. At all events, the potential possibility that the applicant\u2019s trial could lead to the establishment of the relevant facts concerning the search and the identification of any responsible person, is a sufficient ground to consider the developments during that trial in the examination of the applicant\u2019s complaint regarding the alleged failure by the authorities to discharge their procedural obligations under Article 3.",

Also, the courts focused on the physical aspect of the applicant\u2019s alleged ill-treatment, disregarding the psychological effect the alleged treatment could have had on him. Furthermore, at no point did the domestic courts consider whether the strip search had been applied as a last resort, whether it had been performed by trained personnel and with due regard to the applicant\u2019s privacy and dignity (see Yankov, \u00a7 100, and Vala\u0161inas, \u00a7 117, both cited above; see also Wainwright, v. the United Kingdom, no. 12350/04, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2006X). However, these elements were crucial in order to assess the Article 3 compatibility of the treatment to which the applicant was subjected (see Wiktorko v.

Thus, the police officers concerned did not mention in any of their pre-trial statements the black string and retrieval of the yellow balloon without penetration. In fact, even the search report only referred to a yellow balloon (see paragraph 7 above; see also the prosecutor\u2019s application to the trial court for the validation of the search results referred to in paragraph 29 above). In the Court\u2019s view, this required further examination as, without the black string, it would seem that retrieval of the yellow balloon from the applicant\u2019s anus without actual penetration would have simply been impossible. Even more so, the yellow balloon, whether with or without the black string, disappeared from the applicant\u2019s case file, which fact presented another major difficulty in the current case and required, in view of all the circumstances, a rather delicate assessment. Last but not least, by concluding, in a rather formulaic statement, that the applicant had failed to corroborate his allegations of a humiliating and degrading search, the domestic courts put the burden of proof entirely on him. They did so despite the applicant\u2019s rather detailed and consistent statements concerning the specific circumstances of the search, and overlooking the fact that his repeated requests for a medical examination and the initiation of a criminal investigation had been refused.",

In the present case, the Court considers that the evidence available to it is insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that an anal inspection of the applicant was carried out in circumstances as described by him. In view of the foregoing, the Court is unable to conclude that the strip search as such had been aimed at intimidating or humiliating the applicant, or/and that it had been performed in a such a manner that it caused him pain or humiliation, to the point that the suffering went beyond the threshold of severity under Article 3.\u00a0It considers it necessary to emphasise, however, that its inability to reach a conclusion as to whether the applicant\u2019s treatment during the search was contrary to Article 3 derives considerably from the failure of the domestic authorities to effectively investigate his allegations, which, as it already found above, was in breach of their procedural obligations under that provision (see paragraph 79 above).",

Whilst the applicant\u2019s arguments appear somewhat confusing in that it remained unclear whether he claimed that the drugs had been obtained through an anal inspection or had been planted, the Court notes that the fact of a strip search having been performed on the applicant was never disputed between the parties. Also, the prosecution\u2019s position during the trial was that the drugs were extracted from the applicant\u2019s rectum during the search (see paragraphs 29 and 40 above).

However, as the Court emphasised above (see paragraph 82 above), the absence of such material was related to the finding, under the procedural limb of Article 3, that the national courts in the criminal proceedings against the applicant had failed to duly examine his argument concerning the unlawfulness of the strip search and its inhuman and degrading nature (see paragraphs 7579 above). This conclusion is equally relevant for its consideration of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention concerning the unfairness of the trial. The applicant made a prima facie case about the real evidence potentially obtained through illtreatment (see paragraph 72 above). This evidence laid the very basis for his conviction (see paragraphs 46 and 50 above). In fact,\u00a0no other evidence in the case file, in the absence of the report on the applicant\u2019s strip search,\u00a0was sufficiently strong\u00a0on its own. From this standpoint, by not properly addressing the allegations concerning the anal inspection and the manner of the strip search, the national courts failed to adequately examine the applicant\u2019s principal argument concerning the unlawfulness of the use of the evidence obtained as a result. They, thus, failed to assess the quality of the evidence and whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy (see Mehmet Duman v. Turkey, no.\u00a038740/09, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, 23 October 2018; Abdulkadyrov and Dakhtayev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 35061/04, \u00a7\u00a7 79-81, 10 July 2018; and Turbylev v.

However, even assuming that the courts examining the criminal charges against the applicant could, under certain conditions securing the adversarial nature of the criminal proceedings, defer to a pre-existing judicial review of the circumstances of the search, the Court has already found in the cases of Kobiashvili and Megrelishvili (both cited above) that the post-search judicial reviews are not adequate and sufficient for the purposes of establishing the circumstances of a search and for challenging the authenticity and reliability of evidence (see Kobiashvili, \u00a7\u00a7 67-69, and Megrelishvili, \u00a7 35).",

In view of this conclusion, it is not necessary for the Court to consider whether the domestic courts should have also dealt with the applicant\u2019s argument that the drugs were planted.",

In this connection, the Government submitted that the charges had been read out to the applicant by the supervising prosecutor in a verbal translation within forty-eight hours of his detention, in the presence of his defence counsel (see paragraph 32 above), and that the relevant decision had also been translated into Russian; therefore the requirements of the Convention had been fully met. The Court notes the finding of the trial judge, according to which it was not clear whether the applicant had indeed been duly served with the decision to charge him in a language he understood (see paragraph 47 above). In the absence of an explanation by the Government, there seems to be no reason for the Court to depart from the domestic court\u2019s conclusion. Nonetheless, having regard to the fact that shortly after the charges were brought against him, the applicant and his lawyers submitted detailed arguments challenging the main aspects of the accusation and presenting an alternative version of events to the relevant authorities, the Court concludes that the applicant sufficiently understood the charges against him and the material substance upon which the charges were based (see Hermi, cited above, \u00a7 70; see also, mutatis mutandis, Petuhovs v. Germany (dec.) [Committee], no.\u00a060705/08, 9 March 2010, and Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, \u00a7 85, Series A no. 168).",

On 29 September 2008 the charges brought against the applicant were verbally translated to him by the interpreter (see paragraph 32 above). On 6 October 2008 the applicant was questioned with the assistance of an interpreter (see paragraph 19 above). On 14 November 2008 a written translation of the bill of indictment and notice of the conclusion of the pre-trial investigation were sent to him, but he refused delivery, although a copy of the bill of indictment was given to him later at the opening of the trial (see paragraph 38 above).

Romania (dec.) [GC], no. 42219/07, \u00a7 87, 9 July 2015 and the authorities cited therein). If more than one potentially effective remedy is available, the applicant is only required to have used one of them (see for example Aquilina v. Malta [GC], no. 25642/94, \u00a7 39, 29 April 1999 or Karak\u00f3\u00a0v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 39311/05, \u00a7 14, 28 April 2009). When one remedy has been attempted, use of another remedy which has essentially the same purpose is not required (see, for example, Nicolae Virgiliu T\u0103nase v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 41720/13, \u00a7 177, 25 June 2019). The Court has emphasised that applicants must comply with the applicable rules and procedures of domestic law, failing which their application is likely to fall foul of the condition laid down in Article 35 (see for example Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v. Serbia (preliminary objection) [GC], nos. 17153/11 and 29 others, \u00a7\u00a7 72 and 80, 25 March 2014). However, where an appellate court examines the merits of a claim even though it considers it inadmissible, Article 35 \u00a7 1 will be complied with (see, implicitly, Voggenreiter v. Germany, no.\u00a047169/99, 8 January 2004). As regards the six-month rule, that period runs from the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see Leki\u0107 v. Slovenia [GC], no. 36480/07, \u00a7 65, 11\u00a0December 2018). The pursuit of remedies which do not satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a01 will not be considered by the Court for the purposes of establishing the date of the \u201cfinal decision\u201d or calculating the starting point for the running of the six-month rule (Jeronovi\u010ds v. Latvia\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a044898/10, \u00a7 75, 5 July 2016; Alekseyev and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a014988/09 and 50 others, \u00a7\u00a7 10-16, 27 November 2018). Only remedies which are normal and effective can be taken into account. An applicant cannot thus extend the strict time-limit imposed by the Convention by seeking to make inappropriate or misconceived applications to bodies or institutions which have no power or competence to offer effective redress for the complaint in issue under the Convention (Lopes de Sousa Fernandes v.\u00a0Portugal [GC], no. 56080/13, \u00a7\u00a0132, 19 December 2017).",

This complaint was rejected by the competent prosecutor on 17 October 2008. An appeal was lodged on 28 October 2008 with the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office to which no reply was received (\u00a7 24). Complaints to the Ukrainian consulate, the Public Defender of Georgia and the President of Georgia were forwarded to the prosecutor and the trial judge in charge of his case in November and December 2008 (\u00a7 26). This yielded no results. On\u00a028\u00a0September 2008 the regional prosecutor applied to a court to validate retroactively the search which had been performed urgently the previous day. The court examined the application in writing and the applicant was not permitted to submit any observations. The applicant did not appeal, within the designated seventy-two hours, the retroactive decision to validate the search pursuant to Article 293 of the CCP (\u00a7 31). Prior to the applicant\u2019s trial, his lawyers sought to have excluded as inadmissible certain parts of the gathered evidence due to the serious violations which had taken place during the arrest and search. Police officers and an interpreter who had been present during the arrest and search were questioned by the investigator who was in charge of the applicant\u2019s case. The investigator had himself participated in the arrest and search. When the trial was opened on 27\u00a0April 2009, the applicant submitted a written statement describing the arrest and search in detail, requested that all the arresting officers and the interpreter be questioned, protested his innocence, claimed, inter alia, that he had been physically and psychologically ill-treated during the search and requested the exclusion of inadmissible evidence in accordance with Articles\u00a0110 and 111 of the CCP (\u00a7\u00a7 39 \u2013 40). This request was rejected in its entirety by the trial judge on the grounds that the search had been conducted by an authorised officer and his ill-treatment allegation was unsubstantiated (\u00a7\u00a041). When finding the applicant guilty on 18 June 2009, the trial court held that the applicant had fabricated his version of the arrest and search in order to evade criminal responsibility and that the minor injuries found on the applicant did not correspond to the scale of violence which he claimed to have suffered (\u00a7 46). The applicant\u2019s appeal maintained the claim that he had been subject to physical and verbal abuse during the arrest and strip search and that the manner in which the strip search had been carried out constituted inhuman and degrading treatment (\u00a7 49). The appeal court refused to declare the body search and material evidence it had allegedly produced inadmissible and concluded that \u201cthe available evidence did not support the allegations of physical violence\u201d.",

When the complaint lodged by his lawyers on 13 October 2008 \u2212 which covered both limbs of what in essence was an Article 3 complaint \u2013 was rejected by the competent prosecutor on 17 October 2008, the majority claim that the applicant should have known that no investigation had been instigated into his allegations of physical violence and that there was no realistic prospect of one being provided in the future (\u00a7\u00a060). No judicial appeal lay against the prosecutor\u2019s refusal we are told. The majority reject the applicant\u2019s argument that raising allegations of physical abuse in the subsequent trial constituted an effective remedy as, according to the majority, the trial court was not authorised to order a preliminary investigation into those allegations and could not direct the prosecutor to do so (\u00a7 61). Two Georgian decisions in which a trial was similarly deemed not to constitute an effective remedy in relation to Article\u00a03 allegations of physical abuse are cited in support of this approach. As such, according to the majority, time started running in relation to the allegations of physical abuse on 17 October 2008, rendering this part of the applicant\u2019s Article\u00a03 complaint, which he lodged on 20 January 2011 some months after his conviction, as out of time. In contrast, the applicant\u2019s complaint in relation to the manner in which the strip search was carried out is not considered to have been lodged out of time. Firstly, the rejection of this complaint by the prosecutor in October 2008 did not preclude the trial court from examining it. Secondly, pursuant to the relevant provision of the CCP in relation to inadmissible evidence, this part of the Article 3 complaint could and should have been examined by the trial court (\u00a7 64).",

More importantly, both the trial and appeal courts responded to the two related aspects of his Article\u00a03 complaint, namely the preliminary physical abuse on arrest and the subsequent physical and psychological abuse during the strip search. As indicated previously, even if this may have been incorrect in terms of the letter of domestic law (a point on which we are neither convinced nor competent to pronounce), where an appellate court has examined the merits of a claim, even though it considers it inadmissible, Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a01 will have been complied with.",

However, when examining the merits of what is considered the other limb of the applicant\u2019s Article 3 complaint (strip search), the Chamber judgment recognises that the trial court was \u201cunder an obligation to do no more than examine whether the evidence obtained as a result of the search had in fact been obtained by inhuman and degrading treatment ... without there being a possibility that they could also proceed to holding responsible any perpetrator\u201d (\u00a7 73). Thus, in reality, the trial court was competent to perform only the one task the applicant asked of it \u2013 establish whether in the period of thirty minutes during and after his arrest he had been subject to inhuman and degrading treatment whether in relation to the physical abuse alleged or the manner in which the search was performed \u2013 and, if so, draw the necessary consequence for his trial, namely exclude the evidence obtained unlawfully. What it could not do in relation to the physical abuse alleged it could also not do in relation to the unlawfully performed strip search, namely investigate and prosecute the perpetrator(s) of the alleged abuse whether committed during the arrest or subsequently during the search. That does not mean raising the two limbs of his Article 3 complaint before the trial court was not an effective remedy for both limbs.",

Thus, in \u00a7 74, for example, the medical requests made by the applicant and refused, to which reference is made, were requests made because of the physical injuries (bruising, dizziness, suspected broken ribs and high blood pressure) which the applicant claimed to have sustained following the alleged physical abuse.",

However, how could the applicant have known that his appeal of 28 October 2008 to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office would receive no response? Furthermore, as indicated in \u00a7\u00a7\u00a052-53 of the judgment, in 2012-2013 an investigation was initiated and is still ongoing, rendering the \u201cno prospect\u201d line of reasoning somewhat redundant.",

However, when one looks closer at the Georgian precedents referred to, particularly Manukian v. Georgia\u00a0(dec.), no.\u00a049448/08, 3 May 2016, it becomes clear that it is not on all fours with the present case. The applicant in that case was a prisoner when the events which led to his allegations of ill-treatment and gave rise to criminal proceedings against him and other inmates occurred. He lodged no criminal complaint with the prosecuting authorities which, according to the Court \u201cwas the remedy normally available in Georgian law in respect of inhuman and degrading treatment allegedly caused by prison officials\u201d (see \u00a7\u00a033 of the decision in Manukian, cited above). This was not the case for the present applicant. The Committee of three judges in the Manukian case also relied on the same reasoning now employed by the Chamber (namely that the trial court could not order a preliminary investigation into the allegations nor direct a prosecutor to do so). However, for the reasons already outlined above, this is not a sufficient basis to conclude that a trial court is, in certain circumstances, not an appropriate forum for raising allegations in relation to Article 3. The fact that the trial and appeal courts did not admit an applicant\u2019s complaint or that a prosecutor remained passive throughout the proceedings should not render a potentially effective remedy ineffective. It\u00a0simply demonstrates that it was not effective in a given case. We are not in a position to determine whether Article 50 of the Georgian CCP (which enjoins a court, if appropriate grounds exist, to issue a decision), corresponds to a judicial discretion or something more. Suffice it to say that in relation to the strip search the Chamber judgment considers it sufficient that \u201cit cannot be excluded that a finding by the trial court in the criminal proceedings (of inhuman and degrading treatment) could trigger separate proceedings against a perpetrator\u201d. Thus, there is no real difference between the two parts of the applicant\u2019s Article\u00a03 complaint in terms of how the trial court could have dealt with them.",

If there are particularities in the Georgian system of remedies then of course these must be recognised and accommodated but there is no need to render excessively difficult an applicant\u2019s effective access to this Court in the process.",
