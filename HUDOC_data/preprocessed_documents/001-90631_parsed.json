The Court reiterates, however, the principle according to which an applicant cannot be blamed for taking full advantage of the resources afforded to the defence by national law (see Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 8\u00a0June 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0319-A, \u00a7 66). The same applied to the supervisory-review procedure, although it is not normally taken into consideration as a remedy under Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Berdzenishvili v.  (dec.), no.\u00a031697/03, ECHR 2004II (extracts)). Although the mere possibility of reopening a criminal case is prima facie compatible with Article 6 of the Convention, the Convention requires that the authorities allow the resumption of criminal proceedings only if serious legitimate considerations outweigh the principle of legal certainty (see Bratyakin v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a072776/01, 9\u00a0March 2006). Once such a reopening is allowed, the ensuing proceedings should be completed within a \u201creasonable time\u201d, regard being had to all pertinent factors (see, mutatis mutandis, Ivanov v. , no.\u00a015007/02, \u00a7\u00a074, 7\u00a0December 2006, and Henworth v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a0515/02, \u00a7\u00a029, 2 November 2004).",

It is incumbent on respondent States to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see S\u00fcrmeli v. Germany [GC], no. 75529/01, \u00a7\u00a0129, 8\u00a0June 2006).",
