In that connection, the administrative courts accepted that the applicant had been subjected to an unlawful act within the meaning of the SMRDA (see paragraph 18 above). Furthermore, the compensatory remedy under the SMRDA had the potential of resulting in damages being awarded in relation to that unlawful act (see paragraph 24 above). Consequently, by pursuing the two sets of proceedings \u2013 against the order for his isolation and for compensation on that account \u2013 the applicant attempted to exhaust the available domestic remedies. In doing so, he raised in substance at domestic level his complaint that he had been unlawfully deprived of liberty by virtue of being isolated and sought to obtain compensation in that respect. It cannot be said that the applicant\u2019s claim under the SMRDA before the administrative courts was doomed to failure from the outset (Jeronovi\u010ds v.

The Court does not exclude the possibility that measures adopted within a prison may disclose interferences with the right to liberty in exceptional circumstances. Generally, however, disciplinary steps, imposed formally or informally, which have effects on conditions of detention within a prison, cannot be considered to constitute deprivation of liberty (see Bollan v.

In Mancini, two accused persons were unlawfully held in custody for six days at a time when a lawful order for their house arrest was in force; in Gulub Atanasov, the applicant\u2019s house arrest was replaced by internment in a psychiatric institution. The Court found more specifically in Mancini (cited above) that a transfer from house arrest to a detention in prison altered the type of deprivation of liberty to which an applicant was subjected. The reason was that the latter entailed a change in the nature of the place of detention from a private home to a public institution. Unlike house arrest, detention in prison required integration of the individual into an overall organisation, sharing of activities and resources with other inmates, and strict supervision by the authorities of the main aspects of his day-to-day life (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 13-26). Similarly, in Gulub\u00a0Atanasov (cited above, \u00a7 71), the Court found that despite the fact that the applicant\u2019s situation in law remained unchanged, in practice the nature and degree of the restrictions on his liberty while in the hospital must have been very different from those associated with house arrest.",

The duration of his isolation \u2013 some forty-five days in all \u2013 was not decisive on its own but was considered a factor in the overall assessment of the situation.

Instead, it was a disciplinary measure imposed on him within the confines of the prison to which he was transferred to continue serving his lawfully imposed three-year sentence. The order was made following the rise in tensions and a physical altercation in the prison, in which the applicant had been involved, and one of the order\u2019s aims was to ensure the safety of all detainees (see paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 above).",

In this connection the Court finds relevant that the applicant had at the time been serving his prison sentence under the \u201cgeneral prison regime\u201d and had been continually confined for a number of months to prison after being forbidden to work outside or otherwise to leave the prison (see paragraph 6 above).",

The Court observes that the conditions in the disciplinary cell in which he was kept in isolation for fourteen days were clearly harsher when compared with those applicable under the \u201cgeneral prison regime\u201d (see paragraphs 23 and 22 above). In fact, the conditions to which the applicant was subjected while in that cell were comparable to the conditions of detention applied under the \u201cspecial prison regime\u201d to life and whole-life prisoners in Bulgaria (see paragraph 23 above), which have been the subject of examination by the Court under Article 3 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Harakchiev and Tolumov v. Bulgaria, nos.\u00a015018/11 and 61199/12, ECHR 2014). He was kept in the high-security prison wing with increased restrictions on his movement, an obligation to take his meals in his cell and a ban on watching television or listening to the radio during those fourteen days. Despite this, taking all the relevant circumstances into account, the Court is not convinced that those differences disclosed anything more than a variation in the regime and conditions in which the applicant was kept while in prison.",
