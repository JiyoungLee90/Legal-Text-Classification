The decisions on legal aid issues did not contain such elements.

Article 6 \u00a7 1 provided a guarantee for persons seeking legal assistance for the purposes of civil proceedings before the national courts, although a less extensive one than in criminal cases. The question of legal assistance should however be seen as an element of the right of access to a court, rather than the right to a fair hearing. In this context, the means by which a State ensured effective access to civil courts fell within its margin of appreciation (Airey v.

For this reason, the right enunciated in the Court\u2019s judgments concerning civil cases could not be comparable in scope to that guaranteed under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c). This also followed from the fact that the rights guaranteed by Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 had to be determined by reference to the particular facts and circumstances of an individual case. In consequence, the Government asserted that the problems involved in the present case, concerning a claim for reinstatement at work and compensation for unlawful termination of a contract, required to be distinguished from other, more complex cases, for example, regulating civil status and family relationships.",
