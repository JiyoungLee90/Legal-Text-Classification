Owing to the fact that some fourteen years had elapsed, the prospect of establishing the truth had significantly diminished. Some of the alleged witnesses of the event had died in the meantime. Those still alive had no relevant information about the identity of the men who had taken the applicant\u2019s husband (compare to G\u00fcrtekin and Others v. Cyprus (dec.), no. 60441/13, \u00a7 25, 11 March 2014).",

The applicants have not pointed to any other concrete avenues of enquiry that the police could in fact pursue. The facts of the case show that the key traceable witnesses were interviewed and the available evidence collected and reviewed. The Court notes that the police pursued every line of information. The fact that the investigation did not succeed in identifying the perpetrators does not necessarily render the investigation ineffective. In the circumstances, the Court cannot impugn the authorities for any culpable disregard, discernible bad faith or lack of will (compare to G\u00fcrtekin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 27).",
