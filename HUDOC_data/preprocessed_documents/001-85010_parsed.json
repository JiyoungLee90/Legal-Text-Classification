The requirement to prove the truth of a value-judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes the freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see Jerusalem v. Austria, no.\u00a026958/95, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2001II, and Busuioc, cited above, \u00a7 61). Moreover, it has to be recalled that the journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 313, \u00a7 38).",

Switzerland [GC], no.\u00a069698/01, \u00a7 137, 10 December 2007). The Court cannot but observe the peculiarity of the manner in which the proceedings were conducted before the domestic courts. Indeed, the Court notes a series of elements which, examined cumulatively, leads it to such a conclusion. In particular, Mr\u00a0Stepaniuc's action was examined despite the fact that he had failed to pay court fees, which fact, by itself, should normally have rendered the action procedurally inadmissible. Moreover, not only did he fail to appear before the courts but he was not even represented. At the same time, the applicant's requests for adjournment were rejected without any reasons being given while the evidence presented by it was entirely disregarded by the judges. The Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Justice failed even to examine the applicant's submissions concerning Judge I. M.'s alleged lack of independence and impartiality.",
