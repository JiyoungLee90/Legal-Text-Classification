In this context the Court reiterates that it is not incompatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 to confer the power to adjudicate on civil rights and obligations on administrative authorities, provided that their decisions are subject to subsequent control by a \u201ctribunal\u201d that has full jurisdiction. It therefore remains to be ascertained whether the \u2019s scope of review was sufficient. In the sphere of cases falling under the civil head of Article 6 the Court has occasionally answered this question in the negative (Obermeier v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 28 June 1990, Series A no. 179, p. 23, \u00a7 70). In other cases it has answered this question in the affirmative (see for instance, Zumtobel v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 21 September 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0268A, pp. 13-14, \u00a7\u00a7 31-32; Fischer v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0312, p. 18, \u00a7 34). However, the Court has always examined this issue not in the abstract but on a case-to-case basis once the proceedings were terminated. As the proceedings in the present case are still pending before the Administrative Court, the applicant\u2019s complaint about lack of access to a tribunal is premature and must be rejected under 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

Austria, no. 29800/96, \u00a7\u00a7 39-40, ECHR 2001-I). In the present case, the applicant did make use of this remedy. He has, therefore, raised the \u201creasonable time\u201d issue before the competent domestic authorities and invited them to accelerate the proceedings. In the Court\u2019s view, a detailed examination as to whether the applicant could have made more efficient use of the remedy by using it at other stages of the proceedings, would overstretch the duties incumbent on an applicant pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, Wohlmeyer Bau GmbH v.\u00a0Austria, no. 20077/02, \u00a7 45, 8 July 2004).

At that date the applicant lodged an application against the Federal Minister\u2019s failure to decide on his application with the .
