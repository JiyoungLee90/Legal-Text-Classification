As regards procedural guarantees, it appears that the commissions had no clear rules of procedure (see H v.

However, the Court considers that the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of Article 6. There is no requirement that remedies that are neither adequate nor effective should be used (see, mutatis mutandis, Sak\u0131k and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 26 November 1997, Reports 1997VII, p.\u00a02625, \u00a7 53). Furthermore, for the right of access to a court to be effective, an individual must have a clear, practical opportunity to challenge an act which is an interference with his or her rights (see De Geouffre de la Pradelle v.

All judgments and decisions of the  which the Government produced in support of their averment date from the period 19992002. The first reported case in which the Supreme Administrative Court overturned the refusal of a lower court to accept for examination an appeal against a decision of a special medical commission dates from 4 February 1999, and it seems that it set a new trend in that court's caselaw (see paragraph 34 above). In these circumstances, the Court cannot find it established that at the relevant time the applicant could have obtained judicial review of the two decisions of the CDEC which concerned her and which were later considered as binding by the courts examining her action for damages.",
