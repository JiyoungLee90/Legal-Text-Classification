[GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7 159, 9 April 2009). For such a procedural obligation to come into effect, a significant proportion of the investigating steps required by this provision will have been or ought to have been taken after the critical date (ibid., \u00a7 163). Subsequently the Court applied this principle to cases concerning deaths at the hands of private individuals (see Lyubov Efimenko v. Ukraine, no. 75726/01, \u00a7 63, 25 November 2010; and Frande\u015f v. Romania (dec.) no. 35802/05, 17 May 2011).

Bulgaria (no. 39272/98, ECHR 2003XII) the Court referred to both Article 3 and Article 8, finding that there was an obligation on States to enact criminal-law provisions effectively punishing rape and to apply them in practice through effective investigation (see \u00a7\u00a7 148-153 of that judgment). Noting that in the present case the applicant\u2019s complaints are limited to the effectiveness of the investigation and that Article 3 provides sufficient legal basis for the State\u2019s duty to conduct an investigation into serious offences against an individual\u2019s physical integrity, the Court considers that it is not necessary in the particular circumstances of the instant case to decide whether its temporal jurisdiction also extends, in situations like the present one, to issues under Article 8. Therefore it will confine itself to determining whether the events that occurred after the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Bulgaria disclosed a breach of Article 3 under its procedural limb (see Tuna, cited above, \u00a7 63).",

This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, such as witness testimony and forensic evidence, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see Denis Vasilyev v. , no. 32704/04, \u00a7 100, 17 December 2009, with further references). The promptness of the authorities\u2019 reaction to the complaints is an important factor (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a7 133 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV). Consideration has been given in the Court\u2019s judgments to matters such as the opening of investigations, delays in identifying witnesses or taking statements (see M\u0103t\u0103saru and Savi\u0163chi v.

Italy, no. 31143/96, \u00a7 37, 18\u00a0October 2001), and unjustified protraction of the criminal proceedings resulting in the expiry of the statute of limitations (see Angelova and Iliev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 55523/00, \u00a7\u00a7 101-103, 26 July 2007).",

It is highly significant, however, that when Mr D.I. was eventually \u201cfound\u201d eight years later, it turned out that he had never changed his address (see paragraph 16 above). Apparently no attempts were made to establish his whereabouts during this considerable period. No consideration was given to the possibility of separating the cases against Mr T.Z. and Mr D.I. and proceeding with the case in respect of the former. In the Court\u2019s view, the authorities\u2019 inaction verges on arbitrariness, having regard, in particular, to the gravity of the facts and the applicant\u2019s age at the relevant time. As a result, a number of urgent investigative measures, such as the commissioning of an expert examination of the applicant\u2019s clothes and interviewing witnesses, were taken only many years after the rape (see paragraphs 21 and 30 above). It is to be noted furthermore that two decisions to discontinue the criminal proceedings were issued, only to be subsequently set aside by the supervising prosecutors (see paragraphs 24-34 above).",
