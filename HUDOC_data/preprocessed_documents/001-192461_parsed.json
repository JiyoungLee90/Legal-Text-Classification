Nevertheless, the first-instance court had continued to examine the case while the Supreme Court was considering the reassignment application, which it eventually granted after the first-instance court had already delivered its judgment. In that case the Court observed that the Supreme Court\u2019s reassignment decision suggested that the applicant company\u2019s fear about a risk of bias of the courts in the region, on account of an important position occupied by the plaintiff in the region\u2019s courts, was not without substance.",

The procedure for reassignment of cases invoked by the applicant company was intended to ensure the necessary safeguards in cases where parties could have doubts as to the impartiality of a region\u2019s courts in such situations. The Court, in its case-law, has often stressed the importance of such safeguards (see, for example, Remli\u00a0v.\u00a0France, 23 April 1996, \u00a7 48, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II).",
