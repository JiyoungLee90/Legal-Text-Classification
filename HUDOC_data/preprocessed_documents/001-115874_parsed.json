The cell was unventilated, the only air coming in from several holes in a net covering the window. The cell was very cold in winter and very hot in summer, the walls and ceiling were damp and the toilet was not separated from the rest of the cell. During the first five months of detention, the applicant was not issued with any bedding and had to sleep on a bare mattress. When bedding was finally provided, it was changed very rarely. The cell was never cleaned; his mattress was full of parasitic insects and he could not sleep as a result. The light was too weak in the cell for reading. Showers were only allowed once a week and the shower day did not coincide with the day of the week when fresh bedding was issued, which meant the continuous presence of parasitic insects. Food was inadequate and of poor quality; the portions did not conform to the standard decided upon by the Government, particularly in respect of meat, fish, eggs and dairy products.",

The applicant also asked for an additional hour of exercise time for all the detainees in his cell in an attempt to improve the overcrowding situation. The applicant made six complaints between 19 March and 15 May 2007 about the lack of ventilation and access to fresh air aggravating the overcrowding. On 25\u00a0March 2007 he asked to be transferred to a non-smoking cell because he was subjected to passive smoking, which he argued was \u201ca far more serious punishment than the eight months of imprisonment to which [he] had been sentenced\u201d. On 3 May 2007 he complained about the failure to provide adequate food as required by the relevant Government decisions, claiming, inter alia, that reduced quantities of sugar and bread had been distributed to detainees in his cell. The applicant asked for portion sizes to be checked periodically to ensure they were meeting the statutory minimum. On four occasions between 30 March and 28 May 2007 the applicant complained about the presence of parasitic insects and asked for fresh bedding to coincide with shower day so as to avoid the risk of continued infestation. On 12\u00a0May 2007 the applicant asked for various materials in order to carry out repairs to their cell (together with his cell mates), as the ceiling was dark and the paint was peeling off the walls.",

One particularly welcome outcome of these measures was the reduction of the country\u2019s prisoner population. At the time of the 2007 visit the total number of prisoners stood at 8,033 (including 1,290 in pre-trial detention), compared to 10,591 in 2004. This positive trend can be attributed to recent legislative changes, including the entry into force in July 2005 of a new Execution of Sentences Code and amendments to both the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of conditional early releases, as well as a wider use of alternatives to imprisonment and a more selective application of pre-trial detention by the courts.",

In order to counter the charges against him, the applicant was provided with an opportunity to put forward his defence before the Moldovan courts at three levels of jurisdiction. These courts examined the applicant\u2019s allegations, as evidenced by the fact that both the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court reduced the penalties imposed on the applicant in the previous rulings. Furthermore, when addressing the applicant\u2019s allegations in a ruling that found several mitigating circumstances in his favour and reduced the penalties imposed upon him by the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court made express reference to the applicant\u2019s objections to the lower court\u2019s application of Article 329 \u00a7 1 of the Moldovan Criminal Code. However, it dismissed those objections, considering them unsubstantiated and contradicted by the material evidence, likewise broadly making reference to the facts of the case, which had, moreover, already been examined in two previous court rulings (see paragraph 11 of the Court\u2019s judgment).",
