As they approached, Seyran Ayvazyan was in the garden and, having seen the police officers, ran towards the house. The police officers started chasing him. As Seyran Ayvazyan entered the house and was about to shut the door, police officer V.B. reached him and started to push the door open. At that moment Seyran Ayvazyan stabbed V.B. in the arm and cheek with the knife, through the half-open door, and managed to shut the door. V.B. was taken by car to hospital, while A.A. and A.E., who remained at the house, called Tumanyan police station and reported the incident. Then they tried to persuade Seyran Ayvazyan to come out, but the latter refused to do so, threatening to kill anybody who tried to approach the house and sharpening his knives in full view. They contacted one of Seyran Ayvazyan\u2019s sisters, who lived in the same village, but she refused to come. Having received the call from A.A. and A.E, nine more police officers, including A.S., N.N., G.M., R.M., H.Gev., and H.Gri, led by Major A.B., the chief of Tumanyan police station, arrived at the house and surrounded it. The mayor of Odzun, an ambulance and the fire brigade were also called. Another attempt was made to have Seyran Ayvazyan\u2019s relatives, who lived in the same village, come to the scene in order to persuade him to surrender, but they refused to come. Then for about five hours the police officers tried to persuade Seyran\u00a0Ayvazyan to surrender, but he continued to display the same threatening behaviour as earlier. In the meantime, the police officers contacted the head of Vanadzor Psychiatric Hospital, who told them that it would only be possible to tranquillise Seyran Ayvazyan only in hospital.",

After the fire hose had been turned on, six police officers, A.S., N.N., G.M., R.M., H.Gev. and A.A., upon an order from the chief of Tumanyan police station, pushed open the door and entered the house. H.Gev., who was the first to enter, held a small wooden table in front of him as a shield against a knife attack. After the police officers entered, they saw that the way from the corridor into the room had been barricaded with furniture. The police officers decided on the spot to leave the house and the entire group went out. Having seen that the police officers were leaving, Seyran Ayvazyan moved towards them with a knife in each hand, reached H.Gev. by the door to the porch, and stabbed him in the head with one of the knives. H.Gev. immediately fell as a result of the stabbing. As he was lying on the ground, Seyran Ayvazyan tried to stab him again, but at that moment another police officer, H.Gri., who was guarding the entrance, fired a warning shot in the air from his automatic rifle and, seeing that Seyran\u00a0Ayvazyan was still trying to stab H.Gev., shot at Seyran Ayvazyan\u2019s legs. At the same time, and independently of those actions, police officers A.S., A.A. and R.M., seeing that H.Gev. had fallen as a result of the assault and that Seyran Ayvazyan was trying to stab him again, started to shoot with their pistols at Seyran\u00a0Ayvazyan\u2019s legs. A.S. fired eight shots, while A.A. and R.M. fired three shots each. As a result of the shooting, Seyran\u00a0Ayvazyan was wounded, fell and died.",

However, the onemonth time-limit prescribed by Article 290 was applicable to her case. The appeal had only been lodged on 27 June 2007 \u2013 namely outside that one-month timelimit. Thus, both the Regional Court and the Court of Appeal had exceeded their temporal jurisdiction by examining the merits of An.A.\u2019s complaint. This in itself was sufficient grounds for rejecting the appeal; however, the Court of Cassation found it necessary \u2013 taking into account the fact that (a) both courts had examined the merits of the case and had reached findings on the merits, and (b) it was called upon to ensure uniform application of the law \u2013 to express a number of legal positions on the matter, which could provide guidance to lower courts in similar cases.",

Referring to Articles 27 \u00a7 1, 175 and\u00a0182 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the CCP, the Court of Cassation concluded that it was impossible to answer that question unequivocally. In particular, a number of factors suggested that criminal case no. 55200706 had been instituted on account of the acts committed by Seyran Ayvazyan rather than his killing. Firstly, the proceedings had been instituted only under Article\u00a0104 \u00a7 2 (1), in conjunction with Article 34 of the CC (namely in respect of attempted murder of two or more persons) and therefore could not legally be characterised as applying to his killing. Secondly, the wording of the decision to discontinue the proceedings also contained a refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers implicated in his shooting, which confirmed that no criminal proceedings had been instituted on account of that incident.",

Thus, the descriptive part of the wording of the decision to institute proceedings had mentioned the fact that Seyran\u00a0Ayvazyan had been taken to hospital and had died. Furthermore, Seyran Ayvazyan\u2019s sister, An.A., had been granted victim status in the criminal case by decision of the investigator, moreover, that decision had stated that Seyran Ayvazyan had been deprived of his life \u201cas a result of a crime\u201d. Lastly, certain investigative measures taken in the course of the criminal proceedings had been aimed at obtaining evidence concerning the circumstances of Seyran\u00a0Ayvazyan\u2019s death, including the inspections of the crime scene, of Seyran\u00a0Ayvazyan\u2019s body and of his clothes, the autopsy, the forensic examination of his clothes and the interviews with the police officers who had shot at Seyran\u00a0Ayvazyan or witnessed the shootings.

Thus, the investigating authority had failed to secure all the evidence relating to the incident. As regards those officers who had been questioned, H.Gri. had been questioned eight days, N.N. nine days and A.A. ten days after the incident. No measures had been taken in the meantime to isolate them from each other. While there was no evidence to suggest that the police officers had colluded with each other, the fact that no steps had been taken to minimise such risk constituted a significant shortcoming in the investigation. Furthermore, no adequate assessment had been made of the direction of the bullets fired at Seyran\u00a0Ayvazyan.

The Court accepts that some form of official investigation took place (see Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey [GC], no. 24014/05, \u00a7 171, 14\u00a0April 2015).

While there is no evidence to suggest that these officers colluded with each other or with their colleagues in the Tumanyan police force, the mere fact that appropriate steps were not taken to reduce the risk of such collusion amounts to a significant shortcoming in the adequacy of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 330, ECHR 2007II).",

Even those few questions which were asked appear either not to have been sufficiently inquisitorial and detailed or incapable of clarifying the circumstances of the fatal shooting (see paragraph 28 above). A number of highly relevant facts were ignored and, without seeking proper clarification, the investigator merely accepted the accounts of the police officers, who could not have been impartial witnesses. No attempts were made to determine, inter alia, questions such as why six out of the ten bullets fired hit Seyran Ayvazyan in the back and why, if all the police officers were allegedly aiming at the legs, at least one of them ended up shooting much higher \u2013 in the area of the chest (see, mutatis mutandis, Karandja v. Bulgaria, no. 69180/01, \u00a7 66, 6 October 2010).

It is true that the Court of Cassation stated that there had been no eyewitnesses to the shooting other than the police officers but it is not clear on what evidence this statement was based. It is undisputed that the incident took place outside on the porch and was visible even to those police officers who did not take part in the arrest operation and the fatal shooting (see paragraph 29 above). None of the persons mentioned above were, however, summoned for questioning for the purpose of clarifying whether and to what extent they had witnessed the incident. Nor did the investigator try to identify the villagers who, according to several police statements (see paragraph 29 above), had gathered at the scene, albeit at a distance, and might possibly have been able to shed some light on its circumstances.",

Thus, there was a clear contradiction between the statement of police officer H.Gri., who said that police officer A.S. had been next to him at the time of the shooting, and the sketch map of the incident, according to which H.Gri. had been on the porch and police officer S.M. had been next to him (see paragraphs 15 and 28 above). No attempt was made to determine the precise trajectories of the bullets and there was no reconstruction of the incident. Nor did the ballistics test clarify vital information such as who had fired the fatal shot. Furthermore, no confrontations were held between the police officers. Without such investigative measures being undertaken, it was impossible to check the arresting officers\u2019 accounts of the events. It is also notable that no assessment was made of whether the police officers\u2019 response to the alleged threat to police officer H.Gev.\u2019s life was proportionate; this failure to make an assessment is especially striking given the number of shots fired (fifteen \u2013 of which ten hit the target) and the fact that Seyran Ayvazyan was not armed with a firearm but only a knife.",
