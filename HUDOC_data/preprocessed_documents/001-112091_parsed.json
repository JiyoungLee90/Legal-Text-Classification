The debate relating to the connection between striptease dancing and prostitution is tenacious, not least because abroad such operations are often run side by side, openly and in a legal manner, but also because of the nature of these activities. As an example of the persistence of such rumours in Iceland, a report on human trafficking in Iceland (court document no. 7), by the US Embassy in , dating from 2006, could be mentioned. At page 3 of the report, it is stated that during its compilation, a member of the embassy staff was offered sexual services at the restaurant Goldfinger. It is an established fact that the operation of pole-dancing establishments comprises obtaining girls, for the most part foreign nationals, for the purpose of dancing scantily clad or nude in front of the clients of the establishment, or in private cubicles, and, as indicated by the term, it is hard to observe everything that goes on inside such closedoff spaces. Furthermore, the plaintiff has admitted in public that there have been incidents at Goldfinger where clients were offered sexual services, cf. an interview with the plaintiff on Channel 2, 1 June 2007 (court document no. 6). Because of the mystique, among other things, which to most people, surrounds such activities as well as persistent rumours regarding prostitution and human trafficking, the defendants felt that a discussion of this matter would be of interest and relevance to the general public. The defendants refer, for example, to a news item contained in court document no. 9, which cites the Chief of Police in Reykjav\u00edk as stating in his report regarding a licence for Goldfinger that European research has shown striptease dancers to be subjected to various kinds of abuse and, in many cases, they become the victims of human trafficking or other crimes. The defendants feel that the plaintiff has to accept and tolerate controversial discussion with regard to the operation of Goldfinger .... The presentation of the plaintiff\u2019s case, however, is characterised by the shortcoming that he appears to identify himself with the operation of all the poledancing establishments in .\u201d",

It ordered the applicant to pay the appellant ISK 500,000 (approximately 3,000 euros (EUR)) in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and ISK 400,000, plus interest, for his costs before the District Court and the Supreme Court.

The grounds of the case of each party are sufficiently described in the judgment which is being challenged. As indicated therein, the plaintiff based his claim for the annulment of the remarks in judicial claim no. 1, items A to G, on the premise that they contained defamatory innuendos regarding his character, which are the responsibility of the [applicant] as the author of the article, see section 15 (2) of Act No. 57/1956. The title page of the article stated that its text had been prepared by [the applicant]. She confirmed at the court hearing that she had been the author of the article and had also formulated the sub-headings. She had determined the wording of the sub-headings, which, like the article, contained a near-verbatim rendering of [Mrs\u00a0Z]\u2019s statements. This was indeed her ([Mrs Z]\u2019s) account. [The applicant] stated that she had tape-recorded the interview, used the recording as a foundation for the article and had sent the result to [Mrs Z]. Subsequently [Mrs Z] had confirmed by email that this was an accurate rendering of her account. When comparing the manuscript of the interview and its tape-recording, on the one hand, and the article in question with its subheadings, on the other hand, it is however clear that this is not a verbatim rendering of the interviewee\u2019s statements. However, it is also clear that the [applicant] in the main accurately rendered the substance of what her interviewee had said. As mentioned above, she had later confirmed that her story had been accurately rendered. Since the [applicant] is, as stated on the front page [...], the author of the text and has admitted to having written the article and its sub-headings, she is considered to be the author of the article and the sub-headings in the sense of section 15 (2) of Act No.\u00a057/1956 and as such bears responsibility for this work. It is of no consequence whether [Mrs Z] may also be regarded as the author of the article in the sense of this provision of the law.",

The words in items \u0395 and F, however, convey the suggestion that Mr Y had deprived the girls who worked for him of their freedom, which constituted an offence under Article 226 of the Penal Code. The main text under the sub-heading \u2018Prostitution the rule rather than the exception\u2019 contained, inter alia, the words specified in items A and B of judicial claim no. 1, as well as other allegations relating to [Mr Y] and his striptease premises, Goldfinger. It is clear from the relationship between the main text and the heading, that the heading is directed against [Mr Y]. The same applies to this heading as to the remarks in judicial claim items A, B., \u0421 and G above. The remarks identified in items A, B, C, E, F and G of judicial claim no. 1 and the sub-heading referred to in item A of judicial claim no. 2 constitute a violation of Article 235 of the Penal Code. They do not comprise an expression of opinion or values but statements of fact that are not covered by Article 73 of the Icelandic Constitution with respect to freedom of expression.

According to this testimony, Mr Y had received half of the revenue derived from this activity.

The Supreme Court rejected Mr Y\u2019s request to have all the remarks relating to prostitution in Goldfinger declared null and void.

It was also revealed in the case that the Ministry for Social Affairs had requested the police to open an investigation into whether workers at strip clubs had been deprived of their liberty.

Secondly, he was alleged to have deprived the women who had worked for him of their freedom. These allegations involved accusations of criminal conduct proscribed by Articles\u00a0206 and 226 of the Penal Code, respectively. Under Article 241(1) of the Code, the Supreme Court declared the statements null and void. The Court sees no cause for questioning the Supreme Court\u2019s assessment that the allegations were defamatory and that the reasons relied on by the latter were relevant to the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and reputation of Mr\u00a0Y.",

The Court is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s portrayal of Mr Y in her article \u201cwas clearly not a necessary contribution to the said public debate\u201d. Whether or not a publication concerns an issue of public concern should depend on a broader assessment of the subject matter and the context of the publication (T\u00f8nsbergs Blad A.S. and Haukom, cited above, \u00a7 87). In this regard it is to be noted that well before the publication on 23 August 2007 of the applicant\u2019s article, there was an ongoing public debate in Icelandic print and televised media on the tightening of strip club regulations or the banning of such clubs altogether. Another magazine, \u00cdsafold, had in June 2007 published an article on the links between such clubs and prostitution maintaining that the conditions of strip club dancers originating from eastern Europe were comparable to human trafficking. Thereafter Vikan had published interviews with three east European women who worked at Mr Y\u2019s club, Goldfinger, and who affirmed that they were happy working for him and that criticism of strip clubs could only be explained by the envy of certain women. In the same issue, Vikan had published interviews with two anonymous strip dancers who described prostitution and drug addiction as the negative side of their jobs. In reaction to the positive portrayal of the business conveyed by the former three women, Mrs Z had contacted Vikan to offer her story about her own experience of working as a strip dancer at several strip clubs, including for Mr Y at Goldfinger. In the Court\u2019s view, which moreover does not appear to be disputed, there can be no doubt that the applicant\u2019s article seen as a whole concerned a matter of serious public concern in , as in other European States. However, it does not transpire from the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning that this consideration carried any weight in, let alone was seen as relevant to, its assessment.",
