In case of a life-threatening injury or death, the above obligation calls for an effective independent judicial system to ensure enforcement of the aforementioned legislative framework by providing appropriate redress (see, for example, Anna Todorova v. Bulgaria, no. 23302/03, \u00a7 72, 24 May 2011). This obligation also applies in the context of designing a framework for protection of life from road traffic accidents (see, for example, Al Fayed v. France (dec.), no. 38501/02, \u00a7\u00a7 73-78, 27 September 2007; Rajkowska v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 37393/02, 27 November 2007; Railean v. Moldova, no.\u00a023401/04, \u00a7 30, 5 January 2010). An effective judicial system, as required by Article 2, may, and under certain circumstances must, include recourse to the criminal law (see Cioban v. Romania (dec.), no. 18295/08, \u00a7\u00a025, 11 March 2014) but if the infringement of the right to life is not intentional, Article 2 does not necessarily require such remedies; the State may meet its obligation by affording victims a civil\u2011law remedy, either alone or in conjunction with a criminal\u2011law one, enabling any responsibility of the individuals concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages, to be obtained (see Anna Todorova, cited above, \u00a7 73).",

What is important, however, is that whatever form the investigation takes, the available legal remedies, taken together, must amount to legal means capable of establishing the facts, holding accountable those at fault and providing appropriate redress. Any deficiency in the investigation, undermining its ability to establish the cause of the death or those responsible for it, may lead to the finding that the Convention requirements have not been met (see Antonov v.

It is true that in his letter of 16 June 2006, in which he inquired about the progress of the proceedings, the applicant accepted that there was the possibility that he had not received information about the course of the proceedings because he had been away for a while (see paragraph 18 above). However, as there is no evidence before the Court that any attempt was made to serve the decision not to open the investigation on the applicant, the Court, noting that the guarantees of Article 2 of the Convention must be interpreted and applied so as to make their safeguards practical and effective and not theoretical and illusory (see, amongst many others, Banel v. Lithuania, no. 14326/11, \u00a7 62, 18 June 2013), cannot make a firm conclusion that in fact the applicant could not have been served with the decision had the domestic authorities ever attempted to do this at the relevant time.",
