It stated that the medical records did not contain the necessary objective clinical symptomatology to confirm the diagnosis of the closed fracture of the ribs, the contusion of the neck and the burns on the applicant\u2019s hands. As regards the lesions on the applicant\u2019s hands, they lacked objective morphological characteristics typical of lesions caused by electric current. The diagnosis could not, therefore, be the subject of forensic medical assessment. The applicant\u2019s other injuries recorded in connection with the events of 25\u00a0April 2008, notably his concussion, the bruises on his face, the abrasions on his lips and on the back of his hands, the circular bruise on his left wrist and the contusion of the left side of his rib cage, were objectively supported by the medical documentation. The circular bruise on the left wrist could have been caused by a handcuff. The remaining injuries had been inflicted as a result of an impact with a blunt hard object. This could have been a fist, a shod foot or any other blunt hard object with a limited surface, given the form, small size and isolated character of the injuries. The lesions on the applicant\u2019s face and hands could not have been caused as a result of the applicant\u2019s rubbing his face with his denim jacket and sitting on his hands (as had been suggested by police officers Sh. and M., see paragraphs 58 and 60 below). The injuries could have been inflicted on 25\u00a0April 2008. They had caused a short-term \u2013 not exceeding twenty-one days \u2013 health disorder and should therefore be classified as minor health damage.",

Instances of ill-founded refusals to open criminal cases certainly occurred. Thus, during six months of 2010 about 41,000\u00a0illfounded refusals to open a criminal case had been revoked by the heads of investigative bodies (they referred to Communication DD(2010)591 of the Russian Federation of 23 November 2010 concerning the Mikheyev group of cases for the 1100th meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe). However, such instances received a fair assessment and were followed up with strict disciplinary measures against the guilty officials, as far as their dismissal from investigative organs. The Government further explained that the inquiry into a complaint of a crime under Article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was not an \u201cinvestigation\u201d (\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435) within the meaning of the Code.

Firstly, there was an effective criminal-law remedy, notably a criminal investigation into the allegations of ill-treatment by police officers which could lead to the conviction of police officers. The Government referred to and submitted a series of judgments delivered by courts in 2008-2010 in different regions (the Astrakhan, Kemerovo, Lipetsk, Moscow, Rostov and Ryazan regions and the Republics of Tatarstan and Khakasiya), in which police officers of criminal investigation units and other police staff had been convicted under Article 286 of the Criminal Code of crimes which could qualify as violations of Article\u00a03. The Government submitted further that investigative authorities\u2019 acts and decisions, in particular refusals to open a criminal case, were amenable to judicial review under Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Lastly, there were civil judicial remedies to complain about decisions and acts of State organs and their officials and to request compensation for the damage caused.",

There were structural problems which prevented an effective investigation and prosecution in cases of illtreatment by the police. Those structural problems had been analysed in a memorandum by a group of Russian human-rights NGOs, including the applicant\u2019s representative, the Committee against Torture, which had been submitted to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (DD(2010)385). In particular, it was stressed that there was a common practice of replacing a fullscale criminal investigation with preinvestigation inquiries under Article\u00a0144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Such practice was an obstacle to the prompt and thorough investigation of torture cases. The short time-limits for a pre-investigation inquiry and the limited powers of an investigator within the framework of a preinvestigation inquiry did not allow for establishment of the facts and circumstances of incidents. However, the prospect of an \u201cunsuccessful\u201d investigation not resulting in charges being brought against the alleged perpetrators, which was assessed as a professional failure, made investigators reluctant to open a criminal case. This cycle of a weak refusal to open a criminal case, its revocation, and the ensuing additional round of preinvestigation inquiry was being repeated for an unlimited number of times and could last for years.",

The ambulance doctor, who saw the applicant on 26 April 2008, twentyseven hours after the alleged illtreatment, recorded the swelling and hyperaemia of both hands. Some hours later at hospital no. 40 the applicant was diagnosed with burns on his hands (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above). The possibility that the lesions and scars on his hands had been caused from contact with an electrical source was not excluded by the expert in forensic medicine, who examined the applicant in person and saw the scars on his hands on 14 July 2008, or by Dr\u00a0L.M. (see paragraphs 37 and 39 above). The investigative committee did not explain why the 2009 expert opinion should have carried more weight. The expert who drew up the 2008 opinion had had the advantage of examining the applicant in person (notably the scars on his hands), whereas the one who drew up the 2009 opinion had not.

No confrontation was ever held between the applicant and the police officers who completely denied his allegations, or between the police officers whose statements were contradictory or vague. For example, operational officer K.O. stated that after his and S.V.\u2019s failed attempts to interview the applicant, they had taken him to the officer on duty (see paragraph\u00a074 above).

In another set of proceedings their decision was not executed by the investigative committee, which meant that the defect identified by the courts (see paragraphs 83-84 above) continued to reappear in the committee\u2019s seven subsequent decisions throughout the following year (see paragraphs 68 and 70 above). Lastly, the domestic court upheld the investigative committee\u2019s decision not to open a criminal case. In doing so, the court \u2013 without exercising its own independent scrutiny \u2013 satisfied itself that the defects identified by the investigative committee\u2019s own hierarchy had been addressed in the committee\u2019s latest decision (see paragraphs 88-90 above).",
