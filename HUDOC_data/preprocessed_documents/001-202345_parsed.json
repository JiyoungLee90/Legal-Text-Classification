Regarding, in particular, searches of premises and seizures, the Court will assess whether the reasons adduced to justify such measures were relevant and sufficient and whether the aforementioned proportionality principle has been adhered to (see, for example, K.S. and M.S. v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7 43; see also Cr\u00e9mieux v.\u00a0France, 25\u00a0February 1993, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03840, Series A no. 256B; Miailhe v.\u00a0France (no. 1), 25 February 1993, \u00a7 36-38, Series A no. 256C; and Buck, cited above, \u00a7\u00a045).

It is also clear that the search had a general basis in domestic law, as interpreted by the national courts in the present case, having, inter alia, been ordered by an investigating judge on the basis of Articles 77 \u00a7 1 and 78 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with a view to uncovering the relevant facts related to a serious crime which had already been committed (see paragraphs 23, 24 and 8 above). This is, of course, quite separate from the issue of the absence of a second witness during the search (see paragraph 25 above), a matter which should, in the Court\u2019s view, more appropriately be considered in the context of the procedural safeguards discussed below. The search in question was ordered with a view to uncovering physical evidence of a serious offence, and thus in pursuit of a \u201clegitimate aim\u201d, namely the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights of others (see paragraph\u00a072 above). What remains to be resolved, therefore, is whether the interference with the applicant\u2019s home was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d within the meaning of Article 8, that is, whether the interference was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",

Bulgaria, no. 63638/14, \u00a7 71, 19 January 2017). The investigating judge therefore had a duty to shed light on this incident, given its particularly serious nature, and to attempt to uncover all the relevant facts including the identity of the possible perpetrators, irrespective of whether he actually had personal contact with the police officers prior to the search warrant being issued. It is also understood that, in any event, there was never anything to suggest that the authorities themselves had tampered with or attempted to fabricate any evidence against the applicant (see paragraph 59 above), who was ultimately not even formally charged with the crime in question (see paragraph 14 above).",

The police themselves had already informed the investigating judge that the seizure of the shoes was necessary in order to compare them to the footprints found at the scene of the crime, while the leather jacket was an object taken following the murder (see paragraph 5 above). The search warrant in question cannot therefore be deemed to have been vague. Specifically, quite apart from whether it might have been possible to frame the warrant in even more precise terms, it was sufficient, in the given circumstances, that its scope was limited by the objects specifically mentioned and the reference to the offence in question; this in turn circumscribed the discretion of the officers who carried out the search and authorised them to seize only the items which could be seen as being potentially connected with the alleged offence (see, mutatis mutandis, Posevini, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072). The reasons given for the search were therefore both relevant and sufficient in the particular circumstances of the present case (see the case-law cited in paragraph 73 above).",

Moreover, the applicant\u2019s lawyer signed the seizure certificate and the official record of the search-and-seizure operation, and in the case of the latter raised no objections to the search procedure as such but only to the reasoning of the search warrant (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). In fact, the witness who was present during the search likewise made no objections to the search as it was carried out.

In particular, the latter Code, inter alia, specifically: (i)\u00a0refers to the taking of DNA samples by means of a \u201cbuccal swab\u201d; (ii) states that the procedural steps in question have to be carried out by an expert; and (iii)\u00a0limits the circle of persons from whom a buccal swab sample may be taken without their consent (see paragraphs 29-32 above). Concerning this last point, the Court would note, in particular, that Article 131 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, as in force at the relevant time, provided, inter alia, that a blood sample could be taken from, or \u201cother medical procedures\u201d could be undertaken in respect of, any given person if this was deemed medically necessary in order to establish facts \u201cof importance\u201d to the criminal investigation, thus allowing such procedures in respect of a potentially very large group of persons.
