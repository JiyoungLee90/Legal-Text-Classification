A military commission must organise a medical examination of each individual, must determine, with regard to the state of his health, whether he is fit for military service and must decide whether the individual should be included in the military service register, placed on the reserve list, considered partially fit for military service or excused from serving in the army if considered unfit for military service (section 9 \u00a7 6).",

However, the doctors of the military medical commission who had examined the applicant and found him fit for military service could not possibly have diagnosed the illness given the absence of evident clinical symptoms at the time of the conscription, the lack of health complaints on behalf of the applicant and the latter\u2019s failure to undergo any specific medical examinations and provide the commission with medical documents showing the presence of the illness. The Government stressed that specific medical in-patient examinations were required to diagnose the illness. Furthermore, neither the investigating authorities nor the courts had established that the military medical commission had deliberately disregarded the state of the applicant\u2019s health in authorising his conscription for military service.",

The illness was a ground for exemption from military service. The applicant stressed that the Government had not argued otherwise. In the applicant\u2019s opinion, the military medical commission, before drafting him, should have ordered an in-patient medical examination to make the final assessment of the state of his health. He pointed out that the medical and military officials who in 1999 had made the final determination of his fitness for military service had been aware of his inability to serve effectively in the armed forces. The consequences of his exposure to military service had been foreseeable at the very least for the medical personnel involved in the consideration of his eligibility for service. The applicant concluded that military service was ordinarily accompanied by hardships of a physical and psychological character which soldiers faced in their everyday life. While military service itself in general did not constitute inhuman and degrading treatment, his conscription for military service in a very poor state of health went beyond the suffering ordinarily connected with military service and reached the threshold of treatment prohibited by Article 3.",

The State has a primary duty to put in place rules geared to the level of risk to life or limb that may result not only from the nature of military activities and operations, but also from the human element that comes into play when a State decides to call up ordinary citizens to perform military service. Such rules must require the adoption of practical measures aimed at the effective protection of conscripts against the dangers inherent in military life and appropriate procedures for identifying shortcomings and errors liable to be committed in that regard by those in charge at different levels (see K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041 in fine).",

In this respect, the present case may be compared to that of Ta\u015ftan v. Turkey (no. 63748/00, 4 March 2008), in which the Court found that the conscription of the applicant at the age of seventy-one for military service, which was reserved for much younger conscripts, and his performance of such service constituted a \u201cparticularly painful ordeal\u201d for him and \u201can attack on his dignity\u201d.

The applicant\u2019s discharge from the army on health grounds appears to support that conclusion. Although the applicant did not claim that during his military service he had had any medical emergencies or had otherwise been exposed to severe or prolonged pain connected to his illness or experienced considerable anxiety flowing from his awareness of his health condition and the health risk to which he was exposed at all times on account of the nature of military service (see, mutatis mutandis, Sarban v. , no. 3456/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a086-87, 4 October 2005), the Court is prepared to proceed on the assumption that the suffering he may have endured reached the level of severity prohibited by Article 3.",

While completing military service may not be in any way overwhelming for a healthy young person, it could constitute an onerous burden on an individual lacking the requisite stamina and physical strength owing to the poor state of his health. Accordingly, given the practical demands of military service, States must introduce an effective system of medical supervision for potential conscripts to ensure that their health and well-being would not be put in danger and their human dignity would not be undermined during military service (see, mutatis mutandis, Ta\u015ftan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a030).

In addition, the examination by an endocrinologist was carried out when the medical commission was unable to establish the origin of the applicant\u2019s hypotrophy. Following the preliminary assessment of his ability to serve in the armed forces, the applicant was granted a deferral to improve his health.

The applicant supported his argument with a reference to his medical record, which allegedly had been seen by the district commission. In his opinion, the military medical authorities did not attach the necessary weight to his suffering from headaches and hypertension in 1987. The Court, however, entertains doubts that the applicant\u2019s medical history was brought to the attention of the military medical commission. As follows from the Town Court\u2019s judgment of 18\u00a0March 2004, the applicant\u2019s mother was in possession of his medical record, failing to submit it to the military medical authorities (see paragraph 37 above). This conclusion is not negated by the letter from the Sosnovo village hospital which was sent to the  on 4\u00a0December 2001 and on which the applicant strongly relied in support of his argument (see paragraph 26 above).

The Court is therefore not able to establish that on the date of the applicant\u2019s conscription the Russian authorities had substantial grounds to believe that, if drafted into the army, the applicant, owing to the state of his health, would face a real risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3 (see, for similar reasons, X. v.

As a result of the substantial delay, the experts had been unable to establish any physical traces resulting from the beatings. Furthermore, the examination had been psychological and psychiatric in nature, thus having the primary purpose of detecting abnormalities in the applicant\u2019s behaviour and his inability to interact adequately with the investigating authorities. The applicant pointed out that the expert examination performed by the Military Medical Commission of Medical Clinical Hospital no. 442 had unequivocally established that his health had seriously deteriorated during his military service as the experts had concluded that he had \u201cacquired the illnesses during his military service\u201d. That finding had been made in compliance with the requirements of Regulation 46 of the Regulations.

While the Court finds it regrettable that none of the expert opinions directly addressed the issue of the consistency of the applicant\u2019s health problems with his allegations of ill-treatment, it is satisfied that the expert findings did not provide any degree of support to the alleged history of military violence.

The applicant stressed that the experts had concluded that the illness had been acquired during his military service. The Court, however, is not convinced by the applicant\u2019s assertion. Having studied the complete text of the expert opinion issued on 7\u00a0December 1999 in the light of the remaining three expert reports, the Court is more inclined to accept the Government\u2019s interpretation of the expert finding as mere confirmation that the illness had been diagnosed during the applicant\u2019s military service, making him ineligible to serve in the army. In addition, the Court cannot overlook the contradictory nature of the applicant\u2019s submissions. For instance, while raising his complaint that he had been unlawfully conscripted for military service the applicant did not dispute that his brain illness was congenital or had been acquired in early childhood and thus had been present at the time of his conscription. That assertion was at the heart of his tort action against the military authorities.

In contrast to the Court, the domestic courts did not have all the four expert reports before them to reconcile the somewhat contradictory wording of the first two reports. It is particularly worth noting that the courts precisely cited the applicant\u2019s refusal to undergo an additional expert examination and the ensuing absence of expert evidence which could have allowed them to make a conclusive finding as to the origin of the applicant\u2019s illness.",

They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see, among many authorities, Assenov and Others v.

In the present case the applicant complained of ill-treatment to the prosecution authorities on 12 November 1999 (see paragraph 16 above). The Court is mindful of the fact that the prosecutor\u2019s office opened its investigation immediately after being notified of the alleged beatings. On 15 November 1999 the applicant was admitted to the neurology unit of a military hospital, where he was subjected to a medical examination authorised by the investigating authorities. Further steps were taken in the aftermath of the applicant\u2019s release from the hospital. In particular, following the results of the preliminary inquiry into the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment complaint, on 6 March 2000 the prosecution authorities instituted criminal proceedings. While the Court is aware that a certain period elapsed between the applicant\u2019s release from the hospital and the decision to institute criminal proceedings, it is, however, of the opinion that the prosecution authorities needed that time to gather evidence and make their preliminary assessment in order to identify the procedural avenues for proceeding with the applicant\u2019s complaint. The Court accepts that even where an investigation is carried out expeditiously, considerable time may elapse between the different phases of the investigation, for instance, to ensure that the evidence collected is of a sufficient quality to be used for criminal prosecution of the alleged perpetrators of the offence and to corroborate or disprove any allegations to the required standard of proof.",

They also performed a forensic investigative simulation of the incident which allegedly took place between the applicant and Captain Ch., providing the former with an opportunity to participate in the reconstruction of the events at the scene of the alleged incident. Furthermore, the Court does not find the fact that the three investigators\u2019 decisions were annulled by a higher-ranking prosecutor owing to certain procedural defects to be evidence of the inefficiency of the investigation, since from the material in the case file it follows that the investigating authorities made diligent efforts to establish the circumstances of the events and to reconcile their conflicting accounts. In particular, they persistently tried to identify and interview additional witnesses who could have shed light on the events in question. They also further questioned the known witnesses in order to eliminate or explain the discrepancies which had arisen in their previous statements. The Court is also mindful that the authorities\u2019 task was complicated by the fact that the applicant\u2019s complaints related to two incidents of alleged ill-treatment involving the officer and senior conscripts. In this connection, while regretting that there was a certain delay before the investigators interviewed the senior soldiers who had allegedly ill-treated the applicant or could have witnessed the beatings, the Court considers that such a delay did not affect the efficiency of the investigation as it did not lead to a loss of opportunities for the collection of evidence and did not prevent the inquiry from establishing the principal facts of the case.",

When the presiding judge resigned, the proceedings recommenced, which involved scheduling new hearings, rehearing the parties and re-examining evidence. In this connection the Court notes that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts are able to fulfil the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v. Austria (No. 2), no. 72159/01, \u00a7 57, 4\u00a0March 2004). In addition, the Court considers it striking that it took the  over a year to obtain evidence, in particular the applicant\u2019s personal file of a conscript, which was necessary for the examination of the action (see paragraphs 22 and 29 above). The Court does not lose sight of other delays in the proceedings which resulted from a similar failure by the  to discipline the authorities responsible for the delays in the provision of documents (see paragraph 26 above).",

The defendants failed to appear on at least five occasions, which resulted in a delay of approximately seven months. While the Court does not lose sight of the letter which the  sent on 13 March 2003 to the defendants, reacting to their failure to attend and warning about the consequences of such conduct, it is nevertheless mindful of the fact that despite the warning the defendants failed to attend another hearing scheduled for 16 October 2003. No steps were taken by the  to implement the warning in order to avoid future delays in the proceedings. Accordingly, the Court considers that the domestic courts did not make use of the measures available to them under national law to discipline the participants in the proceedings and to ensure that the case was heard within a reasonable time (see Rybakov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a014983/04, \u00a7 32, 22 December 2005).",
