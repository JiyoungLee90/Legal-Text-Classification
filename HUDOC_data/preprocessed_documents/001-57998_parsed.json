This opportunity to join, as a party, criminal proceedings which in principle are proceedings between two parties only, the prosecuting authorities and the accused, is intended to promote the interests of victims of crime. Moreover, French law allows such victims to join criminal proceedings without claiming financial compensation for the damage personally suffered as a direct result of the offences for which the accused is prosecuted (see paragraph 60 of the Court\u2019s judgment and paragraph 12 below). As regards their position as a party to the criminal proceedings this makes no difference at all.",

The effect of the test accepted by the Court is, however, that although certain victims of crime are, under national law, permitted to participate as a party with full rights and obligations in the criminal proceedings against the perpetrator of that crime, yet, unlike the interests of the other parties to those proceedings, their interests are not protected by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).

Consequently, learned writers may be rather divided on how the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgments should be explained as well as on what should be deduced from them. In such cases it is rather difficult for an international court like the European Court of Human Rights to assess what exactly is the national law. It cannot but try to form an opinion, but it should be clear that, being confronted with different opinions of learned writers and left without decisive guidance from the Court of Cassation, it necessarily has to do so with a certain reticence, a freedom it should be allowed since, after all, it is not deciding questions of French law.",

The Court accepts their view (see paragraphs 74 and 60 of its judgment) without considering whether it is compelling. It does not even discuss the opposite view, although there are other learned authors - and not the least authoritative - who fundamentally disagree and maintain that the civil action within the meaning of Article 2 CCP is and remains \"essentially an action for reparation, even if sometimes it is used less in order to obtain compensation than in order to have the perpetrator of the crime punished, which is the case if the victim only claims symbolic compensation, one franc damages, or joins proceedings before a criminal tribunal which has no jurisdiction to deal with a claim for damages\".",

In other words: the victim is free to postpone the choice which, according to the Court of Cassation, is implied in Article\u00a02 CCP till the very last moment of the criminal proceedings. That cannot but imply that up till that moment the criminal proceedings must, right from their beginning, meet the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6) also in respect of the civil party. However, under the interpretation now accepted by the Court, the victim will only be allowed to bring a complaint for a failure to meet these requirements in the period before he had made his choice, if the victim succeeds in persuading the Convention institutions that during that period he had already formed the intention of submitting a claim for financial compensation. That is odd where the victim ultimately opts for financial compensation; it is also odd where the victim finally chooses not to present such a claim, because that choice may, of course, be influenced by deficiencies of the criminal proceedings which fall within the ambit of Article 6 (art. 6): an excessive duration of those proceedings, as we have in the present case, being only one of those deficiencies; lack of impartiality, violation of the principle of equality of arms are other, obvious examples of deficiencies which may in the end lead a victim to change his mind and decide - as under national law he is free to do without losing his standing as a civil party - not to submit a claim for financial compensation.",

I would have thought it was obvious that the requirement of legal certainty makes it impossible for the applicability of the guarantees of Article 6 (art. 6) to be made to depend on so moot a factor as the subjective intentions of the civil party. The arguments which we have been forced to read and listen to well illustrate the point. The Government try to deduce that the applicant never intended to claim financial compensation from the fact that she never did submit such a claim. The applicant, however, answers that she intended to submit such a claim all along but that when, after twelve years, the defendant was acquitted, she felt that she no longer had a real chance and therefore gave up. That would seem a reasonable explanation, especially when one considers that pursuing a claim for financial compensation after acquittal may entail the risk of having to pay the costs of the ensuing further proceedings if the claim fails. Under these circumstances the mere fact that the applicant did not after all submit a claim for financial compensation does not prove - and cannot prove - that at the time when she joined the criminal proceedings as a civil party she did not ultimately intend to do so. What the Government have requested the Court to do is to deny the applicant the protection of the Convention on grounds that must necessarily remain subjective and speculative. I am still quite unable to understand why the Court has acceded to that request.",

They wished to discover the circumstances of their son\u2019s death and requested a reconstruction of the events; they did not seek damages\" (p.\u00a07, para. 8). Subsequently they raised no claim for compensation nor did they ever mention an intention of doing so at the appropriate stage of the proceedings. The proceedings ended with a ruling that there was no case to answer, on the ground that the accused could claim to have been acting in self-defence. That finding - which excluded all criminal and civil responsibility - deprived the applicants of any right to bring proceedings for compensation in the civil courts. The Court concluded that the applicants \"set in motion judicial criminal proceedings with a view to securing a conviction, which was a prior condition for obtaining compensation, and retained the right to submit a claim for damages up to and during the trial\" (previously cited judgment, pp. 14-15, para. 47).",

Case-law draws a distinction between the victim\u2019s right to lodge a civil-party application and the right to claim compensation for damage. This means that it is possible to bring civil-party proceedings for the sole purpose of helping to secure a proper conviction. If the victim also wishes to claim compensation for the prejudice sustained, he must in addition file a claim for damages, which may either be included in the civil-party application or submitted later in a separate document. In the latter case French law allows the victim to file his claim even after the criminal judgment has been delivered (see paragraph 63 of the judgment), unlike the position in certain other legal systems which require the victim to specify at the outset the basis on which he is participating in the proceedings and/or oblige him to file his claim for damages at an earlier stage of the proceedings. If compensation is a possible issue but the proceedings end with a result other than a conviction, the consequence of the French system is that there is no objective criterion for ascertaining what the true object of the victim was at the time when he made his civil-party application, unless he has already lodged his claim for compensation or has in some other way made known during the proceedings his intention to claim compensation at the appropriate time.",

During the proceedings the applicant never made any explicit claim for pecuniary reparation or expressed in any other way his intention to do so at the appropriate stage of the proceedings. Nor was any civil action for compensation brought by the applicant in the civil courts after the ruling that there was no case to answer, although this was theoretically possible (see paragraph 118 of the Commission\u2019s opinion). However, the Court based its ruling on an interpretation of national law different from that given in the present case, to the effect that Article 85 of the French CCP, which provided for the lodging of a complaint together with an application to join the proceedings as a civil party, simply applied Article 2 of the same Code, which laid down the conditions for bringing civil-party proceedings (see paragraph 121 of the judgment).
