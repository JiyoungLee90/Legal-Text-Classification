By local standards, they were a particularly attractive type of home, equipped with modern conveniences and located in urban centres. Practically all flats were under the regime of \u201csocial ownership\u201d \u2013 a concept which, while it does exist in other countries, was particularly highly developed in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (\u201cthe SFRY\u201d). They were generally built by socially owned enterprises or other public bodies for allocation to their employees, who became \u201coccupancy right holders\u201d. All citizens of the SFRY were required to pay a means-tested contribution to subsidise housing construction. However, the amount an individual had contributed was not amongst the legal criteria taken into account in the waiting lists for allocation of such flats.",

In accordance with this Act, an occupancy right, once allocated, entitled the occupancy right holder to permanent, lifelong use of the flat against the payment of a nominal fee. When occupancy right holders died, their rights transferred, as a matter of law, to their surviving spouses (indeed, spouses held occupancy rights in common) or registered members of their family households who were also using the flat (sections 19 and 21 of this Act). Furthermore, in the event of a divorce, the spouses were free to choose which one of them would continue to use the flat; in the absence of an agreement, either of them could apply to a court for a transfer of the occupancy right (section 20 of this Act). In practice, these provisions on transfer meant that occupancy rights originally allocated by public bodies to their employees could pass, as of right, to multiple generations for whom the initial employment-based link to the allocation right holder no longer existed. Occupancy rights could be cancelled only in court proceedings (section 50 of this Act) on limited grounds (sections 44, 47 and 49 of this Act), the most important of which was failure by occupancy right holders to physically use their flats for their own housing needs for a continuous period of at least six months without justified grounds. Although inspections were foreseen to ensure compliance with this requirement (section 42 of this Act), occupancy rights were rarely, if ever, cancelled on these grounds prior to the 1992-95 war. Moreover, on 24\u00a0December 1992 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina annulled the inspection provisions.",

As a rule, they fled to areas controlled by their own ethnic groups. All parties to the conflict quickly adopted procedures allowing the flats of those who had fled to be declared \u201cabandoned\u201d and allocated to new occupants. While the alleged rationale for the allocation of \u201cabandoned\u201d flats was to provide humanitarian shelter to displaced persons, particularly attractive flats were often awarded to the military and political elites. In some cases, occupancy rights were cancelled pursuant to section 47 of the Housing Act 1984, because of failure by the pre-war occupancy right holders to use their flats for a continuous period of at least six months. In most cases, however, the authorities applied legislation specially enacted for those purposes: the Abandoned Flats Act 1992, the Abandoned Flats Decree 1993, the Refugee Accommodation Decree 1993, the Refugee Accommodation Act 1995 and the Abandoned Property Act 1996. In the immediate aftermath of the war, legislation on abandoned flats remained in force in both Entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina (namely, the Federation of Bosnia and  and the Republika Srpska) and reallocation of flats continued nearly unabated, which further reinforced ethnic separation.",

However, that right was limited in time and failure to make a timely application led to the cancellation of occupancy rights. The general deadline in the Federation of Bosnia and  was 4 July 1999, but in some cases an application could have been made by 4 October 1999 or, for damaged flats, by 29 June 2002 (sections 5 and 18e of the Restitution of Flats Act 1998). Occupancy rights on military flats can be cancelled also under section 3a of that Act on the following grounds. First, if the pre-war occupancy right holder served in foreign armed forces after 19 May 1992 (when the JNA formally withdrew from ). Since those who were granted refugee or equivalent status in a country outside the former SFRY are exempted, the restriction affects only those who served in the forces of the successor States of the SFRY and, in reality, almost exclusively those who served in the VJ\u00a0forces. The second category is those who acquired an occupancy or equivalent right to a military flat in a  of the SFRY. On 22\u00a0September 2004 the , on an application for abstract constitutionality review, declared that provision constitutional (decision U 83/03, published in Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina no. 60/04 of 27 December 2004).

Upon the cancellation of a pre-war occupancy right, due to failure to make a timely application or due to a final decision rejecting a restitution claim pursuant to section 3a of the Restitution of Flats Act 1998, the flat may be allocated to current and retired military officials, current and retired staff of the Ministry of Defence, war veterans, war invalids or families of killed members of the former ARBH or HVO forces provided that their housing needs have not otherwise been met (see section 30 of the Military Flats Allocation Ordinance 1996). Section 31 of that Ordinance also provides that a person cannot be allocated a military flat if he or she or his or her spouse or minor child had a house or a flat in Bosnia and Herzegovina before the war (even if it has meanwhile been sold or gifted). Other conditions set out in paragraph 56 above, such as one\u2019s income, do not apply to the allocation of military flats. Pursuant to section 30 of the Military Flats Allocation Ordinance 1996, 45% of flats should be allocated to senior officers and the highest Ministry officials; 15% to junior officers; and 10% to non-commissioned officers, other soldiers and Ministry staff. The remaining flats should be allocated to war veterans, war invalids or families of killed members of the former ARBH or HVO forces. During and immediately after the war many military flats were reportedly allocated to the highest military and civilian officials whose housing needs had otherwise been met (see \u0110oki\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 10). In 2002 the High Representative therefore requested the local authorities to ensure that all flats be allocated in accordance with the law. It would appear that during that process, which led to some evictions and which was monitored by the High Representative and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the deficiencies mentioned above were for the most part remedied.",

The Court held that the applicants in those cases did not have \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 because occupancy right holders in  had no longer been able to purchase their flats since 1 January 1996. However, the present case must be distinguished. Pursuant to the Dayton Peace Agreement (see paragraphs 63-65 above) and domestic laws enacted under international pressure (see paragraphs 54-55 above), all occupancy right holders in Bosnia and Herzegovina are as a rule entitled to get back their pre-war flats and then purchase them under very favourable terms. In , this is not the case. Furthermore, unlike the Croatian authorities, the Bosnian-Herzegovinian authorities have consistently held that an occupancy right constitutes \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for example, the Human Rights Commission\u2019s decision mentioned in paragraph 34 above and the \u2019s decision mentioned in paragraph 54 above). As the position of the national authorities appears to be in accordance with international standards (see paragraphs 68-69 above), the Court does not see any reason to depart from it. Lastly, the situation in the present case is not that different from the situation in \u0110oki\u0107, given that those who purchased military flats located in the present-day Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina could not register their ownership and remained, strictly speaking, occupancy right holders (see \u0110oki\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 12). The Court therefore dismisses the respondent Government\u2019s objection.",

However, the present applicants did not conclude such contracts. The crux of the present case is whether the cancellation of the applicants\u2019 occupancy rights, which prevents them from repossessing their pre-war flats, was contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In a similar case (Ble\u010di\u0107 v.  [GC], no. 59532/00, ECHR 2006III), the Court held that the cancellation of an occupancy right was an instantaneous act rather than a continuing situation (\u00a7 86). The Court does not see any reason to depart from that jurisprudence. Consequently, the six-month period started to run with regard to each of the present applicants when the decision cancelling his or her occupancy right entered into effect under the rules of administrative procedure set out in paragraph 58 above or, if an applicant used further remedies, such as an appeal to the Human Rights Chamber or a constitutional appeal, when the final decision was rendered in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. It should be emphasised, however, that only remedies which are effective can be taken into account as applicants cannot extend the strict time-limit imposed by the Convention by seeking to make inappropriate or misconceived applications to bodies or institutions which have no power to offer effective redress for the complaint in issue (see Fernie v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 14881/04, 5 January 2006). It is true that mere doubts regarding the effectiveness of a remedy cannot absolve an applicant from the obligation to try it (see Milo\u0161evi\u0107 v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 77631/01, 19 March 2002), but a remedy which did not offer reasonable prospects of success, for example in the light of settled domestic case-law, will not be regarded as effective (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20 November 1995, \u00a7 27, Series A no.\u00a0332) and will not be taken into account for the purposes of the six-month rule. The Court now turns to the situation of each of the present applicants.",

The respondent Government underlined that under the housing legislation spouses held occupancy rights in common and maintained that consequently Mr Mago\u2019s status must have been taken into consideration when examining Ms Mago\u2019s restitution claim. They referred to a decision of the domestic Human Rights Chamber CH/02/8202 et al. of 4 April 2003. However, unlike Ms Mago, the applicant in that case was still married to a member of the VJ forces. It is noted that in the event of a divorce spouses are entitled under the housing legislation to choose which one of them will continue to use their flat (see paragraph 6 above). The Court considers that the authorities must respect that choice. The respondent Government also argued that the applicant should have applied to the competent court for a transfer of the occupancy right following her divorce. However, according to the housing legislation, such proceedings must be pursued only in the absence of an agreement between former spouses as to the use of their flat after their divorce. In the present case, Mr\u00a0Mago did not apply for the restitution of the flat in  and thereby tacitly agreed that Ms Mago take it back. In those circumstances, his status should not have been taken into account when examining Ms Mago\u2019s restitution claim. Since the applicant did not fall into any of the categories targeted by the contested measures and the respondent Government did not suggest any other reason for the deprivation of her possessions, there has been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 with respect to Ms Mago.",

While the respondent Government alleged that those applicants had probably been allocated flats in , they failed to substantiate that allegation. The parties agreed, and this is indeed well known, that the nature of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was such that service in certain armed forces was to a large extent indicative of one\u2019s ethnic origin (see \u0110oki\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 60). As a result, the contested measures, although apparently neutral, have the effect of treating people differently on the ground of their ethnic origin. The Court has held in comparable situations that, as a matter of principle, no difference in treatment which is based exclusively or to a decisive extent on one\u2019s ethnic origin is capable of being objectively justified in a contemporary democratic society (Sejdi\u0107 and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 27996/06 and 34836/06, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2009; D.H. and Others v. the  [GC], no. 57325/00, \u00a7 176, ECHR 2007IV; and Timishev v.

It is true that States must normally offer compensation if taking a property. Furthermore, the fact that a person has acquired a property right in one State is normally not sufficient in itself to justify a taking of his or her property in another State. That being said, in the exceptional circumstances of the dissolution of the SFRY and the wars in the region, the Court considers that the respondent State has not been required under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to pay compensation to the applicants for the cancellation of their occupancy rights given that they have meanwhile been granted equivalent rights in other former Republics of the SFRY (see Jahn and Others, cited above, \u00a7 117).
