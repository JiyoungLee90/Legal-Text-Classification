The case originated in an application (no. 4877/15) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Nazilya Khamzinovna Khaziyeva (“the applicant”), on 30 December 2014.
The applicant was represented by Ms A. Maralyan, a lawyer admitted to practice in Russia. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 28 August 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Ufa.
On 26 December 2006 a new block of flats was commissioned by the Ufa Town Administration.
On 30 September 2010 the Ordzhonikidzevskiy District Court of Ufa recognised T.’s title to the flat at 66/2-54, Ulitsa Kommunarov, Ufa.
On 28 October 2010 T. sold the flat to M. The transaction and M.’s title to the flat were registered by the state registration authorities.
On 13 January 2011 M. sold the flat to the applicant. The transaction and the applicant’s title to the flat were registered by the state registration authorities.
On an unspecified date the Housing Foundation of the Republic of Bashkortostan brought a civil claim seeking, inter alia, the invalidation of the applicant’s title to the flat and eviction.
On 23 July 2013 the District Court granted the claims in full. The court established that the judgment of 30 September 2010 had been forged and that T. had died in 2008 and could not have been a party to the relevant proceedings. The court refused to recognise that the applicant had purchased the flat in good faith for her failure to check the authenticity of the judgment of 30 September 2010. It further took into account that M. had sold the flat to the applicant for 180,000 Russian roubles (RUB) while she had bought it for RUB 190,000.
.  On 17 November 2013 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Bashkortostan upheld the judgment of 23 July 2013 on appeal.
On 4 April 2014 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s cassation appeal.
On 9 July 2014 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation rejected the applicant’s second cassation appeal.
According to the Government, the eviction order was not enforced and the applicant continues to reside in the flat.
