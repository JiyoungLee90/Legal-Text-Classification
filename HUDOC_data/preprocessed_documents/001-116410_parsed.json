The Court held in these judgments that overcrowding in Polish detention facilities had been, at the relevant time, of a structural nature what undermined the effectiveness of any domestic remedies available, making them theoretical and illusory and incapable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint (ibid. \u00a7\u00a0111). The Court, nevertheless, indicated that where the alleged violation no longer continued and could not, therefore, be eliminated with retrospective effect, the only means of redress was pecuniary compensation. In such situations, regard being had to the principle of subsidiarity, it could not be excluded that applicants who complained of degrading treatment because of the conditions of their detention, might be required to first avail themselves of the civil action relied on by the Government (ibid. \u00a7\u00a0109 ).",

The Court considered that it was neither mandated nor in a position to obtain and examine evidence necessary to rule on the existence of a causal link between the applicant\u2019s treatment in prison and his state of health after his release.

Most importantly, at the time when the case was being decided by the Court, the applicant had still had time to bring a civil action under Article 23, taken in conjunction with Article\u00a0417 or Article 448 of the Civil Code, in order to seek compensation for the alleged violation.
