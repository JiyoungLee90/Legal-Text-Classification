The quashing of the extension order in question was carried out on procedural grounds, and it did not affect the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention in the relevant period. In any event, the Government considered that the ruling of 11 November 2002 had affected the applicant\u2019s status as a victim and made available to the applicant the possibility of claiming compensation in separate civil proceedings for the non-pecuniary damage caused by the unlawful deprivation of liberty, as provided by Articles 1070 and 1100 of the Civil Code.

Paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Convention covers the former and paragraph\u00a05 of Article 5 the latter. The court invited to rule on an action for damages caused by unlawful detention examines the matter after the events and therefore does not have jurisdiction to order release if the detention is unlawful, as Article 5 \u00a7 4 requires it should (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 114). A civil action for damages has accordingly no bearing on the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Belchev v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 39270/98, 6 February 2003; Nakhmanovich v. Russia (dec.), no. 55669/00, 28 October 2004; and, most recently, Shcheglyuk v. Russia, no. 7649/02, \u00a7 34, 14 December 2006).

During that period he was detained \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a). At the same time, he was held in custody in connection with another set of criminal proceedings for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on suspicion of several counts of murder, a situation envisaged in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c). It accordingly follows that, from 26 November 2001 to August 2002, the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty fell within the ambit of both sub-paragraphs (a) and (c) of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01. Taking into account that the applicant was detained on the basis of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), and notwithstanding the fact that his detention was also grounded on Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), the Court considers that this period should be taken into consideration for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3. Therefore, the applicant has been continuously detained pending trial on the charges of several counts of murder, since his arrest on 25 December 1999 until his conviction by the first-instance court on 30 April 2004. The period to be taken into consideration therefore lasted approximately four years and four months.",

The selection of lay judges for examination of a particular case in a regional (city) court was to be carried out by the judge to whom the case in question had been assigned in accordance with the rules set out by Section 5 of the Act.

Besides, the total number of the selected lay judges was 102, whereas there should have been 156 names selected for each judge of the court. Moreover, the selected 102 lay judges were not distributed between the judges of the City Court. Therefore, when it came to the selection of the two lay judges for a particular case it would have been impossible for the judge to whom the case had been assigned to determine which lay judges would take part in the drawing of lots. The applicant further submitted that on 11 November 2002 Judge Kurguzov \u201cdrew lots\u201d between six unidentified lay judges, and therefore it is impossible to verify whether the remaining four persons had had the status of lay judges and had been on the relevant lists of lay judges.

The Court notes, however, that no information on the general lists of lay judges for other district courts of  were provided by the Government. Thereafter the president of the City Court had to select from the general lists of the district courts situated in  156 lay judges for each judge of the City Court (see paragraphs 39, 40 and 43 above). In this connection the Court observes, first of all, that on 27 September 2002 the acting president of the City Court conducted the selection only on the basis of the general list of lay judges assigned to the Krasnogvardeyskiy District Court. Besides, only 102 lay judges were selected and there was no further reassignment between the judges of the City Court. The Court further observes that on 11 November 2002 Judge Kurguzov, to whom the applicant\u2019s case had been assigned, instead of drawing lots among 156 lay judges in order to select two to sit on the bench for the hearing of the applicant\u2019s case, drew lots among six unidentified lay judges and as a result selected lay judges Ms D. and Mr S. Regard being had to the above circumstances, the Court considers that the procedure provided for by the domestic law for selection of lay judges and drawing of random lots for their participation in the applicant\u2019s case had been breached on several occasions.",

The preliminary investigation of the case lasted one year and nine months, which was reasonable, taking into consideration the complexity of the case. On 25 December 2001 the case was taken over by the St Petersburg City Court for trial. On 8 January 2002 the first hearing was scheduled for 5 August 2002 due to the workload of the judge and the necessity to select the lay judges. On 5 August 2002 the hearing was adjourned due to the necessity to search for one of the applicant\u2019s co-defendants. The proceedings were resumed on 15 December 2002. In this connection the Government pointed out that the separation of the criminal case against the applicant would have not resulted, in view of the specific nature of the case, in facilitation of the court proceedings. The Government further submitted that after the resumption of the proceedings in December 2002 the hearings were adjourned on many occasions. They considered, however, that only the adjournments resulting from the failure to deliver the applicant and his co-defendants to the courtroom can be attributed to the domestic authorities. The Government concluded therefore that the length of the proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case did not exceed the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

The applicant further argued that although his case was not an easy one, it was not especially intricate either: when the case file was transmitted to the trial court it contained eighteen volumes, of which six represented copies of documents from the case file of one of the applicant\u2019s co-defendants. The applicant concluded that the domestic authorities did not show particular diligence while examining his case and did not respect the requirement of the reasonable duration of the proceedings.",

The Court observes that the applicant was represented by a lawyer in the domestic proceedings, which involved complex issues, and required qualified legal advice.
