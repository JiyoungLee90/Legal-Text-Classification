Nonetheless, the Court considers that the judgment of 5 May 2007 \u2013 and thus the obligations established therein \u2013 must be read in the context of the legal acts which were in force at the time of its adoption. Where enforcement of a judgment is delayed for a substantial period of time, and such a delay is imputable not to the applicant but to the State authorities (see paragraphs\u00a098-105 below), the applicant should not have to bear the additional burden resulting from that delay (see, mutatis mutandis, Gladysheva v. Russia, no. 7097/10, \u00a7 80, 6 December 2011). Without suggesting what specific price would be appropriate, the Court nonetheless considers that the market value of the land has increased during the period of the non-enforcement of the judgment, and in 2015 that value was many times higher than the nominal price which the applicant would have paid if the judgment had been promptly enforced. Accordingly, requiring the applicant to pay the market price was not justified in the circumstances of the present case and thus could not be considered proper enforcement of the judgment of 5 May 2007.",

Lithuania, no. 62988/00, \u00a7 35, 7 April 2005). Nonetheless, the Court reiterates that the complexity of the domestic enforcement procedure cannot relieve the State of its obligation under the Convention to guarantee to everyone the right to have a binding judicial decision enforced within a reasonable time, and that it is for the Contracting States to organise their legal systems in such a way that the competent authorities can meet their obligation in this regard (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 70, and the cases cited therein).",

The land reform in that area started in 2000 (see paragraph 12 above). The Court has no reason to doubt that it may have been necessary to amend the land allocation plan in order to take into account the requests for restitution of land. Nonetheless, it reiterates that when the judgment of 5\u00a0May 2007 was adopted, the land reform in that area had been going on for seven years, and the applicant\u2019s right to buy land had now been recognised for twenty years. The Court considers that these circumstances both required and enabled the authorities to enforce that judgment without any undue delay.",

Despite the fact that the applicant had been petitioning the relevant authorities since January 2001 (and not since 2004, as claimed by the Government \u2013 see paragraph 83 above), she was included on the list of candidates to receive land only in August 2009, after the deadline set by the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraphs\u00a030 and 36 above). The first time the applicant was offered a specific plot was in November 2010, and although she agreed to the offer, nearly three years later (in May 2013) she was presented with new plots. It took the authorities another two years (until April 2015) to identify that the plots offered to the applicant were of lesser size than previously determined (see paragraphs 40, 42 and 45 above). Although the Court accepts that Contracting States are in principle justified in prioritising the interests of former owners to restore their property rights (see, among other authorities, Pyrantien\u0117 v. Lithuania, no. 45092/07, \u00a7 48, 12 November 2013, and Albergas and Arlauskas v. Lithuania, no. 17978/05, \u00a7 57, 27 May 2014), in the present case the Government did not demonstrate that any restoration claims had been submitted in respect of the plot allocated to the applicant, nor that in general the former owners\u2019 claims in the Buivydi\u0161k\u0117s cadastral area had been of such extent as to preclude any possibility of allocating two\u00a0hectares to the applicant in due time. The Court further notes that at various points the NLS (before it took over the VCA\u2019s functions), the bailiff and the Parliamentary Ombudsperson had unsuccessfully tried to speed up the enforcement of the judgment, with the VCA making little to no effort in that regard (see paragraphs 19, 27, 35, 38 and 54 above).",

Furthermore, on 20 November 2008 that same court found that the lengthy non-enforcement of its previous judgment, as well as the VCA\u2019s refusal to respond to the applicant\u2019s requests for information had warranted awarding non-pecuniary damages to the applicant and her husband (see paragraph 53 above).",

Nonetheless, to date the local authorities have failed to comply with those judgments.

On the other hand, the Court reiterates that, in any event, in cases concerning non-enforcement of final decisions, where such a decision is delivered in favour of an individual against the State, the former should not, in principle, be compelled to bring separate enforcement proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Metaxas v.

The Court will award financial compensation under Article\u00a041 only where it is satisfied that the loss or damage complained of was actually caused by the violation it has found, since the State cannot be required to pay damages in respect of losses for which it is not responsible (see Kingsley v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35605/97, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2002IV, and the cases cited therein).",
