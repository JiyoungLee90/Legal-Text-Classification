The opening of letters both to and from the Convention organs undoubtedly gives rise to the possibility that they will be read and may conceivably, on occasion, also create the risk of reprisals by prison staff against the prisoner concerned (see Campbell, cited above, p.\u00a022, \u00a7\u00a062). No compelling reasons have been found to exist for monitoring or delaying an applicant's correspondence with the Court (see Campbell, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 48 and\u00a062; and Peers v.\u00a0, no.\u00a028524/95, \u00a7\u00a084, ECHR\u00a02001III and Drozdowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a020841/02, \u00a7\u00a7 27-31, 6\u00a0December 2005).",
