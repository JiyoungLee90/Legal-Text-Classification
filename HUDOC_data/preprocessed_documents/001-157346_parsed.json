There is no doubt that the requirement to undergo a strip search will generally constitute an interference under the first paragraph of Article 8 and must be justified in terms of the second paragraph, namely as being \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d for one or more of the legitimate aims listed therein. According to settled case-law, the notion of necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, for example, Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, \u00a7\u00a067, Series A no.\u00a0130). Whilst strip searches may be necessary on occasions to ensure prison security or prevent disorder in prisons, they must be conducted in an appropriate manner (see Iwa\u0144czuk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a059).",

However their further submission that there was a risk that the applicant might bring some dangerous objects in with him is unsupported by any evidence. The applicant was not classified as a dangerous prisoner. Likewise, it has not been shown that in the past he had given the prison authorities any reason for thinking that he might behave in a dangerous manner or bring any dangerous objects onto the prison premises. Whilst he did behave in a vulgar and offensive manner, from the documents submitted by the parties it appears that his behaviour never overstepped the limits of verbal abuse. The Court is aware of the need to assure security in institutions where people are deprived of their liberty, it considers however that highly invasive and potentially debasing measures like personal checks or strip searches require a plausible justification. It does not appear that such a justification was given by the prison authorities to the applicant in the instant case. The Court also notes in this respect that the Ombudsman in his recommendation of 23 December 2014 drew the attention to the fact that the domestic law as applied in practice did not guarantee to prisoners effective remedies to contest the decision to perform personal checks (see paragraph\u00a030 above). In the absence of such an effective remedy, it is difficult to enforce at the domestic level the requirement of a sufficient justification for personal checks or strip searches.",

The Court considers that the punishments imposed on the applicant were of a serious nature, in particular the placement of the applicant in a solitary cell, taking into account the fact that the reasons for their imposition have not been clarified. It was asserted by the domestic courts to which the applicant appealed that the disciplinary measures were rightly imposed for the applicant\u2019s refusal to undergo the body searches. However, the question whether there had existed genuine and valid reasons for which the applicant was requested to undergo such searches has never been examined in any procedure before the domestic courts (see paragraphs 16 and 20 above).",
