We must stress, first of all, that the mandate of the European Court of Human Rights is defined in a restrictive manner in Article\u00a019 of the Convention. The Court\u2019s role is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Parties Contracting in the Convention and the Protocols thereto. The Convention and the Protocols lay down a collective guarantee on some of the universally recognised human rights, establishing a minimum standard of protection for the selective catalogue of rights and freedoms which they set out, which minimum standard is binding on all States Parties. While the domestic legislation of the States and other international instruments may impose higher standards of protection or make good any omissions in the human rights protection afforded by the Convention and the Additional Protocols thereto, this does not in itself extend the mandate assigned to the Court.",

This provision requires the States Parties to the Convention not only to refrain from acts prohibited by the provision but also to guarantee effective protection against such acts, whether they are committed by public officials or private individuals. However, the inhuman or degrading nature of the act must be assessed in the light of all the circumstances of the case. In order for ill-treatment to fall within the scope of Article 3, it must attain a minimum level of severity. It follows that there may be types of violence which, although morally reprehensible and very often condemned by domestic legislation in the Contracting States, do not fall within Article 3 de la Convention (see Ireland v. United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 167, Series A no.\u00a025). Moreover, the standard applicable to the public authorities must automatically be more stringent than that applied in interpersonal relations. Consequently, the threshold for inhuman or degrading treatment is lower for acts committed by the public authorities than for acts committed by private individuals. Similarly, in the latter case, according to the Court\u2019s well-established case-law, the obligation to investigate is only confirmed if there is sufficient evidence to corroborate a suspicion of offences of a specific level of severity committed by private individuals.",

In our view, under the particular circumstances of the case, the minimum threshold for the obligation to investigate deriving from Article 3 of the Convention was not attained. In this connection, we do not think that the quotation (in paragraph 39 in fine of the judgment) from B.S. v. Spain (no. 47159/08, \u00a7\u00a7 39-40, 24 July 2012) corroborates the conclusion reached by the majority because, unlike the acts complained of in B.S., the racist abuse denounced in the present case was not attributable to any State officials exercising supervision over the victim.",

Under the circumstances of the present case, however, the reliance by the majority on a putative racist motivation in order to transform a case of minor violence inflicted by private individuals into a case of ill-treatment liable to attain the severity threshold required by Article 3 of the Convention does not constitute a convincing argument. In our view, by adopting this approach the majority, while seeking, commendably, to make good an omission in the protection provided by the Convention, has distorted the import of Article 3.",

However, the Court judgment solely finds a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on the grounds that no investigation had been conducted into the possible racist motivation of the violence carried out. The majority neither pronounce on the investigation into the violence as such nor contest the facts established on completion of the investigation. This raises questions about the approach adopted by the majority. The first question which logically arises is whether the applicant was the victim of an assault. Only after such an assault has been substantiated can the reason for its occurrence be examined. The obligation to investigate the motive for the violence carried out only eventuates after the investigators have established the assault. A finding cannot be made against a State for failing to investigate possible racist motives for an assault without first of all substantiating the assault, or at least noting shortcomings in the investigation into the assault itself.",

We do not find this approach very convincing because unfortunately racism is a general problem that affects all Council of Europe countries.
