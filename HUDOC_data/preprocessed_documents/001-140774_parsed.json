It nevertheless considers it appropriate to affirm that if a statement obtained in breach of the principles established in the Salduz judgment were the sole and decisive evidence used in securing the conviction of a third person, this would normally constitute a breach of the right to a fair trial. The reopening of the proceedings, as being the most appropriate form of redress, would allow the clarification of all these circumstances (see Ge\u00e7gel and \u00c7elik v.
