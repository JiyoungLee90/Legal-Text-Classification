In line with its case-law (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 139, 140 and 143), the Court considers that the Lithuanian authorities were entitled to correct their mistakes and annul the restoration of the applicant\u2019s property rights in order to protect forests classified as being of national importance. Accordingly, it is of the view that the annulment in itself did not constitute a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. At the same time, the Court underlines that the correction of the authorities\u2019 errors should not create disproportionate new wrongs (ibid., \u00a7 140, and the cases cited therein). It must therefore assess whether the authorities complied with their obligation to promptly and adequately compensate the applicant for the loss which he suffered as a result of their mistakes.",

Although the applicant criticised the quality of those plots during the meetings and in his submissions to the Court (see paragraphs 14-18 and 27 above), he did not make any decisions formally refusing the plots offered to him and indicating the reasons for the refusal (compare and contrast Beinarovi\u010d and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 152). Instead, as demonstrated by the minutes of those meetings, which he had signed, on each occasion he reiterated that he wished to wait for the decision of the Court in the present case, or for a response from \u201ca competent institution\u201d (see paragraphs 14-18 above). In this connection, the Court takes note of the Government\u2019s position that the cooperation of applicants with the public authorities in the restitution process is of key importance when determining the proportionality of the interference with their property rights (see paragraph 29 above; see also Pauk\u0161tis v. Lithuania, no.\u00a017467/07, \u00a7\u00a7 85-86, 24 November 2015, and Valan\u010dien\u0117 v. Lithuania, no. 2657/10, \u00a7\u00a7 71-72, 18\u00a0April 2017). In the present case, not only did the applicant not cooperate with the authorities, but he explicitly refused to participate in the restitution process in accordance with domestic law. In the Court\u2019s view, the applicant himself effectively suspended the restitution process and therefore the delay in the restoration of his property rights cannot be considered the responsibility of the authorities (see Beinarovi\u010d and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0162). In this connection, the Court also reiterates that within the scheme of the Convention it is intended to be subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a013378/05, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2008; Austin and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09 and 2 others, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2012; and Sargsyan v.\u00a0Azerbaijan (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 40167/06, \u00a7\u00a7 29-32, 12\u00a0December 2017). It should therefore not be treated as the first-instance authority for restoring property rights, without allowing the domestic authorities an opportunity to do so.",
