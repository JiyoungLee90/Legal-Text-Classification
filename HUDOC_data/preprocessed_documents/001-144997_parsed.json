Finally, the applicant was advised that she should contact the prosecutor\u2019s office because the Security Police had not indicated any procedure or time-limits for lodging an appeal.",

The Minister for Health was of the opinion that the relatives should have been informed about the organ removal and that their consent should have been obtained. The representatives stated that the organ removal had been conducted in compliance with the applicable law. The meeting record contained a note to the effect that in autumn 2003 a working group which had been established by the Ministry of Health had prepared amendments to the above-mentioned Law in order to define its provisions more clearly. They had made two proposals. The first proposal was to include in the Law a provision stating that on all occasions inquiries were to be made about the deceased person\u2019s wishes with his or her closest relatives. The second proposal was to rely on the person\u2019s wishes as expressed during his or her lifetime and, in the absence of any such wishes, to presume consent (no inquiries made with the closest relatives). It was also noted that the relevant committee of the Parliament had opted for the second option (see paragraph 41 below for the adopted text). It was also noted that once the proposed amendments were passed by the Parliament, the occurrence of such \u201cproblematic situations would be practically ruled out\u201d. On 17 March 2004 the applicant received reply from the Ministry of Health to this effect.",

He stated that \u2013 according to the information provided by the Ministry of Health \u2013 the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine (see paragraph 28 below) had not been ratified by the Latvian Parliament and that Latvia had not even signed the Additional Protocol to the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine concerning Transplantation of Organs and Tissues of Human Origin; Latvia was therefore not a party to this Convention. The prosecutor relied on Article 17 of the Additional Protocol and indicated that at the relevant time (May 2002) in Latvia these issues were regulated in sections 4 and 11 of the Law. These provisions did not require consent from close relatives unless the removal was from the body of a dead child. The rules relating to transplantation coordinators obliged them to obtain relatives\u2019 consent only in cases prescribed by law. The prosecutor concluded that there were no grounds to consider that the medical practitioners, in taking the decision to remove organs and in carrying out the removal of those organs, had infringed legal provisions. Therefore, there were no grounds to charge them with a crime under section 139 of the Criminal Law; at that time no other person had been charged with the crime. At the same time, the applicant was informed about the 2 June 2004 amendments to sections 4 and 11 of the Law, in which it was specified that the organs of a deceased person might be removed for transplantation purposes if there was no information recorded in the Population Register indicating any objection and if the relatives of the deceased had not, before the start of the transplantation, informed the hospital in writing of the deceased person\u2019s objection \u2013 expressed during his or her lifetime \u2013 to the use of his or her organs and tissue after death.",

He also referred to sections 4 and 11 of the Law and noted that these provisions prohibited removal in cases where a refusal or objection had been received but not in cases where wishes of the closest relatives had not been established. These provisions, as in force in May 2002, therefore did not oblige medical practitioners to actively search for and inform the closest relatives of a deceased person about the possible removal for transplantation purposes of his or her body tissue and organs unless that person was a child. On 29 May 2002 the medical practitioners did not have any information at their disposal concerning a refusal of or objection to the removal of Mr\u00a0Petrovs\u2019 organs.

The possibility of using this remedy was still open to the applicant. Citing the Court\u2019s decision in Andrasik and Others v. Slovakia (no.\u00a057984/00, 22\u00a0October 2002), the Government argued that the proposed remedy had become available shortly after the applicant had submitted her application to the Court on 18 January 2005. The Government provided some examples of domestic case-law pertaining to the application of section 1635 in practice. They referred to the proceedings in case PAC-714 (instituted on 7 February 2005), where a claimant had sought compensation for non-pecuniary damage from a hospital where she had given birth and where tubal ligation (surgical contraception) had been performed without her consent (see L.H. v. Latvia, no. 52019/07, \u00a7 8, 29 April 2014 (not yet final)). On 1\u00a0December 2006 that claim had been upheld and the claimant had been awarded compensation for physical injury and moral suffering in the amount of 10,000 Latvian lati (LVL) in respect of the unlawful sterilisation on the basis of section 2349 of the Civil Law. This judgment had taken effect on 10\u00a0February 2007. The Government also referred to one of the \u201cTalsi tragedy\u201d cases (instituted on 15 September 2006), where on 16\u00a0March 2010 the appellate court had awarded compensation payable by the State in the amount of LVL\u00a020,000 in connection with the incident of 28\u00a0June 1997 in Talsi where, among other children, the claimant\u2019s daughter had died.

Even if they had been, the outcome of proceedings before these institutions would have been largely dependent on the examination carried out by the MADEKKI, the report of which institution the applicant had not contested.

The case of Gri\u0161ankovs and Gri\u0161ankova concerned a legal provision which the applicants in that case considered to be contrary to the Convention. The applicant in the present case referred to section 11 and pointed out that the system of \u201cpresumed consent\u201d in Latvia had been limited by the wishes expressed by the relatives. She considered that the issue in the present case was not a legal provision itself but rather the fact that persons responsible for the removal of the organs had carried out the procedure without trying to establish the wishes of the closest relatives.

Even if the applicant had personally submitted such a complaint, the result would have been the same. According to the applicant, she could not have appealed against the MADEKKI report since it was not an administrative act but rather an expert report drawn up in the course of criminal proceedings, against which no appeal lay. In any event, the MADEKKI report in itself had been neither sufficient to provide redress for the applicant nor legally binding. The applicant referred to the case of Manoussakis and Others v.

Instead, she argued that her wishes as the closest relative had not been taken into account.

Accordingly, the Government\u2019s objections in this regard must be dismissed. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that the concepts of private and family life are broad terms not susceptible to exhaustive definition (see Hadri-Vionnet v.

In the case of Pannullo and Forte v.\u00a0France (no. 37794/97, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2001-X), the Court considered the excessive delay by the French authorities in returning the body of their child following an autopsy to be interference with the private and family life of the applicants. It has also considered that the refusal of the investigative authorities to return the bodies of deceased persons to their relatives constituted an interference with the applicants\u2019 private and family life (see Sabanchiyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 38450/05, \u00a7 123, ECHR 2013 (extracts) and Maskhadova and Others v. Russia, no. 18071/05, \u00a7 212, 6\u00a0June 2013).

The Government did not contest this. The Court sees no reason to hold otherwise and thus considers that this Article is applicable in the circumstances of the case. The Court notes that this complaint is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.",

In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there were positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private or family life; these obligations involved the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private or family life (see X and Y v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, \u00a7\u00a023, Series A no. 91). She further referred to the case of Ciubotaru v.

As concerns the first of these considerations, the applicant\u2019s view was that by granting the closest relatives the right to express binding wishes in relation to organ removal, the domestic law had struck the right balance between private and family life and the rights of others. In the applicant\u2019s case, the domestic authorities had not fulfilled their duty to provide conditions for these wishes to be expressed. For the interference to be in \u201caccordance with the law\u201d, the law had to be clear and had to provide the possibility of exercising the protected rights. As regards the second consideration, the applicant argued that the interference had not been proportionate. There had to be some mechanism to establish the wishes of a dying person through his or her closest relatives if that person had not made such wishes known during his or her lifetime. The existence of such a mechanism would be proportionate, imposing less of a limit on the right to private and family life and not hindering society\u2019s legitimate interests, since the circle of close relatives who could object to organ removal would remain very limited. In such cases, the lack of an answer from the relatives \u2013 after a specified period and after contacting them and requesting them to express their wishes \u2013 could be presumed to constitute consent. The applicant concluded that there had been no pressing social need which could have exempted the authorities from their duty of seeking to establish the wishes of the closest relatives concerning organ removal.",

They pointed out that when a deceased person\u2019s closest relatives were not present at the hospital, national laws did not impose any obligation on a doctor or on the medical institution itself to make specific inquires in order to ascertain if there was any objection from those persons as regards possible organ removal. In this connection they referred to a domestic decision (in case no.\u00a01840000303) where a city court had confirmed that section\u00a04 of the Law provided for the right of the closest relatives to object to removal of the deceased person\u2019s organs, but did not impose any obligation on the medical expert to explain these rights to the relatives.

According to the Government, the \u201cpresumed consent system\u201d in Latvia was an active process and the persons involved were expected to take positive steps if they wished to veto any organ removal. It is the Court\u2019s view that these issues appertain to the quality of domestic law, in particular, whether the domestic legislation was formulated with sufficient precision or afforded adequate legal protection against arbitrariness in the absence of the relevant administrative regulation.",

Against this background, while clearly there was a medical emergency given his critical condition, it cannot be said that it had been practically impossible to contact his closest relatives or at least to make an attempt to contact them, informing them of his condition and making enquiries about the possible organ transplantation. Indeed, the applicant submits that she was in contact with the doctors at the Hospital; the Government deny this for the simple reason that no contact details were recorded on her son\u2019s medical card. Be that as it may, the starting point of the Court\u2019s analysis is that, as established by the domestic authorities, the applicant was not informed about the possible removal of her son\u2019s organs for transplantation purposes (see paragraphs 15, 18, 20 and 22 above).",

However, the Minister for Health was of the opinion that the applicant should have been informed; it has been mentioned that as a result of a proposal by a working group established in the Ministry, certain amendments to the Law had been proposed to improve clarity (see paragraph 23 above). These amendments were later adopted by Parliament with effect from 30 June 2004 (see paragraph 41 above). Such disagreement and the subsequent changes in the legislation indicate a lack of reasonable clarity as to the nature of the discretion conferred on the public authorities under domestic law at the time. While Latvian law set out the legal framework allowing the closest relatives to express their wishes in relation to organ removal for transplantation purposes, it did not define with sufficient clarity the scope of the corresponding obligation or the discretion conferred on medical practitioners or other authorities in this respect.",

Following the death of the applicant\u2019s son, as explained by the prosecution, only sections 4 and 11 of the Law were applicable (see paragraphs 25-26 above). The Government referred to domestic case-law, confirming that there was no legal duty to inform the closest relatives about imminent organ removal, and argued that the Law implied that action was needed to be taken by the relatives. The Court reiterates that the principle of legality requires States not only to respect and apply, in a foreseeable and consistent manner, the laws they have enacted, but also, as a necessary part, to ensure the legal and practical conditions for their implementation (see mutatis mutandis Broniowski v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, \u00a7\u00a7 147 and 184, ECHR 2004 V). In the present case, it remains unclear how the \u201cpresumed consent system\u201d, as established under the Latvian law, operates in practice in the circumstances in which the applicant found herself, whereby she had certain rights as the closest relative but was not informed \u2013 let alone provided with any explanation \u2013 as to how and when these rights might have to be exercised.",

The prosecution also explained that the relevant provisions prohibited organ removal in cases where a refusal or an objection had been received but not in cases where the wishes of the closest relative had not been established (see paragraph 26 above). The Government, while arguing that the removal of organs from the deceased person could not take place against the expressed or presumed wishes of the person concerned, nevertheless admitted that it was not necessary for the medical expert to explain the rights of the closest relatives or to make any inquires as to their wishes. The Court notes a considerable uncertainty as to the applicable law in these various positions. As noted by the applicant and uncontested by the Government, several medical examinations were carried out prior to the actual organ transplantation to establish whether the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s organs were in fact compatible with the potential recipient\u2019s body. The amount of time required to carry out such examinations, short as it might have been, could have been sufficient to provide a real opportunity for the applicant to express her wishes in the absence of those of her son. As noted, however, no mechanism was in place for the applicant to express her wishes, which she was entitled to do under domestic law.",

On one hand, when considering the question of the exhaustion of domestic remedies, the majority affirms (in paragraph 70) that \u201cthe applicant\u2019s complaint relates to the application and interpretation of domestic law, in the light particularly of the absence of relevant administrative regulation; it cannot be said that any issues of compatibility arise\u201d. For the purpose of deciding on the issue of the complaint\u2019s admissibility, the nature of the legal issue at stake is the manner in which the law is construed and applied, not the content of the law. At the same time, the judgment states (in paragraph 90) that the issues under consideration \u201cappertain to the quality of domestic law, in particular, whether the domestic legislation was formulated with sufficient precision or afforded adequate legal protection against arbitrariness in the absence of the relevant administrative regulation.\u201d Thus, for the purpose of considering the merits of the case, the main legal issue is no longer the interpretation and application of the law, but its content. If this is so, then the issue of the compatibility of the legislation with the principle of its foreseeability and precision inevitably arises. Prima facie there is no obstacle to lodging a constitutional complaint against legislation lacking precision and pertaining to fundamental constitutional rights. I note that in many countries a statute lacking sufficient precision and clarity may be declared contrary to the national Constitution by a constitutional court or by other courts entrusted with the constitutional review of legislation.",

Avoiding discussion of fundamental human rights questions which arise in cases under consideration, and which are of utmost relevance in ascertaining the correct judicial answer, does not seem to be the most efficient argumentative strategy for a human rights court.",

It is obvious that death cannot extinguish such rights.

Firstly, why is an administrative regulation the preferred solution, rather than a better drafted statute? Such a stance would require more thorough consideration under the Latvian Constitution. Secondly, the Court is entering the domain of the States\u2019 constitutional autonomy.
