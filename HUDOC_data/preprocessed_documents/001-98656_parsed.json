Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, \u00a7 43, ECHR 1999VIII).",

Norway [GC], no.\u00a021980/93, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999III). The Court's task is not to take the place of the national courts but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation (ibid., \u00a7 60, and, Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, \u00a7 45, ECHR 1999I). In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Jersild v. Denmark, 23\u00a0September\u00a01994, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 298, and Veraart v. the Netherlands, no. 10807/04, \u00a7 61, 30 November 2006).

The applicant submitted to the domestic courts, in particular, that the original statement expressed by him had been couched in milder terms and had a broader context. The courts found against him on that point after considering the evidence which was before them: the submissions of the applicant and one of the organisers of the round table on the one hand, and those of Mr L, who had prepared the article in Ukraine and the World Today, on the other. In the ordinary course of events, in the absence of prima facie evidence of procedural unfairness the Court would accept such findings of the domestic courts (see, for example, Marchenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 4063/04, \u00a7 48, 19 February 2009). In the present case, however, the first-instance court carried out pre-judicial investigations during the whole of the period from the bringing of the proceedings in April\u00a01999 until 21 June 2001, when the defendants were informed of the proceedings. By then, however, apart from the fact that pre-judicial enquiries should have been terminated within a maximum of twenty days from registration of the civil claim (see paragraph 31 above), the newspaper had destroyed the tape recording of the proceedings as it took the view that the prescription period of one year had expired. The unfortunate result was that by not dealing with the case, or even informing the defendant of its existence, until the evidence which could well have shed a conclusive light on the issue had been destroyed, the first-instance court had put itself in a position in which its assessment of the relevant facts was restricted.",
