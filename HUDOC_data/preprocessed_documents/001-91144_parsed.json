Sometime in 1996 the Government filed a request with the NJC to open disciplinary proceedings against the applicant. They alleged that from January to August 1996 the applicant had conducted sexual relationships with minors and that from 1995 onwards he had used his position to protect the financial activities of two individuals who were known for their criminal activities, and had thus caused damage to the reputation of the judiciary, which amounted to a serious disciplinary offence. For these reasons they proposed that disciplinary proceedings be instituted against the applicant and that a disciplinary sanction be imposed, including that he be permanently removed from office as a judge and as President of the Supreme Court. Furthermore, they asked for the applicant\u2019s immediate provisional removal from office during the proceedings.",

The motion was denied on 9 January 1997 as being unfounded. At the hearing held on 9 January 1997 the NJC refused the applicant\u2019s request that the hearings before it be public on the ground that the exclusion of the public was necessary for the protection of the interests of the applicant and the judiciary as such without any further reasoning.

On 14 January 1997 the NJC found that the applicant had committed a disciplinary offence in maintaining contacts and appearing in public with B.\u010c. and S.\u0160. despite knowing that they had been convicted of numerous crimes, and of using his position to protect these two individuals\u2019 interests and gains from June 1995 to November 1996.

The Court noted that the manifest example of such activities was provided by the armed forces and the police. Furthermore, as to the proceedings concerning dismissal of a judge in its Pitkevich decision on admissibility (see Pitkevich v. Russia (dec.), no. 47936, 8 February 2001) the Court found that the judiciary, while not being part of the ordinary civil service, was nonetheless part of typical public service. A judge had specific responsibilities in the field of administration of justice, which was a sphere in which States exercised sovereign powers. Consequently, a judge participated directly in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and performed duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State. The Court concluded that the dispute concerning the dismissal of a judge did not concern her \u201ccivil\u201d rights or obligations within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention.",

For these reasons the Court decided to develop further the functional criterion set out in the Pellegrin judgment and adopted the following approach (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others\u00a0v.

It must also satisfy a series of requirements \u2013 independence, in particular of the executive, impartiality and guarantees afforded by its procedure \u2013 several of which appear in the text of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 itself (see Zlinsat, spol. s.r.o., v.

Italy, 26 February 1993, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 257-B). To that end Article 6 requires a tribunal falling within its scope to be impartial. Impartiality normally denotes absence of prejudice or bias and its existence can be tested in various ways. The Court has thus distinguished between a subjective approach, that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction or interest of a given judge in a particular case, and an objective approach, that is determining whether he or she offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium, 1\u00a0October 1982, \u00a7\u00a030, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a053, and Grieves v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a057067/00, \u00a7\u00a069, ECHR 2003-XII).",

As regards the type of proof required, the Court has, for example, sought to ascertain whether a judge has displayed hostility or ill-will or has arranged to have a case assigned to himself for personal reasons (see De Cubber, cited above, \u00a7 25). The principle that a tribunal shall be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is long established in the case-law of the Court (see, for example, the Le\u00a0Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium judgment cited above, \u00a7\u00a058). Although in some cases it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption, it must be remembered that the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports 1996-III). In other words, the Court has recognised the difficulty of establishing a breach of Article 6 on account of subjective partiality and for this reason has in the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues focused on the objective test. However, there is no watertight division between the two notions, since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test), but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test) (see Kyprianou v.  [GC], no.\u00a073797/01, \u00a7\u00a0119, ECHR 2005...).",

It is the higher demands of justice and the elevated nature of judicial office which impose that duty (see Buscemi v. Italy, no. 29569/95, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR 1999-VI). Thus, where a court president publicly used expressions which implied that he had already formed an unfavourable view of the applicant\u2019s case before presiding over the court that had to decide it, his statements were such as to justify objectively the accused\u2019s fears as to his impartiality (see Buscemi v. Italy, cited above, \u00a7 68). On the other hand, in another case, where a judge engaged in public criticism of the defence and publicly expressed surprise that the accused had pleaded not guilty, the Court approached the matter on the basis of the subjective test (see Lavents v.\u00a0Latvia, no. 58442/00, \u00a7\u00a7 118 and 119, 28 November 2002).",

The Court reiterates that while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see Schenk v. Switzerland, 12 July 1988, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, Series A no.\u00a0140, and Garcia Ruiz v. Spain [GC] no. 30544/96, ECHR 1999-I, \u00a7\u00a028).
