She received, inter alia, the Explanatory Memorandum required by the Adoption Agencies Regulations 1976, the first sentence of which reads: \"This Memorandum must be given to the parent ... of a child who is about to be adopted\", and she was therefore informed from this moment of the Council\u2019s decision. Indeed, it appears that on 29 September a social worker visited the applicant to discuss adoption and her refusal to sign the certificate at the end of the said Memorandum. At this time, the Council withdrew its social-worker support for the applicant, in the context of her relationship with A, since it was no longer envisaged that this relationship should be nurtured.

According to the Local Ombudsman\u2019s report (see paragraph 31 below), they had, on their solicitors\u2019 advice, deferred making an approach to the courts so that they could show that the applicant\u2019s health had improved and that she had a stable home. The summons issued for access in favour of the applicant was due to be heard on 1 December 1978. On that day, the court ordered H to file evidence in support of the application within twenty-one days and the Council to file evidence twenty-one days thereafter. Leave was granted for A to be examined by a psychiatrist nominated by the Official Solicitor if he saw fit and for all parties to file psychiatric evidence about other parties to the proceedings, including H and A. The summons was then adjourned, with liberty to the parties to restore it.",

On 22 October, the Official Solicitor confirmed that he would arrange \"in the near future\" for the visits and the instruction of the psychiatrist.",

The former contended that the circumstances of the case had totally changed since then and that leave should therefore be sought anew, A still being a ward of court.

Whilst taking the view that the Official Solicitor had \"acted with all reasonable promptness\", he described the Council\u2019s delay, though not deliberate, as \"quite deplorable\", adding that the apology made by its legal department \"does not assist [the applicant] whose case was seriously prejudiced by this delay\". He pointed out that \"[in adoption proceedings] delay is a potent weapon and courts and practitioners must be vigilant to ensure that the position of natural parents is not prejudiced thereby\". Nevertheless, the result of the delay here was that when the case came before the court, A, who was aged four years and ten months, had been with the prospective adopters for nineteen months and had not seen her mother since June 1977, nearly three and a half years previously.",

Their Lordships were unanimously of the view that the courts had no reviewing powers as to the merits of local authority decisions, notably on such matters as access to the child: the general inherent power of the court in its wardship jurisdiction was available to fill gaps or supplement the powers of local authorities but not to supervise (except on judicial review principles; see paragraph 57 above) the exercise of discretion within the field committed to them by statute. Sometimes, however, the local authority itself may invite the supplementary assistance of the court and the wardship may then be continued with a view to action by the court.",

It could therefore exclude the natural parents from access. Consequently, the applicant retained no separate or residual right of access to the child and the proceedings thus did not concern a \"right\" of hers. Alternatively, the Government submitted, any such right of access had already been \"determined\" by the High Court when on 24 June 1977 it stopped the applicant\u2019s access to A (ibid.).",
