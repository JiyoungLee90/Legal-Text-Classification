The NRTC noted that at three of its previous meetings it had discussed draft regulations drawn up by the BNR management board, and had noted that they did not envisage any mechanism governing the workings of the BNR collective bodies and the journalists\u2019 rights and obligations. The NRTC\u2019s recommendation for those matters to be addressed had not been heeded. The lack of precise regulations was somewhat offset by the existence of rules governing the workings of individual BNR programmes. However, the rules of the \u201cHristo Botev\u201d programme did not say on which legal provision they were based and predated the BNR regulations on which they were supposed to be based. Those rules did not define clearly the competencies of the journalists in their various professional capacities as authors, hosts, editors, reporters and so on. Neither the BNR regulations nor the individual programmes\u2019 rules dealt with the powers of collective bodies such as management and editorial boards. The applicant\u2019s and the two other journalists\u2019 dismissals showed that there existed confusion between administrative and professional bodies, which made it possible to have administrative interference in the content of radio shows. Rule 7 of the \u201cHristo Botev\u201d programme (see paragraph 37 below), mentioned in the dismissal orders, was an example of that, because it said that changes in a show\u2019s content could be made solely by written order of the respective manager. The editorial board\u2019s resolution of 5 October 1998 as to who could and who could not be an interlocutor in the show was also an example of that.",

It found that the rules of disciplinary procedure had been breached in that the applicant had not been properly invited to explain her actions before a competent disciplinary authority. It went on to say that the order for the applicant\u2019s dismissal did not point to the specific disciplinary offences committed by her, save for the breach of the editorial board\u2019s resolution of 5\u00a0October 1998. However, the minutes of the board\u2019s meeting showed that it was far from clear whether any resolution had been adopted with regard to the participation of Ms V.N. in the show. Lastly, the court found that, despite having the duty to do so under Article 189 of the Labour Code 1986 (see paragraph 39 below), the BNR had failed to consider whether the severity of the punishment corresponded to the gravity of the applicant\u2019s offence. The order for the applicant\u2019s dismissal was therefore unlawful and had to be set aside. She was accordingly entitled to lost wages, plus interest. However, she could not be reinstated because the term of her employment contract had come to an end on 31 December 1999, while the judicial proceedings were pending.",

It found that the applicant had been duly asked for an explanation by a competent disciplinary authority \u2013 her line manager \u2013 prior to the imposition of her punishment. The court went on to say that the order for the applicant\u2019s dismissal had been issued in line with the applicable requirements, had indicated the offender, the offence, the punishment, and the legal provisions on which it had been based. Moreover, the applicant had in fact committed the disciplinary offence alleged against her. By allowing Ms V.N. to in fact host her show for one hundred and thirteen minutes the applicant had not only breached employment discipline but had also grossly violated basic rules of her work, such as compliance with the resolutions of the editorial board. By trying to present Ms V.N. as a \u201ccoauthor\u201d instead of an \u201cinterlocutor\u201d, she had tried to circumvent the editorial board\u2019s resolution. Under Rule 7 of the \u201cHristo Botev\u201d programme (see paragraph 37 below), any changes in the content or in the organisation of shows that had already been approved could be made only by written decision of the appropriate manager. Therefore, after the editorial board had approved the show on 9 October 1998, the applicant should have informed it about the intended participation of Ms V.N. as a coauthor. By failing to do so, she had grossly breached the rules of the \u201cHristo Botev\u201d programme and had accordingly correctly been given the harshest disciplinary punishment \u2013 dismissal.",

In its view, that court\u2019s ruling that the order for the applicant\u2019s dismissal had been lawful corresponded to the evidence, which showed that the order had been issued by a competent disciplinary authority in line with the applicable rules of procedure and had been duly reasoned. The court further found that the decision to dismiss the applicant had been correct. By knowingly failing to comply with the decision that Ms V.N. should not take part in her show, the applicant had breached employment discipline within the meaning of the Labour Code 1986 (see paragraph 39 below). It was true that the BNR\u2019s internal rules had not envisaged an editorial board, but it could not be overlooked that the meeting on 5 October 1998 had been attended by Mr I.R. and Ms M.P., both of whom had been entrusted by the directors general of the BNR and the \u201cHristo Botev\u201d programme with managerial functions. Mr I.R. and Ms M.P. had indicated that they did not agree with Ms V.N.\u2019s intended participation in the applicant\u2019s show. Although the applicant had been aware of that, she had allowed Ms V.N. to take part in her show, thus breaching employment discipline within the meaning of Article 190 \u00a7 1 (6) of the Labour Code 1986 (see paragraph 39 below). The court went on to say that the applicant should have also been aware of the orders of the directors general of the BNR and of the \u201cHristo Botev\u201d programme, which had been public and available upon request. Lastly, the court held that the applicant\u2019s dismissal had not been contrary to Article 10 of the Convention, because that Article allowed the licensing of broadcasting enterprises. Therefore, neither its letter nor its spirit proscribed the existence of disagreements between those entrusted with the task of framing a radio\u2019s programme and those in charge of current and operative issues. The same went for Article 39 of the Constitution and section 4 of the Radio and Television Act 1996 (see\u00a0paragraphs 31 and 33 below).",

It was clear that the applicant had committed a disciplinary offence. The sanction had been proportionate to the gravity of that offence. The applicant had had a domestic remedy allowing her to challenge her dismissal in court, and had availed herself of that opportunity. It was also important to point out that the BNR management had not voiced disagreement with the topics intended to be included in the applicant\u2019s show, had not tried to ban the airing of any material \u2013 such as those concerning alleged corruption and the customs \u2013, and had not sought to impose any changes to the show\u2019s script with a view to censoring it. The show had not been taken off the air. The editorial board\u2019s resolution of 5 October 1998 had prohibited only the intended participation of Ms V.N. in the show, for reasons which could be deduced from the ensuing explanations of Mr I.R. and Ms M.P. to the BNR director general, as well as from the position taken by the NRTC. The BNR was a national media which had a large number of listeners, traditions and authority, and no real competitors in the sphere of political journalism on radio. Such a media had to abide by certain internal rules enforced by its management, and decisions as to the content of its shows could not be taken singlehandedly. Contrary to what she was alleging, the applicant had been acquainted with the editorial board\u2019s resolution that Ms V.N. should not take part in her show, which had apparently been adopted after a vote. All of that showed that the conflict between the applicant and the BNR management was rather the result of differences of principle, and did not concern the journalistic investigations conducted by Ms V.N. and the three other journalists. The applicant had in effect allowed Ms V.N. to take over her show, thus circumventing the editorial board\u2019s resolution. That resolution could not be regarded as a form of censorship because it had not proscribed the discussion of any topics or changes to the substantive content of the show. It had merely barred Ms V.N. \u2013 not the applicant or the other journalists who had taken part in the journalistic investigations discussed during the show \u2013 to be put on air.",

She had had the right to select the persons who were to take part in the show, and had not breached the technical rules or the weekly schedule, because she had obtained the agreement of the editor in charge, who had approved the show\u2019s script, topics and participants. Her disciplinary dismissal had had nothing to do with the breaches set out in the order of the BNR director general, and the ensuing dispute had been an employment one only ostensibly, while in reality having a deeply political subtext. That assessment had been shared by the entire journalistic guild, and had been reflected in declarations made by the Union of Bulgarian Journalists and other organisations. Even the Supreme Court of Cassation had, by saying in its judgment in the applicant\u2019s case that Article 10 of the Convention allowed limitations on the exercise of freedom of expression, acknowledged that the applicant\u2019s dismissal had related to the exercise of her freedom of expression.

The alleged breaches of discipline to which the Government alluded in their observations had not been laid down in any statute or internal rule of the BNR; they had been breaches of nonexistent rules issued by bodies that by law did not exist. As evident from the minutes of its meeting of 5 October 1998, the editorial board had not formally resolved to bar Ms V.N. from taking part in the applicant\u2019s show. However, even if it had done so, its resolution would have amounted to censorship and would have been invalid. The NRTC had found that the BNR\u2019s internal rules had not clearly set out the powers of its collective bodies, and those rules did not identify clearly the roles of the various persons who were to take part in radio shows.

The public was entitled to know about the sale of municipal plots at reduced prices, abuses and the diversion of funds in the customs, and the strange restitutions of prime properties.

In so far as the applicant claimed, based on the findings of the firstinstance court which dealt with her legal challenge against her dismissal, that the disciplinary proceedings against her had failed to comply with the procedural requirements laid down in that Code, the Court observes that the judgment of that court was later overturned, in the context of the same proceedings and without having acquired legal force, by higher courts at two levels of jurisdiction, and that those higher courts found that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant had been in line with the relevant legal provisions (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above). The Court observes in this connection that it is primarily for the national courts to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among many other authorities, Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. , 25 June 1992, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 239, and Casado Coca v. , 24 February 1994, \u00a7 43, Series A no. 285A). Although the Court can and should exercise a certain power of review in this matter, since failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of Article 10 of the Convention, the scope of its task is subject to limits inherent in the subsidiary nature of the Convention, and it cannot question the way in which the domestic courts have interpreted and applied national law except in cases of flagrant nonobservance or arbitrariness (see, mutatis mutandis, Weber and Saravia v. Germany (dec.), no. 54934/00, \u00a7 90, ECHR\u00a02006XI, and GoranovaKaraeneva v. , no. 12739/05, \u00a7 46, 8 March 2011). The Court does not consider that the Sofia City Court\u2019s and the Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s judgments were arbitrary. Contrary to the applicant\u2019s averment, those courts explained, albeit briefly, why they were of the view that she had acted in breach of employment discipline within the meaning of the relevant provisions of the Code (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above), and their rulings on this point cannot be regarded as manifestly erroneous or arbitrary. In view of these considerations, the Court concludes that the interference was lawful in terms of Bulgarian law. The applicant has not sought to argue that that the relevant provisions of the Labour Code 1986 were not sufficiently accessible or foreseeable.",

Indeed, when taking disciplinary action against the applicant the BNR management board and the BNR director general specifically noted that she had in effect allowed Ms V.N. to host her show in her stead (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above) Neither the editorial decision nor the order for the applicant\u2019s dismissal mentioned or imposed any limitations on the topics to be discussed during her show, or on the substantive content or manner of presentation of the information broadcast during the show (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Purcell\u00a0and Others v. Ireland, no. 15404/89, Commission decision of 16\u00a0April 1991, Decisions and Reports 70, p. 262; Brind and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 18714/91, Commission decision of 9 May 1994, unreported; and Fuentes Bobo v. Spain, no. 39293/98, \u00a7 45, 29 February 2000). The Court cannot therefore agree with the applicant that her dismissal was intended to prevent the dissemination of information of public interest. The situation in the present case thus appears far removed from that obtaining in Manole and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 10406 and 112), where the Court was faced with a situation where a public broadcasting organisation was systematically required to avoid certain topics considered harmful to the Government and to devote a disproportionate amount of airtime to reporting on the acts of members of the ruling political party, with little or no coverage of the acts and views of opposition parties. By contrast, in the present case the applicant\u2019s dismissal appears to have been a result of her failure to abide by the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d undertaken as a journalist employed by a public broadcasting organisation. Her capacity as such a journalist did not automatically entitle her to pursue, unchecked, a policy that ran counter to that outlined by her employer, to flout legitimate editorial decisions taken by the BNR\u2019s management and intended to ensure balanced broadcasting on topics of public interest, or to have unlimited access to BNR\u2019s air. There is nothing in the facts of the present case to suggest that the decisions of the BNR\u2019s management in relation to the applicant\u2019s show were taken under pressure from the outside or that the BNR\u2019s management was subject to outside interferences.",

In the instant case, the BNR management board entrusted that decision to the BNR director general, instructing him to take into account the degree of the applicant\u2019s fault (see paragraph 14 in fine above). The director general came to the view that the appropriate disciplinary punishment was dismissal (see paragraph 15 above). His decision in that respect was subjected to scrutiny by the domestic courts. The firstinstance court found that he had failed to consider whether the severity of the punishment corresponded to the gravity of the applicant\u2019s offence (see\u00a0paragraph 25 above). The appellate and the cassation courts were, on the contrary, satisfied that the gravity of the disciplinary breach committed by the applicant was sufficient to warrant her dismissal (see paragraphs 27 and\u00a029 above). The Court, for its part, observes that it is true that dismissal by way of disciplinary sanction is a severe measure (see Fuentes Bobo, cited above, \u00a7 49). However, it cannot be overlooked that it was prompted by concrete and deliberate actions on the part of the applicant \u2013 who in effect allowed Ms V.N. to host her show in her stead, letting her speak for one hundred and thirteen minutes out of one hundred and twenty (see paragraphs\u00a01315 above) \u2013 which showed that her employer could not trust her to perform her duties in good faith (contrast Vogt v. Germany, 26\u00a0September 1995, \u00a7 60, Series A no. 323, and Wille v. Liechtenstein [GC], no. 28396/95, \u00a7 69, ECHR 1999VII). The Court has already had occasion to observe, although in a different context, that the national authorities may be justified in insisting that employment relations should be based on mutual trust (see Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others, cited above, \u00a7 76); this is even more so when it comes to journalists employed by a public broadcasting organisation. It should be noted in this connection that BNR, as a public broadcaster, bore responsibility for statements made on air (see,\u00a0mutatis mutandis, Radio France and Others v. , no. 53984/00, \u00a7\u00a024, ECHR 2004II).",

There were no identifiable delays in the proceedings before the firstinstance court. The applicant criticised the secondinstance court for taking more than a year and a half to dispose of the case. The Court is unable to agree that that period was excessive. It notes that a hearing listed before that court for 7 December 2001 had to be adjourned on account of a bomb threat, for which the authorities cannot be held responsible (see paragraph 26 above). It is true that the period of adjournment \u2013 approximately six months \u2013 could have been shorter, but the Court does not consider that it in itself rendered the length of the proceedings unreasonable. Nor does the Court consider that the national courts\u2019 failure to comply with the domesticlaw timelimits on the duration of employment proceedings automatically rendered the length of the proceedings unreasonable. Failure to abide by timelimits prescribed by domestic law does not in itself contravene the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see GoranovaKaraeneva, cited above, \u00a7 73, with further references). That said, the Court notes that recently, in Nikolov and Others v. Bulgaria (nos. 44184/05, 22250/06 and 37182/07, \u00a7\u00a7 3742, 21 February 2012), it found that delays of about two years in the examination of appeals on points of law by the Supreme Court of Cassation, in proceedings in which the applicants had been challenging their dismissals from work, had been in breach of the reasonabletime requirement, because a very high level of diligence was required of the authorities in such cases in view of the stakes involved. The Court sees no reason to hold otherwise in the present case, where the Supreme Court of Cassation took almost two and a half years to dispose of the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law.",

Notwithstanding the fact that these are regulated by labour legislation, they do require particular attention so as not to render nugatory or to substantially diminish the freedom of expression protected by Article 10 of the Convention. Disputes surrounding journalistic activities should not be viewed only or mainly in terms of labour legislation which, although significant, does not constitute the whole picture. It is equally significant to have regard to the particular feature at play in the professional activity of the journalist, bearing in mind his or her role in conveying ideas and opinions. That is why we consider important that in cases of dismissal or other measures taken by employers against journalists, particular attention should be given to rights protected by Article 10 of the Convention.",

The Bulgarian courts considered the issue as only a labour dispute and did not take into account the problems in the functioning of the BNR and the rights and duties of the journalists employed by it. There was an absolute lack of an Article 10 analysis at domestic level. This is crucial to our way of thinking. In the absence of such analysis the majority prefers to undertake this task itself. We remain firmly of the opinion that it is not for this Court to embark upon such analysis when this has not taken place at domestic level and its elements were not examined and balanced by the authorities when deciding the case.",

Indeed, in our opinion the measure of dismissal has been quite extreme. It does not seem that other measures or sanctions were considered by the BNR Director or the BNR Management Board. The majority has relied on the case of Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others v.  ([GC], nos.\u00a028955/06, 28957/06, 28959/06 and 28964/06, ECHR 2011...) for finding the measure proportionate (see paragraph 60 of the judgment). The relevance of that case, whose circumstances were clearly different from those in the present case, seems to us very limited. In the present case we are talking firstly about journalistic activity and, secondly, about activity which did not entail conduct that was offensive in any way. The act attributed to the applicant taken within the context of rather unclear division of responsibilities as concerns editorial choices within a given programme does not appear to have been so grave or so farreaching in its effects as to irrevocably have breached the mutual trust between employer and employee.",
