This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken all reasonable steps to secure the evidence concerning the incident. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see, e.g., Muravskaya v.

The Court reiterates that a substantial delay in the identification of the cause of a death, unless it is justified by objective circumstances, can in and of itself undermine public confidence in the maintenance of the rule of law and thereby raise an issue under the Convention (see, e.g., Merkulova v. Ukraine, no.\u00a021454/04, \u00a7\u00a7 50-51 and 61, 3 March 2011; Kachurka v. Ukraine, no. 4737/06, \u00a7\u00a050, 15 September 2011 and Sergiyenko v.

The Court also notes the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning difficulties encountered by her in obtaining information on the progress of the case and involvement in the decision-making process. In this regard the Court reiterates that an effective investigation requires that the actions of the authorities be subjected to public scrutiny, and that the deceased person\u2019s next-of-kin must able to take an active part in it, including by prompt access to the relevant materials and decisions (see, e.g., Sergey Shevchenko v. Ukraine, no. 32478/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a074-75, 4 April 2006; Kachurka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051; Mikhalkova and Others v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a010919/05, \u00a7\u00a048, 13 January 2011; Masneva v.
