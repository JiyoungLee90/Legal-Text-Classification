The case originated in an application (no. 37042/14) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Yevgeniy Valentinovich Chayka (“the applicant”), on 25 April 2014.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Belyakov, a lawyer practising in Moscow. The Russian Government ("the Government") were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 16 November 2015 the complaint concerning the belated examination of the applicant’s statements of appeal against the detention order was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Moscow.
On 8 October 2013 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of aggravated fraud. Two days later the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow authorised his detention.
The detention was extended by the District Court on 20 November 2013. The applicant’s counsel appealed. On 20 January 2014 the Moscow City Court upheld the detention order.
On 5 September 2014 the District Court changed the measure of restraint from detention to house arrest.
