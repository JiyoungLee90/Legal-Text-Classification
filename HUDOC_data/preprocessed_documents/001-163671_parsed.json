The prosecutor first gave arguments in support of the risk that the applicant would abscond. Thus, because he had held the posts of Minister of the Interior and Prime Minister of the country in the past, he had formed a broad and extensive personal network within the country and abroad. The applicant possessed two valid diplomatic passports under his real name, and those travel documents allowed him to use simplified procedures for entering any foreign country as well as other privileges reserved for diplomats. Furthermore, it appeared that the applicant also had a false passport (see paragraph 10 above). Moreover, the prosecutor continued, the fact that the applicant\u2019s spouse had hurriedly left Georgia on 21\u00a0May 2013, after the applicant had been summoned by the investigating authority, also gave rise to a suspicion that the applicant might aim to join his wife outside the country.

Considering that the impugned offences were closely related to his past activities in public office, and the fact that the majority of the important witnesses had worked under the applicant\u2019s hierarchical subordination, there was a well-substantiated risk that the applicant might influence those people. The prosecutor\u2019s argument was confirmed by reference to the incident of 30\u00a0November 2012, when the applicant had managed to identify the mobile phone number of the Chief of the Border Police, placed a call and exerted pressure on the latter in a rude and obscene manner by uttering personal and career threats (see paragraph 11 above).",

Notably, the detention had been authorised by the Kutaisi City Court decision of 22 May 2013, delivered after the fully adversarial judicial review. Whilst the decision mentioned in its reasoning part that the legal basis for the imposition of the detention was Article 205 of the CCP (see paragraph 22 above), it should further be noted that paragraph 2 of the specified criminal provision explicitly stated that the pre-trial detention measure was imposable for the maximum permissible time-limit of nine months (see paragraph 61 above). In other words, when read in conjunction with Article 205 \u00a7 2 of the CCP it was clear that the decision of 22\u00a0May 2013 remanded the applicant in custody for the maximum permissible statutory period, as such was the well-established practice of domestic courts. As proof of the existence of uniform judicial practice in that respect, the Government submitted numerous recent examples of detention orders which did not cite the relevant provisions from Article 205 of the CCP, nor indicated any specific time-limits, but rather gave general references to that particular Article as the only legal basis for the imposition of the detention. The Government further stated that in order to alleviate the fact that the preventive measure of pre-trial detention was straightforwardly imposable for the statutory period of nine months, the legislator was thoughtful enough to provide for an alternative mechanism of regular review of the lawfulness and appropriateness of the continued detention. Notably, under Article\u00a0206\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 in fine, 8 and 9 of the CCP, the applicant was entitled to request release from pre-trial detention at any stage of the proceedings, including the pre-trial conference, if he considered that his continued detention had ceased to be necessary for the purposes of good administration of justice (see paragraph 63 above).",

Firstly, the initial detention order of 22 May 2013 neither directly indicated that he was remanded for the maximum permissible statutory period of nine months nor made a specific reference to paragraph 2 of Article 205 of the CCP. Consequently, it was difficult for him to read from the impugned court decision what exactly the duration of his pre-trial detention ought to be. Even assuming that the Kutaisi City Court had indeed authorised his pretrial detention for the statutory period of nine months by default, in accordance with the prevalent judicial practice, the blind application of that general practice was unjustified and disproportionate in his case, as there had existed particular factual circumstances which should have been taken into account by the domestic court. The applicant claimed that the domestic courts had placed him in a situation whereby he was remanded in custody for an \u201cunlimited or unpredictable time\u201d (a reference was made to Baranowski v. Poland (no. 28358/95, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2000III), or an \u201cindefinite period of time\u201d (a reference was made to Tymoshenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 49872/11, \u00a7 267, 30 April 2013). Thus, by failing to give sufficient reasons and specific time-limits for his pre-trial detention, the domestic courts placed the applicant in a state of uncertainty about the grounds for his detention, in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (a further reference was made to Kharchenko v. Ukraine, no. 40107/02, \u00a7\u00a075, 10\u00a0February 2011).",

All those previous cases concern the specific problem, conditioned by a particular legislative lacuna common to the criminal procedural law of a number of Contracting States, whereby defendants were held in custody even after the expiration of the relevant detention orders, solely on the basis of the fact that a bill of indictment had been filed with a trial court (see also, as the leading authority on the matter, Je\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05764, ECHR\u00a02000IX). With respect to Georgia, that distinct legal problem, similarly giving rise to violations of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the past, was linked to the now already extinct Code of Criminal Procedure of 20 February 1998 (see Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v. Georgia, no.\u00a01704/06, \u00a7\u00a0106-111, 27 January 2009; and Gigolashvili v.

However, the absence of specific timelimits in a detention order cannot, as such, render the deprivation of liberty unlawful within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 as long as a further reading of the relevant domestic law and practice could allow a detained person to comprehend, if need be with appropriate legal advice, what the actual duration of the detention was (compare, for instance, with Chitayev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 59334/00, \u00a7 182, 18 January 2007).",

This legal provision, whilst enumerating in its first paragraph the exhaustive list of purposes for which the detention measure could be used, in its second paragraph clearly stated that the length of the detention so authorised should not exceed the maximum permissible time-limit of nine months, or could even expire earlier by the fact of the delivery of a judgment at the first level of jurisdiction (see paragraph 61 above, and compare again with Chitayev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 109 and 182). That being so, it should not have been that difficult for the applicant, who was assisted by lawyers, to understand, by reading the decision of 25 May 2013 in conjunction with paragraph 2 of Article\u00a0205, that the imposed detention measure was to run for the maximum permissible statutory period of nine months unless a judgment of the first-instance court intervened earlier. This is particularly true in the light of the existence of an extensive judicial practice, according to which it was commonplace for the criminal courts at the material time to refer in their detention orders to Article 205 of the CCP rather than to cite the specific provision from that Article concerning the statutory length or to indicate any other time-limits (see paragraph 68 above). The applicant\u2019s lawyers, as qualified legal professionals, should normally have been aware of that judicial practice.",

On the contrary, Article 206 \u00a7\u00a7 1 in fine, 8 and 9 of the CPP clearly allowed the applicant to request at any stage of the proceedings pending trial the alteration or cancellation of the initially imposed detention. In that respect, the Court shares the Government\u2019s position that, in theory, that particular remedy was designed to enable the domestic courts to keep track of and respond to changing circumstances, and to modify or cancel the initial detention order if it appeared, after an additional judicial review, that the reasons provided therein ceased to exist or no longer sufficed for justification of the continued deprivation of liberty. The Court observes that the applicant resorted, in actual fact, to that remedy on 25 September 2013 (see paragraph 30 above).",

He argued that the majority of those statements were official documents, representing the position of high-ranking European officials, and should therefore be taken into consideration during the examination of his complaint under Article\u00a018 of the Convention. Apart from the position of the international community, the applicant also asked the Court to take into account the official statements of senior State officials in Georgia which conveyed the ruling forces\u2019 intention to eradicate the UNM from the political life of the country. As another example of the political witch-hunt allegedly perpetuated by the current Government against members of the former regime, the applicant also referred to an unrelated set of criminal proceedings against a former Minister of Defence, D.K., whose extradition from France to Georgia had recently been refused by a French court, the Court of Appeal of AixenProvence.",

In the latter case the Court concluded that the criminal prosecution and detention had been used against Mr\u00a0Gusinskiy in order to intimidate and coerce him into ceding his company shares to the State. In his own case as well, the applicant argued, the incident of 14\u00a0December 2013 made it clear that his criminal prosecution and detention had been used by the Chief Public Prosecutor as leverage into coercing him to give false testimony against the former President of Georgia, which particular purpose was fully extraneous to the one provided for under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention.",

Furthermore, the alleged incident was not the subject matter of the present application. They noted that, whilst the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 18 of the Convention was aimed at demonstrating the improper use of criminal proceedings and arrest as a means of excluding the applicant from the political life of the country, that particular complaint had nothing in common with the Court\u2019s judgment in the Gusinskiy case, where a violation of Article 18 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 1 was found on account of the finding that the detention had been used by the State as a part of illicit commercial bargaining strategies. The only tangible argument brought by the applicant in support of his complaint of an ulterior political motive behind his detention was the very fact of his involvement in the politics. However, the Government argued, the applicant\u2019s political status could not grant him immunity from criminal liability. They further cited, as an obiter dictum equally applicable in the applicant\u2019s situation, the Court\u2019s finding in the case of Khodorkovskiy v.\u00a0Russia (no. 5829/04, \u00a7 258, 31 May 201): \u201c[A]ny person in the applicant\u2019s position would be able to make similar allegations. In reality, it would have been impossible to prosecute a suspect with the applicant\u2019s profile without far-reaching political consequences.\u201d",

It can only be applied in conjunction with other, substantive Articles of the Convention. However, there may be a violation of Article 18 in connection with another Article, even if there is no violation of that Article taken alone. It further follows from the terms of Article\u00a018 that a violation can only arise where the right or freedom concerned is subject to restrictions permitted under the Convention (see Gusinskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73 and 75; and Cebotari v. Moldova, no. 35615/06, \u00a7\u00a049, 13\u00a0November 2007). As the Court has previously held in its case-law, the whole structure of the Convention rests on the general assumption that public authorities in the member States act in good faith. Indeed, any public policy or individual measure may have a \u201chidden agenda\u201d, and the presumption of good faith is rebuttable. However, an applicant alleging that his rights and freedoms were limited for an improper reason must convincingly show that the real aim of the authorities was not the same as that proclaimed or which could be reasonably inferred from the context. A mere suspicion that the authorities used their powers for some other purpose than those defined in the Convention is not sufficient to prove that Article 18 was breached (see Khodorkovskiy, cited above, \u00a7 255). Furthermore, high political status of an accused cannot grant immunity from criminal process and detention (see Lutsenko, cited above, \u00a7 106).",

As a consequence, there are only a few cases where a breach of that Convention provision has been found. Thus, in the Gusinskiy case (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73-78), the Court accepted that the applicant\u2019s liberty had been restricted, inter alia, for a purpose other than those mentioned in Article 5. It based its findings on a signed agreement between the detainee and the federal Minister for the Press, from which it was clear that the applicant\u2019s detention had been imposed in order to make him sell his media company to the State. In the case of Cebotari v. Moldova (cited above, \u00a7 46), the Court found a violation of Article 18 of the Convention where the applicant\u2019s arrest was obviously linked to an application pending before the Court. In the case of Lutsenko v.\u00a0Ukraine (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108-09), the prosecuting authorities seeking the applicant\u2019s arrest explicitly indicated that the applicant\u2019s communication with the media was one of the grounds for his arrest, such reasoning clearly demonstrating that his arrest was an attempt to punish him for publicly disagreeing with accusations against him. In Tymoshenko v.\u00a0Ukraine (cited above, \u00a7 299), the reasoning formally advanced by the authorities suggested that the actual purpose of the detention was to punish the applicant for a lack of respect towards the court, which it was claimed she had been demonstrating by her behaviour during judicial proceedings. In the case of Ilgar Mammadov v. Azerbaijan (no. 15172/13, \u00a7\u00a7 14243, 22\u00a0May 2014), the Court found that the standard of proof was satisfied because the combination of the relevant case-specific facts clearly demonstrated that the actual purpose of the measures taken by the authorities had been to silence or punish the applicant for criticising the government and attempting to disseminate what he believed was true information that the government were trying to hide.",

It further reiterates in this connection its previous finding that the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention lacked reasonableness, in breach of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention (see paragraphs \u00a7\u00a7 89-92).",

Thus, soon after the change of power resulting from the parliamentary election of October 2012, the applicant, who had formerly held high-ranking State posts and had then become the leader of the strongest opposition party in the country, was accused of abuse of power and certain other criminal offences, detained and prosecuted. Many international observers, including various high-ranking political leaders of foreign States and international organisations, expressed concerns over the possible use of criminal proceedings against the applicant for an improper, hidden political agenda on the part of the regime (see paragraphs\u00a04754 above). The Court considers that an allegation of the restriction of a Convention right of a politically active person for the purpose of hindering or making impossible his or her participation in the political life of the country must always be taken very seriously, given the existence of a direct link between human rights protection and the functioning of democracy. Thus, in the particular circumstances, the decision to detain the applicant must be seen in the light of the broader context of the criminal proceedings initiated against him and of his high political status at the time those proceedings were initiated. This general context is undoubtedly reminiscent of the situations examined by the Court in the cases of Lutsenko (cited above, \u00a7 104) and Tymoshenko (cited above, \u00a7 296). However, as was also emphasised in those Ukrainian cases (see, for instance, Tymoshenko, cited above, \u00a7 298), the Court cannot carry out its scrutiny under Article 18 of the Convention solely against the general perspective of the allegedly politically motivated prosecution of the applicant as an opposition leader. Indeed, as the political and adjudicative processes are fundamentally different, the Court must base its inquiry on evidence in the legal sense and its own assessment of the relevant and specific factual circumstances of an individual case. In establishing that the authorities had improper motives in restricting a politician\u2019s human rights, the Court cannot accept as evidence the opinions and resolutions of political institutions or non-governmental organisations, or statements by other public figures. It must base its scrutiny only on the concrete facts of the case (see Ilgar Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0140; Lutsenko, cited above, \u00a7 108; and also Khodorkovskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0259).",

The particularity lies, notably, in the incident of 14\u00a0December 2013, when the applicant was, according to his submissions, removed from his prison cell for a late-night meeting with the Chief Public Prosecutor and the head of the prison authority, D.D., during which the latter senior officials used the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention as leverage to obtain from him statements in relation to the unrelated investigation into the death of the former prime minister as well as those concerning the former president of the country (see paragraph 35 above). Admittedly, the applicant\u2019s own description of the circumstances surrounding the incident of 14 December 2013 might, at first sight and in the absence of a meaningful domestic investigation into the issue, have appeared to be assertions. However, the applicant\u2019s account was particularly credible and convincing, as he was able to recall clearly and coherently the sequence of the events, the time when those events had occurred, the names of the persons involved, the various distinguishing details concerning his night-time removal from the prison, and his talk with O.P. and D.D. He informed the domestic authorities of the circumstances of the incident at the very first opportunity, publicly expressing his readiness to cooperate with any investigation and calling upon the authorities to examine the video footage from the relevant prison surveillance cameras as a proof of his allegations. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s account of the facts was confirmed in part by a senior official insider of the Prison Department, L.M., who was dismissed from her post personally by D.D. shortly after her revelatory statements.",

In general, the Court observes that the authorities, notably the Prime Minister, the Minister of Prisons, and the Chief Public Prosecutor, were unmistakably opposed to the calls for an objective and thorough investigation repeatedly launched by the applicant, the public and even certain senior high-ranking State officials. Nor did the Government, in their submissions before the Court, provide any meaningful explanation of the incident of 14 December 2013, apart from making a brief reference to the very vague internal probe conducted by the Ministry of Prisons, in relation to which not even the smallest piece of information was shared with the Court. All those particular circumstances of the case lead the Court to find, from the standpoint of an objective trier of fact that the applicant\u2019s account of the incident should be agreed to be factual with as high a degree of certainty as possible (for examples of the application of a similar standard of evidence \u2013 drawing highly probable inferences from circumstantial evidence only \u2013 for the purposes of scrutiny under Article 18 of the Convention, see Ilgar Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 142; and Gusinskiy, cited above, \u00a7 76).",
