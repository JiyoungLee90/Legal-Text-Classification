In particular, it criticised both her and a colleague at Azadliq Radio for lack of professionalism and antigovernment bias.

She claimed that the article was insulting and damaging to her honour and dignity, her right to respect for her private and family life, and her right to freedom of expression. She submitted that she was facing blackmail in connection with her journalistic activity: her private life had recently been invaded and a hidden intimate video recording of her had been filmed and released on the internet. Referring specifically to the passage cited in paragraph 17 above, she argued that the article in question was part of a larger campaign mounted against her in the pro-government press in retaliation for her journalistic activity and that it had made her into an object of ridicule by \u201clowering her in the eyes of society\u201d. The article had used the incident involving the hidden video for the purpose of insulting her and damaging her reputation. The insulting and derogatory statements made in the article had caused her to experience significant mental suffering and had tarnished her reputation in the eyes of her colleagues, friends, relatives and readers. She requested the court to order the newspaper to publish an apology and sought compensation for distress in the amount of 50,000 Azerbaijani manats (AZN).",

The newspaper submitted that it too condemned the interference with the applicant\u2019s private life. However, being a \u201cjust, fair and highly reputed newspaper\u201d, it had a duty to its readers to inform them about \u201csocial, political and other events of public interest\u201d. The respondent newspaper further stated that, in its view, the fact that the applicant, who was not married, had an extramarital sexual relationship with \u201csome person\u201d was contrary to the image of a woman as \u201cthe highest manifestation of our national and moral values\u201d. Behaviour such as the applicant\u2019s could be damaging to the morals of younger generations. The newspaper argued that the contents of the article in question fell within the limits of its right to freely express its opinions. It further contended that the article could not have damaged the applicant\u2019s reputation because, contrary to her submissions, it was not believable that she possessed a reputable image among readers in the first place. In this connection, it went on to criticise some of the applicant\u2019s past views and actions, which, in its view, were proopposition or even unpatriotic. It stated that no one supported her, not even other pro-opposition journalists and politicians mentioned in the article, because none of them had sued the newspaper on account of the matter.",

It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person, as well as his or her sexual life (see Khadija Ismayilova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106). It can therefore embrace multiple aspects of the person\u2019s physical and social identity. Article 8 protects in addition the right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no.\u00a076639/11, \u00a7 95, 25 September 2018, with further references). Article\u00a08 thus guarantees a right to \u201cprivate life\u201d in the broad sense, including the right to lead a \u201cprivate social life\u201d, that is, the possibility for the individual to develop his or her social identity (see, among other authorities, Bigaeva v.\u00a0Greece, no. 26713/05, \u00a7 22, 28 May 2009). At the same time, it also includes a right to live privately, away from unwanted attention (see Smirnova v.

Austria, no. 12556/03, \u00a7 35, 15 November 2007; Med\u017elis Islamske Zajednice Br\u010dko and Others v.

Harm to reputation has been alleged before the Court in various contexts in cases involving both professional and social reputation. In particular, the Court has held that the use of offensive expressions or cartoons, even as part of criticism relating to a matter of general interest, can be harmful to a person\u2019s reputation (see Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos.\u00a028955/06 and 3 others, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 15, 67 and 72-73, ECHR 2011). An attack on a person\u2019s reputation can also be made by touching upon a person\u2019s intimate characteristics which constitute profound parts of the person\u2019s identity, such as deliberate misrepresentation of a person\u2019s gender (see Sousa Goucha v.\u00a0Portugal, no. 70434/12, \u00a7 27, 22 March 2016).",

Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, \u00a7 83, 7 February 2012). This requirement covers social reputation in general, as well as professional reputation in particular (see Denisov, cited above, \u00a7 112, with further reference to Med\u017elis Islamske Zajednice Br\u010dko and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 76 and 105-06). The requirement of attaining a certain level of seriousness has been applied not only in the narrower contexts of honour and reputation as particular aspects of private life, but also in other contexts involving the more general, broad concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d, such as publication of a photograph (see Vu\u010dina v.\u00a0Croatia (dec.), no. 58955/13, \u00a7\u00a7 29-31, 24 September 2019).",

Lithuania, no. 36919/02, \u00a7 39, 25 November 2008). In respect of the former, the pre-eminent role of the press in a democracy and its duty to act as a \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d are important considerations in favour of a narrow construction of any limitations on freedom of expression. However, different considerations apply to press reports concentrating on sensational and, at times, lurid news, intended to titillate and entertain, which are aimed at satisfying the curiosity of a particular readership regarding aspects of a person\u2019s strictly private life. Such reporting does not attract the robust protection of Article 10 afforded to the press and, in such cases, freedom of expression calls for a narrower interpretation (see Von Hannover v.\u00a0Germany, no. 59320/00, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66, ECHR 2004VI; Leempoel & S.A. ED. Cin\u00e9 Revue v. Belgium, no. 64772/01, \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 77, 9\u00a0November 2006; Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s (ICI PARIS) v.

While confirming the Article 10 right of members of the public to have access to a wide range of publications covering a variety of fields, the Court has stressed that in assessing in the context of a particular publication whether there is a public interest which justifies an interference with the right to respect for private life, the focus must be on whether the publication is in the interest of the public and not whether the public might be interested in reading it (see Mosley v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a048009/08, \u00a7 114, 10 May 2011, and Ungv\u00e1ry and Irodalom Kft v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a064520/10, \u00a7 47, 3 December 2013).",

As such, the messages conveyed on its pages were expected to have a significant degree of seriousness. The comments were meant to be critical, as confirmed by the newspaper\u2019s submissions before the domestic courts (see paragraph 19 above). The only discernible intent behind the statements made in respect of the applicant was to attack her or set her up for attack on grounds of morality. By further exploiting the previous breach of her privacy, the article in question sought, by using offensive and derogatory language, to attribute to the applicant characteristics and behaviour in a manner calculated to negatively and radically influence how she was viewed in society.",

In such circumstances, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine this matter in detail for the purposes of the present complaint. It nevertheless observes that the domestic legal system provided the applicant with the possibility of bringing a civil action for damages against the newspaper and that her action was examined by the domestic courts under the legislation and case-law mentioned above.

However, the brief reasoning provided by the courts is not compliant with the general principles mentioned above (see paragraphs 5464 above) and does not demonstrate that the courts duly examined whether the statements made about the applicant were compatible with the ethics of journalism and whether they had overstepped the permissible bounds of freedom of expression.
