The DEJA had requested the municipality of Yerevan to provide technical equipment with which to conduct the compulsory demolition works, and similar requests had also been made to private construction companies, but in vain. The applicant had even been requested to provide a labour force and machinery for the demolition works or, alternatively, to deposit with the DEJA advance payment of the whole of the demolition expenses, but he had refused to do so. Moreover, the bailiffs had several times imposed fines on E.T. All necessary and sufficient measures had thus been taken to try to ensure the execution of the final judgments. Accordingly, there had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 or Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",
