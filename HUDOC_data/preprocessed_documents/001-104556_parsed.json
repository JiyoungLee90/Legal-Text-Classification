The plaintiff stated that the defamatory statements made in the letter were similar to some prior statements that the applicant had told him. The trial court further referred to the letter itself and concluded that the events described therein related to the applicant. That the applicant was the author of the text, the court relied on Mr G.A.'s letter of 23 June 2005 in which he confirmed that the letter in question had been submitted by the applicant, a fact which was evident from his signature under the text.

In the absence of the original letter, there was no direct evidence linking it with the applicant. It is to be noted that Mr G.A.'s letter was admitted in evidence after the trial court had failed to secure the attendance of a journalist and the newspaper's chief editor, witnesses who were proposed for examination, purportedly, by the applicant. From the applicant's appeal of 18\u00a0February\u00a02006, it appears that this letter was admitted after the trial court had failed also to secure the attendance of Mr G.A. The applicant's complaints that he was denied the right to cross-examine Mr G.A., as the only witness against him, remained unanswered by the Court of Appeal.
