They had no experience of life in Nigeria and, as their parents were not \u201cwell-connected\u201d there, they would be unlikely to go back to \u201cgood circumstances\u201d. It therefore had \u201cno hesitation\u201d in saying that it was in the best interest of the children for them to remain in the United Kingdom with both their parents, who, notwithstanding their criminal activities, had managed to produce well-adjusted children. According to the Tribunal, it would be facile to pretend that the applicant had not contributed to this success. Nevertheless, it did not follow that any of the parties should be allowed to remain. The Tribunal then considered the position of D. It acknowledged that there was clear evidence that the necessary surgery which he would require in the future was not available in Nigeria. Furthermore, given that medical treatment under the National Health Service was residence-based, it would not be possible for D to go to Nigeria and return to the United Kingdom at some point in the future for the surgery. In any event, as D was a British citizen and a minor, he could not be expected to leave the United Kingdom. The Tribunal further accepted that on account of his medical condition and forthcoming surgery his need for parental support was enhanced and \u201cas a matter of informed common sense, it would be good for him to have the support of his mother at that time just as it would be good for the mother to be able to be near him\u201d. Having accepted that D could not leave the United Kingdom, the Tribunal considered that it would be undesirable to split the siblings. It therefore concluded, having regard to the Immigration Rules with reference to Article\u00a08 of the Convention, that the appeals of the applicant\u2019s partner and minor children were allowable because the effect of separating them would be \u201cunduly harsh\u201d on the children.",

It will now resemble that conducted under the rules to a greater or lesser extent. Clearly, if the new rules perfectly mirrored Strasbourg jurisprudence as interpreted by our higher courts, the second stage judicial exercise would largely cover the same canvas. The difficulty is that the new rules do not obviously constitute a perfect mirror. We do not seek in this decision to gauge the extent of the difference, but one particular difference is of great importance in the present case. This relates to their methodology. They do not set out in full the Boultif criteria (Boultif v Switzerland, 54273/00; [2001] ECHR 497) as restated by the Grand Chamber in Maslov v Austria 1683/03; [2008] ECHR 546 (see\u00a0Appendix A).

In particular, how does one take into account important decisions such as Uner v Netherlands (2007) 45 EHRR 14 and Maslov v Austria? Mr Southey QC, who represents KJ and WM, rightly submits that the Strasbourg authorities have an important role to play. Mr Tam rightly accepted that this is correct. The answer is that the Secretary of State and the tribunals and courts will have regard to the Strasbourg jurisprudence when applying the tests set out in our domestic legislation. For example, a tribunal may be considering whether it would be \u2018unduly harsh\u2019 for a child to remain in England without the deportee; or it may be considering whether certain circumstances are sufficiently \u2018compelling\u2019 to outweigh the high public interest in deportation of foreign criminals. Anyone applying these tests (as required by our own rules and legislation) should heed the guidance contained in the Strasbourg authorities. As we have stated above, the scheme of Part 5A of the 2002 Act and paras. 398-399A of the 2014 rules is to ensure compliance with the requirements of Article 8 through a structured approach, which is intended to ensure that proper weight is given to the public interest in deportation whilst also having regard to other relevant factors as identified in the Strasbourg and domestic case-law. The new regime is not intended to produce violations of Article 8.\u201d",

Where article 8 claims are made by foreign offenders facing deportation, rule 398 explains that the Secretary of State will first consider whether rule 399 or 399A applies. Those rules, applicable where offenders have received sentences of between 12 months and four years, provide guidance to officials as to categories of case where it is accepted by the Secretary of State that deportation would be disproportionate. The fact that a claim under article 8 falls outside rules 399 and 399A does not, however, mean that it is necessarily to be rejected. That is recognised by the concluding words of rule 398, which make it clear that a claim that deportation would be contrary to article 8 will not be rejected merely because rules 399 and 399A do not apply, but that \u2018it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation will be outweighed by other factors.",

Cases not covered by those rules (that is to say, foreign offenders who have received sentences of at least four years, or who have received sentences of between 12 months and four years but whose private or family life does not meet the requirements of rules\u00a0399 and 399A) will be dealt with on the basis that great weight should generally be given to the public interest in the deportation of such offenders, but that it can be outweighed, applying a proportionality test, by very compelling circumstances: in other words, by a very strong claim indeed, as Laws LJ put it in SS (Nigeria). The countervailing considerations must be very compelling in order to outweigh the general public interest in the deportation of such offenders, as assessed by Parliament and the Secretary of State. The Strasbourg jurisprudence indicates relevant factors to consider, and rules 399 and 399A provide an indication of the sorts of matters which the Secretary of State regards as very compelling. As explained at para 26 above, they can include factors bearing on the weight of the public interest in the deportation of the particular offender, such as his conduct since the offence was committed, as well as factors relating to his private or family life. Cases falling within the scope of section 32 of the 2007 Act in which the public interest in deportation is outweighed, other than those specified in the new rules themselves, are likely to be a very small minority (particularly in non-settled cases). They need not necessarily involve any circumstance which is exceptional in the sense of being extraordinary (as counsel for the Secretary of State accepted, consistently with Huang [2007] 2 AC 167, para 20), but they can be said to involve \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 in the sense that they involve a departure from the general rule.",

But, where the Secretary of State has adopted a policy based on a general assessment of proportionality, as in the present case, they should attach considerable weight to that assessment: in particular, that a custodial sentence of four years or more represents such a serious level of offending that the public interest in the offender\u2019s deportation almost always outweighs countervailing considerations of private or family life; that great weight should generally be given to the public interest in the deportation of a foreign offender who has received a custodial sentence of more than 12 months; and that, where the circumstances do not fall within rules 399 or 399A, the public interest in the deportation of such offenders can generally be outweighed only by countervailing factors which are very compelling, as explained in paras 37-38 above.",

The critical issue for the tribunal will generally be whether, giving due weight to the strength of the public interest in the deportation of the offender in the case before it, the article 8 claim is sufficiently strong to outweigh it.

Therefore, in cases of serious criminality, expulsion would be compatible with Article 8 in the absence of private and family life factors of commensurately compelling weight. Furthermore, while the Court had repeatedly emphasised that the best interests of the child are paramount, in the context of the removal of a non-national parent as a consequence of a criminal conviction it had indicated that the decision first and foremost concerns the offender and, as a consequence, the nature and seriousness of the offence committed or the offending history might outweigh the other criteria (Jeunesse v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 12738/10, 3 October 2014 para 109).",

In the Government\u2019s view, their proper application was consistent with the principles laid down by the Court and facilitated the striking of a fair balance in individual cases.

In this regard, the domestic courts had repeatedly made clear that paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules and section 117C of the 2002 Act provided scope for all relevant factors to be taken into account in the proportionality assessment whilst at the same time ensuring that when the balance came finally to be struck, the public interest was accorded its proper weight.

However, their decisions in this field must, in so far as they may interfere with a right protected under paragraph 1 of Article 8, be in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society, that is to say, justified by a pressing social need and, in particular, proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see \u00dcner, cited above, \u00a7 54; see also Boultif, cited above, \u00a7 46, and Slivenko v.

In that context, the Court has consistently treated crimes of violence and drug-related offences as being at the most serious end of the criminal spectrum (see, for example, Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 85; A.W. Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 47486/06, \u00a7 40, 12\u00a0January 2010; Dalia v. France, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 54, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 I; and Baghli v. France, no. 34374/97, \u00a7 48, ECHR 1999 VIII but see also Lukic v Germany, no, 25021/08, 20\u00a0September 2011 involving multiple convictions for fraud). In any event, the fact that the offence committed by an applicant was at the more serious end of the criminal spectrum is not in and of itself determinative of the case. Rather, it is just one factor which has to be weighed in the balance, together with the other criteria which emerge from the judgments in Boultif and \u00dcner.",

Although many of the factors relevant to applicant\u2019s partner\u2019s appeal were essentially the same as those relevant to his own, his appeal was dismissed on the sole basis there were no \u201cvery compelling circumstances\u201d over and above those which had applied in respect of his partner.",

The Upper Tribunal itself acknowledged the strength of the applicant\u2019s ties to his partner and children, all of whom would stay in the United Kingdom. It also acknowledged that his partner and children needed him, and this need for parental support was particularly acute in the case of D on account of his medical condition and forthcoming surgery. Finally, it accepted that it was in the best interests of the children for him to remain in the United Kingdom, a factor which, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, must be accorded significant weight (see Krasniqi v. Austria, no.\u00a041697/12, \u00a7 47 25 April 2017). Having regard to these careful and detailed findings by the Upper Tribunal, which must carry significant weight in the overall assessment of proportionality, the Court considers that in the circumstances of the present case the seriousness of the particular offence(s) committed by the applicant was not of a nature or degree capable of outweighing the best interests of the children so as to justify his expulsion. It therefore considers that the applicant\u2019s deportation was disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and as such was not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",
