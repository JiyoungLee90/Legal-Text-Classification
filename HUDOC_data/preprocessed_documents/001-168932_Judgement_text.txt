The case originated in an application (no. 46815/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a German national, Mr Michael Reisner (“the applicant”), on 18 August 2009. The applicant was represented by Ms J. Ertürk, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
In a judgment delivered on 21 July 2015 (“the principal judgment”), the Court held that the interference with the applicant’s right to enjoyment of his possessions could not be considered lawful, and that the applicant had been made to bear a disproportionate individual burden, in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. The Court further held that the applicant’s right of access to court, in the third set of proceedings, had been breached and that there had therefore also been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Reisner v. Turkey, no. 46815/09, §§ 45-61, 21 July 2015).
Under Article 41 of the Convention the applicant sought just satisfaction for the damage he had sustained as a result of the violation of the Convention and Protocol.
Since the question of the application of Article 41 of the Convention was not ready for decision, the Court reserved it and invited the Government and the applicant to submit, within three months, their written observations on that issue and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (ibid., § 68, and point 4 of the operative provisions).
On 14 December 2015 the panel of the Grand Chamber declined to accept the referral request of the Government. Accordingly, the principal judgment became final on that date.
The applicant and the Government each submitted observations.
