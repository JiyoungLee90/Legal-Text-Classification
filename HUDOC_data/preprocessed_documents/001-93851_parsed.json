The District Court examined the applicant\u2019s allegations of police brutality. It noted that the prosecution authorities had conducted an inquiry into the applicant\u2019s complaints about the beatings and had decided not to institute criminal proceedings because the allegations had not been proven.",

It was a mere interlocutory decision pertaining to certain procedural aspects within the criminal investigation into the impugned events of March 2003. The Court reiterates that the decisive question in assessing the effectiveness of a remedy concerning a complaint of inhuman and degrading treatment is whether the applicant could have raised that complaint before a prosecutor in order to obtain direct and timely redress, and not merely an indirect protection of the rights guaranteed in Article\u00a03 of the Convention. The remedy can be either preventive or compensatory in nature (see, among other authorities, Koval v. , no.\u00a065550/01, \u00a7\u00a094, 19 October 2006). The Court notes that the Government did not explain how a judicial appeal against an interlocutory prosecutor\u2019s decision could have offered such preventive or compensatory redress, or both, for allegations of treatment which had been contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see, for similar reasoning, Ostrovar v. Moldova (dec.), no. 35207/03, 22 March 2005). Accordingly, the Court does not consider that the Government have discharged the burden upon them of proving that a complaint against the decision of 27 July 2007 was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s Convention complaint.",

Indeed, as a general rule, the State should be given an opportunity to investigate the case and give answer to the allegations of ill-treatment.

Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v.

In response to the findings of the medical reports the Government, citing the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, merely stated that the applicant had not been subjected to treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The Court observes that the applicant provided a detailed description of the ill-treatment to which he had allegedly been subjected and indicated its place, time and duration. It notes the consistency of the allegations made by the applicant that he had been ill-treated by police officers while in custody, and the fact that he maintained his allegations whenever he was able to make statements freely before the investigating authorities or the domestic courts. If the Government considered the applicant\u2019s allegations to be untrue, it was open to them to refute them by providing their own plausible version of events and submitting, for instance, witness testimony and other evidence to corroborate their version. Indeed, the Government did not provide any explanation as to how the applicant had acquired the injuries. Furthermore, although the effectiveness of the investigation into the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment complaints will be examined below, the Court would already stress at this juncture that it is struck by the fact that, despite the seriousness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, the investigating authority did not advance any version of events, while declining to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers. It apparently did not occur to either the investigators or the trial and appeal courts that the applicant\u2019s injuries should be accounted for. The Court further notes that it was open to the respondent Government to submit a copy of the complete investigation file relating to the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment complaints. The Government, citing the destruction of the documents, failed to provide the Court with the materials, confining themselves to submitting a copy of the decision issued by the head of the Prokopyevsk Town Police Department on 7 April 2003, approving the findings of the official police inquiry into the applicant\u2019s complaints.",

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. An obligation to investigate \u201cis not an obligation of result, but of means\u201d: not every investigation should necessarily be successful or come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimant\u2019s account of events; however, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Thus, the investigation of serious allegations of illtreatment must be thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0107 et seq., and Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998VIII, \u00a7 102 et seq.). Finally, the investigation must be expeditious. In cases under Articles 2 and\u00a03 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation has been at issue, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a0133 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV). Consideration was given to the starting of investigations, delays in taking statements (see Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no.\u00a023531/94, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2000-VI, and Tekin v. Turkey, 9\u00a0June 1998, \u00a7 67, Reports 1998-IV) and to the length of time taken for the initial investigation (see Indelicato v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a031143/96, \u00a7 37, 18 October 2001).",

The prosecutor\u2019s role was critical not only to the pursuit of criminal proceedings against the perpetrators of the offence but also to the pursuit by the applicant of other remedies to redress the harm he had suffered (see paragraph 30 above). The Court notes that the prosecution authorities, who were made aware of the applicant\u2019s alleged beating, initiated an investigation which has not yet resulted in criminal proceedings against the perpetrators of the beating. The investigation was closed and re-opened and is currently pending. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the issue is consequently not so much whether there has been an investigation, since the parties do not dispute its existence, as whether it has been conducted diligently, whether the authorities have been determined to identify and prosecute those responsible and, accordingly, whether the investigation has been \u201ceffective\u201d.",

In the present case the applicant brought his allegations of ill-treatment to the attention of the authorities by filing a complaint with the Prokopyevsk Town Prosecutor (see paragraph 10 above). The Prokopyevsk Town Prosecutor\u2019s office did not launch an investigation after being notified of the alleged beatings. Instead it remitted the applicant\u2019s complaint to the Prokopyevsk Town Police Department, a State authority whose employees were implicated in the events which were to be looked into, with an order to conduct an official police inquiry. The Court is mindful of the fact that in the present case the initial investigative steps, which usually prove to be crucial for the establishment of the truth in cases of police brutality, were conducted by the police force itself (see paragraph 12 above). Furthermore, the Court considers it particularly striking that despite the fact that the police inquiry resulted in the finding that certain investigative steps on the part of the prosecution authorities were needed \u201cto establish the truth\u201d, no such steps were taken. On 18 April 2003 the assistant prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers, entirely basing his decision on statements they had made during the official police inquiry (see paragraph 14 above). In addition, in the period immediately following the events in question no attempts were made to conduct a forensic medical examination of the applicant. The Court reiterates in this connection that proper medical examinations are an essential safeguard against ill-treatment. The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and have a mandate which is broad in scope (see Akko\u00e7 v. , nos.\u00a022947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7\u00a055 and \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000X). The Court notes with concern that the lack of a forensic medical examination was invoked by the assistant prosecutor as a ground for a refusal to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints (see paragraph 17 above).",

It is apparent from the decisions submitted to the Court that the investigators based their conclusions mainly on the testimonies given by the police officers involved in the incident. Although excerpts from the testimonies of the applicant and his female friend, Ms S., were included in the decisions on the refusals to institute criminal proceedings, the investigators did not consider those testimonies to be credible, apparently because they reflected personal opinions and constituted an accusatory tactic by the applicant and Ms S. However, the investigators did accept the police officers\u2019 testimonies as credible, despite the fact that their statements could have constituted defence tactics and have been aimed at damaging the applicant\u2019s credibility. In the Court\u2019s view, the prosecution inquiry applied different standards when assessing the testimonies, as those given by the applicant and Ms S. were deemed to be subjective but not those given by the police officers. The credibility of the latter testimonies should also have been questioned, as the prosecution investigation was supposed to establish whether the officers were liable on the basis of disciplinary or criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v. , no.\u00a046317/99, \u00a7\u00a099, 23\u00a0February 2006).",

The excerpts from their testimonies were included in the decision of 18 May 2007. Those individuals did not witness the beatings, did not remember the applicant and merely attested that they had not heard any complaints of police brutality (see paragraph 24 above). The Court firstly finds it inexplicable that it was not until January 2007, almost four years after the events under consideration, that the investigators attempted for the first time to collect statements from possible eyewitnesses. In this connection, the Court notes that while the investigating authorities may not have been provided with the names of individuals who could have seen the applicant at the police station or might have witnessed his alleged beatings, they were expected to take steps of their own initiative to identify possible eyewitnesses. The Court also observes that, due to the protraction of the investigation, the individuals in question could no longer recall the details of their detention at the Rudnichniy police station or provide the authorities with any valuable information.",

The Court recognises that the investigation is still pending but, considering its length so far and the very serious shortcomings identified above, the Court does not consider that the applicant should have waited for completion of the investigation before bringing his complaint to the Court (see Angelova and Iliev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0103, and Mikheyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0121). Furthermore the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant lodged his application before the Court on 2 March 2004, that is after the authorities had closed the investigation into his ill-treatment complaints. The Court is mindful of the fact that the investigation was re-opened only in January 2007. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Government\u2019s objection as to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, in so far as it concerns the applicant\u2019s failure to await the outcome of the domestic criminal proceedings.",

In particular, the Court cannot overlook the fact that by the time the criminal proceedings against the police officers were finally instituted in January 2007, the case file pertaining to the initial inquiry into the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment complaints had already been destroyed, medical evidence was no longer available, and witnesses either could not be identified or did not remember the events in March 2003. In such a situation, the Court finds it implausible that the perpetrators of the offence against the applicant would ever be brought to justice and convicted. The prosecutor\u2019s decision of 6\u00a0August 2007, authorising a stay in the criminal proceedings on the ground that it was impossible \u201cto identify persons who could be charged\u201d, supports the Court\u2019s finding to that effect (see paragraph 29 above).",

In other words, the Court considers that in the circumstances of the present case a civil action which, according to the Government, is available to the applicant, would not offer sufficient prospects of success and can be regarded as theoretical and illusory rather than practical and effective. The Court therefore dismisses the second limb of the Government\u2019s objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention under its procedural limb.",
