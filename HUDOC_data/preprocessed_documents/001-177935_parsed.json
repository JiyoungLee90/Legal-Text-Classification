Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and depression and had been admitted to the Idrija Psychiatric Hospital on several occasions. In 2007 he lodged an extensive criminal complaint, alleging that he had suffered various injustices at the hands of his work colleagues, acquaintances, the police and other organisations. Upon examining the complaint, the Nova Gorica State Prosecutor\u2019s Office decided not to pursue it. In June 2008 Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d started to telephone the Prosecutor\u2019s Office and go there in person on an almost daily basis.

They relied on the forensic report, claiming that his vomiting had been caused by him being struck or pushed in the abdomen in the course of the intervention, when the police had tried to restrain him in order to take him to the psychiatric hospital. As he had resisted actively and strongly, it had not been possible to lift him up into a vertical position or to turn him onto his side in order to mechanically clean his respiratory tract. The inhalation of the gastric contents had been very quick and intense, and moreover, it had only been possible to provide him medical assistance once he had calmed down \u2013 which had only occurred once his breathing had been disrupted due to the aspiration of the gastric contents.

This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention.

Furthermore, the responsibility of the State under Article 2 is not confined to cases in which there exists significant evidence that the use of force by State agents has, or could have, directly caused a person\u2019s death. It may also be engaged where those agents, when conducting an operation, fail to take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods with a view to avoiding or at least minimising incidental loss of life (see, for example, Ergi v.\u00a0Turkey, 28 July 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 77\u201179, Reports 1998-IV, and Saoud v.

Where the authorities decide to place and maintain in detention a person with disabilities, they should demonstrate special care in guaranteeing such conditions as correspond to his special needs resulting from his disability (see Jasinskis v. Latvia, no.\u00a045744/08, \u00a7\u00a059, 21\u00a0December 2010). The State is therefore under a positive obligation to take all reasonable measures to ensure that the health and well-being of persons in detention, police custody or under arrest, who thus find themselves dependent on the State authorities, are adequately secured. This includes promptly providing them with the medical assistance required by their condition in order to prevent a fatal outcome (see Saoud, cited above, \u00a7\u00a098 and the references cited therein). Moreover, the authorities are under an obligation to account for the treatment of people in custody, who are in a vulnerable position. Consequently, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but later dies, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of the events leading to his death (see, among many authorities, Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2002IV).",

In this connection, the Court points out that Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d could be deemed to be vulnerable because of his particular medical needs in view of his mental illness (see Ilievska v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a020136/11, \u00a7 61, 7 May 2015). This in itself called for special protection (see Renolde v. France, no. 5608/05, \u00a7 93, ECHR 2008). Moreover, his vulnerability was compounded by a defenceless situation in which he found himself during the intervention. Considering that the domestic authorities were aware of Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d\u2019s condition, they were required to demonstrate special care in the choice of methods used to manage his behaviour and to take him to the psychiatric hospital (see, mutatis mutandis, Scavuzzo-Hager and Others v.

It is true that the Court has repeatedly held that errors of judgment on the part of a health professional or negligent co-ordination among health professionals in the treatment of a particular patient are not sufficient of themselves to call a Contracting State to account from the standpoint of its positive obligations, under Article 2 of the Convention, to protect life (see Byrzykowski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 11562/05, \u00a7\u00a0104, 27 June 2004, and the references cited therein). It is also true that, according to the statements of the police officers and medical staff, the whole incident from the police struggle with Mr\u00a0\u0160tefan\u010di\u010d to his vomiting and the loss of consciousness and interruption of breathing lasted only a few minutes.",

The domestic preliminary inquiry was thus not capable of determining to a sufficient extent whether any of the persons involved in the incident might be held responsible for Mr \u0160tefan\u010di\u010d\u2019s death. Yet no judicial investigation was conducted in the course of which additional explanations might be requested from the intervention team and the forensic pathologist in order to clarify the questions identified above. The Court therefore finds that the conclusions made by the investigating authorities were inadequate, leaving open a number of questions which should have been examined in order to ensure that the investigation was effective.",
