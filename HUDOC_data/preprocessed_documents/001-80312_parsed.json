In the same decision, the Deputy Minister declared the applicant an undesirable alien, entailing a five year exclusion order, on account of her criminal record in the .

Nevertheless, in a case which concerns family life as well as immigration, the extent of a State's obligations to admit to its territory relatives of persons residing there will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest. Factors to be taken into account in this context are the extent to which family life is effectively ruptured, the extent of the ties in the Contracting State, whether there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family living in the country of origin of one or more of them and whether there are factors of immigration control (for example, a history of breaches of immigration law) or considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion. Another important consideration will also be whether family life was created at a time when the persons involved were aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence of that family life within the host State would be precarious from the outset. The Court has previously held that where this is the case it is likely only to be in the most exceptional circumstances that the removal of the non-national family member will constitute a violation of Article 8 (see Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v.\u00a0the Netherlands, no. 50435/99, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2006..., with further references).",

This is not altered by the fact that the applicant's second request for a residence permit for stay with Mr G. filed on 1\u00a0November 1991 was left undetermined for a period of more than seven years because her file had been mislaid by the responsible immigration authorities, as \u2013 like in 1990 in respect of her first request for a residence permit for stay with Mr G. \u2013 one of the main reasons why this second request was rejected on 27 November 1998 by the Deputy Minister was because Mr G. failed to meet the minimum income requirement.",

As to the question whether such a requirement was reasonable in the instant case, the Court considers that it has not been demonstrated that, between 1990 and 1998, Mr G. has in fact ever complied with the minimum income requirement or at least made any efforts to comply with this requirement whereas the applicant's claim that he is incapacitated for work has remained wholly unsubstantiated.",

On this point the Court reiterates that, where the admission of aliens is concerned, Contracting States are in principle entitled to expel an alien convicted of criminal offences (see \u00dcner v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2006...).",

France, no. 47160/99, \u00a7 34, 13 February 2001). The Court considers the fact that the applicant's son is suffering from asthma does not constitute such a further element of dependency. The Court further notes that the applicant was born in Serbia where she lived until the age of seven, that she held a valid passport issued in Pan\u010devo (Serbia) by the authorities of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia when she filed her second request for a Netherlands residence permit in 1991, and that her claim of having become stateless after the dissolution of this Federal Republic is no more than conjecture. The same applies to her claim that Mr G. is stateless and might be denied admission to her country of origin. In any event, the decision to declare the applicant an undesirable alien does not entail a permanent exclusion order, but an exclusion order of a temporary validity in the sense that \u2013 at the applicant's request \u2013 it can be lifted after a limited number of years of residency outside of the Netherlands.",
