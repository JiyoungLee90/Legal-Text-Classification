If after twenty-four hours the test subject had a small red mark, he or she was deemed too sensitive and did not participate any further in the tests.

That GF test had been preceded and succeeded by a full medical examination which revealed no abnormality. The letter also referred (inaccurately, as it later emerged \u2013 see paragraph 36 below) to seven blood tests conducted after the GF test and to their results and confirmed that \u201cpeak flow meter measurements\u201d had also been taken from the applicant and that \u201cbreath-holding tests\u201d, a clothing penetration study (apparently, although not expressly noted, the mustard gas tests) and a battery of personality tests were performed. The results of these tests were not included in the letter and no other records supporting the statements made in the letter were enclosed. His doctor's stamp on it indicates that he decided to tell the applicant that all was normal. The applicant persuaded his doctor to show him the letter in 1994.",

On the information before me I am still of that opinion. Subsection (1) of that section, which deals with injuries caused by acts of members of the Armed Forces, can have no application since the administration of the GB gas to ... Maddison was (so I understand) carried out by [civilian] personnel and not by any member of the Armed Forces. Subsection (2) also seems inapplicable. [It] provides that no proceedings in tort are to lie against the Crown for death or personal injury due to anything suffered by a member of the Armed Forces if that thing is suffered by him 'in consequence of the nature or condition of any equipment or supplies used for the purposes of the Armed Forces of the Crown'. As I understand the facts of this case, GB gas cannot be said to be a 'supply used for the purposes of the Armed Forces' at all, it being purely an experimental substance and one which has never been used for the purposes of the Armed Forces. If this is correct, then section 10 of the 1947 Act cannot protect the Crown or the Minister from liability.\u201d",

In addition, from 1919 a serviceman injured in the course of war service was entitled to a disability pension and his spouse to a pension. The scope of these entitlements later widened to include disability or death caused by injury attributable to any service in the armed forces (war service or not).

The House of Lords considered the maintenance of the distinction between procedural and substantive limitations on access to a court to be a necessary one since Article 6 was concerned with procedural fairness and the integrity of a State's judicial system rather than with the substantive content of its national law. However, the House of Lords acknowledged the difficulty in tracing the borderline between the substantive and procedural, considering the Convention jurisprudence to be indicative of some difficulty in this respect. Drawing on the text, historical context, legislative intent and the actual operation of section 10 of the 1947 Act and, further, on a comprehensive analysis of the Convention jurisprudence and applicable principles, the House of Lords concluded that section 10 of the 1947 Act maintained the existing lack of liability in tort of the Crown to service personnel for injury suffered that was attributable to service and served to ease servicemen towards the no-fault pension option by taking away the need to prove attributability. It amounted therefore to a substantive limitation on the liability of the Crown in tort to servicemen for service injury to which Article 6 \u00a7 1 did not apply.",

But European human rights law is concerned, not with superficial appearances or verbal formulae, but with the realities of the situation (Van Droogenbroeck v.  ...). [Mr Matthews'] argument does, with respect, ignore the realities of the situation. It is common ground that the Secretary of State does in practice issue a certificate whenever it is (in legal and practical terms) appropriate to do so. He does not have a wide discretion comparable to that of a foreign government in deciding whether or not to waive State immunity (which may be by no means a foregone conclusion, especially in politically sensitive employment cases). The decision whether or not to waive immunity in Fogarty really was a decision about a procedural bar, but I am quite unpersuaded that it provides a parallel with this case. The fact is that section 10 of the 1947 Act did in very many cases before 1987, and still does in cases of latent injury sustained before 1987, substitute a no-fault system of compensation for a claim for damages. This was and is a matter of substantive law and the provision for an official certificate (in order to avoid or at least minimise the risk of inconsistent decisions on causation) does not alter that. Section 10(1)(b), taken on its own, is a provision for the protection of persons with claims against the [MOD]. I respectfully agree with Lord Bingham's analysis of the legislative history of the 1947 Act and with the conclusions which he draws from it.",

He noted that Mr Matthews' counsel (also counsel for the present applicant) had conceded that, if the 1947 Act simply said that servicemen had no right of action, it would not have infringed Article 6. Mr Matthews argued, however, that the structure of the 1947 Act was such that he had a civil right (a cause of action in tort) until a section 10 certificate was issued; if no certificate had been issued he would have been able to prosecute his action before the courts; and section\u00a010 therefore gave the Secretary of State a power at his discretion to cut off the applicant's action and prevent him from bringing it before the courts. Lord Hoffmann pointed out that, if the purpose of section 10(1)(b) and (2)(b) had been to give the Secretary of State a discretionary power \u201cto swoop down and prevent people with claims against the Crown from bringing them before the courts\u201d, he would have agreed since such executive interference would run counter to the rule of law and the principle of the separation of powers. However, referring to the historical analysis of Lord Bingham, he considered it clear that section 10 delimited the substantive cause of action and the section 10 certificate was no more than a binding acknowledgment by the Secretary of State of the \u201cattributable to service\u201d requirement for an award of a pension, the quid pro quo for the inability to sue in tort. He too considered distinguishable Tinnelly & Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others (Matthews did not involve any encroachment by the executive upon the functions of the judicial branch) and Fogarty (having regard to the discretion available to the foreign government to submit or not to jurisdiction).",

Section 10 is an integral part of the overall scheme of liability which is described in Part I of the Act. This was all new law.

The Secretary of State is told that he cannot have it both ways. He is not allowed to assert the immunity without making a statement in the form of a certificate in the terms which the condition lays down. This has the effect of preventing him, as the minister responsible for the administration of the war pension scheme, from contesting the issue whether the suffering of the thing was attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to an award under that scheme. This is a matter of substantive law. It is an essential part of the overall scheme for the reform of the law which the 1947 Act laid down.

This ensured that a State could not legislate to divest itself of its Article 6 responsibilities and implied that a \u201ccivil right\u201d could have a meaning or content different to domestic law. However, the House of Lords in Matthews analysed the existence of a \u201ccivil right\u201d solely by reference to domestic law. It was true that there was an unresolved tension between, on the one hand, the principle that the expression \u201ccivil rights\u201d had an autonomous meaning and, on the other, the principle that Article 6 applied only to disputes about civil rights which could be said at least on arguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law. The answer was to view domestic law as regulating whether a right had \u201csome legal basis\u201d in domestic law but not as determining whether there was, in fact, a civil right. Accordingly, the fact that the applicant had, until the issuance of the section 10 certificate, a civil cause of action recognised by domestic law was sufficient to conclude that he had a \u201ccivil right\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention.",

In addition, the Government considered it vital to bear in mind the rationale underlying Article 6: the protection of the rule of law and the proper separation of powers from any threat (see Golder, cited above, and Lord Hoffmann in Matthews). A provision entitling the executive to exercise arbitrary discretion to prevent otherwise valid claims from being decided by the courts would threaten the rule of law, whereas section 10 brought with it no such threat as it simply defined the circumstances in which a no-fault pension scheme would replace a claim in tort for damages. Moreover, it was essential to analyse accurately an individual's substantive rights in domestic law taking into account the history and legislative context of the provision and its purpose (as did Lord Bingham). The purpose of the provision could then be measured against the underlying rationale of Article 6 of the Convention.",

The uncontroversial starting-point was that, prior to the 1947 Act, there was no common-law right to claim damages in tort from the Crown: section 10 could not therefore have removed or taken away any pre-existing right. The 1947 Act created such a right in section 2 but did so expressly subject to section 10 which preserved the preclusion from claiming damages in cases concerning servicemen. In short, the parliamentary intention behind the 1947 Act was to maintain the pre-existing preclusion in so far as servicemen were concerned. Both sections 2 and 10 were contained in Part I of the Act entitled \u201cSubstantive Law\u201d, a title which accurately reflected the nature of Part I which was a composite of provisions laying down the basic rules for the Crown's liability in tort. Both the prior common law and the 1947 Act were rules of general application marking the limits of tortious liability in domestic law: they were expressed in the language of rules of substantive law and the circumstances in which there was no right to claim (the section\u00a010 exception to the section 2 right to claim) were of general application and clearly set out in the statute.",

The purpose of the certification provisions was not to confer a broad discretion to take away an existing cause of action but rather to ease the path of servicemen towards an alternative pension by taking away the need to prove a causal link between the injury and service. If a certificate was not issued, a cause of action continued but under section 2 of the 1947 Act.

In submitting this correspondence to this Court, the Government pointed out that neither they nor the Secretary of State in 1995 (in issuing the section 10 certificate) were aware of these Treasury Solicitor letters until the above-noted letter of 7 February 2005. A policy decision had been taken by the MOD not to \u201ctake a section 10(1) point\u201d as regards certain civil claims mounted by some Porton Down volunteers because at least some of the tests (including those conducted on Mr\u00a0Maddison to which the Treasury Solicitor's letters related) had been conducted by or under the direction and control of civilian personnel and not solely by members of the armed forces. While it was not clear precisely which type of personnel were involved in tests on the applicant, \u201cthere appear to have been some armed forces personnel and some civilians involved\u201d in the applicant's tests. The MOD stated that it would be prepared to treat the applicant as falling within the above-noted policy decision. The applicant could now sue for damages in tort given this decision of the MOD. He retained, in addition, the separate right to continue with his claim for a pension in the PAT since the section 10 certificate remained valid for the purpose of those proceedings. When the section 10 certificate was issued in 1995, the Minister believed section 10 to be applicable and, until the Treasury Solicitor's letters of advice were recently produced, that was the belief of the Government Agent. They concluded that it was \u201cat least arguable\u201d that, if the applicant had commenced a civil negligence action following his section 10 certificate (of August 1995), the action would have been barred. According to the Government, therefore, the Article 6 issues he raised before the Court remained live.",

In both these respects, the Court would reiterate the fundamental principle that Article 6 does not itself guarantee any particular content of substantive law of the Contracting Parties (see, amongst other authorities, Z and Others, cited above, \u00a7 87).",

Where, moreover, the superior national courts have analysed in a comprehensive and convincing manner the precise nature of the impugned restriction, on the basis of the relevant Convention case-law and principles drawn therefrom, this Court would need strong reasons to differ from the conclusion reached by those courts by substituting its own views for those of the national courts on a question of interpretation of domestic law (see Z and Others, cited above, \u00a7 101) and by finding, contrary to their view, that there was arguably a right recognised by domestic law.",

The Lords made it clear that prior to 1947 no right of action in tort lay against the Crown on the part of anyone. The doctrine that \u201cthe King could do no wrong\u201d meant that the Crown was under no liability in tort at common law. Section 2 of the 1947\u00a0Act granted a right of action in tort for the first time against the Crown but the section was made expressly subject to the provisions of section 10 of the Act. Section 10 (which fell within the same part of the 1947 Act as section 2 entitled \u201cSubstantive law\u201d \u2013 see Lord Hope in Matthews, paragraph 94 above) provided that no act or omission of a member of the armed forces of the Crown while on duty should subject either that person or the Crown to liability in tort for causing personal injury to another member of the armed forces while on duty. Section 10 did not therefore remove a class of claim from the domestic courts' jurisdiction or confer an immunity from liability which had been previously recognised: such a class of claim had never existed and was not created by the 1947 Act. Section 10 was found therefore to be a provision of substantive law which delimited the rights of servicemen as regards damages claims against the Crown and which provided instead as a matter of substantive law a no-fault pension scheme for injuries sustained in the course of service.",

The Court is unable to accept this argument. It finds that section 10 must be interpreted in its context and with the legislative intent and purpose in mind. As explained in detail in the judgments of Lord Bingham and Lord Hope in Matthews, the object of the certification procedure introduced by section 10(1)(b) was not to alter the essential thrust of section 10 as originally drafted \u2013 namely, to exclude the Crown's liability altogether \u2013 but was rather to facilitate the grant of a pension to injured service personnel by obviating the need to prove that the injury was attributable to service.",

Section 42 of the 1976 Act was not aimed at creating an exception for cases in which Parliament (when adopting the 1976 Act) considered discrimination justified but rather allowed the Secretary of State by a conclusive certificate, based on an assertion that the impugned act was done to protect national security, to stop court proceedings that would otherwise have been justified. As observed by Lord Hoffmann, section 10 did not involve such encroachment by the executive into the judicial realm but rather concerned a decision by Parliament in 1947 that, in a case where injuries were sustained by service personnel which were attributable to service, no right of action would be created but rather a no-fault pension scheme was to be put in place, the certificate of the Secretary of State serving only to confirm that the injuries were attributable to service and thereby to facilitate access to that scheme.",

This was a free-standing obligation (unattached to any judicial or other process) to provide an \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201caccessible\u201d means for an individual to \u201cseek all relevant and appropriate information\u201d. His particular need for information, and for the means of obtaining it, first arose in 1987 when he initially began to seek his records, well before and separate from any PAT appeal. In any event, attaching the positive obligation to the PAT process was absurd as it would effectively require someone (whether or not he or she was entitled to, or was interested in, a pension): to engage in a litigious process and, in particular, to apply for a pension and/or threaten litigation under section 2 of the 1947 Act; to hope that any pension application would be unsuccessful at first instance so that he/she could appeal to the PAT; and, before the PAT, to discharge a burden of proof and demonstrate the relevance of the documents to the litigation issues before he/she could obtain an order for disclosure under Rule 6 of the PAT Rules. Rule 6 is designed for the contentious litigation process and not to assuage fear by providing information: the applicants in McGinley and Egan had not relied on the general right to information and their case was therefore distinguishable on the facts.",

In addition, the applicant considered the Rule 6 procedure to lack effective control: there were no time-limits on disclosure and disclosure was allowed on a piecemeal basis. There were also significant delays in the procedure. The applicant accepted that some delay was attributable to him and he explained the reasons for his delay in responding to the PAT's letter of 25 July 2001 and for applying to adjourn the October 2002 hearing. However, he argued that those delays did not, in any event, lead to the overall delay in the procedure: the MOD continued to make disclosure thereafter and the hearing adjournment was attributable also to the VA which was not ready, to the reasonable confusion as to the scope of the appeal and to the need to put further questions to Dr H. The uncontrolled certification by the MOD of records as undisclosable \u201cdepartmental minutes or records\u201d also undermined the ability of the Rule 6 procedure to fulfil the positive obligation under Article 8, as did the power to withhold documents on \u201cnational security\u201d grounds. The whole Rule 6 procedure was, in the applicant's view, marked by errors, contradictory statements and admissions that certain documents could no longer be found with the consequence that the information at the end of the disclosure process was incomplete.

While withholding information on \u201cmedical in confidence\u201d grounds could serve a legitimate aim (the interests of health professionals compiling medical records and, consequently, the interests of patients), the applicant was not convinced of this in the present case since the only persons who stood to gain by the Porton Down scientists expressing themselves freely were the scientists themselves. In any event, the \u201cmedical in confidence\u201d approach was abandoned generally (in 1991 with the entry into force of the Access to Health Records Act 1990) and specifically as regards Porton Down participants (with the introduction of the 1998 Scheme). This defence to full disclosure was clearly not proportionate having regard to the enormous importance of the information for the applicant; the paucity of the information disclosed and the piecemeal manner in which that had been done; the need for actual and original records to make a proper risk assessment; the anxiety and stress caused by the absence of such a risk assessment; the facts that the tests were in secret, that the participants were forbidden to speak of them and that there were no safeguards against abuse put in place; the toxic and hazardous material to which the participants were exposed; and the lack of an adequate follow-up study which might have generated conclusions to clarify the issue for test participants one way or the other.",

Indeed, the clear evidence is that it did. From the onset of his medical problems in 1987, he single-mindedly pursued through various means (detailed in paragraphs 17-33 above) any relevant information that could inform him about his test participation and assuage his anxiety as to the consequences. While the PAT found, relying on its expert's report, that there was no reliable evidence to suggest a causal link between the tests and the applicant's claimed medical conditions, that was not until 2004 and, in any event, the High Court has since allowed his appeal and sent the matter back to the PAT, before which the matter is pending.

Even taking into account only the period following the making of the Rule 6 order by the President in February 2001, the disclosure has been piecemeal (over five occasions listed in paragraph 161 above, the most recent being in April\u00a02005), the State reviewed its position on the classification of certain material on several occasions during that period (see paragraphs 53, 55, 57, 59 and 68 above) and, over four years after the Rule 6 order, disclosure remains incomplete (see the letter of 18 April 2005, paragraph 68 above). Indeed, the PAT described as \u201cdisquieting\u201d the difficulties experienced by the applicant in obtaining the records produced to the PAT. In the same vein, it is also illustrative that none of the authorities dealing with the Rule 6 procedure or the present application was aware until recently of the Treasury Solicitor's letters from 1953 (see paragraph 72 above). These demonstrated difficulties in making comprehensive and structured disclosure to date undermines, in the Court's view, any suggestion that an individual going to Porton Down to review records retained there (the 1998 Scheme) could lead to the provision of all relevant and appropriate information to that person. It is undoubtedly the case that certain records (existing after 1996) were, given their age and nature, somewhat dispersed so that the location of all relevant records was, and could still be, difficult. However, it is equally the case that the absence of any obligation to disclose and inform facilitates this dispersal of records and undermines an individual's right to obtain the relevant and appropriate disclosure.",

However, section 2 was subject to section 10, which provided for different treatment for the armed forces. If members of the armed forces were injured in the course of their duties, the Crown could not be sued in tort if the Secretary of State certified that the death or injury could be treated as attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to a war pension, the idea being to substitute a no-fault pension system for an action in tort. While the placement of sections 2 and 10 in Part\u00a0I of the 1947 Act, entitled \u201cSubstantive law\u201d, is relevant, it is also pertinent to observe that a cause of action in tort against the Crown could be pursued by a serviceman against the Crown if the Secretary of State did not issue a section 10 certificate.

More specifically, I believe that the tort of negligence for which the applicant seeks judicial redress has a well-established legal basis in the domestic law of the respondent State. Until 1947 it was not actionable against the State. One could argue that until then the State did not have any legal liability because according to the British legal system prevailing at the time, \u201cthe King could do no wrong\u201d. I do not find this traditional legal fiction sufficiently convincing to have neutralised in terms of the Convention the civil wrong of negligence as far as claims against the State were concerned. It did, however, prevent any action against the State. It should be recalled that whether there is a civil right in any country is not decided exclusively by reference to the domestic law. The courts may examine whether there is a sufficient legal basis for a civil right in the State in question regardless of the domestic conditions or limitations.",

The substantive provisions of this Act do not exclude cases such as that of the applicant from the scope of the State's tortious liability. And here I must say that I agree with the statement in the judgment of the High Court that if the 1947 Act was intended to exclude members of the armed forces from the reforms introduced by sections 1 and 2, then one would have expected a clear provision to the effect that these reforms were not to apply to claims by such persons. In such cases the question whether any particular claim fell within this category or not would have had to have been decided by the courts on the basis of the relevant facts (see Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172) concerning the substantive limitation under section 76(1) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982).",

The question then arises whether this provision is part of the definition of the relevant civil right, or whether it simply regulates an already existing civil liability through procedural restrictions.

In this connection, I believe that it is also pertinent to point out that certification by the Secretary of State also amounts to intervention by the executive, in fact a member of the government, in the determination of the question whether an individual is qualified to bring an action in the courts for negligence. Given the political status of the Secretary of State, his intervention points to a procedural rather than a substantive limitation on the right to bring an action. This is because holders of political posts are responsible for the formulation of policies and their application and this involves the exercise of substantial discretion. And, as was rightly pointed out by the High Court, the fact that the certificate was generally issued as a matter of policy in every case in which the Secretary of State was satisfied that there was a connection between the serviceman's injuries and his service in the armed forces did not mean that the Secretary of State could not depart from this policy if he wished to. Such a change of policy is illustrated by what was discovered, after the hearing in this case before our Court, in connection with a case similar to that of the applicant (see paragraph 72 of the judgment; reference is made to this point below).",

If he is not satisfied that the relevant situation requires such a certificate or, to use the words of the House of Lords, if he finds that it is not appropriate to issue the certificate, people in the applicant's position can sue for the civil wrong of negligence, which already exists. The Secretary of State may not have wide discretion compared to that of a foreign government in deciding whether or not to waive State immunity, but he certainly does have the possibility or the power to decide each case in one way or another. If he issues the certificate there can be no judicial action. If he does not, people in the applicant's position can bring an action on a legal basis that already exists. Indeed, it is important to stress that in such cases the existing legal basis is the general right to sue the State in tort under section 2 of the Act. No new legal basis is provided for in the absence of the relevant certification and therefore no new legal basis is required. This supports the conclusion that the restrictions regarding members of the armed forces do not fall within the definition or delimitation of the general liability of the Crown in tort as introduced by the substantive provisions of the 1947 Act. Furthermore, taking into account the wording of the Act, the distinction made by the High Court between the existence of a right and a remedy is, I believe, correct. The legal basis of the right is there. The remedy is conditional.",

As a consequence of that, the Secretary of State has decided that he will no longer \u201ctake a section 10(1) point\u201d in any civil action brought by the applicant. So it appears that in the present case there were two contradictory approaches regarding the exclusion of Crown liability by virtue of section 10 of the 1947 Act. This is an additional strong argument in support of the position that section 10 certificates were not granted as a matter of course. The Secretary of State may exercise his or her discretion in one way or another through an assessment of the situation on the basis of the same facts. This is strongly indicative of a procedural limitation on the right of access to a court in respect of the claim. It certainly seems to undermine the view expressed by the House of Lords and the Government that the exercise of discretion in issuing section 10 certificates is not substantial. On the contrary, it appears from these new facts that the Secretary of State in issuing a certificate is making an assessment or appraisal of the situation that goes beyond the mere finding of fact or the verification of the fulfilment of certain legal conditions. It has been demonstrated that the same situation may be assessed in two different, contradictory ways. The political status of the Secretary of State and the nature of the conditions that he has to consider when deciding whether or not to issue a certificate (\u201c... if [the] suffering ... has been or will be treated as attributable to service ...\u201d) do play a role in such an assessment.",

Nevertheless, in most cases they remain unasserted either because they are not violated in the first place or because the aggrieved person omits to pursue them procedurally. Moreover, a right without a remedy is a simple recommendation (\u201cnatural obligation\u201d). It follows that a right is doubly dependent on its concomitant remedy. If the remedy does not exist a right is not a right; if the remedy is not procedurally pursued the right will not be vindicated. The right and its remedy are not only interdependent.
