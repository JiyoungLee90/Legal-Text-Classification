However, their claims in this respect appear to be excessive. Having regard to the principles developed in its case-law on determination of compensation in similar cases (see, for instance, Kovalenko and Others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a042-43, cited above, Goncharova and Others and 68\u00a0other \u201cPrivileged Pensioners\u201d cases v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a023113/08 and 68\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02224, 15\u00a0October 2009), the Court considers it reasonable and equitable to award a total of EUR\u00a05,000 each to Mrs\u00a0Anisimova and Mr Filipenko to cover all heads of damage.",
