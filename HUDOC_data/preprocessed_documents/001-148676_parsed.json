First, legal advice can be withheld for good cause during the early stages of interviews, so long as the conditions in which the interviews occur are not significantly coercive (Magee v. the United Kingdom, no. 28135/95, ECHR 2000 VI) and so long as access is not delayed for an excessive period (John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I). Moreover, interviewing a suspect having withheld legal advice and following a newstyle caution is not decisive in the assessment of whether there has been a breach of Article 6 (Averill v. the United Kingdom, no. 36408/97, ECHR 2000VI). Rather, the court must look at the circumstances overall and the use to which evidence is put (and including whether adverse inferences are drawn). Accordingly, so long as the overall circumstances have not caused irretrievable prejudice to the rights of the defendant, much will depend on the directions a jury receives as to how they should approach the silence or the statement of a suspect in these circumstances. As the Court made clear in Averill, considerable caution is required when attaching weight to the fact that a person arrested in connection with a serious criminal offence and having been denied access to a lawyer during the early stages of his interrogation responds in a particular way \u2013 or as in that case, does not respond \u2013 to the questions put to him. The need for caution is not removed simply because an accused is eventually allowed to see his solicitor and then refuses to answer questions. A jury must be given a strong and careful warning that they must take into account all of the relevant circumstances; they must have discounted all reasonable (\u2018innocent\u2019) explanations for the accused\u2019s silence or statements before they consider using this material against him; and the jury must be told to be careful not to accord disproportionate weight to this evidence.\u201d",

Both prosecution and defence experts agreed that the bombs were not viable. The prosecution\u2019s expert explained that this was because the hydrogen peroxide had not reached the necessary concentration required for explosion. He noted that it would have been difficult for those constructing the bombs to have measured the strength of the hydrogen peroxide but pointed out that, if the purpose had only been an hoax, no increase in hydrogen peroxide concentration would have been necessary: at the initial low concentration or with a banger inserted into the mix, the same impression of noise would have been produced. In response to the defence claim that the hydrogen peroxide had been concentrated and then diluted again with tap water (see paragraph 77 below), analysis of the isotope composition of London tap water showed that this was not possible.",

It is not alleged by anyone that legal advice was denied by the officers as a result of bad faith or dishonesty.

For instance, a solicitor may have advised the defendant in question to remain silent or they may have reminded the defendant that he should tell the truth and that there may be consequences if he lied. Therefore, when considering whether to hold any lie told by those three defendants during a safety interview against them, remember that this safeguard with these safety interviews was withheld.\u201d",

If you are not sure he did, ignore this matter on that issue. If you are sure, consider why did the defendant lie on that issue. The mere fact that a defendant tells a lie is not in itself evidence of guilt. A defendant may lie for many reasons and they may possibly be innocent ones in the sense that they do not denote guilt.

Equally, it is astonishing to imagine why nearly 100 gallons of hydrogen peroxide was needed unless its purpose was to increase its strength. The handwritten figures ... on 36 bottles made devastating evidence. Each one demonstrated that the manufacturers of the bombs believed that they had in fact achieved the critical concentration necessary to ensure that the bombs exploded. Indeed a significant part of the trial was taken up by the efforts by applicants to explain away this crucial evidence. In very brief summary it was contended that after the concentration in the hydrogen peroxide had been increased, it was then watered down. Moreover it is difficult to understand how any political point, if that was all that was sought to be made, could be improved by the incorporation of shrapnel within the bomb. The shrapnel was intended to cause death and maiming. There could be no other purpose. And if this expedition were intended as a hoax or a political demonstration, there was a remarkable silence from the applicants themselves after they had made their escapes. If their objective was a hoax, half a moment\u2019s attention to the outpouring of the news about the unsuccessful bombings would have demonstrated that their objective had been achieved. Yet no such assertion or claim or explanation was given or offered to the police or the media or the public before any of the applicants was arrested.\u201d",

They had boarded the same train to Vauxhall and at the fourth applicant\u2019s stop, Mr Osman had decided to alight with him on the pretext of wishing to speak about something. As they walked towards the fourth applicant\u2019s home, Mr\u00a0Osman had told the fourth applicant that he was in trouble with the police. He claimed to have stolen some money and to have escaped from police custody. When they arrived at the fourth applicant\u2019s flat, Mr Osman had asked him to put on the television, and together they had watched a report of the attempted bombings which showed photographs of the men sought by the police. Mr Osman had then said that he knew the men and that they were good men. When the photograph of a fourth man sought in connection with the attacks appeared on screen, Mr Osman had pointed at the screen and said, \u201cthat\u2019s me\u201d. At first the fourth applicant had not believed him since the photograph did not resemble Mr Osman. But as Mr\u00a0Osman had continued to discuss the justification for the attacks, the fourth applicant had begun to realise that he was telling the truth. He had become frightened and had wanted Mr Osman out of his home. Mr Osman had then asked to stay with the fourth applicant for two nights and, fearing for his personal safety if he refused, the fourth applicant had acceded to the request.",

The decision not to arrest and caution [the fourth applicant] when the officers interviewing him believed that they had material which gave them reasonable grounds for suspecting that he had committed an offence was a clear and deliberate instruction to ignore the Code. But at that stage the police dilemma is understandable. [The fourth applicant] was providing information about Osman which could have been of critical importance in securing his arrest, which was the priority at that time. It seems to us that the judge was entitled to come to the conclusion that the prosecution had established that nothing was said or done which could undermine the reliability of the witness statement. He was entitled to take into account the fact that in the prepared statement he made after caution he asserted that he was seeking to give assistance to the police. That was repeated in the later interviews. He said nothing therefore to suggest that the circumstances were such as to render it likely that what he said was not reliable. It seems to us, therefore, that the judge was also entitled to conclude from all material that [the fourth applicant] with the help of legal advice, was repeating, subject as we have said to some corrections, what was in the witness statement as his account of the part such as it was, that he played in relation to Osman in the days after 21st July. Further, given the [fourth applicant\u2019s] adoption of that witness statement, we do not consider that the judge\u2019s decision to permit the statement to go before the jury in the exercise of his discretion under s. 78 of the Act can be said to be perverse or affected by any error of law.\u201d",

The main thrust of the argument on [the fourth applicant\u2019s] behalf is that to prosecute on the basis of a statement that he gave when being treated as a witness is quite simply unfair. He was, it is said, effectively being told that he would not be prosecuted and gave assistance accordingly. The judge in our view rightly rejected this argument. There was no evidence that [the fourth applicant] made his statement because he believed he was not going to be prosecuted. He gave no evidence to that effect; and there is nothing in the interviews after he was arrested to suggest that that was the reason for his having made the witness statement. On the contrary, he made the witness statement because he wanted to assist the police. In this type of case, the court is only likely to conclude there has been an abuse of process if a defendant can establish that there has been an unequivocal representation by those responsible for the conduct of the prosecution and that the defendant has acted to his detriment: see R\u00a0v Abu Hamza [2007] 1 Cr App R 27, [2006] EWCA Crim 2918, in particular at paragraph 54.

The Convention system recognised the particular need in the terrorism context to strike a proper balance between individual rights and the exigencies involved in dealing with terrorism.

This was not the case here and, in any event, the applicants\u2019 statements were not merely exculpatory but also false. In the Government\u2019s submission, the right against self-incrimination operated to protect those who incriminated themselves or remained silent.

It stated that since national laws may attach consequences to the attitude of an accused at the initial stages of police interrogation which are decisive for the prospects of the defence in any subsequent criminal proceedings, Article 6 will normally require that the accused be afforded a lawyer from these initial stages (see also Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 52).

Thus, the second aspect of the Salduz principle holds that, even where a restriction on access to legal advice was justified for compelling reasons, and thus itself compatible with Article 6, it may nonetheless be necessary, in the interests of fairness, to exclude from any subsequent criminal proceedings any statement made during a police interview in the absence of a lawyer.

The attacks had killed fifty-two people and injured countless more, and had temporarily disabled the entire London public transport system. When the first three applicants and Mr Osman detonated their devices two weeks later, the police had to work on the assumption that their conspiracy was an attempt to replicate the events of 7 July. At that stage, the police could not know why the bombs on 21 July had failed to explode and they had to assume that those responsible might attempt to detonate other bombs. The possibility of further loss of life on a large scale was no doubt foremost in their minds. The need to obtain, as a matter of critical urgency, information on any further planned attacks and the identities of those potentially involved in the plot, while ensuring that the integrity of the investigation was not compromised by leaks, was clearly of the most compelling nature.",

While there were extensive facilities at the police station for the detention of terrorist suspects and the investigation of terrorism offences, when the safety interviews were taking place the custody facilities were full. There were eighteen detainees arrested in connection with the attempted bombings, all of whom had to be detained separately to avoid communication and cross-contamination of forensic evidence (see the trial judge\u2019s ruling at paragraph 54 above). In spite of those pressures, save for the errors as to the wrong cautions (see paragraphs\u00a015, 22-23, 25-26, 30, 36, 40, 45, 51, 55-58, 64, 67-68, 80, 93 and 134-138 above), the police adhered strictly to the legislative framework which regulated how they had to conduct their investigation (see paragraph\u00a0142 above). There is no doubt that the superintendents who authorised the restrictions on the applicants\u2019 access to legal advice had reasonable grounds for their beliefs that such restrictions were necessary in order to counter a reasonably perceived and serious threat to the safety of the public since those grounds were contemporaneously recorded by the police in the relevant custody records and they were full, compelling and convincing (see paragraphs 21, 33 and 42 above). That there did exist an underlying urgent purpose of such a compelling character is borne out by the fact that the police questioning of the first three applicants was focused and concentrated on the threat posed to the public, rather than being directed at establishing their criminality (as in the cases of John Murray and Magee, both cited above). It is further noteworthy that at the time that the restrictions were imposed, it was clear to the police that there were at least four men involved in the bombings, the last of whom, Mr Osman, was still at large. The applicants\u2019 submission that the police could have waited until their solicitors arrived before beginning the interrogation is misguided since it is evident that at least part of the reason for delaying access to legal advice was because the police were concerned that access to legal advice would lead to the alerting of other suspects (see paragraphs 21, 33 and 42 above).",

He had voluntarily accompanied the police officers to the police station after agreeing to assist with the police investigation. As a witness, and not a suspect, there was no need for the police to consider whether the fourth applicant ought to be provided with legal advice. The fourth applicant asserts that he ought to have been placed under arrest and treated as a suspect, with all the procedural guarantees that status entailed. While the decision not to arrest and caution the fourth applicant at the point at which his answers began to suggest his involvement in a criminal offence was, as the Court of Appeal found, troubling (see paragraph 127 above) and in breach of Code C, the exceptional circumstances in which the police were operating must be borne in mind. Again as the Court of Appeal pointed out, the police dilemma at that stage was entirely understandable. The applicant was providing key information about the identity and whereabouts of the suspected fourth bomber, as well as details concerning the identity of the other bombers. At the time of the fourth applicant\u2019s first police interview on the evening of 27 July 2005, only Mr Omar had been arrested and he had provided no useful information on the nature of the plot or the identities of those involved. The remaining three bombers were still at large and their identification and arrest were imperative for public safety reasons. It was for the police to decide what course of action was most likely to lead to information on the extent of the risk to public safety and the whereabouts of the remaining bombers. The decision not to arrest the fourth applicant, apparently based on the fear that a formal arrest might lead him to stop disclosing information of the utmost relevance to the public safety issues facing the police, was not an unreasonable one in the circumstances. The imperative to obtain this information concerning the immediate safety of the public was of greater importance to the police at the time of the fourth applicant\u2019s questioning than any concern whether he had committed a criminal offence. Given the extreme conditions and time pressure under which they were then operating, this is not a decision that the Court can second-guess.",

The grounds and procedure for applying the exception to the general right to legal advice were set out in detail in Schedule 8 and in Code C (see paragraphs 142, 147 and 151 above). The decision to delay access to legal advice required authorisation by an officer of superintendent rank or above and was permitted only if the conditions in paragraph 8 of Schedule 8 were fulfilled (see paragraph 142 above). Those conditions were strict and exhaustive. Further, Schedule 8 stipulated that the reasons for the decision were to be recorded and that the detainee was to be informed of them. No restriction on access to legal advice could exceed forty-eight hours (see paragraph 151 above). Paragraph 6.7 of Code C provided that once sufficient information had been obtained to avert the risk of, inter alia, any of the dangers set out in paragraph 8 of Schedule 8, the questioning had to cease until the detainee had obtained legal advice (see paragraph 149 above). The provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000 and Code C struck an appropriate balance between the importance of the right to legal advice and the pressing need in exceptional cases to enable the police to obtain information necessary to protect the public.",

The forty-eight hour time-limit for delaying legal advice was also respected, since the applicants\u2019 access to legal advice was delayed for between four and eight hours only (see paragraphs 64, 67 and 68 above). The purpose of the safety interviews \u2013 to obtain information necessary to protect the public \u2013 was strictly adhered to in the applicants\u2019 cases. As the trial judge noted, in questioning Mr Omar the police officers concentrated throughout on issues that might have revealed information relevant to assisting them to locate people or items that could pose a danger to the public. There had also been no suggestion at trial by those acting for Mr Omar that the police had exceeded the requirements of what was necessary and that the lines of questioning had not been relevant to the public safety issues (see paragraph 63 above). In respect of Mr Ibrahim, the judge considered that the questions put did not go beyond legitimate questioning for safety purposes (paragraph 67 above) and as regards Mr Mohammed, he found that the questioning did not exceed the legitimate bounds or purpose of a safety interview and was focused and appropriate (paragraph 68 above).

It is furthermore unconvincing to suggest that, had the right words been used, the applicants would have acted differently and, instead of lying to the police, would have set out the hoax defence that they were later to deploy at trial. As the trial judge observed, the defence ultimately relied on did not require any detailed understanding of the criminal law and it could have been summed up by the single word \u201choax\u201d (see paragraph 60 above). Any defendant who genuinely believed that his whole enterprise had been a hoax (and thus that there was no real threat to the public safety) would not have needed to ponder the difference between the old and new style caution before telling the police this. Further, both the old and the new-style caution made it clear that anything said could be used in court.

United Kingdom (dec.), no. 31411/07, \u00a7 40, 18 January 2011; Beggs v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 15499/10, \u00a7 124, 16 October 2012 (with further references therein)). In the applicants\u2019 case, the trial judge performed his crucial role with care, diligence and fairness (see paragraphs 79-83 above). His directions were circulated to and discussed with counsel in advance of delivery. They were also given in written form to the jury. They included the instruction to the jury that, in deciding whether to hold any lie told by the applicants during the safety interviews against them, the jury should remember that the safeguard of access to legal advice had been withheld and bear in mind the possibility of innocent explanations for the lies told (see paragraphs 79 and 81 above). The jury were also asked to take into account the failure to administer the correct caution to the applicants (see paragraph 80 above). An explicit direction was given to the jury that they were not allowed to hold it against the applicants that they had failed to mention during the safety interviews matters which they later had relied on in court (see paragraph 82 in fine above). Also, a clear contrast was drawn between the safety interviews and the later interviews where the applicants had had access to legal advice and the trial judge explicitly told the jury that they could only draw adverse inferences in respect of the later interviews (see paragraph 83 above). Throughout his summing-up, the trial judge stressed the need for the jury to consider the case of each defendant and his statements separately, just as the judge himself had done in his ruling on the admissibility of those statements.",

There was Mr Mohammed\u2019s farewell letter (see paragraph 75 above). There was evidence of the extensive contact between the men before and after 21 July 2005 (see paragraph 74 above). There was the evidence that they had bought vast quantities of hydrogen peroxide and patiently concentrated it, marking the bottles in a manner suggesting that they believed that had reached a high enough concentration to achieve an explosion (see paragraph 72 above). There was the evidence as to the construction of the bombs, which were, in all other respects, viable devices, containing as they did working electrical circuits, detonators and shrapnel, intended to cause maximum impact on explosion (see paragraph 73 above). The prosecution\u2019s scientific expert pointed out that, if the intention had only been to create a loud bang, no concentration would have been necessary. The same is true of the inclusion of the shrapnel. There was further scientific evidence in the form of the isotopic analysis, which disproved the men\u2019s claim to have concentrated the hydrogen peroxide and then diluted it again with tap water (see paragraph 73 above). There was the witness evidence of the passengers on the trains boarded by Mr Omar and Mr\u00a0Mohammed as to their shocked reactions when their bombs did not detonate (see paragraph 76 above). Lastly, there was oral evidence from the fifth bomber, Mr Asiedu, flatly contradicting the claim that the attacks had been intended as a hoax (see paragraph 78 above).

However, it is significant that there was a clear legislative framework in place to govern the admissibility, in any criminal proceedings subsequently brought, of evidence obtained during police questioning. In addition to the prohibition in section 76 PACE on admitting into evidence a confession obtained by oppression or one which was likely to be unreliable, the trial judge had discretion under section 78 PACE to refuse to admit evidence which he considered would have an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings (see paragraphs 152-154 above).

In this context, it is significant that the fourth applicant had agreed to assist the police and had attended the police station voluntarily (see paragraph 101 above). He was questioned not as a suspect but as a witness and was free to leave at any time. There was accordingly no significant curtailment of the applicant\u2019s freedom of action (see Alexander Zaichenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04851; and Bandaletov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62). This conclusion is not undermined by the possibility that, had he tried to leave the police station after he had begun to discuss his role in sheltering Mr Osman, he might have been arrested. Until such an arrest took place, his formal position as a witness, and not a suspect, dictated the manner and circumstances in which the statement was taken. Concerns regarding the potentially coercive conditions of police interrogation and the vulnerability of suspects, adverted to in the Court\u2019s case-law as being relevant in this context (see paragraphs 192 and 196(b) above above) did not arise. As a consequence, and as the domestic courts found, there was nothing to indicate that the witness statement was, or might be, unreliable (see paragraphs 118 and 128 above).",

In his prepared statement read out on 30 July 2005 after consultation with his solicitor, he emphasised the valuable assistance that he had given (see paragraph 111 above). He made the same point in a police interview on 1 August (see paragraph 112 above). In his appeal against sentence, he successfully relied on the early assistance provided to seek a reduction in the term of imprisonment he had been sentenced to serve. The Court of Appeal considered the matter of pre-arrest assistance to the police to be relevant to the sentencing exercise and in the applicant\u2019s case it led to a two-year reduction in sentence on appeal (see paragraphs\u00a0130-132 above).",

He was not interviewed again until two and a half days later, by which time he had availed himself of his right to legal assistance. During this period, he had ample opportunity to reflect on his defence, with the benefit of legal advice, in order to choose how he wished to proceed. He could have chosen at that stage to retract the witness statement, relying then on the arguments which he now advances. Instead he chose to adopt his witness statement and build upon it, clarifying some factual details and emphasising once more his desire to assist the police and his ignorance as to Mr Osman\u2019s role in the attempted bombings (see paragraph 111 above and Bandaletov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 17-18, 23, 26 and 67; and compare and contrast Lutsenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 51). The decision not to retract the witness statement once he had received legal advice was an important factor in the trial judge\u2019s finding that the statement was reliable and that it would not be unfair to admit it or an abuse of process to continue with the trial (see paragraphs 118, 123 and 128 above). By converse implication, had the applicant retracted the statement after having received legal advice, this would have weighed heavily in the balance against its admission. The Court accordingly rejects the fourth applicant\u2019s claim to have been presented with a fait accompli once the statement had been taken (see paragraph 188 above). It is also significant in this respect that, while he did challenge the admissibility of the statement at trial, he has failed to explain why he felt unable to challenge it at an earlier stage.",

Ukraine, no. 31720/02, \u00a7 87, 20\u00a0September 2012, the Court did not consider the fact that the applicant there had repeated his confession in the presence of his lawyer to undermine its finding that his rights had been irretrievably prejudiced. However, this conclusion in that particular case cannot be taken in isolation: as the Court has already emphasised, the question whether criminal proceedings were fair must be assessed by reference to the proceedings in their entirety (see paragraphs 191-196 above) and the facts of Titarenko were significantly different. Notably, the impugned interview in that case was conducted once the applicant had been arrested and was in involuntary police custody and the applicant later retracted what he had said in his confession, claimed that he had an alibi and contended that the confession had been obtained from him under duress. None of these features were present in the fourth applicant\u2019s case. As noted above, the applicant had at first been interviewed as a witness while voluntarily attending the police station (see paragraph\u00a0218 above). In suspect interviews on 30 July, 1 August, 2 August and 3 August, all conducted in the presence of a lawyer and after the applicant had received legal advice, he either reiterated what he had previously said or referred to his prior statement. At no stage did he seek to advance any other version of events than the one given to the police during his initial interview (see paragraph paragraphs 111-112 and 220 above and compare and contrast also Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 17; and Alexander\u00a0Zaichenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 14-15).",

He studied carefully the circumstances in which the statement in its totality had been adopted by the fourth applicant and provided detailed reasons for his conclusion that there would be no unfairness if the statement were admitted in its entirety and if the prosecution were to proceed (see paragraphs 117-120 and 123 above; and compare and contrast Panovits, cited above, \u00a7 85; and Alexander Zaichenko, cited above, \u00a7 58).

It also corroborated the prosecution allegation that the fourth applicant had met Mr\u00a0Sherif to collect a passport for Mr Osman. A fingerprint showed that Mr\u00a0Osman had been in contact with a newspaper, containing a report of the bombings together with photographs, found in Mr Osman\u2019s flat. There was oral evidence from Mr Sherif as to his contact with the fourth applicant in connection with Mr Osman\u2019s escape after the bombings and Mr Osman gave evidence which largely reflected the contents of the fourth applicant\u2019s statement (see paragraph 125 above).

While I am fully aware of the difficult and urgent situation, which called for \u201csafety interviews\u201d for the purposes of obtaining information that was urgently necessary to remove imminent danger and save the lives of many, I find myself unable to follow the argument that preventing access to a lawyer may be justified for the purposes of \u201censuring that the integrity of the investigation was not compromised by leaks\u201d.
