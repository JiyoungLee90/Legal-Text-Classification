The appeal court had been aware of a business notification and, specifically, could have sought submission of the 2013 notification document (see paragraph 7 above) indicating the applicant\u2019s actual residence address while the Liski Unit\u2019s representative had omitted to disclose it. The applicant insisted that he had not received any notifications; no correspondence, including by registered mail, had been handed over to him by any official of the postal service; he had never refused any such correspondence. In particular, despite the requirements of the law, when returning correspondence, the postal service had not specified that the addressee had not been present/residing at the address and had not indicated the source of their information about that.",

Although this is not expressly mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 6, the object and purpose of this Article taken as a whole indicate that a person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d is entitled to take part in such a hearing. Moreover, sub-paragraphs (c), (d) and\u00a0(e) of paragraph 3 guarantee to \u201ceveryone charged with a criminal offence\u201d the right \u201cto defend himself in person\u201d, \u201cto examine or have examined witnesses\u201d and \u201cto have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court\u201d, and it is difficult to see how he could exercise these rights without being present (see Hermi v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59, ECHR 2006XII). An oral, and public, hearing constitutes a fundamental principle enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01. This principle is particularly important in the criminal context, where generally there must be at first instance a tribunal which fully meets the requirements of Article 6, and where an applicant has an entitlement to have his case \u201cheard\u201d, with the opportunity, inter alia, to give evidence in his own defence, hear the evidence against him, and examine and cross-examine the witnesses (see Jussila v. Finland [GC], no.\u00a073053/01, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2006XIV).",

The character of the circumstances that may justify dispensing with an oral hearing essentially comes down to the nature of the issues to be decided by the relevant national court, not to the frequency of such situations (see also Flisar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39). It does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases. The overarching principle of fairness embodied in Article 6 is, as always, the key consideration.",

Leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law (as opposed to questions of fact) may comply with the requirements of Article 6, even if the appellant in question was not given an opportunity of being heard in person by the appeal or cassation courts, provided that a public hearing was held at the first instance (see Hermi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62). Even where the court of appeal has jurisdiction to review a case both as to facts and as to law, Article 6 does not always require a right to a public hearing, still less a right to appear in person. In order to decide this question, regard must be had, among other considerations, to the specific features of the proceedings in question and to the manner in which the applicant\u2019s interests were actually presented and protected before the appellate court, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it.\u00a0Where an appellate court has to examine a case in respect of both the facts and the law and make a full assessment of the issue of guilt or innocence, it cannot determine the issue without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the accused for the purpose of proving that he did not commit the act allegedly constituting a criminal offence (see Kamasinski v.

There are clearly \u201ccriminal charges\u201d of differing weight. What is more, the autonomous interpretation adopted by the Court of the notion of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d has underpinned a gradual broadening of the criminal head to cases not strictly belonging to the traditional categories of the criminal law \u2013 for example, administrative penalties, prison disciplinary proceedings, customs law, competition law, and penalties imposed by a court with jurisdiction in financial matters (ibid.).",

However, he chose not to be present when an offence record was being compiled by the Liski Unit (see paragraphs 9 and 36 above). While it is true that the business notification in 2013 (see paragraph 7 above) did mention his actual residence address, it does not appear that this notification was inserted into any official database such as the register of individual entrepreneurs (see paragraph 42 above). Nor does it appear that this notification was part of the administrative-offence file or that the applicant formally requested the Liski Unit to correspond to his actual residence address. At the same time, the Court has been given no reason to rule out that the Liski Unit would be authorised, under Russian law, to use this other address for official purposes. Thus, while it remains unclear whether and when the applicant became aware of or received a copy of the offence record, the above elements contain indications that the applicant could realise, in early August 2014, that he could be subject to an administrative-offence charge and that that charge would be determined by a commercial court and, specifically, the Commercial Court of the Voronezh Region (see paragraph 36 above and the provisions of Chapter\u00a025 of the CComP mentioned in paragraph 34 above). Furthermore, in the circumstances of the case he had no valid reason to expect to be notified at the address at which he was actually residing at the time (in particular, as regards the decision to start the judicial proceedings). Russian law made it a rule that notifications be dispatched to a person\u2019s registered residence address. Even though the above considerations do not suggest that the applicant was thereby actually informed of any decision to bring the matter for adjudication before a commercial court or informed of any judicial order to initiate proceedings, they point toward a certain lack of diligence on the part of the applicant (compare Gadzhikhanov and Saukov v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a010511/08 and 5866/09, \u00a7 22, 31 January 2012 in the context of a judgment creditor\u2019s conduct in enforcement proceedings) and indicate that he was aware of the existence of \u201cthe proceedings\u201d in its wider meaning including the initial non-judicial stage of such proceedings.",

In fact, both at the domestic level and before the Court the applicant did not specify any factual circumstances in that respect confining his submissions to a general statement that he had not received any notifications.",

The Court also notes that the commercial court took care to send a notification to the place where the business (the food sale stalls or alike) was located (see paragraph 16 above). It is also uncontested that the information relating to scheduled hearings was timely and in an adequate manner made accessible via the court\u2019s Internet site. In the Court\u2019s view, thereby they displayed sufficient diligence to enable the applicant, who was to be aware of the applicable rules on notifications relating to entrepreneurs, to apprise himself of the proceedings pending against him, namely as regards the appeal proceedings in the case.",

Austria, no.\u00a032435/06, \u00a7 27, 12 May 2010), the Court considers that in the particular circumstances of the case it was justified to deem the applicant duly notified even though it was common ground that the notifications did not actually reach him.\u00a0By implication it was justified to conduct the appeal hearing in his absence.",

It is uncontested before the Court in this connection that the applicant was afforded an opportunity to prepare his defence (for instance, by way of having access to the case file or commenting on the Liski Unit\u2019s observations) and to attend the cassation hearing. He chose not to attend it, confining his defence to the submission of written pleadings to the court. The cassation appeal court carefully examined the applicant\u2019s arguments, including regarding the notifications in the appeal proceedings. The Court further notes in that respect the narrow scope of the applicant\u2019s grievance before the Court, namely that there is no indication of any issue relating to the rights protected under Article 6 \u00a7 3, for instance under its paragraphs\u00a0(a), (b) or (d) (see paragraph 58 above). In particular, it does not transpire that the applicant ever wanted, but was not afforded an opportunity, to have an opportunity to examine any witnesses (see the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a058 above).",
