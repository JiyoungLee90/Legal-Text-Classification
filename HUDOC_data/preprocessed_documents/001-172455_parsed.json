However, the Court must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Apostol v.

Accordingly, that obligation, which should have been borne by the other party and which was imposed on the applicant at the enforcement stage, constituted a restriction of a purely financial nature and therefore calls for particularly rigorous scrutiny from the point of view of the interests of justice (see Apostol, cited above, \u00a7 60, and Osman Y\u0131lmaz v. Turkey, no.\u00a018896/05, \u00a7 41, 8 December 2009). In this connection, the Court takes account of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision dated 14 January 2010, which repealed the provision in the second sentence of section 28 (1)(a). It notes that the higher court found the said provision incompatible with the right of access to court, as it imposed the obligation to pay the court fees on the party whose case had been accepted and who was not legally liable for such fees pursuant to the judgment.",
