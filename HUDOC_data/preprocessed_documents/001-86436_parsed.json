This was apparently due to the poor coordination between the prosecution and the investigation authorities (see Vachev, cited above, \u00a7 96). In addition, it seems that for a period of more than two and a half years, between October 1996 and June 1999, the investigation had almost ground to a halt (see paragraph 20 and 21 above). As a result, the preliminary investigation stage alone spanned almost seven years. In view of the relatively uncomplicated nature of the case, such a timespan appears excessive. Moreover, four hearings before the Elin Pelin District Court were adjourned owning to reasons attributable to the authorities (see paragraphs 14 and 24 above).",
