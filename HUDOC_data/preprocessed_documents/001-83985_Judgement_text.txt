The case originated in four applications (nos. 12636/03, 14118/03, 33393/03 and 36734/03) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five Ukrainian nationals, Mrs Nina Vasilyevna Kolnoochenko, Mr Vladimir Kuzmich Shashkov, Mrs Valentina Mikhaylovna Ignatyeva, Mr Valentin Petrovich Steblina and Mrs Larisa Anatolyevna Dubosar (“the applicants”), on 24 March, 17 April, 7 October and 25 September 2003, respectively.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Y. Zaytsev, their Agent, and Mrs I. Shevchuk, Head of the Office of the Government Agent before the European Court of Human Rights.
On 5 May 2006 the Court decided to communicate the complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the delay in the enforcement of judgments given in the applicants' favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.
The applicants were born in 1939, 1940, 1940, 1937 and 1972 respectively. On 30 January 2007 the second applicant died. By letter of 12 April 2007, Mrs Svetlana Ivanovna Shashkova, the second applicant's widow, informed the Court that she wished to pursue the application.
The first applicant was employed by a subsidiary of the Statecontrolled “Pivdenelekromash” OJSC (“the Company,” ВАТ “Південелектромаш”) until her dismissal on redundancy in 2005. The other applicants were employed by the Company itself.
Between January 2001 and May 2004 (see appendix for details) each applicant obtained one or more final judgments from the  (Новокаховський міський суд Херсонської області), awarding him or her salary arrears or other payments against his or her employer.
The writs of enforcement in respect of these judgments were transferred to the Nova Kakhovka City Bailiffs' Service (Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Новокаховського міського управління юстиції), which initiated the enforcement proceedings. On different occasions the bailiffs informed the applicants that the collection of the debts was impeded by pending bankruptcy proceedings against the Company.
In March 2006 the judgment given in favour of the first applicant and two of the three judgments given in favour of the second applicant were enforced in full. Other judgments remain fully or partially unenforced.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgments of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-19, 27 July 2004) and Trykhlib v. Ukraine (no. 58312/00, §§ 25-32, 20 September 2005).
