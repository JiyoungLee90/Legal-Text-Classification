The pre-trial investigation stage of these proceedings, which terminated by O.F.\u2019s committal for trial, lasted from October 2001 until June 2008, that is, six years and seven months.

Based on the case file materials, major delays at this stage were attributable to numerous remittals of the case for further investigations following poorly substantiated decisions to discontinue the criminal proceedings for want of evidence that O.F. had committed a crime and the need to rectify procedural shortcomings and collect further evidence (see paragraphs 9-12 above).",
