Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural acts would have no incidence on the continuous nature of the detention. However, the applicant\u2019s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d.

In this respect the Court reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities, above all the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation concerning domestic legislation, the Court\u2019s role being confined to determining whether or not the effects of that interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see, among other authorities, Waite and Kennedy v.

In that case the Government did not argue that the 2001 text of Article\u00a025(4) was not applicable to detention during the trial stage of the criminal proceedings and that that Article from the Constitution should have been interpreted in the light of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 1999. The Court has therefore expressly ruled that the manner in which the applicant\u2019s detention had taken place during the trial stage of the proceedings, had been contrary to the 2001 text of Article 25(4) of the Constitution and found a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Moreover, it is worth noting that after the adoption of the Boicenco judgment, as admitted by the Government in their observations, changes have been made to the Code of Criminal Procedure in such a way as to make it compatible with the \u201cuninterpreted\u201d 2001 text of Article 25(4) of the Constitution.",
