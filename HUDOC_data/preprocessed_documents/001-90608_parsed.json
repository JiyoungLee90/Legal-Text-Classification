Given the previous offers, the court could not agree with the applicant company that the amount of compensation should be based on the value of the property in 1994, when the municipality\u2019s offer was made. Under section 10 (a) of Compulsory Acquisition Law no. 15 of 1962, the time relevant for determination of the amount of compensation was that of notification of the order of acquisition. The applicant company\u2019s argument that a fair amount had to be based on the market value of the property in 1994 was not justified by law. Turning to whether the actual compensation paid on the basis of the value of the applicant company\u2019s property in 1972 was equitable, the court noted that it could not accept the applicant company\u2019s expert evidence, which had been based on an inappropriate comparison with properties having different building density coefficients from the applicant company\u2019s property and other important differences in their legal and factual characteristics. Having thoroughly examined the suggestions of the applicant company\u2019s expert witness concerning his evaluation, the court dismissed his evidence, finding that he had merely tried to serve the financial interests of the applicant company and not to assist the court. The expert evidence submitted on behalf of the municipality had been accurate, used comparators that had similar legal, physical and real characteristics to those of the applicant company\u2019s property and had accurate adjustments of the value of the property based on adequate and well-substantiated explanations. The court accepted therefore that, on the basis of the evaluation, the value of the applicant company\u2019s property on 1 December 1972 was CYP 103,056. The court awarded the latter sum (minus the amount of CYP 100,000 already paid by the municipality) plus different taxes and other expenses paid by the applicant company.",

Further, it maintained that the municipality\u2019s obligation to provide it with just compensation as required by Article 23 (3) of the Constitution and the relevant jurisprudence of this Court could not be considered to have been fulfilled by an offer of compensation made 22 years after the acquisition notification and estimated on the basis of the value of the property at the time of the notification.",

The court noted that the fact that the value of the property had been estimated by the LSO to be CYP 735,000 was a non sequitur, as both expert witnesses appearing before the district court had used the comparative method of valuation to determine the property\u2019s value at the relevant time and any subsequent evaluation was based on different grounds and could not confirm or disprove an outcome reached by using the comparative method in respect of a particular point in time, which was acceptable per se and could not be falsified by a subsequent estimation based on different grounds. Further, the court found the applicant company\u2019s argument under Article 23 of the Constitution to be misconceived: firstly, the municipality had made offers for compensation on at least two occasions before 1994, and any delay in payment of compensation was attributable to the applicant company, which had chosen repeatedly to contest the lawfulness of the acquisition procedure instead of referring the matter of compensation to the district court for determination. The applicant company knew at all times that the value of the property, as at 1972, had been estimated as CYP 100,000 and that its own evaluation was substantially higher. It was further aware that the relevant law provided that compensation must be based on the market value of the property at the time of notification of the compulsory acquisition. The applicant company should therefore have applied to the courts to obtain determination of the amount of compensation, as provided by law, or could have challenged the municipality\u2019s offer of 1 March 1984 before the courts. Instead, it only contested the same old valuation in 1995 when it challenged the new offer which was made on its basis.",

At the same time, he is aware that the property will at some time pass to the acquiring authority and ought to know that the critical time for assessment of its value is the time of publication of the notice of acquisition. Therefore, if his intention is to replace it with another property of equal value he should not delay... We find that the provision for payment of interest until the date of payment of compensation, constitutes a just measure for preserving the value of the amount that would have been received by the owner had he accepted the offer outright, or had the parties reached an agreement concerning the value of the property at the material time of publication of the notice.... The plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they are additionally entitled to compensation by the total amount of yearly increase of the value of the property, is equated in essence to a claim for compensation equal to the value of the property as on the day of payment instead of the time of publication of the notice of acquisition. This is an unrealistic claim which does not accord either with the letter or the spirit of the law. Should it be adopted, it would encourage all sorts of delaying tactics by owners aiming to receive compensation amounting to the yearly increase of their property while at the same time enjoying the use and benefit of the property.\u201d",

The fact that the applicant company did not exercise its right under domestic law to take steps to have the compensation assessed as soon as it became possible could not be held against it. The acquisition was a compulsory one, and it was quite natural for the applicant company which owned it to want to keep its land and not part with it at any price if it could help it. Exercising its legal right to ask the courts for determination of compensation would have resulted in its dispossession by the acquiring authority, while it could not be excluded that the acquisition order might be set aside at some future stage either because the acquiring authority decided not to go on, or because, as a result of unreasonable delay, it was deemed to have abandoned its project.",

The municipality had written a letter to the LSO in January 1977 \u2013 four years after the publication of the notice of acquisition \u2013 to request the valuation of the property. They had only proceeded with the negotiations when they had received a letter from the applicant company on 19 June 1980. They had then had a meeting with the applicant company on 1 March 1984 and made an offer of compensation. The applicant company\u2019s subsequent letter of 23\u00a0February 1985 had gone unanswered and after nine years a requisition notice had been published in the Official Gazette on 25 November 1994. Throughout these years of little if any activity being taken with a view to acquisition, the applicant company\u2019s property had been kept in reserve until it was actually needed, while its value had substantially increased. The applicant company had therefore been unfairly deprived of capital gain generated by the property. The actual compensation which was paid in 1995, namely the amount of CYP 277,944.51, constituted merely 12.92% of the actual value of the property in 1994 as agreed between the parties. The interest imposed by Cypriot law was clearly inadequate for the compensation reasonably to reflect the property\u2019s market value. Furthermore, the acquisition notice and order of 1972 and 1973 had concerned part of the property, while the 1994 requisition order had concerned the whole property, yet the amount of compensation paid reflected the value of only part of the property as estimated in 1972.",

The interference with the applicant company\u2019s property rights commenced with the publication of the notice of compulsory acquisition in 1972 and subsequent acquisition order issued in 1973 and continued throughout the period terminating with the final transfer of ownership to the municipality. During that period the applicant company\u2019s use of its property was significantly reduced until the final acquisition took place.

The initiation of proceedings to have the amount of compensation determined would effectively have meant acceptance of the interference and would have been inconsistent with, or even undermined, other proceedings that were pending challenging the legitimacy and finality of the acquisition. The Court finds particularly important in this respect that following the domestic court\u2019s decision that the refusal of the applicant company\u2019s building permit application was unlawful because the company remained the owner of the relevant property, the applicant company had an expectation that it might obtain a building permit until 1993, when its contestation of a second refusal was rejected. Secondly, it is clear that long periods of inactivity elapsed in which the acquiring authority failed to take any action concerning the acquisition and for which the Government did not submit any justification or reasonable explanation. Lastly, the acquiring authority had the same possibility to accelerate the proceedings by applying to the civil courts for determination of the award of compensation but failed to do so. The Court notes that no explanation was provided by the Government as to why the municipality took no such action, while it considers it more reasonable for the municipality to have sought to obtain determination of the amount of compensation, given the very nature of the compulsory acquisition order issued to enable the municipality to pursue its policies.",
