The Court notes that the applicants took steps to keep track of the investigation\u2019s progress, or lack thereof. Having regard to the period during which the applicants complained to the relevant prosecuting authorities, which lasted approximately a year and half, the Court notes that there had not been excessive or unexplained delay on the part of applicants once they had, or ought to have, become aware that no investigation had been instigated or that the investigation had lapsed into inaction or become ineffective and, in any of those eventualities, there was no immediate, realistic prospect of an effective investigation being provided in the future.",

The Government contended that the injuries might have been inflicted as a result of the eighth applicant\u2019s body coming into contact with the metal fence surrounding the university.

Given the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to carry out an effective investigation at the relevant time and in view of all the material in its possession, the Court cannot address the question of whether State agents were behind the attack on the eighth applicant and whether it was State agents who subjected him to the alleged violence (contrast Uzeyir Jafarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 58-62, and Chernega and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 125-131).

The Court has frequently stressed the fundamental role of freedom of expression in a democratic society, in particular where, through the press, it serves to impart information and ideas of general interest which the public is, moreover, entitled to receive (see, for example, Observer and Guardian v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, \u00a7 59, Series A no.\u00a0216). The Court also reiterates that the key importance of freedom of expression as one of the preconditions for a functioning democracy is such that the genuine, effective exercise of this freedom is not dependent merely on the State\u2019s duty not to interfere, but may call for positive measures of protection, even in the sphere of relations between individuals (see \u00d6zg\u00fcr\u00a0G\u00fcndem v. Turkey, no. 23144/93, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000III). In particular, the positive obligations under Article 10 of the Convention require States to create a favourable environment for participation in public debate by all the persons concerned, enabling them to express their opinions and ideas without fear (see Dink v. Turkey, nos. 2668/07, , ,  and , \u00a7 137, 14 September 2010). It cannot be disputed that the physical ill-treatment of journalists while the latter are performing their professional duties seriously hampers their exercise of the right to receive and impart information.",

In that connection, the Court notes that the seventh applicant\u2019s belated submissions with regard to the services provided by his representatives, Mr P. Leach, Ms J. Gavron and Ms R. Remezaite, in the proceedings before the Court were not admitted to the file. The Court also rejects the seventh applicant\u2019s claim in respect of the legal services of Mr\u00a0E.\u00a0Sadigov, since according to the case file Mr E. Sadigov never represented him in the proceedings before the Court. Therefore, the Court allows the seventh applicant\u2019s claims concerning legal services provided by Mr R. Hajili.
