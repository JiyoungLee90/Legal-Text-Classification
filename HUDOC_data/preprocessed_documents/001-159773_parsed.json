The role of the Council for the Judiciary is to show that a judge cannot bear the same responsibilities as a member of another profession: he/she performs a public function and cannot refuse to adjudicate on disputes. Furthermore, if the judge is exposed to legal and disciplinary sanctions against his/her decisions, neither judicial independence nor the democratic balance of powers can be maintained.

Austria, 24\u00a0February 1993, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 30, Series A no. 255, and Wettstein v.\u00a0Switzerland, no. 33958/96, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2000-XII).",

Nevertheless, it considers that the applicants must have suffered distress and anxiety on account of the violations found. Ruling on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41 of the Convention, it awards the applicants EUR 4,000 each in respect of nonpecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable.",

Therefore, the most appropriate form of redress in cases such as the present one would be the reopening of the proceedings, if requested. The Court notes that the authorities applied the Civil Proceedings Act as appropriate (see paragraph 11 above). It further observes that the Civil Proceedings Act provides for the possibility of proceedings being reopened where the Court concludes in a judgment that a court\u2019s decision or proceedings prior to it were in breach of the fundamental human rights or freedoms of the party (see paragraph 27 above).",
