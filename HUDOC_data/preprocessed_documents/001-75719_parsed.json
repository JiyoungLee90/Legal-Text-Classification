They submitted that the adoption of deportation as a criterion for determining the category of persons subjected to the most severe forms of Nazi persecution followed from the practice of the International Military Tribunal at , which had recognised deportation for the purpose of forced labour as a crime against the population of the occupied countries. The Government maintained that, contrary to the Court\u2019s findings (see paragraph 27 of the admissibility decision), the Foundation had applied the deportation criterion since the beginning of its operation, and not only since the adoption of Resolution no. 29/99 of 18 August 1999.",

On the other hand, the Court noted that it could not be excluded that some procedural issues \u2013 related to the application of those eligibility criteria to the facts of individual cases \u2013 could arise (see Wo\u015b, \u00a7 80). In other words, once a compensation scheme is put in place by a government or with a government\u2019s consent, and regardless of the nature of the respective benefits, issues of compliance with Article 6 \u00a7 1 or Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 may arise.

The Foundation exercised the same margin of discretion each and every time it applied the eligibility criteria to the facts of individual cases. In this context, the Court emphasises that in the area falling within the Foundation\u2019s margin of discretion, its decisions in individual cases bear upon the claimants\u2019 rights. As a matter of principle, the Court considers that in cases such as the present one, where an issue related to assessment of the facts arises, the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 would extend to all similar cases in which there appear to be reasonable grounds to believe that the Foundation\u2019s assessment of facts was questionable and thus had a direct bearing on the applicant\u2019s eligibility for compensation.",

The Court further noted that, following amendments to the eligibility criteria introduced by the Foundation\u2019s Resolution no. 29/99, the applicant received a supplementary compensation payment on 2 March 2000, but only in respect of his forced labour between April 1941 and February 1944 and on the separate ground that he had performed forced labour as a child under the age of 16. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court considered that a dispute over the applicant\u2019s entitlement to compensation had arisen in respect of the right to receive compensation for the overall period of his forced labour, given that the applicant considered that the deportation requirement was not a relevant factor in the assessment of his compensation claim. In the Court\u2019s view, that dispute was genuine and of a serious nature. The outcome of the relevant proceedings before the Foundation was decisive since it concerned the scope of the applicant\u2019s right to obtain compensation in respect of the overall period of his forced labour (see Wo\u015b, \u00a7\u00a7 81-82).",

The Court held that those regulations, regardless of their characterisation under domestic law, could be considered to create a right for a victim of Nazi persecution to claim compensation from the Foundation. Accordingly, the Court found that if a claimant complied with the eligibility conditions stipulated in those regulations he had a right to be awarded compensation by the Foundation (see, mutatis mutandis, Rolf Gustafson v. Sweden, 1 July 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV). Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, it could not be said that the relevant Foundation\u2019s regulations gave rise to an ex gratia compensation claim. Finally, the Court considered that the applicant could claim, at least on arguable grounds, the right to receive compensation from the Foundation in respect of the overall period of his forced labour. This was so especially since he had already received one instalment of compensation by virtue of the decision of 2 February 1994, so that he could have been led to believe that he did indeed have such a right (see Wo\u015b, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84).",

Having regard to the autonomous nature of the concept \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d, the Court did not find conclusive the findings of the domestic courts to the effect that compensation claims asserted against the Foundation did not come within the scope of civil law. Furthermore, the Court considered that there were similarities between the entitlement to welfare allowances which falls under the scope of \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d (see Salesi v. Italy, 26 February 1993, \u00a7 19, Series A no.\u00a0257E) and the entitlement to receive compensation from the Foundation, regard being had in particular to the eligibility criteria of a claimant\u2019s financial difficulties and severe damage to his health as a result of Nazi persecution. Finally, the Court observed that, in the present case, the applicant was not affected in his relations with the Foundation, acting in the exercise of its discretionary powers. Rather, the applicant suffered an interference with his means of subsistence and was claiming an individual, economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in the Foundation\u2019s statute and its internal regulations (see, mutatis mutandis, Salesi, loc. cit., and Mennitto v.  [GC], no. 33804/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 2000X). Thus, the Court was of the view that the right to claim compensation on account of Nazi persecution from the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation could be considered \u201ccivil\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In conclusion, the Court found that the right to compensation asserted by the applicant under the first compensation scheme was a \u201ccivil right\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1, which was thus held to be applicable (see Wo\u015b, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a089-93).",

In particular, the Court is not persuaded that its finding as to the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 could be refuted by the retrospective admission, made for the first time in June 2005, that the Foundation had erred when granting the applicant a primary payment in respect of the overall period of his forced labour. It is noteworthy in this respect that, in reply to the applicant\u2019s various queries at the material time, the Foundation never claimed that its decision of 2 February 1994 on primary payment had been flawed.

It established this as an inherent aspect of the safeguards enshrined in Article 6, referring to the principles of the rule of law and the avoidance of arbitrary power which underlie much of the Convention.
