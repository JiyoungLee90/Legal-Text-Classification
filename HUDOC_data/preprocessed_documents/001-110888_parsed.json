The Government referred to the Sokurenko and Strygun case, where the Court had acknowledged that in exceptional circumstances the highest judicial body competent to interpret the law could take a decision which was not strictly provided by the law. They further reiterated the reasoning given by the Supreme Court in its decision of 13 May 2008. Finally, the Government observed that the relevant domestic legislation had been changed in July 2010 and that the Supreme Court was no longer competent to review the commercial cases as a second-instance court of cassation, this fact having rectified the situation and dispensed the State of liability.",
