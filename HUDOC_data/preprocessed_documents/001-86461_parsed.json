It added that the prostheses were directly delivered to the operating theatre at the Clinique du Parc but were billed by a company named Clinique Service, also managed by the applicant, with a systematic increase of 15% for the prostheses and 18.5% for the ancillary equipment, the increased price alone being charged to the Health Insurance Office.

In practice, the two-month time-limit granted to the Principal Public Prosecutor existed purely to allow the prosecuting authorities to circumvent the normal procedural deadline (ten days); the mechanism in Article 505, which allowed one of the parties to redress the error made by failing to appeal in time, and which thereby subjected the other party to differential and unfavourable treatment by not allowing that party the benefit of limitation periods under normal conditions and the legal certainty they entailed, breached the principle of equality of arms. This had already been taken into account by the Government in a different context. The former Article 546 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had entitled the Principal Public Prosecutor to lodge an appeal against any judgments concerning petty offences (contraventions), whereas the parties had been denied that right. As a result, the Court of Cassation had found that the relevant provision breached the principle of equality of arms, and the legislature had endorsed that reasoning by repealing the provision in the Law of 23 June 1999. In that particular example, as in the present case, only the prosecution had had an interest in appealing and the fact that the respondent had been acquitted did not make render that right in any way notional. The difference in treatment as to the possibility of appealing and the practical procedure for doing so was sufficient in itself to breach the principle of equality of arms between the parties, even if they did not concurrently exercise their right in every case.",

The prosecution\u2019s right of appeal, and hence the availability of a review, made it possible to perform a regulatory and corrective role, whether this role resulted in conviction or acquittal. Although in formal terms the defendant did not have the right to lodge a cross-appeal following an appeal by the Principal Public Prosecutor, the Court of Appeal was required to examine all aspects of the case, and in particular all of the defendant\u2019s arguments (Court of Cassation, Criminal Division, 17 January 1996).",
