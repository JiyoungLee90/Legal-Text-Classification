Nevertheless, it observes that the applicant was not represented by a lawyer at any stage of the proceedings, and hence, did not benefit from any legal assistance when he requested the attendance of the two witnesses in criminal proceedings where he faced serious charges and the risk of a heavy criminal penalty. In this connection, the Court finds it noteworthy that A.V.O.\u2019s involvement in the events was considered sufficiently significant by the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court, who mentioned him in both the bill of indictment of 21\u00a0June 2001 and his written opinion of 9 April 2002 (see paragraphs\u00a015 and\u00a019 above). Having regard to the prosecution\u2019s recognition of the relevance of that witness (see, mutatis mutandis, Pello v. Estonia, no.\u00a011423/03, \u00a7 33, 12 April 2007, where the relevance of the evidence concerned for the establishment of the truth had been recognised both in the bill of indictment and by the County Court), the Court considers that the State Security Court should have evaluated the applicant\u2019s request to have A.V.O. heard by addressing the potential effects of his testimony and should have given reasons for its exclusion. However, it failed to do so and simply rejected the applicant\u2019s request by indicating that the examination of the witnesses called by him would have no effect on the outcome of the proceedings (see paragraph 21 above). The applicant\u2019s arguments in that regard were not taken into account by the Court of Cassation either.",
