In practice, the list of property that could not be confiscated was determined by applying, by analogy, the list of property that could not be subject to seizure. The Constitutional Court pointed out that seizure of property and confiscation had different purposes, and besides, the list of properties not subject to seizure had changed over time, for example, by excluding the person\u2019s home. It also pointed to some other shortcomings in the domestic regulation, such as uncertainty as to whether the property that had to be confiscated was supposed to be determined with reference to the time of commission of the crime, the initiation or completion of the criminal proceedings, or the enforcement of the penalty. Accordingly, the Constitutional Court drew the Parliament\u2019s attention to the fact that there were \u201cserious deficiencies\u201d in the legal regulation for imposing and executing the confiscation of property penalty.",

Instead, enforcement was based on the investigator\u2019s decision to impose a restriction on property. Furthermore, the Government did not specify whether the trial courts had the competence to assess the proportionality of such a sanction. While the wording of the domestic law appeared to allow the property confiscation to be directed at a part of the convicted person\u2019s property (see paragraph 33 above), the Court points to the findings of the Constitutional Court, which concluded that there was uncertainty and divergent case-law concerning the trial court\u2019s ability to determine the extent of the property confiscation. In particular, the trial courts frequently considered that their competence was limited to ordering confiscation of the entirety of the person\u2019s property and had proceeded to do so even when the result could have been considered disproportionate (see paragraph 20 above).",

It may also seriously impede a person\u2019s ability to present his or her case effectively before the court. With regard to the compulsory nature of the punishment, the Court has previously held that a mandatory confiscation of property deprived the applicants concerned of any possibility to argue their cases and of any prospects of success (see Andonoski, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-38, and G.I.E.M. S.R.L. and Others, \u00a7\u00a0303, both cited above; and compare Denisova and Moiseyeva v. Russia, no. 16903/03, \u00a7\u00a7 61-64, 1\u00a0April 2010). Furthermore, the exact scope of the punishment being determined at the pre-trial stage of proceedings, by a decision that is designed to serve a different purpose, as argued by the Government (see paragraph 58 above), cannot be regarded as affording the individual a reasonable opportunity of putting his or her case to the competent authorities.",

In the judgments convicting the applicant, the proportionality analysis only concerned the deprivation of his liberty and did not address the ancillary punishment of property confiscation (see paragraphs 7-8 above). The courts never specified the particular property that was to be confiscated and hence the extent of the punishment was not identified in the domestic judgments. Neither the question of whether the amount of property to be confiscated corresponded to the gravity of the offence, nor whether that imposed an excessive burden on the applicant was ever analysed. Accordingly, the Court considers that the above-mentioned legislative deficiencies limited the scope of the review carried out by the domestic courts to the extent that it was too narrow to satisfy the requirement of a \u201cfair balance\u201d inherent in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and therefore did not afford the applicant a reasonable opportunity of putting his case before the competent authorities (compare Paulet v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a06219/08, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68, 13 May 2014).",
