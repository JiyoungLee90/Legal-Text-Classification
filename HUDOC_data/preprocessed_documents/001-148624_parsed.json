A judicial order had been required only if detention \u201cpending trial\u201d exceeded six months. The Constitutional Court had subsequently condemned that practice as unconstitutional, finding that it was contrary to Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Yudayev v. Russia, no. 40258/03, \u00a7\u00a056, 15 January 2009).
