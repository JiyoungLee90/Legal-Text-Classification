Ireland, no. 15404/89, Commission decision of 16 April 1991, Decisions and Reports (DR) 70, p.\u00a0262, and Brind and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 18714/91, Commission decision of 9 May 1994, DR 77-A, p. 42). However, the present case is distinguishable from the aforementioned applications, which concerned restrictions on broadcasting media, whose impact is often far more immediate and powerful than that of the press. In addition, the regulations examined by the Commission described in considerable detail the type of programme to which the ban applied (interviews with the spokespersons of certain organisations). Lastly, the decisions imposing the bans had been subjected to judicial scrutiny.",

The Court considers that the political tension caused by terrorist acts in the region concerned at the material time is a factor to be taken into account (see, mutatis mutandis, Piermont v. France, judgment of 27\u00a0April 1995, Series A no. 314, p. 26, \u00a7 77). While it is certainly possible that the articles that led to the seizure of the newspapers would have exacerbated an already tense situation, the decision to impose the ban contained no reasons and made no reference to the seizure warrants issued by the judges in Istanbul. In addition, the ban was not a preventive measure taken as a result of the seizures to which the Government refer, since the seizure of a publication as a preventive measure may only be ordered by a judge in criminal proceedings of a different kind to those which were brought in the present case. Accordingly, in the absence of detailed reasoning accompanied by proper judicial scrutiny, the decision to implement such a measure lays itself open to various interpretations. Thus, the ban could be perceived by the applicants as a response to heavy criticism in \u00dclkede G\u00fcndem of the security forces' operations in the region.",

In view of their passive role as recipients of information, citizens must be permitted to receive a variety of messages, to choose between them and reach their own opinions on the various views expressed, for what sets democratic society apart is this plurality of ideas and information.",

In addition, the successor publications to \u00dclkede G\u00fcndem, and various other publications, were unable to escape the same fate (see paragraphs 22-23 above). Lastly, since there is no right to seek judicial review in the administrative courts, such measures can only be lifted by a unilateral discretionary act on the part of the governor of the state of emergency region.",
