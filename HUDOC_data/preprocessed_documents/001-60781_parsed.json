The mother suffered from bad health and it was noted in 1973 that when she had a broken arm she always kept one of the children off school (presumably to help in the home) and was likely to be summoned before the Education Sub-Committee. Problems with rent and electricity arrears were noted as recurring through 1975 and 1976, as well as continuing health difficulties suffered by the mother. An entry on August 1976 noted that the eight children were all happy though overcrowded and that there were no behavioural problems. ",

The home was adequately furnished and maintained to a reasonable standard. The mother was described as a caring woman who did not enjoy good health but who put her childrens\u2019 interests first. The family was considered as appearing a happy well-adjusted group though they were well known to the social services as they had been given assistance from time to time. The children attended school regularly and appeared happily settled. W.H. was recorded as admitting the offence and as being more than ashamed of his conduct, though he could offer no explanation for these actions. It was noted that he did not appear to realise fully the serious nature of these charges. Since the alleged offence he had obtained accommodation outside the applicants\u2019 home - it indicated an address in the same apartment block. It was further noted that the mother was not prepared to accept the charges relating to this man and stated that they had plans to marry in the Spring as they had had a close relationship for many years. It was concluded that, in view of the serious nature of the offences, it would be necessary for firm control to be exercised over the accused for a period of time. ",

In his later affidavit, he stated that this entry was based on information from the mother. Entries indicated concerns about school attendance and that the mother had been repeatedly told that she should not keep the girls off school. In September 1977, it was noted that the school had expressed concerns about the welfare of T., the fourth applicant, which was attended to by a senior social worker. A school meeting concerning the children\u2019s attendance was arranged but the mother and H., the second applicant, failed to attend. In November 1997, the social worker paid an unexpected visit to the home and found that W.H. was there. Both he and the mother denied that he was living there. ",

Soon after, he began coming into her room at night and doing things to her, requiring her to masturbate him. If she cried, he would punch her in the face. From the age of 12, he used to make the girls have a bath together and would touch them all over their bodies, inserting his finger into them. Often he would keep her off school and would abuse her sexually. He assaulted her often, coming up behind her to hit her on the back of the head. He also used to stand on her naked feet with his shoes on and twist, pinch her with his nails and punch her. This physical abuse happened on a daily basis. He would also get her and the others to strip to the waist and hit each other with dog chains. This conduct continued regularly until she left home on her 17th birthday (19\u00a0October 1977). She recalled going to the social services when she was aged 14 and telling them that W.H. was living with them when he was not supposed to. Nothing happened as a result.

Hardly a day went past when he did not do something of a sexual nature to her (e.g. touching her breasts or private parts) or batter her. When she was older, he made her touch him on his private parts and perform oral sex. He made her and the other children hit each other with chains and whips and would sometimes join in. She was often left with bad bruises and a bleeding nose. From the age of 11 or 12, he had sexual intercourse with her several times. When she ran away in January 1977, she told the police and he was arrested. However, he returned home and started interfering with her again, having intercourse with her and punching or kicking her if she refused. She ran away again in Spring 1977 and was put into a home, first in Dumfries, then Annan and finally Closeburn, which she eventually left in 1979 when she was 16. At that point, she did not return home but went to stay with her sister and then embarked in a series of relationships. When she visited her mother on 1 January 1980, W.H. put his hands up her skirt but let her go when she threatened to tell her boyfriend. On another occasion in 1981, W.H. tried to fondle her but she got up and left. She had never been able to tell anyone about these things as she was scared of him and thought that he would severely assault her.

When she was 9, she remembered him making her touch him and masturbate him. She had to do that to him two or three times a week when he came home from work. He then started keeping her off school and would lie down on the bed naked, making her take her clothes off and masturbate him. This occurred two or three times a week. When she was 10 or 11, he began to touch her breasts and rub his penis over her until he ejaculated. When she was 14, he forced her to have sexual intercourse with him.

He may warn the probationer about the conduct if he considers a warning is likely to alter the probationer\u2019s behaviour. If he reports the matter to the court, the court then investigates the matter.

As the second applicant H.\u2019s allegations referred most vividly to ill-treatment at an early age, only mentioning in sweeping terms alleged continuation of abuse after the first conviction in 1977, his statements in their view did not provide an adequate basis for making specific findings about ill-treatment after 7 January 1977. The Government also pointed to the evidential difficulties arising from the allegations which concerned events occurring more than 20 years ago and the incomplete evidence which was available.

Although Mr R. had a suspicion that the mother was still cohabiting with W.H., he had visited the house very frequently without seeing W.H. and, in the view of the social work consultant Ms Anne Black, given the low level of awareness about child sexual abuse at the time, she would not have expected him to pursue his suspicions further. None of the applicants, when seen by the social workers or interviewed for various purposes, gave any hint that W.H. was still living in their home or continuing to abuse them. Though the social worker Mr M. recalled that he found W.H. leaving the home on two to three occasions, the notes indicated that the mother and W.H. both denied that he was living there, and he took the view that W.H.\u2019s visits during the day while the children were at school was not tantamount to living there and did not constitute sufficient evidence of a breach of his probation to justify further action.

Bedfordshire County Council there have been further cases in the English courts which indicate that a duty of care may arise where, for example, the social services have failed to prevent foreseeable damage to children either already in their care or affected in other ways by their exercise of their duties (see paragraph\u00a073). However, these developments took place some years after the X. and Others case, which at the time gave the impression that the highest judicial authority had ruled out the possibility of suing local authorities in the exercise of their child protection functions on grounds of public policy. If taking action at the present time, the applicants might, at least on arguable grounds, have a claim to a duty of care under domestic law, reinforced by the ability under the Human Rights Act to rely directly on the provisions of the Convention. The Court is not satisfied that this was the case at the relevant time in 1996. While the Government have also made reference to the possibility of judicial review proceedings, these would only have been available to challenge the social services\u2019 actions at the time that they occurred. The applicant children were not in a position where they could make use of such redress.",

The Court also considers that it must have regard to the fact that, though the local authority did fail to take reasonable steps to avoid the risk, this is not a case where those failings can be regarded as being causally connected with the totality of any damage suffered during that period. If the local authority had acted with more care in monitoring and supervising the family, though this would have increased the likelihood of uncovering the ongoing abuse, it can only be speculative as to at what stage this would have occurred and how effective the measures taken would have been.",
