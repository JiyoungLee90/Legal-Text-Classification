It might also be said that the law might be changed in order to allow the samples to be used for purposes other than those identified by the section. It might also be said that while samples are retained there is even now a risk that they will be used in a way that the law does not allow. So, it is said, the aims could be achieved in a less restrictive manner ... Why cannot the aim be achieved by retention of the profiles without retention of the samples?",

It is these benefits which must be balanced against the risks identified by . In relation to those risks, the position in any event is first that any change in the law will have to be itself Convention compliant; second any change in practice would have to be Convention compliant; and third unlawfulness must not be assumed. In my view thus the risks identified are not great, and such as they are they are outweighed by the benefits in achieving the aim of prosecuting and preventing crime.\u201d",

In two cases, compelling DNA evidence linking one suspect to a rape and another to a murder had not been able to be used, as at the time the matches were made both defendants had either been acquitted or a decision made not to proceed for the offences for which the profiles had been obtained: as a result it had not been possible to convict either suspect.",

The sample from \u201cI\u201d should have been destroyed, but had not been. \u201cI\u201d had pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced.

On the basis of the existing records, the Home Office statistics estimated that there was a 40% chance that a crime-scene sample would be matched immediately with an individual\u2019s profile on the national database.

Lord Steyn saw five factors which led to the conclusion that the interference was proportionate to the aim: (i) the fingerprints and samples were kept only for the limited purpose of the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime; (ii) the fingerprints and samples were not of any use without a comparator fingerprint or sample from the crime scene; (iii) the fingerprints would not be made public; (iv) a person was not identifiable from the retained material to the untutored eye; (v) the resultant expansion of the national database by the retention conferred enormous advantages in the fight against serious crime.",

Lord Steyn held that, even assuming that the retention of fingerprints and samples fell within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention so as to trigger the application of Article 14, the difference of treatment relied on by the applicants was not one based on \u201cstatus\u201d for the purposes of Article 14: the difference simply reflected the historical fact, unrelated to any personal characteristic, that the authorities already held the fingerprints and samples of the individuals concerned which had been lawfully taken. The applicants and their suggested comparators could not in any event be said to be in an analogous situation. Even if, contrary to his view, it was necessary to consider the justification for any difference in treatment, Lord Steyn held that such objective justification had been established: firstly, the element of legitimate aim was plainly present, as the increase in the database of fingerprints and samples promoted the public interest by the detection and prosecution of serious crime and by exculpating the innocent; secondly, the requirement of proportionality was satisfied, section 64(1A) of PACE objectively representing a measured and proportionate response to the legislative aim of dealing with serious crime.",

It can therefore embrace multiple aspects of the person\u2019s physical and social identity (see Mikuli\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 53176/99, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2002-I). Elements such as, for example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8 (see, among other authorities, Bensaid v. the United Kingdom, no. 44599/98, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001I with further references, and Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2003I). Beyond a person\u2019s name, his or her private and family life may include other means of personal identification and of linking to a family (see, mutatis mutandis, Burghartz v. Switzerland, 22 February 1994, \u00a7 24, Series A no. 280B, and \u00dcnal Tekeli v. Turkey, no. 29865/96, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2004X). Information about the person\u2019s health is an important element of private life (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, \u00a7 71, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I). The Court furthermore considers that an individual\u2019s ethnic identity must be regarded as another such element (see, in particular, Article 6 of the Data Protection Convention quoted in paragraph 41 above, which lists personal data revealing racial origin as a special category of data along with other sensitive information about an individual). Article 8 protects, in addition, a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see, for example, Burghartz, cited above, opinion of the Commission, p. 37, \u00a7\u00a047, and Friedl v. Austria, 31 January 1995, Series A no. 305-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 20, \u00a7 45). The concept of private life moreover includes elements relating to a person\u2019s right to their image (see Sciacca v. Italy, no.\u00a050774/99, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2005-I).",

They also accepted the highly sensitive nature of such searching and the need for very strict controls in this respect. In the Court\u2019s view, the DNA profiles\u2019 capacity to provide a means of identifying genetic relationships between individuals (see paragraph 39 above) is in itself sufficient to conclude that their retention interferes with the right to the private life of the individuals concerned. The frequency of familial searches, the safeguards attached thereto and the likelihood of detriment in a particular case are immaterial in this respect (see Amann, cited above, \u00a7 69).

The possibility the DNA profiles create for inferences to be drawn as to ethnic origin makes their retention all the more sensitive and susceptible of affecting the right to private life.

The need for such safeguards is all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned, not least when such data are used for police purposes.

The domestic law must also afford adequate guarantees that retained personal data were efficiently protected from misuse and abuse (see notably Article 7 of the Data Protection Convention). The above considerations are especially valid as regards the protection of special categories of more sensitive data (see Article 6 of the Data Protection Convention) and more particularly of DNA information, which contains the person\u2019s genetic make-up of great importance to both the person concerned and his or her family (see Recommendation No. R (92) 1 of the Committee of Ministers on the use of analysis of DNA within the framework of the criminal justice system).",

In this respect, the Court must bear in mind that the right of every person under the Convention to be presumed innocent includes the general rule that no suspicion regarding an accused\u2019s innocence may be voiced after his acquittal (see Rushiti v. Austria, no. 28389/95, \u00a7 31, 21 March 2000, with further references). It is true that the retention of the applicants\u2019 private data cannot be equated with the voicing of suspicions. Nonetheless, their perception that they are not being treated as innocent is heightened by the fact that their data are retained indefinitely in the same way as the data of convicted persons, while the data of those who have never been suspected of an offence are required to be destroyed.",

The Court, however, finds this argument difficult to reconcile with the obligation imposed by section 64(3) of PACE to destroy the fingerprints and samples of volunteers at their request, despite the similar value of the material in increasing the size and utility of the database. Weighty reasons would have to be put forward by the Government before the Court could regard as justified such a difference in treatment of the applicants\u2019 private data compared to that of other unconvicted people.",

The Court has already emphasised, drawing on the provisions of Article 40 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989, the special position of minors in the criminal-justice sphere and has noted, in particular, the need for the protection of their privacy at criminal trials (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, \u00a7\u00a7 75 and 85, 16 December 1999). In the same way, the Court considers that particular attention should be paid to the protection of juveniles from any detriment that may result from the retention by the authorities of their private data following acquittals of a criminal offence. The Court shares the view of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics as to the impact on young persons of the indefinite retention of their DNA material and notes the Council\u2019s concerns that the policies applied have led to the over-representation in the database of young persons and ethnic minorities who have not been convicted of any crime (see paragraphs 38-40 above).",

Accordingly, the retention at issue constitutes a disproportionate interference with the applicants\u2019 right to respect for private life and cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society. This conclusion obviates the need for the Court to consider the applicants\u2019 criticism regarding the adequacy of certain particular safeguards, such as too broad an access to the personal data concerned and insufficient protection against the misuse or abuse of such data.",

For the reasons set out in their submissions under Article 8, there was no reasonable or objective justification for the treatment, nor any legitimate aim or reasonable relationship of proportionality to the purported aim of crime prevention, in particular as regards the samples which played no role in crime detection or prevention.
