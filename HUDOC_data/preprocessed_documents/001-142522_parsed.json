In the Court\u2019s view, the interference in question constitutes an individual and excessive burden on the applicant (see Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth, cited above, \u00a7 73). Such a burden could have been eased only if in 2013 the applicant had been able to obtain her pension as of the date of her initial request, namely November 2000.
