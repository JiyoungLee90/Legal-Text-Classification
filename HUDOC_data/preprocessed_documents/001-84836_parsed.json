The Government maintained that legal-assistance agreements signed by Mrs Moskalenko and Mrs\u00a0Arutyunyan were void because they contradicted the imperative provision of the Civil Code prohibiting an agent from making a private profit from the agency relationship. The Government expressed doubt that the applicant was aware of his obligation to disburse a considerable amount of money to his representatives. They insisted that the sole purpose of their inquiries had been to obtain an official opinion from the competent national authorities as to the validity of the legal-assistance agreement with Mrs Moskalenko. They denied that the Representative had attempted to initiate an investigation, because neither the Representative nor the authorities he had contacted had the right to institute criminal proceedings.",

The Government had not explained the purpose of these inquiries, given that they had obviously encroached on lawyer-client privilege. Furthermore, Mr\u00a0Laptev\u2019s request had contained factually untrue information, such as the allegation that the applicant had not been aware of the legal-assistance agreements with his lawyers. The applicant also pointed out that in December 2005 and February 2006 State officials had compelled him to give statements concerning his relationship with his representatives before the Court.

The expression \u201cany form of pressure\u201d must be taken to cover not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation of applicants or their legal representatives but also other improper indirect acts or contacts designed to dissuade or discourage them from pursuing a Convention remedy (see Kurt v.

The request contained the assertion that Mrs Moskalenko had imposed a financial obligation on the applicant without his knowledge (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). In fulfilment of the above request the police officers required the director of Mrs Moskalenko\u2019s office and subsequently Mrs Moskalenko herself to produce documents concerning her legal relationship with the applicant. They also visited the applicant in prison and attempted to compel him to give a written statement about his contacts with Mrs Moskalenko. The Federal Registration Service, for its part, determined that the legal-assistance agreement between the applicant and Mrs Moskalenko had been in breach of the Civil Code and the Advocates Act and requested the President of the Moscow City Bar to take measures against Mrs Moskalenko and to report back.",

If the Government had reason to believe that in a particular case the right of individual petition had been abused, the appropriate course of action was for that Government to alert the Court and to inform it of its misgivings (ibid.). The Russian Government, however, did not confine themselves to mentioning the alleged invalidity of legal-assistance agreements in their comments on the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction but, following the submission of their comments, they asked two domestic authorities to carry out certain inquiries into the applicant\u2019s arrangements with his representative Mrs Moskalenko.",

Furthermore, given that the jurisdiction of the Economic Security Department only extended to inter-regional or international tax and economic crimes or highly publicised criminal offences (see paragraph 38 above), apparently the Department was not competent to carry out such an inquiry but nevertheless did so on obviously spurious legal grounds. In any event, the Court sees no plausible reason as to why, in the absence of any apparent indication of a criminal offence or criminal-law complaint, any inquiry should have been conducted by the police (compare Ergi, \u00a7 105, and Fedotova, \u00a7\u00a050, both cited above).
