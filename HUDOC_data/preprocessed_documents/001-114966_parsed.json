He applied for asylum and submitted that in his home country he had been a deacon in the Orthodox Coptic church. In 2005 he had been called upon to be an observer in the national elections. Serving in this capacity, he had witnessed many wrongdoings by officials. The personal integrity and freedom of election of voters had been violated. Due to this, the applicant had refused to sign a statement asserting that the election procedure had been carried out correctly. Subsequently he had received several death threats. In connection with a sermon on 12 June 2005 he had been severely beaten outside the church by two unknown men. He had lost a tooth and had been cut on the hand. In September 2005 he had attended a traditional Christian feast. There he had been pursued and arrested by two policemen who had taken him to a police station in . He had been accused of activities against the regime and had been incarcerated for three months and eleven days, during which time he had been tortured. On 20 January 2006, after being released, he had participated in a demonstration against the election results. He had again been taken into custody by two unknown men and taken to the Kaliti prison in . There, he had been kept without criminal charges or a trial and had been tortured through violence with fists and truncheons, cut with sharp objects, chained and blind-folded, forced to hear other inmates being tortured, forced to crawl on his knees on sharp rocks and have his head shaved with broken bottle glass. The detention had lasted for five months. During his time in the prison, he had preached to his fellow inmates. He had told his story to one of the military prison guards, who had then helped him to escape. He had hidden from the authorities by travelling between Christian holy places where he had preached. A group of pilgrims had helped him and had paid him to travel with them and preach to them. On 8 May 2007, the pilgrims had informed him that they had decided to help him flee the country. They had arranged for his travel to , where he had had to wait for a while. A smuggler had then helped him to reach , via an unknown European country.",

He had had thoughts of being better off dead, but had not seemed to consider suicide as an option and had claimed to leave himself in the hands of God. He had tried to cure his depression with holy water and by staying in a monastery. During the examination the applicant had been very formal and had given clear and distinct answers to all the questions. However, he had given an emotionally detached impression and had seemed to have an intellectual and distant attitude towards the story he told. There had been no signs of psychosis. He had seemed rigid in his personality and had had difficulties in adjusting his mind-set and the topics discussed to the limited time of the examination. The risk of suicide had been hard to assess. The applicant had expressed a clear will to die, but had seemed to have religious doubts about actually committing suicide and would therefore deny any such plans. The assessment was that he was probably suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and that his depression was a result of this.",

Moreover, it stated that the arrest order submitted by the applicant was very simplistic in nature and hence had little evidential value. Regarding the medical certificate, the court found that it confirmed that the applicant was suffering from PTSD and that he had scars, but that it could not confirm how his injuries had occurred. The court further stated that the applicant\u2019s submissions had been vague and had escalated during the proceedings. The applicant had submitted for the first time at the oral hearing, among other things, that he had been suspected of being a spy. Moreover, it found peculiar his explanations as to how he had escaped from prison and how he had received information on being wanted by the Ethiopian authorities. The court thus found that the credibility of the applicant\u2019s submissions was weak. It also added that the incidents described by the applicant had happened several years earlier, that he had not been politically active and that he had not had any problems prior to the 2005 elections. Moreover the court stated that the political situation in  had calmed down since then and that the applicant\u2019s submissions did not substantiate that he would risk being subjected to persecution to such an extent that he should be perceived as a refugee. Nor did they substantiate that he would be at risk of being subjected to degrading or inhuman treatment if he were to return. He was therefore not considered to have other needs for protection.",

However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v.

These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (H.L.R. v. France, judgment of 29 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, \u00a7 40).",

As a general principle, a respondent State\u2019s responsibility may be engaged where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if deported, faces a real risk to being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In such a case, Article 3 imposes an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country. (see Saadi v.  (dec.) GC no. 37201/06, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2008-... ). As such, the Court\u2019s focus in assessing such a risk is \u2018future\u2019 orientated; but does the fact that an applicant has already been tortured in the past have any bearing upon the Court\u2019s assessment of a future risk if he or she is deported to a third country? To my mind, it does. It constitutes a factor to which particular weight should be given and it leads to a reversal of the general onus of proof in Article 3 claims (R.C. v. , no. 41827/07, \u00a7 55, 9\u00a0March 2010).",

The evidence was that he had, probably, been tortured in the past in that his body bore scars which substantiated his claim. Being aware of reports of serious human rights violations in , the Court did not find them to be of such a nature as to show that, on their own, there would be a violation of the Convention if the applicant were to be returned thereto.

However, instead of reversing the onus of proof at this point by requiring the respondent State to \u2018dispel any doubts\u2019 about the risk of the applicant being subjected again to ill treatment, it reverts its focus to comparatively minor \u2018credibility\u2019 issues and concludes that the onus remains with the applicant and that he has failed to make it plausible that he would face a risk of ill treatment if deported to Ethiopia.

Objectively, there are independent reports of \u2018serious human rights violations in Ethiopia\u2019, a fact which the majority acknowledges (\u00a739). Subjectively, the applicant\u2019s account of severe beatings with fists and truncheons, of cuts with sharp objects, of being enchained and blindfolded, of being forced to listen to others being tortured, of being forced to crawl over sharp rocks and of having his head shaved with broken glass\u2014are corroborated in two respects. Firstly, he bears \u201ca rather large number of scars on different parts of the body\u201d which are consistent with the applicant\u2019s statements and have been assessed as such by an expert in forensic medicine (\u00a712). Secondly, his presentation upon independent assessment led to the conclusion that he has undergone trauma in the past and that he now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression (\u00a7 11). This evidence, including the independent forensic evidence, has not been contradicted or rebutted by the Government. To expect of an applicant who has already been tortured to prove that he will not be tortured again if deported is, to my mind, to take a step too far. The case law is clear. In such circumstances, the onus of proof shifts to the deporting State to adduce convincing evidence that such an individual will not be subjected, once again, to such treatment.",
