According to the expert, for the properties under categories (a) and (b), the ground rent was a percentage of 4 to 6 percent of the market value of the properties, while for agricultural land, in 1974, the rent was between CYP 2 and 35 per decare per annum. In particular, in 1974 the applicant\u2019s house in Kyrenia had an approximate market value of CYP 20,000 (approximately EUR 34,172), which meant an annual rent of CYP 800 (approximately EUR\u00a01,366). The applicant\u2019s fields had, in 1974, an approximate total market value of CYP\u00a017,152 (approximately EUR\u00a029,305) and a total annual rent of CYP 1,039 (approximately EUR\u00a01,775) could have been obtained from them. The expert took into account the nature of the area under study and the trends in rent increase (an average of 12% per annum for ground rents, 7% per annum for dry agricultural properties and 5% per annum for gardens and houses).
