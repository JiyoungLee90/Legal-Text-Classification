This lack of clarity further originated from the fact that in the 1970s and 1980s seven flats in the building were sold to their tenants who had thereby acquired shares in the right to perpetual use of the plot. Under domestic law they therefore became entitled to give their consent to the administrative division of the property, sought by the applicant. As some of them refused to give such consent, the case had to be brought to a civil court, competent to deal with this issue in contentious proceedings. Moreover, another set of inheritance proceedings relating to the estate of one of the legal predecessors of the holders of the right to perpetual use rendered the proceedings even more complex.

The Mayor has been ordered on two occasions to issue a decision in the applicant\u2019s case and given time-limits therefor (\u00a7\u00a7 23 and 38 above). The Court notes that none of those orders was complied with. Further, there were ten months of a near total inactivity between November 1995 when the case was lodged with the Warsaw Municipal Office and September 1996 when the next steps were taken in the proceedings (\u00a7\u00a7 16-18 above). The Court further notes that it was only after one year from November 1995 that this Office requested a town-planning authority to submit a town-planning scheme relevant for the case. Likewise, a basic legal analysis of the issues involved in the case was made one year later (\u00a7 20 above). Subsequently, it took the Office two years to request a competent authority to prepare a so-called \u2018map of legal status\u2019 of the plot (\u00a7 30 above). The Office further needed two years and six months to realise that there was no mandatory \u2018anti-fire wall\u2019 on the property and to require that an expert opinion be prepared as to whether such a wall was indeed mandatory. The applicant\u2019s appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court against a decision of 10 July 2000 waited for its turn to be examined by that Court for one year and six months (\u00a7\u00a7 39-41 above).
