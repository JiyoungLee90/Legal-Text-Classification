It was impossible to take a shower as inmates were afforded only fifteen minutes and two to three men had to use one shower head at the same time. Inmates had to wash and dry their laundry indoors, creating excessive humidity in the cells. Inmates were also allowed to smoke in the cells. The lavatory pan was separated from the living area by a partition affording no privacy to inmates. No toiletries were provided. The food was of poor quality and in scarce supply. The applicant further argued that he had not been adequately treated after he had been discovered to be suffering from skin diseases. His skin condition deteriorated so severely that he was transferred to the prison hospital. Following several complaints to various officials, the applicant started to receive treatment.

In this respect, assuming that the facility\u2019s registration logs had been destroyed, the Court considers it extraordinary that in June 2006, that is more than three years after the applicant\u2019s detention in that facility had come to an end, the director was able to recollect the exact number of inmates who had been detained together with the applicant. The director\u2019s certificates are therefore of little evidential value for the Court. However, if the registration logs still exist, the Court finds it peculiar that the Government preferred to rely on the director\u2019s certificates to support their allegations concerning the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention when it was open to them to submit copies of registration logs showing the names of inmates detained with the applicant.",

They were removed some time towards the end of 2002, that is more than seven months after the applicant\u2019s detention in that facility had begun. In addition, the Court observes that the applicant was diagnosed with a serious skin disease in the facility and that it appears most likely that he was infected while in detention. Although this fact in itself does not imply a violation of Article 3 given, in particular, the fact that the applicant received treatment (see Alver v. , no.\u00a064812/01, \u00a7\u00a054, 8 November 2005, and Igor Ivanov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040) and that he fully recovered, the Court considers that these aspects, while not in themselves capable of justifying the notion of \u201cdegrading\u201d treatment, are relevant in addition to the focal factor of the severe overcrowding, to show that the applicant\u2019s detention conditions went beyond the threshold tolerated by Article 3 of the Convention (see Novoselov v. , no.\u00a066460/01, \u00a7\u00a044, 2 June 2005).",

The Court also reiterates its finding made in the context of a complaint under Article 13 of the Convention that in Russia there have been no domestic remedies whereby an applicant could enforce his or her right to a \u201chearing within a reasonable time\u201d (see Sidorenko v. , no. 4459/03, \u00a7\u00a039, 8\u00a0March 2007, and Klyakhin v. , no.\u00a046082/99, \u00a7\u00a7 101-102, 30 November 2004). The Court sees no reason to depart from that finding in the present case and therefore considers that this complaint cannot be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies.",

The Court considers these reasons to be regrettably laconic. It would have been preferable to have expanded this element to explain in more detail why the City Court was worried about the vulnerability of certain victims and witnesses or whether and why it was concerned that witnesses and victims could have been deterred. It was also important to explain why the concern for the safety of victims and witnesses outweighed the importance of ensuring the publicity of the trial. Moreover, if the trial court had indeed taken into account certain information, this should have been presented to the parties, in particular the applicant, so that an open discussion of the matter could have occurred (see Volkov v. , no.\u00a064056/00, \u00a7\u00a031, 4\u00a0December 2007).",

The Court notes that the Government submitted no documents to show what information had served as a basis for the City Court\u2019s decision. Furthermore, as can be seen from the court hearing record, the need to guarantee the victims\u2019 and witnesses\u2019 safety was not even mentioned by the prosecutor in his objection to the applicant\u2019s request to open the trial to the public (see paragraph 22 above). It appears that the Moscow City Court concluded that there was a risk to the victims\u2019 and witnesses\u2019 safety merely on the ground of the gravity of the charges against the defendants. In this respect, the Court notes that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify the restriction of such a fundamental tenet of judicial proceedings as their openness to the public. This is particularly true in cases such as the present one where the legal characterisation of the facts was determined by the prosecution without judicial examination of the issue whether the evidence that had been obtained supported a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the alleged offence. The Court observes that a danger which defendants may present to other parties to the proceedings cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the gravity of the charges and severity of the sentence faced. It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may confirm the existence of a danger justifying the denial of public access to a trial. In the present case the decisions of the domestic courts gave no reasons why they considered the risk to the victims\u2019 and witnesses\u2019 safety to be decisive. Consequently, the Court finds that dispensing with a public hearing was not justified in the circumstances of the present case.",

Russia (no. 64056/00, 4 December 2007) where the Court did not find a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (the widow of one of the applicant\u2019s purported victims had requested in camera proceedings before the Omsk Regional Court because she feared the defendant\u2019s friends and their threats), the Moscow City Court did not enlarge upon the problem of \u201cguarantee[ing] the security of the victims, witnesses and other parties to the proceedings\u201d (see paragraph 22). Thus the necessity of in camera hearings in the present case remains unclear for me. In my humble opinion, the respondent Government could have clarified this point in their response to the Court\u2019s question \u201cWas the exclusion of the public in the present case \u2018strictly necessary\u2019 for one of the purposes within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention?\u201d.",
