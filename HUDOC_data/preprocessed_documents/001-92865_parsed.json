The impugned article was interpreted as alleging that Mrs Klestil-L\u00f6ffler intended to divorce, and that she had close contacts with two men. The latter implied, according to the courts\u2019 expressed opinion, that Mrs Klestil-L\u00f6ffler had committed no less than double adultery and that Mr Klestil was put in the position of a deceived husband. In dismissing the applicant company\u2019s argument that the article was related to public life, the courts distinguished between a politician\u2019s alleged marital problems and his state of health, because in their view only the latter could have a bearing on his public functions.",

While the article did not concern a political debate, it can nevertheless be said to have contributed to an issue of general interest, namely certain attitudes of society towards the presidential couple (see, mutatis mutandis, Nikowitz and Verlagsgruppe News GmbH v. Austria, no.\u00a06266/03, \u00a7 25, 22 February 2007, which concerned a satirical article on society\u2019s attitudes towards a sports star).

Being in the position of head of state, it is a matter of fact that many people are interested in the president\u2019s private life, though admittedly for various reasons, spanning from concern about the president\u2019s well-being to mere curiosity. Moreover, the fact that the presidential couple had kept the public informed about the first applicant\u2019s divorce and his remarriage to the second applicant indicates that the claimants themselves were aware of the public interest in such matters. In these circumstances it is important that the Court does not take a paternalistic view, and try to decide for people what the true meaning of public interest is. In my view, there can be no doubt that the impugned article concerned a matter which was of legitimate interest among many people, and notably not the everyday life of a person who has not sought publicity (see, a contrario, Von Hannover, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 62 and 64).",

It appears from the article that Mr Klestil himself had made a statement in the periodical News, in which he apparently commented on the rumours of a possible divorce, calling them completely unfounded. However, because the domestic courts had found that there was no direct link with the public life within the meaning of section 7 of the Media Act, the proof of truth in respect of the existence of the rumours reported was not available to the applicant company.",

The text itself did not pretend to relate to any established facts. It reported, in a somewhat humorous way, on rumours about the Federal President\u2019s marriage, and without using any insulting or abusive language (see, a contrario, Tammer, cited above, \u00a7 67). While it did not take a stance on the rumours concerning a possible break-up of the Federal President\u2019s marriage, it distanced itself from allegations that Ms Klestil-L\u00f6ffler had \u201cclose relationships\u201d with two other men, by explaining that there were professional reasons for her being well acquainted with the two men concerned which should arouse no suspicion whatever.",
