The Court has repeatedly pointed out that such documents drafted after a considerable period of time were apparently based on personal recollections and could not be viewed as sufficiently reliable sources, given the length of time that has elapsed (see, among other authorities, Veliyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a024202/05, \u00a7\u00a0127, 24 June 2010; Belashev v. , no. 28617/03, \u00a7 52, 4 December 2008, and Igor Ivanov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a034000/02, \u00a7\u00a034, 7 June 2007). A further element undermining the reliability of these certificates is the fact that in the proceedings on application no.\u00a042239/02, Starokadomskiy v. Russia, the Government submitted to the Court a similar certificate signed by the same prison governor on 21\u00a0February 2006. It concerned the conditions of Mr\u00a0Starokadomskiy\u2019s detention in Cell 243 in the period from 11\u00a0April 2004 to 23 December 2005, that is during the time when the applicant in the instant case was held in the same cell. According to that certificate, Mr\u00a0Starokadomskiy shared the cell with three \u2013 not one \u2013 other inmates (see Starokadomskiy, cited above, \u00a7 24). The Government did not put forward any explanation for this discrepancy between the 2006 and 2011 certificates.",

However, the entries in respect of the number of detainees in Cell 243 were corrected in a visible way, with some figures having been erased and the number \u201ctwo\u201d having been written over instead. The Court requested the Government to furnish explanations about the origin, reason and timing of these corrections. The Government responded that the erasures had been the product of negligence on the part of the prison warders responsible for filling out the register. They did not indicate at what moment and for what purpose the information in the register was corrected. The Court regrets that the inquiry carried out by the Russian authorities did not elucidate these matters because this failure makes it impossible to determine whether the corrected data has any probative value. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the information contained in the copy of the prison population register produced by the Government is not sufficiently reliable to establish the facts.",
