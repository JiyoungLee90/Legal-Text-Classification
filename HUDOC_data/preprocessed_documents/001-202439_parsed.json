It noted, firstly, that in view of the general nature of the administrative offence of minor hooliganism and the severity of the potential sanctions provided for in the Decree, including deprivation of liberty, the cases concerned the examination of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d against the applicants, within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which meant also that Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 was applicable (see Kamburov, \u00a7 23, and Stanchev, \u00a7 45, with reference to further case-law). The Court found, secondly, that under domestic law as it stood before 2011 there had been no possibility to appeal against district courts\u2019 judgments under the Decree (see Kamburov, \u00a7 24). Lastly, it noted that the cases did not concern \u201coffences of a minor character\u201d within the meaning of Article 2 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7, in particular since \u201cminor\u201d hooliganism under the Decree was punishable with deprivation of liberty (see Kamburov, \u00a7\u00a7 25-26, Stanchev, \u00a7\u00a7 47-48, and Zhelyazkov, \u00a7\u00a7 43-44).",

Once again however, the Court cannot accept this as an indication of a sufficiently established practice. Those courts themselves admitted that at the time the practice was inconsistent (see paragraph 22 above in fine).
