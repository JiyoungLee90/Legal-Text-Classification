The Code of Commercial Procedure granted the power to intervene by way of supervisory review to the President and Deputy President of the Supreme Commercial Court (Articles 180 and 181 of the Code, see paragraph 25 above) in the same way as the Code of Civil Procedure gave the power to intervene in civil proceedings to the president and deputy presidents of higher courts. Neither the Code of Civil Procedure nor the Code of Commercial Procedure set any time-limit for exercise of that power, so that final judgments were liable to challenge indefinitely. It follows that the problem of legal certainty raised in the instant case is structurally identical to that which has been found by the Court to amount to a violation of the principle of legal certainty in civil proceedings (see the authorities cited above).",
