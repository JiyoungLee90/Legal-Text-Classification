The CCRC report noted that legal advice dated 9 July 1998 on the merits of an appeal made reference to the omission in the jury direction but that this issue was not pursued beyond the initial advice and was not incorporated into the applicant's grounds of appeal at that time.

Whether the direction resulted in a violation of the applicant's Article 6 rights was a question to be assessed in light of all the circumstances of the case, including the situations in which adverse inferences could be drawn, the weight attached to them and the degree of compulsion inherent in the situation (citing John Murray, cited above, \u00a7 47). The Government highlighted that the legislative scheme itself contained safeguards to prevent adverse inferences being drawn in situations where it would be unfair to the accused, pointing out in particular that no adverse inferences could be drawn where a person had not been cautioned or where a person did not later seek to rely on a fact which he might reasonably have been expected to mention during police questioning.",

However, they argued that it did not follow that the applicant's trial as a whole was unfair within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. They contended, first, that there was formidable prosecution evidence in the case, a factor which was relevant to the Court's assessment (citing John Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 52 and 54). They accepted that the evidence against the applicant was mostly circumstantial but explained that most of it was not disputed and was simply read to the court. They also highlighted that, in sentencing the applicant, the trial judge had made a number of findings as to his involvement in the conspiracy and his credibility (see paragraph 18 above). The Government, referring to the findings of the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 25 above), maintained that this was not a borderline case in which an adverse inference might have tipped the balance between a guilty and a not guilty verdict.",

In the context of the direction to the jury as a whole, and in light of the direction that the jury could not hold a lie against the applicant in considering his defence except where there was no innocent explanation for that lie, the jury could not have been in any doubt that if they had thought that the explanation advanced by the applicant was, or may have been, true, they should not draw an adverse inference against him. Accordingly, the Government concluded, there was no realistic possibility on the facts that the jury believed the applicant's story to be true but at the same time drew an adverse inference against him. They distinguished Condron and Beckles, both cited above, on the grounds that in Condron the applicants were suffering from heroin withdrawal and the concern was whether they were sufficiently lucid to understand the consequences of their silence, while in Beckles the trial judge had potentially positively undermined the value of the applicant's explanation for his silence by wrongly referring to the lack of independent evidence as to the legal advice given.",

The fact that a trial judge leaves a jury with the option of drawing an adverse inference from an accused's silence during police interview cannot of itself be considered incompatible with the requirements of a fair trial. However, as the Court has previously emphasised, the right to silence lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6 and particular caution is required before a domestic court can invoke an accused's silence against him (see Beckles, cited above, \u00a7 58; and Condron, cited above, \u00a7 56).",

In practice, adequate safeguards must be in place to ensure that any adverse inferences do not go beyond what is permitted under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

In other cases, an accused will choose not to answer questions at a police interview for a reason which is inherently linked to his substantive defence. Such cases generally arise where the accused has some reason to conceal the truth. In such cases, it is artificial to separate consideration of the substantive defence from consideration of the explanation for the accused's silence because in order to accept the plausibility of the explanation for the applicant's silence, the plausibility of the applicant's account of events from which the reason for silence stems must also be accepted.",

The judge reminded the jury members of the applicant's explanation for this refusal (see paragraph 16 above). He further reminded them that it was for the prosecution to prove its case and that the applicant was not required to prove anything (see paragraph 13 above). He concluded by advising them that if they found that the applicant could reasonably have been expected to mention during the police interviews the facts on which he later relied in court, then they could draw such inferences as appeared proper from his failure to mention the facts when interviewed. In this context, the judge emphasised that such failure could not on its own prove guilt (see paragraph\u00a017 above). However, he omitted to advise the jury members that no inferences could be drawn unless they were satisfied that the reason for the applicant's silence was that he had no answer to the questions asked or none that would stand up to cross-examination. The Court notes that the Court of Appeal accepted that, in omitting this detail, the judge's direction to the jury was deficient. However, the finding by a domestic court that a direction was deficient does not necessarily lead to a conclusion by this Court that the trial was unfair (see, for example, Wood, cited above). It is for the Court to assess whether, on the facts of the present case and in light of all the relevant circumstances, the applicant's trial was fair notwithstanding the omission in the judge's direction. In making this assessment, the Court will have regard to the overall summing up to the jury as outlined above, the effect of the omission in the judge's direction, insofar as this can be identified, and any other safeguards present to protect the applicant's right to a fair trial.",

However, as noted above (see paragraph 52), the applicant's explanation for his silence was inherently linked to his substantive defence. Accordingly, unlike in Condron, cited above, \u00a7 63, there is some indication of how the jury approached the question of the weight to be given to the applicant's silence during the police interviews. The Court of Appeal concluded that, as the jury had convicted the applicant, it had clearly rejected his defence and in doing so must also have rejected his explanation for his silence. The Court agrees that in order to consider plausible the applicant's explanation that he was afraid of incriminating others, the jury would have had to accept that the applicant's movements on certain days and at certain times, as well as his connection with certain people, was explained by his involvement in buying and selling stolen cars and not by his participation in a robbery conspiracy. It can be concluded from the fact that the jury rejected the applicant's defence that it also rejected his explanation for his silence. It is not plausible to suggest that, having accepted the applicant's explanation for his silence, wrongly-drawn adverse inferences led the jury to reject the applicant's overall defence to the robbery charges. Moreover, the jury's conclusions as to the lack of credibility of the applicant's explanation are supported by the comments of the trial judge when passing sentence on the applicant (see paragraph 18 above).",
