The Hague Convention stipulated only a maximum age requirement for children whose return could be sought under its provisions (the age of 16). It also protected (under Article 12) very young children from possible harmful effects of the return if it was shown that the parent seeking the return had not taken care of the child before the abduction or that the child had already adapted to the new environment. Following this approach, separating an abducted child from the parent who had a dominant role in the child\u2019s life would not fall within the Article 13 (b) exceptions unless objective obstacles to the parent\u2019s return could be shown to be present. This approach however, was difficult to accept in cases concerning abductions of infants by mothers because of the special relationship between them. This was true even in the absence of any objective obstacles to the mother\u2019s own return because any separation of an infant from his or her mother would inevitably be contrary to the child\u2019s best interests.",

Furthermore, the family court took account of the following elements, which were identified by the RODK experts: the boy was only an infant when he arrived in Poland; he did not have any memories of his life in Canada; the most important element in his life was his contact with his mother; since the abduction his mother had been his sole carer; the applicant contested that state of affairs as late as six months after the child\u2019s arrival in Poland.

I consider it an impossible task for the domestic courts to assess the possibility of one parent moving to a different country with the child.
