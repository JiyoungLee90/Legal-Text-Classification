Romania [Committee], no.\u00a017605/15, \u00a7\u00a070, 14 February 2017). The lawyer could have attempted to purchase food or drinks during the waiting periods when the applicant was not being interrogated (see paragraphs 13, 14 and 27 above). Nothing in the file indicates that the prosecutor would have opposed such action or would have proceeded with the questioning in the absence of the lawyer. In fact, the parties agreed that the prosecutor had waited for the applicant\u2019s lawyer to arrive before engaging with the applicant (see paragraph 12 above).",

Indeed, the context in which the measure is taken is an important factor, since situations commonly occur in modern society where the public may be called on to endure restrictions on freedom of movement or liberty in the interests of the common good (see De Tommaso v.

However, these words do not merely refer back to domestic law. They also relate to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention. On this last point, the Court stresses that where deprivation of liberty is concerned it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Khlaifia and Others v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 16483/12, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, 15 December 2016, and Del R\u00edo Prada v.

She was also granted, at her request, additional time for consultation with her lawyer (see paragraph 13 above). Those measures inevitably prolonged the overall time needed for processing the case, but cannot be held against the authorities.",

On this point the Court notes that, while the parties contested the time when the lawyer arrived at the DNA\u2019s offices, they both agreed that the first interview took place about an hour after the lawyer\u2019s arrival (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above).
