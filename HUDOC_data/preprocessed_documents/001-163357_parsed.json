The applicant had raised new issues in connection with Judge C.K.\u2019s alleged bias at every subsequent level of jurisdiction, and not at the trial stage of the proceedings.

However, the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies requires an applicant to have normal recourse to remedies within the national legal system which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged. There is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see, among other authorities, Micallef v. Malta [GC], no.\u00a017056/06, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2009, with further references). The Court furthermore reiterates that in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights, the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a056581/00, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2006II).",

He raised the same complaint in his closing remarks before the trial court (see paragraph 25 above). The Court is therefore satisfied that the substance of the applicant\u2019s complaint was adequately raised at the trial stage of the proceedings (see, conversely, Zahirovi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 58590/11, \u00a7 36, 25 April 2013). In the Court\u2019s view, the fact that the applicant did not specify that Judge M.A. was the president of the criminal section of the trial court does not lead to a different conclusion, since, inter alia, the president of the trial court, who was competent to decide on the exclusion request, must have been aware of that fact. Similarly, in the Court\u2019s view, the fact that the applicant did not raise at the trial stage the fact that Judge C.K. had worked as Judge M.A.\u2019s clerk does not render the applicant\u2019s complaint as to the trial court\u2019s impartiality inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

Firstly, the requests for exclusion of Judges C.K. and T.D. on the ground that they had worked with the deceased girl\u2019s mother were to no avail, given that the president of the court had dismissed them following the judges\u2019 statements that that fact would not influence their adjudication (see paragraph 18 above). There is nothing to indicate that if the applicant had lodged such requests in respect of the investigating judge, Judge V.D. or the lay judges, the president of the court would have decided otherwise (see, mutatis mutandis, Vasilkoski and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 28169/08, \u00a7 46, 28\u00a0October 2010). Secondly, the applicant unsuccessfully requested that the President of the trial court ask the higher court to assign another first-instance court to decide the case (see paragraph 17 above). As pointed out by the Government, an application in this respect lodged by the applicant would be rejected as inadmissible. As to whether it was possible to make a similar representation to other competent bodies, the Court notes that this remedy is not directly accessible to the accused (see, mutatis mutandis, Erdo\u011fdu v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 25723/94, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2000VI). Finally, the Court considers that it would be excessively formalistic to require the applicant to lodge repeated exclusion requests on all possible aspects of his complaint concerning the alleged bias of Judge C.K., such as the fact that she had been Judge M.A.\u2019s clerk or the fact that the latter had been president of the trial court\u2019s criminal section.",

Judge C.K. had not been a clerk only to Judge M.A.; she had been appointed as a judge more than a year and ten months before the traffic accident; the responsibilities of Judge M.A. as president of the criminal section had been strictly separated from the adjudication of specific cases; she had had no responsibilities in respect of judicial supervision, distribution of cases or career development of the judges in the criminal section. As president of the criminal section she could not have influenced the outcome of the impugned proceedings, nor of the composition of the panel which had acted in them. At the relevant time, Judge V.D. had worked on minor-offence cases and not in the criminal section of the trial court.

In this connection, the Court will firstly assess the nature of the personal link between Judge M.A. and Judge C.K., who presided over the adjudicating panel of the trial court. The Court observes in this respect that Judge M.A. and Judge C.K. had been working together for at least two and a half years (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). It has not been argued that they were particularly close, or that their relationship went beyond a professional relationship as colleagues (ibid., \u00a7 48). However, in this respect the Court considers relevant the fact that Judge C.K. had been working as a clerk with Judge M.A.",

As already noted (see paragraph 49 above), Judge M.A., along with other members of her family, had victim status in the proceedings and lodged a compensation claim against the applicant\u2019s insurance company, which was subsequently decided on the merits by the same panel of judges that determined the applicant\u2019s guilt (see paragraph 26 above). In these circumstances, the Court considers that the fact that Judge C.K., who was Judge M.A.\u2019s colleague, was presiding over the panel which decided the applicant\u2019s guilt in respect of Judge M.A.\u2019s daughter\u2019s death in such a tragic accident, prompted objectively justified doubts as to her impartiality. The Court notes in this respect that similar considerations apply in respect of all the judges in the trial court. In this connection it observes that the domestic law did provide for the possibility of transferring a case to another competent court (see sections 31 and 32 of the Criminal Proceedings Act, paragraph 33 above), a practice which according to the applicant, and not refuted by the Government, had been applied in similar circumstances (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above, and, mutatis mutandis, Biagioli v. San Marino (dec.), no.\u00a08162/13, \u00a7 80, 8 July 2014). In the Court\u2019s view this is sufficient to conclude that in the present case the applicant\u2019s fears as to the impartiality of the trial court could have been considered objectively justified.",
