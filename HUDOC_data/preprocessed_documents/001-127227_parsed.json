However, the Croatian pension authorities had arbitrarily stopped the payment of his pension, arguing that the Social Insurance Treaty did not apply to YPA military pensions.

The applicant\u2019s entitlement to a pension had been recognised by the former SFRY authorities, and  had only acknowledged that fact and continued to pay the pension. The applicant had been entitled to receive the pension abroad only under section 88 of the Pension Insurance Act. In other words, the applicant would have received his pension as long as he lived in Croatia or in one of the countries in respect of which it was possible to receive payments from Croatia. Instead, the applicant had moved to Serbia, with which Croatia had not made any arrangement for payment of military pensions abroad, and with which there was no reciprocal agreement, and  had maintained a separate pension system for military pensioners. Therefore, in the Government\u2019s view, the applicant had himself created a situation in which he had ceased to satisfy the requirements of the domestic law to receive his pension, and accordingly he had no possessions within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. At the same time, all this should have been well known to the applicant, since the Pension Insurance Act and the Pension Insurance Treaty had been published in the Official Gazette and on the Internet and therefore accessible to him. The fact that he had misinterpreted the relevant domestic law, which in the Government\u2019s view he himself was also aware of, had not changed the fact that he and he alone was responsible for the cessation of payment of his pension. The mere hope he had had that the pension would be paid in  had no basis in the relevant domestic law. This is moreover so since he had failed to make the necessary enquiries of the competent authorities as to whether there was such a possibility.",

Regarding the lawfulness of the interference, the Government pointed out that  had agreed to pay YPA military pensions under certain conditions, which were even more flexible than the conditions later set out in the Succession Agreement. Referring to the case-law in Carson and Others (cited above) the Government argued that the payment of pensions abroad had been possible only under a treaty or a reciprocal agreement, which were legitimate requirements of the domestic law within the State\u2019s margin of appreciation. There had been no international treaty or reciprocal agreement with  on payment of YPA military pensions abroad, and the applicant\u2019s misinterpretation of the relevant law, notably the Social Insurance Agreement, had had no bearing in this respect. Since at the time Serbia was not paying pensions to YPA military pensioners living in Croatia, the Government saw no reason why Croatia should be paying such pensions in . In the Government\u2019s view, the domestic authorities had sufficiently reasoned their decisions when dismissing the applicant\u2019s request, and it appeared from his submissions to the Court that he had himself understood the whole situation. The Government also pointed out that the applicant had dual citizenship, Croatian and Serbian, and that it had been open to him to apply to the Serbian authorities for a pension. He had, however, failed to do so, and had then later returned to Croatia, following which the payment of his pension was resumed since the previously existing impediments had been removed. The Government also submitted that Annexe E of the Agreement on Succession Issues was not applicable to the applicant\u2019s situation at the time, since it had come into force only later. In any event, under that Agreement the obligation to pay the applicant\u2019s pension had been on . The Government also considered that ILO Convention 48 was not applicable to the applicant\u2019s case, since it concerned contributory pension systems, and the applicant had not been a member of such a scheme in Croatia.",

The Government also argued, reiterating their arguments that there was no treaty or reciprocal agreement with Serbia on the issue, that the applicant in this case had not borne an excessive individual burden, since he was able to receive his pension through a representative in  without the involvement of the pension system. They pointed out that the applicant had never lost his entitlement to a pension, and that the payment of his pension had been resumed once he had returned to .

As suggested by the Government, the payment of the applicant\u2019s pension is subject to certain conditions, one of which was residence in Croatia or any other country with which  had a reciprocal agreement or a treaty on payment of pensions abroad. The question therefore arises whether the applicant satisfied the necessary conditions for the payment of his pension. In view of the principle that there is no right under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to receive a social security benefit or pension payment of any kind or amount, unless national law provides for such entitlement (see, for example, Raviv v.\u00a0Austria, no. 26266/05, \u00a7 61, 13 March 2012), the central issue which remains for the Court to determine is whether the applicant satisfied all the requirements under the relevant Croatian pension legislation at the time, generating a property right to receive payment of his pension in Serbia. Or, in other words, whether there was a sufficient legal basis in the Croatian domestic legislation for the applicant to claim the payment of his pension in Serbia (see Kopeck\u00fd v.

That conclusion, in addition to the fact that separate legislation on YPA military pensions no longer existed, also follows from the following. The Pension Insurance Act, in section 186, recognised pensionable years of employment in the period prior to 8\u00a0October 1991 acquired under the former SFRY legislation on military pensions as pensionable years of employment to be recognised when obtaining a pension under the Pension Insurance Act. Furthermore, the Pension Insurance Act, in section 152 \u00a7 1, provided that the means for payment of pensions to YPA military pensioners should be secured in Croatia\u2019s budget, and that the necessary contributions should be paid on a monthly basis. The enforcement of the Act was assigned to the Croatian Pension Fund, a body replacing the Republic Workers\u2019 Fund, which had ceased to exist. In the period relevant to the present case, the Pension Insurance Act was amended several times. The amendment of 29\u00a0November 2001 reduced the amount of YPA military pension instalments.

Furthermore, the Government pointed out that the domestic legislation concerning the payment of pensions abroad did not distinguish between pension beneficiaries on any ground, including their nationality, ethnicity or the nature of the pension entitlement. All of them, including YPA military pensioners, had had equal opportunities to obtain payment of their pension abroad if there was a bilateral treaty or reciprocal agreement between Croatia and their country of residence. The stopping of pension payments in a country with which there was no treaty or reciprocal agreement had been a consequence of an objective nature and not discrimination on any ground. In this respect, Croatia had made no distinction between YPA military pensioners and persons who had been paying contributions to pension funds in .

The Government pointed out that the domestic pension authorities had not kept records of the pension beneficiaries\u2019 ethnicity, which would have enabled them to discriminate against the applicant on that ground.
