Nevertheless, detaining an individual in a prison which is so far away from his or her family that visits are made very difficult or even impossible may in some circumstances amount to interference with family life, as the opportunity for family members to visit the prisoner is vital to maintaining family life (see Ospina Vargas v.\u00a0Italy (dec.), no.\u00a040750/98, 6 April 2000).

The rejections of his numerous requests for transfer to a prison closer to his home did not mention the places where the crimes in question had been committed.
