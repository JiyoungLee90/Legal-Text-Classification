The legislator considered that putative fathers' legal security required rapid elimination of uncertainty about possible claims being brought against them on the basis of the Paternity Act.

The time-limit of five years only concerned cases where the paternity was to be established by a court decision while it was still possible today for a father to acknowledge such a child. The aim of the time-limit had been to ensure a rapid examination of possible claims made against putative fathers in order to protect their rights and freedoms, and to ensure legal certainty and finality in family relations. The restriction concerning a man's death was justified, as in such cases it was usually no longer possible to obtain sufficient evidence of paternity.",

Even though the applicant's father had not been capable of acknowledging him, paternity proceedings against him could have been initiated within the statutory time-limit. Moreover, the sufficiency or insufficiency of blood testing as evidence could only have been established by initiating paternity proceedings. The reform of family legislation including the paternity laws had been one of the main legal reforms in the 1970s and it had been widely publicised. The applicant, being already an adult at the time, must have been aware of the law reform and the new possibility to have his alleged father's paternity established by a court decision. The five-year time limit was thus proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, namely the general interest in protecting legal certainty of family relationships.",

The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Keegan v.

Apart from weighing the interests of the individual vis-\u00e0-vis the general interest of the community as a whole, a balancing exercise is also required with regard to competing private interests. In this connection, it should be observed that the expression \u201ceveryone\u201d in Article 8 of the Convention applies to both the child and the putative father. On the one hand, people have a right to know their origins, that right being derived from a wide interpretation of the scope of the notion of private life (see Odi\u00e8vre v.\u00a0France [GC], cited above, \u00a7 42). A person has a vital interest, protected by the Convention, in receiving the information necessary to uncover the truth about an important aspect of his or her personal identity and eliminate any uncertainty in this respect (see Mikuli\u0107 v. Croatia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 64 and 65). On the other hand, a putative father's interest in being protected from claims concerning facts that go back many years cannot be denied. Finally, in addition to that conflict of interest, other interests may come into play, such as those of third parties, essentially the putative father's family, and the general interest of legal certainty.",

Furthermore, the Court will examine whether or not an alternative means of redress exists in the event the proceedings in question are time-barred. This would include, for example, the availability of effective domestic remedies to obtain the re-opening of the time-limit (see, for example, Mizzi v. Malta, cited above, \u00a7 111) or exceptions to the application of a time-limit in situations where a person becomes aware of the biological reality after the time-limit has expired (see Shofman v.\u00a0Russia, cited above, \u00a7 43).",

This study revealed that there was no uniform approach in this field. Unlike proceedings by fathers for the establishment or denial of paternity (see Shofman v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037), a significant number of States did not set a limitation period for children to bring an action aimed at having paternity established.

Only a small number of legal systems seemed to have produced solutions to the problem which arises when the relevant circumstances become known only after the expiry of the time-limit, for instance, by providing for the possibility of bringing an action after the time-limit has expired if there was a material or moral impossibility of lodging it within that period or if there were good reasons for the delay.",

However, the Court has difficulties in accepting the inflexible limitation period with time running irrespective of a child's ability to provide reliable evidence, and without providing any exceptions to the application of that period (see, mutatis mutandis, Shofman v.

In the present case, however, the national courts did not make any attempt to balance the competing interests but only concluded that the applicant's claim was time-barred. Thus, the national courts did not consider at all whether or not the general interest in protecting legal certainty of family relationships or the interest of the father and his family outweighed the applicant's right to have an opportunity to seek a judicial determination of paternity. The Court considers that such a straightforward restriction of the applicant's right to institute proceedings for the judicial determination of paternity is not proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In this connection the Court reiterates that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Airey v.
