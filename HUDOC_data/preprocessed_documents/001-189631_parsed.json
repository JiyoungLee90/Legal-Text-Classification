These are necessary to coordinate the operation of the credit institutions concerned and to ensure integrated operation. For operational activity, the issues enlisted in section 15(2) of the Act (such as risk management, business policy, marketing and IT systems) are undoubtedly important, therefore the legislator has authorised [the Savings Bank] to establish binding regulations on such issues. In exercising its right of control, [the Savings Bank] monitors compliance with the regulations issued and, in that framework, it is entitled to give specific instructions. Taking into consideration that integrated operation is contingent upon compliance with the regulations and instructions mentioned, the legislator has also authorised the implementation of certain sanctions. Since cooperatives are managed by executive officers on an operative level, their mandates may be suspended or terminated. Sanctions against cooperatives not complying with the binding rules (suspension of the Integration Organisation\u2019s membership, exclusion) are one means of ensuring integrated operation. It is also justified to exercise [the Savings Bank]\u2019s right of control and implement sanctions if a cooperative is in crisis, since \u2013 because of a financial risk pool \u2013 the operation of a single member may jeopardise the security of the whole system. ...

Moreover, the Integration Act required them to comply with the instructions issued by the Savings Bank, allowed for the suspension of voting rights and authorised the International Organisation to define, without any clear limits, the banks\u2019 solvency capital (see paragraphs\u00a026 to\u00a031 and 39 above).

They also drew attention to the funds provided by the MFB to the Integration Organisation, submitting that they had significantly raised the own funds of every single cooperative credit institution participating in the integration. Furthermore, the Government pointed out that certain uniformity regarding the operations of the cooperative credit institutions was necessary because of the joint and several liability, which had benefited the cooperative credit institutions and their creditors, and the fact that the solvency and liquidity were monitored as a whole on the basis of consolidated accounts of these institutions. For instance, the limitations on the use of profit served bank stability, did not make it impossible to eventually use such profit and could be challenged in court.

This encompasses an indirect claim over the company\u2019s assets, including the right to a share in them in the event of it being wound up, but also other unrestricted rights, especially voting rights and the right to influence the company\u2019s conduct and policy (see, among many authorities, Olczak v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 30417/96, \u00a7\u00a060, ECHR\u00a02002X (extracts)).",

The Court notes that the legislative provisions complained of mostly allow for measures to be taken against the cooperative credit institutions. Only very few provisions seem to allow for measures to be taken directly against particular shareholders. In this connection, it is observed that such measures were taken by the Savings Bank when it refused to consent to the payment of dividends in the case of Kinizsi Bank and imposed the limits on such payment in the case of Moh\u00e1csi Bank (see paragraphs 32 and 35 above).

For instance, it is doubtful that the Act would \u201cprofessionalise, modernise and organise\u201d the cooperative credit institution sector.

The capital adequacy ratio of the cooperative credit institutions at all times exceeded the regulatory requirements, and fared better than the rest of the banking and credit institution sectors.
