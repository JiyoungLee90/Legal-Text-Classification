This argument was justified by referring to the session of 10\u00a0December\u00a02002 when the applicant had not contributed to establishing the facts. Furthermore, the public prosecutor had not submitted any new evidence at the session of 16 November 2004, but had rather addressed the applicant's written submissions.",

Having regard to this power, it quashed the trial court's decisions and remitted the case for fresh consideration on three occasions (see paragraphs 9, 12 and 14 above). Each time the Court of Appeal gave its decision, the applicant exercised her right under section 362 (1) of the Act, requesting to be notified of the dates of the sessions. She was, however, summoned to attend only one session while the public prosecutor attended all four sessions held by the Court of Appeal. Such was the case with the last session held at the final stage of the proceedings when the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant's conviction. On that occasion, the public prosecutor referred to her own written submissions of 24 September 2004 and submitted a final oral statement requesting that the applicant's appeal be dismissed. The applicant, not having been informed of the session, could not have replied to that position, even though it did not involve, according the Government, any new evidence. In this connection, the Court observes that the principle of equality of arms does not depend on further, quantifiable unfairness flowing from a procedural inequality. It is a matter for the defence to assess whether a submission deserves a reaction (see Bulut v. , 22 February 1996, \u00a7 49, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II). The Court considers that even if the public prosecutor had not been permitted to make any comments, her presence at the Court of Appeal's private sitting afforded her, if only to outward appearances, an additional opportunity to bolster her opinion in private, without fear of contradiction by the applicant (see Borgers v. Belgium, 30 October 1991, \u00a7\u00a028, Series A no. 214B, and Lobo Machado v. Portugal, 20 February 1996, \u00a7\u00a032, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996I).",

In this context, it reiterates that, since the remittal of cases for re-examination is usually ordered as a result of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency in the judicial system (see Nankov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 26541/02, \u00a7 48, 29 November 2007). The legislative amendments, to which the Government referred in their submissions, do not concern the impugned proceedings, but are intended to prevent procedural deficiencies of this kind in future. In addition, the trial court's requests for expert examinations affected the length of the proceedings, in particular since some of them were inappropriate (see paragraph 12 above) (see Stojanov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 34215/02, \u00a7 60, 31 May 2007).",
