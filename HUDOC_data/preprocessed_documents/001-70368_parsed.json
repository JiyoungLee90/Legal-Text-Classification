They referred in that respect to the decision of the Court of Appeal of 23\u00a0June 2004 which had observed that the main reason for the delays in the proceedings until April 2003 had been the obstructiveness of the defendants and the abuse of the rights of the defence. The Government also submitted that the defendants had made numerous applications to challenge the trial court. In the Government's view the defendants' actions justified the conclusion that they had resorted to delaying tactics.",

The Court is of the view that this conclusion remains valid, despite the Government's argument that the applicant had attempted to obstruct the trial hearing held on 23 September 2002 (see paragraph 41 above). It must then establish whether the other grounds advanced by the judicial authorities were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d to continue to justify the deprivation of liberty.",

In this respect, the Court recalls that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider that such an initial risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001).

The Court accepts that at the relevant time the authorities had a valid reason to consider that the risk relied on could materialise. However, it cannot but note that in their decisions, following the decision of the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court of 20 April 1999, the judicial authorities did not refer to the fact that the applicant had breached the preventive measure imposed on him in another set of proceedings.

It notes however that the decisions referring thereto did not put forward any argument capable of showing that these fears were well-founded. The Court considers that such a generally formulated risk flowing from the nature of the offences with which the applicant had been charged may possibly be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings.

In that regard the Court would also point out that although such a potential danger may exist where an accused is charged with a serious offence and where the sentence faced is a long term of imprisonment, the degree of that risk cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the offence and anticipated sentence (see Muller v.
