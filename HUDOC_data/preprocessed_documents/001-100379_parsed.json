The Court observes that the authorities accepted the validity of the medical report of 19 April 2001 and thus the existence of the applicant's injuries. The applicant's allegations of ill-treatment were rejected essentially with reference to the lack of a causal link between the applicant's injuries and the actions of the policemen and the lack of further evidence implicating the policemen. The Court notes that the medical report at issue was drawn up by the doctor shortly after the events at issue and there is nothing in the case file or the parties' submissions to suggest that the injuries described in the report had been inflicted either before the applicant's arrest on 16 April 2001 or in the period from his release to the medical examination of 19 April 2001.",

It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. The Court has previously had before it cases in which it has found that there has been treatment which could only be described as torture (see Aksoy v.

It observes that the requirements of an investigation and the undeniable difficulties inherent in the fight against crime cannot justify placing limits on the protection to be afforded in respect of the physical integrity of individuals (see Tomasi, \u00a7 115, and Ribitsch, \u00a7\u00a7 38-40, both cited above).",

Although the Court has found this unacceptable treatment to be deliberate it does not consider that it caused such serious injuries or suffering or was of such a cruel nature that it should be characterised as torture within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.

In this connection the Court notes a number of significant omissions capable of undermining its reliability and effectiveness. Firstly, the Court observes that there was a selective and somewhat inconsistent approach to the assessment of evidence by the investigating authorities. The prosecution authorities did not consider that testimony to be credible, apparently because it reflected a personal opinion and constituted an accusatory tactic by the applicant. However, the investigator did regard the police officers' testimonies as credible, despite the fact that their statements could have constituted defence tactics and have been aimed at damaging the applicant's credibility. In the Court's view, the prosecution investigation applied different standards when assessing the testimonies, as that given by the applicant was deemed to be subjective, but not those given by the police officers. The credibility of the latter testimonies should also have been questioned, as the prosecution investigation was supposed to establish whether the officers were liable on the basis of disciplinary or criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v. Bulgaria, no. 46317/99, \u00a7 99, 23\u00a0February 2006).",

While the investigating authorities may not have been provided with the names of individuals who might have seen the applicant at the police station or might have witnessed his alleged ill-treatment, they were expected to take steps on their own initiative to identify possible eyewitnesses. In particular, the prosecution authorities could have at least questioned lawyer S. who, as it follows from the information submitted by the Government, represented the applicant during the interview of 18 April 2001 (see paragraph 9). The Court therefore finds that the investigating authorities' failure to look for corroborating evidence and their deferential attitude to the police officers must be considered to be a particularly serious shortcoming in the investigation (see Ayd\u0131n, cited above, \u00a7 106).",

Instead he remitted the applicant's complaint to the local police station, a State authority whose employees were allegedly implicated in the events which were to be looked into, with an order to conduct an official police inquiry (see paragraph 11 above). While the Court acknowledges the necessity of internal inquiries by the police with a view to possible disciplinary sanctions in cases of alleged police abuse, it finds it striking that in the present case the initial investigative steps, which usually prove to be crucial for the establishment of the truth in cases of police brutality, were conducted by the police force itself (see, for similar reasoning, Vladimir Fedorov v. Russia, no. 19223/04, \u00a7 69, 30 July 2009). In this connection the Court reiterates its finding made on a number of occasions that the investigation should be carried out by competent, qualified and impartial experts who are independent of the suspected perpetrators and the agency they serve (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 325, ECHR 2007..., and O\u011fur v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, ECHR 1999III). Furthermore, the Court would stress that it is not convinced that, despite relying on the police officers' statements in the decisions of 3 May and 27 July 2001 (see paragraphs 15 and 21), the assistant prosecutor had heard evidence from them in person. It appears that he merely recounted the officers' statements made during the internal inquiry. The Court, however, is mindful of the important role which investigative interviews play in obtaining accurate and reliable information from suspects, witnesses and victims and, ultimately, the discovery of the truth about the matter under investigation. Observing the suspects', witnesses' and victims' demeanour during questioning and assessing the probative value of their testimony forms a substantial part of the investigative process.",
