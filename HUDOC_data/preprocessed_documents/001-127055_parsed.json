The Court of Appeal observed that the employees\u2019 fears were scientifically unfounded, as the occupational-health doctor had explained.

Accordingly, their fears were in reality based on prejudice rather than on an established risk; consequently, the applicant\u2019s illness could not affect the future smooth operation of the company.",

It noted that the applicant had not been absent from work and that no absence on the ground of illness was foreseeable in the immediate future. Moreover, the nature of the applicant\u2019s job, which did not demand excessive effort, precluded the risk of a reduction in his capacity for work since, during the many years in which a person was merely HIV-positive, his or her working capacity was not substantially reduced.",

It was that event which prompted his colleagues to express their refusal to work with him, despite reassurances from the occupational-health doctor invited by the employer to explain the mode of transmission of the disease. It was that event which prompted the employer to attempt to persuade him to leave the company and the employees to openly threaten to disrupt the operation of the company as long as the applicant continued to work there.",

Supposed or expressed prejudice on the part of employees could not be relied on as a pretext for terminating the contract of an HIV-positive employee.
