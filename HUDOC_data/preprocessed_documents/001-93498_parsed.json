The applicant\u2019s lawyer asked the Primorskiy District and St. Petersburg City courts and the  archive for certified copies of minutes of the meetings for election of lay judges, lists of lay judges and copies of official publications of such lists. His requests were fruitless. The domestic courts merely responded that the lay judges had been lawfully elected.

The Court therefore, firstly, has to decide whether the essential requirements of the procedure for selection of lay judges, as laid down in the RSFSR Judicial System and Court Election Acts of 1981, were respected and then it has to proceed to the examination of the lawfulness of the extensions of the lay judges\u2019 term of office by the President\u2019s Decrees.",

In this respect, the Court observes that the presented \u201cSupplement\u201d does not contain any indication that the individuals, including Mr S., enclosed in the list had, in fact, been selected to serve as lay judges in the Primorskiy District Court (see paragraph 7 above). The \u201cSupplement\u201d merely lists the names of eleven persons, their home address and place of work. The Government did not refer to any other source of information on the basis of which their assertion regarding the content of the \u201cSupplement\u201d could be verified. The Court observes \u2013 and this was not disputed by the parties \u2013 that Mr S. and Ms B. should have been appointed to the tribunal in accordance with the RSFSR Judicial System and Courts Election Acts (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). Accordingly, it was open to the Government to submit copies of documents which could constitute the legal basis for the lay judges\u2019 appointment, such as the minutes of citizens\u2019 meetings for the election of lay judges, the official publications of the list in the local press or the complete text of the decision of the executive committee of the District Council of People\u2019s Deputies by which the list of lay judges had been approved. However, no such documents were presented. An archive search carried out by the applicant with a view to finding such documents was unavailing. The applicant\u2019s and his lawyer\u2019s requests to the District Court for provision of such documents also did not produce any result (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above). The Court is, therefore, not convinced by the Government\u2019s submission that Mr S. was elected to serve in the Primorskiy District Court.",

It appears from that decision that the Presidium of the Primorskiy District Assembly of War and Labour Veterans elected Ms B. to serve as a lay judge. In that connection, the Court notes the apparent failure to observe the requirements of the RSFSR Judicial System and Courts Election Acts (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above) regarding the election of lay judges by general staff meetings or general meetings and gatherings of citizens at their place of residence. The Court observes that the Government did not argue that under the domestic law in force at the material time the Presidium could have replaced a general staff meeting at Ms B.\u2019s place of work or a general meeting at Ms B.\u2019s place of residence. It follows that there has been a substantive breach of the rules for selection of lay judges established in Article 58 of the Courts Election Act (see paragraph 14 above) and Section 22 of the RSFSR Judicial System Act (see paragraph 13 above).",
