The case originated in an application (no. 50070/10) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Mesut Çeki (“the applicant”), on 25 June 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr C. Tombul, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 4 September 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1977 and was detained at the Kırıkkale Ftype prison when the application was lodged.
On 1 October 2004 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of being member of a terrorist organisation.
On 5 October 2004 the applicant was brought before the judge at the Ankara Assize Court who placed him in detention on remand taking into consideration the nature of the offence, the state of evidence and the severity of the envisaged penalty.
On 15 March 2005 the Ankara public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Ankara Assize Court, charging the applicant with membership of a terrorist organisation.
On 31 January 2008 the Ankara Assize Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 15 years’ imprisonment. The court ordered the continuation of his detention.
.  On 6 May 2009 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment. The case was accordingly remitted to the Ankara Assize Court for further examination.
.  On 10 November 2009 the 11th Chamber of the Ankara Assize Court held a further hearing, in which both the applicant and his lawyer were present. At the end of that hearing, the court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention.
.  On 10 December 2009 the applicant’s lawyer filed an objection against the decision of 10 November 2009. On 21 December 2009 the 12th Chamber of the Ankara Assize Court dismissed this objection without holding a hearing. In delivering its decision, the court took into consideration the written opinion of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative.
On 28 August 2012 the Ankara Assize Court once more convicted the applicant and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment.
On 8 July 2013 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first instance court.
