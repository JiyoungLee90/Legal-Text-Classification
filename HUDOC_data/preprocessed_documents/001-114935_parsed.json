They considered that he had thereby failed to comply with Article 34 of the Convention and had not properly lodged an application in the sense of Rule 47 of the Rules of Court. In this regard, the Government referred to Lord Woolf who in the Review of the Working Methods of the European Court of Human Rights recommended the Court to deal only with properly completed application forms which contained all the information required for the Court to process them. The Government pointed out that the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention had been communicated only in 2009 and that the relevant documents had been destroyed after the expiry of the statutory storage period for archival documents.",

It further notes that together with his application form the applicant provided some evidence that he had approached the domestic authorities and that he had received the letter of 23 May 2003 in reply from the State Police. In this respect, nevertheless, the Court notes that at the material time there were no effective domestic remedies in relation to complaints about conditions of detention in short-term detention facilities (see Kadi\u0137is v.  (no. 2), no.\u00a062393/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-63, 4 May 2006, and \u0145ikitenko v.

As regards the expiry of the statutory storage period for the relevant documents, the Court has already expressed serious concerns in a different context (see Leja v.

Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural acts would have no incidence on the continuous nature of the detention. However, the applicant\u2019s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d. The complaint about the conditions of detention must be filed within six months from the end of the situation complained about or, if there was an effective domestic remedy to be exhausted, of the final decision in the process of exhaustion (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a042525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7\u00a078, 10 January 2012, and also I.D. v. , no.\u00a047203/06, \u00a7\u00a7 28-31, 30\u00a0November 2010).",

Even though the conditions in Saldus remained substantially the same during each detention period, after each of those periods the applicant was transferred back to Liep\u0101ja Prison, where the detention conditions were substantially different and appear not to raise any issues under the Convention, at least in so far as the present applicant is concerned. The Court therefore considers that the periods of the applicant\u2019s detention in the short-term detention facility in Saldus cannot be regarded as a continuing situation. The Court considers that in the present case the six-month period referred to in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is to be calculated separately for each detention period; on each occasion starting to run on the date that followed the applicant\u2019s transfer from the short-term detention facility in Saldus to Liep\u0101ja Prison and expiring six calendar months later, regardless of the actual duration of those calendar months (see Katajevs v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a01710/06, \u00a7\u00a027, 11\u00a0September 2012). The Court notes that the applicant lodged his complaint with the Court on 17\u00a0June\u00a02003. It follows that the complaint about the first two detention periods, that is, between 5 June and 5 July 2002 and between 5\u00a0September\u00a0and 22\u00a0November 2002, has been introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

In addition, the Court has already found that in other short-term detention facilities in Latvia the conditions of detention largely resemble those depicted by the applicant in the present case (see Kadi\u0137is, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a052-56, where the applicant was held in a short-term detention facility in Liep\u0101ja for fifteen days in an overpopulated cell that had a stifling atmosphere, with no access to natural light and often no fresh air, without the ability to leave the cell other than for use of a washbasin or the toilet, without a bed and forced to sleep with other detainees on a wooden platform with no mattress or blankets, with an insufficient amount of food and often thirsty, and \u0145ikitenko v. , no.\u00a062609/00, \u00a7\u00a025, 16\u00a0July 2009, where the applicant was held in a short-term detention facility in Jelgava for one month and five days in similar, in some respects even worse, conditions than those in the Kadi\u0137is case).
