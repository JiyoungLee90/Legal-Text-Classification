The court referred to the statement which the applicant had made in the presence of his lawyer, the minutes of the inspection of the crime scene on 10 July 2006, the results of the forensic examination of K.\u2019s body and other material evidence found on the crime scene, forensic expert\u2019s statements made before the court, and statements of witnesses who on 28 June 2006 had first seen the applicant with R. and K. and then later with K. alone walking down the road. The court also noted that the pennant which the applicant had with him when he had been in the caf\u00e9 (see paragraph 7 above) had been later found on the crime scene. The court also referred to the statements of witnesses who had seen that on 27\u00a0June 2006 K. had with her a note of 20 hryvnias. The conclusion that K. had been raped was made having regard to the position of K.\u2019s body when it had been discovered by the police and the fact that her clothes had been pulled down. In its reasoning the court did not refer to the clothes which the applicant described on 14 July 2006 (see paragraph 19 above) as an evidence of his guilt. However, in the operative part of the judgment the court ordered the police to return the clothes to the applicant\u2019s mother. As to the applicant\u2019s allegation of ill-treatment, the court dismissed this as unsubstantiated referring to the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 5 February 2007.",

Ukraine (no.\u00a023180/06, \u00a7\u00a067, 31 October 2013) which concerned lack of access to a lawyer at the early stages of criminal proceedings, no violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3 (c) of the Convention was found having regard, inter alia, to the fact that when being legally represented the applicant maintained the statements which he had earlier made in the absence of a lawyer. In the case Titarenko v.\u00a0Ukraine (no. 31720/02, 20 September 2012) the Court found a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01, 3 (c) of the Convention having regard, inter alia, to the fact, that as soon as the applicant became legally represented, he retracted the confessions which he had earlier made without a lawyer being present.",

In particular, on 10 July 2006 the applicant incriminated himself not only by saying that he had robbed, raped and killed K., but also by showing the crime scene to the police which immediately inspected it and collected physical evidence. The Court accepts that after the applicant became legally represented, theoretically speaking, it was open for him to say that he had not robbed, killed and raped K. It is, however, difficult to see how it would be possible for him to retract the statement concerning location of the crime scene after it had been actually found and inspected by the police. In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that the absence of legal assistance on 10\u00a0July 2006 could not be remedied by the fact that subsequently the applicant was legally represented and repeated his self-incriminating statements in the presence of a lawyer.",
