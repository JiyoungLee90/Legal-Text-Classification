The Court notes that from the very beginning of the investigation, as early as on 12 May and then again on 20 May 2011, the applicant alleged that the perpetrators of his son\u2019s beating on 9 May 2011 had been the police officers who had previously ill-treated him on 7 May 2011. This allegation was specific and consistent throughout the proceedings. The investigators, however, only questioned the police officers for the first time more than a month later, on 23 June 2011 (see paragraph 66 above). Second, the police officers who participated in the enhanced security measures in the area in connection with the public celebration were only questioned in August and September 2011, several months after the events (see paragraph 89 above), and the police officers from the nearby police station were not questioned at all. Third, the owner of the nearby shop, who could have had video footage of the incident, was only questioned on 17 August 2011 \u2013 three months after the opening of the investigation (see paragraph 86 above) and, as it happened, two months after the destruction of the video recording. In addition, assuming that the investigators did not notice the video surveillance cameras during the crime scene examination at the Mustang car repair garage on 10 May 2011, they learnt of their existence at the latest on 18 June 2011 from the witness statement given by Tamerlan Suleymanov\u2019s colleague (see paragraph 63 above).",

The relevant steps were only taken on 2 August 2011 (see paragraph 50 above). Fourth, the place of Tamerlan Suleymanov\u2019s alleged detention in Yalkhoy-Mokhk was only examined several weeks later after the receipt of the detailed complaint about it and only upon the Court\u2019s request under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court to this end (see paragraphs 43, 100 and 52 above), and this examination was conducted without the involvement of a forensic expert. Further, although during the period from the middle of May to the middle of October 2011 the investigators took important steps, such as a crime scene examination (see paragraphs 22 and 49 above) and the questioning of key witnesses about the circumstances of the incident \u2013 the applicant was questioned at least five times (see paragraphs 56, 58, 65, 93 and 94 above) and the colleagues of Tamerlan Suleymanov were questioned at least three times (see paragraphs 57, 59 and 63 above), they took those steps repeatedly and inconclusively.",

However, no relevant steps were taken and only after the applicant\u2019s complaint on 13 July 2011 about his son\u2019s unlawful detention on the premises of the ROVD in Yalkhoy-Mokhk did the investigators ask the officers from the very same ROVD to confirm whether Tamerlan Suleymanov was detained on their premises. On 30 July 2011 the officers replied that they did not know whether the applicant\u2019s son was detained on their premises or not (see paragraph 48 above). Even assuming that for some reason the investigators were precluded from visiting the premises in which the applicant\u2019s son was allegedly detained in YalkhoyMokhk in person, it runs counter to the requirement of an independent investigation to ask the very same individuals who were suspected of unlawfully detaining the applicant\u2019s son to look into the matter.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the authorities cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin to request particular lines of inquiry or investigative procedures (see, mutatis\u00a0mutandis, \u0130lhan v.\u00a0 [GC], no. 22277/93, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2000VII): they must show their commitment to take all steps of their own motion and to demonstrate that they have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the identity of the person responsible will risk falling below this standard (see, for example, Salman v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 21986/93, \u00a7\u00a0106, ECHR 2000VII, and Tanrikulu v.

This failure to act in a timely manner led to unnecessary protractions and a loss of time. Therefore, it is doubtful that any appeals by the applicant against the investigators\u2019 decisions would have had any prospects of spurring the progress of the investigation or effectively influencing its conduct.
