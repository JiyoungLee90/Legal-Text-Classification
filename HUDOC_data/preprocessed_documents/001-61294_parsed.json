The children had expressed their reluctance to see their mother many times in the course of the divorce and custody proceedings and at the meeting in Divri\u011fi on 21 August 1997 when they firmly refused to travel with the applicant\u2019s lawyer. In such circumstances the authorities were also under an obligation under Article 8 of the Convention to protect the interests of the children who were mature enough to have their views taken into account. The failure to enforce access rights was first and foremost the result of the father\u2019s refusal to co-operate and the Government could not be held responsible for his conduct.

The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and co-operation of all concerned are always an important ingredient. Whilst national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such co-operation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention. Where contacts with the parent might appear to threaten those interests or interfere with those rights, it is for the national authorities to strike a fair balance between them (see Hokkanen, cited above, p. 22, \u00a7 58 and Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, p. 265, \u00a7 94).",
