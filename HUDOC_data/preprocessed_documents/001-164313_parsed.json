The main issue before the Supreme Court was whether the applicants could be said to have been \u201ccharged\u201d on 17 September 1998 or whether the appropriate \u201cstarting point\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 was 5 April 2005. The court assessed the evidence in light of the relevant case-law of the domestic courts and of this Court. In doing so, it distinguished the applicants\u2019 case from that of Ambrose v. Harris [2011] UKSC 43, in which the Supreme Court accepted that an appellant, who was complaining that there had been a breach of his right to legal advice under Article 6 \u00a7 1, had been \u201ccharged\u201d following his caution by police in connection with the alleged offence. The Supreme Court observed that as the \u201cfair trial\u201d guarantee under Article 6 was distinct from the \u201creasonable-time\u201d guarantee it had to be approached separately. Therefore, the fact that the applicants had been subjected to questioning on 17\u00a0September 1998 that might have affected their right to a fair trial did not mean that this was the relevant \u201cstarting point\u201d for determining whether proceedings had been conducted within a \u201creasonable time\u201d. The court concluded that the correct \u201cstarting point\u201d in the applicants\u2019 proceedings was 5 April 2005 and the case was remitted to the Appeal Court.",

The Court considers that applicants should not suffer a procedural injustice because of the manner in which it has dealt with their application.

Furthermore, the main witness, the son of the deceased, suffered from profound psychological issues arising from sexual abuse suffered at the hands of the applicants, and it took some time for him to fully cooperate with the authorities in their investigation. It took the police from 1998 to 2005 to resolve the difficulties that these, and other, issues may have presented in any prosecution and to arrive at a point where they felt there was sufficient evidence in order to proceed against the applicants. After the applicants were charged with the murder of A.M. in 2005, it was a process of careful, reasoned analysis that resulted in the decision being taken not to prosecute at that time. However, further surveillance work undertaken by the police in 2007 and 2008 resolved the problems that had stood in the way of any prosecution in 2005. As soon as a decision was made to prosecute, an indictment was served, the Crown sought a retrospective extension of time within which to prosecute the applicants, and the case thereafter proceeded without delay.",

To begin with, the case against the applicants was of undoubted complexity, not least owing to the number of people involved in the proceedings. It is to be noted that at the applicant\u2019s trial the prosecution led evidence from over fifty witnesses (see paragraph 37 above). Furthermore, there were specific difficulties faced by the prosecution, including the disappearance of the supposed murder victim; the fact that her body was never recovered; the lack of forensic evidence linking the applicants to the crime; and the psychological problems suffered by the main witness, who was the son of the supposed victim and who had been sexually abused by the applicants (see paragraph 8 above), which inevitably impacted on his ability to cooperate with the prosecution. During the three and a half years from April 2005 to September 2008, the police were conducting a difficult exercise of building up an evidential case against the applicants and periodically reviewing the evidence. The delay of the prosecuting authorities in going ahead was not because of negligence but because of a careful and reasoned analysis that resulted in a decision not to prosecute until there was a sufficiency of evidence against both of the applicants, who were suspected of having acted together (see paragraph 20 above). Evidence obtained under the police Operation Aspen (see paragraphs 24-25 above) led to the Crown concluding on 9 September 2008 that there had been a material change as to the prospects of securing both applicants\u2019 conviction (see paragraph 25 above). Indictment of the applicants followed swiftly on 10 September 2008.",

The Court reiterates that Article 6 does not require suspects and defendants to cooperate actively with the judicial authorities. Nor can they be blamed for making full use of the multiple remedies available to them under domestic law (see, among other authorities, Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 319A, \u00a7 66). An applicant\u2019s conduct does, however, constitute an objective fact which cannot be attributed to the respondent State and which must be taken into account in determining whether or not the length of the proceedings exceeds what is reasonable (Eckle v. Germany, \u00a7 82). In this respect, the many successive motions and appeals lodged by the applicants carried with them an inevitable delaying effect. On the other side of the equation, there was no identified undue delay on the part of the Scottish prosecuting or judicial authorities during this second period.",

Although the Court has accepted that the applicants\u2019 own actions greatly contributed to that delay, in view of the need for diligence triggered by the significant lapses of time both between the commission of the offence and the laying of charges, and between the laying of charges and the applicants\u2019 conviction becoming final, the Court considers that the overall length of the proceedings (almost nine years in respect of the first applicant, and just over nine years and two months for the second applicant \u2013 see paragraphs 16, 46 and 90 above) was excessive and failed to meet the reasonable-time requirement.",
