It is their duty, however, to present at least those essential facts which are at their disposal and which, they must be aware, are of significant bearing for the Court to be able to properly assess the case (see Milo\u0161evi\u0107 v. Serbia (dec.), no. 20037/07, 5 July 2011, \u00a7 43). Any such failure would not necessarily have to mean that there has been an abuse of the right to petition. Thus, if none of the facts allegedly concealed concerned any offence or any wrongdoing on his or her part, an applicant\u2019s failure to present such facts to the Court would not be observed as the abuse of the right to petition (see, for example, Al-Nashif and Others v. Bulgaria, (dec.) no. 50963/99, 25\u00a0January 2001). However, having regard to the importance of Mrs\u00a0Timokhina\u2019s failures for the proper determination of the present case, in particular the fact that she had lodged the application on behalf of her deceased husband, acted in his name and failed to inform the Court about her true legal status, the Court finds that such conduct was contrary to the purpose of the right of individual petition, as provided for in Article 34 of the Convention. It thus constitutes an abuse of the right of petition, within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, and rejects the application pursuant to paragraph 4 of that Article.",
