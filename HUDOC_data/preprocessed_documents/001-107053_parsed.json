In particular, the medical court found the applicant guilty of amending medical records without informing her superior (see paragraph\u00a028 above). This does not sit well with the finding made by the labour court that in 2004 the hospital\u2019s director had reviewed the medical records of the ward\u2019s patients and found no irregularities (see paragraph\u00a012 above). Nor does it appear compatible with the labour court\u2019s conclusion that these allegations had not been confirmed by the evidence (see paragraphs\u00a013 and 14 above). It is further noted that the medical court found the applicant guilty of an offence punishable under Article\u00a052\u00a0(3) of the Code of Medical Ethics in that she had improperly taken the medical records out of the hospital to show them to the regional consultant (see paragraph\u00a027 above). The findings of the medical court in this respect are also incompatible with the findings of the labour court which held that such conduct was expressly recommended by the Law on the Profession of Physicians (see paragraph\u00a014 above).",
