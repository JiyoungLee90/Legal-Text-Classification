Accordingly, the Court considers that there is no call to award the applicant any sum on that account (see, most recently, Apostu v. Romania, no. 22765/12, \u00a7 136, 3 February 2015). However, the Court considers that, insofar as the Commission decision remains in force, the respondent State\u2019s outstanding obligation to enforce it cannot be disputed. Accordingly, the applicant is still entitled to enforcement of that decision. The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see, amongst others, S.C. Prodcomexim SRL v. Romania (no.\u00a02), no.\u00a031760/06, \u00a7\u00a052, 6 July 2010). Having regard to the violation found, the Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well. It therefore considers that the Government must secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 27\u00a0September\u00a02001.",
