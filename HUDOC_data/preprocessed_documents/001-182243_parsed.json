It considered the appeal to be admissible despite the fact that it had been lodged by the applicant in person, as it concerned the very issue whether the applicant, as the defendant, was entitled to conduct his own defence. The Court of Appeal stressed that Portuguese law on criminal procedure did not allow the procedural status of defendant to be combined with that of defence counsel in the same proceedings. It required that the defendant be assisted by defence counsel at the hearing before the investigating judge and at the trial in all cases where the proceedings concerned could give rise to a custodial sentence or a public-safety detention order. This reflected the premise that the accused would be better defended when the defence was conducted by a legal professional trained in advocacy. The latter, unencumbered by the emotional burden weighing on a defendant, could provide a lucid, dispassionate and effective defence. The\u00a0law on criminal procedure was thus intended not to place limits on the defence\u2019s action, but to support the proper defence of the accused.",

Moreover, in adversarial proceedings the powers vested by law in the defence were incompatible in many situations with the position of the defendant.

Following the adoption of the Portuguese Constitution in 1976, the CCP of 1987 (adopted by Legislative Decree no.\u00a078/87 of 17\u00a0February 1987 further to Law no. 43/86 of 26 September 1986 authorising the Government to approve a new CCP) established an adversarial criminal procedure and reinforced the legal position of the public prosecutor\u2019s office, but also that of the accused, in order to ensure effective equality of arms and to avoid all measures which could prejudice the accused\u2019s personal dignity (see point III.10 of the Preamble to the CCP of 1987 and point 3 of section 2 of Law no. 43/86). Article 64 \u00a7 1 of the CCP, as amended in 1987, provided for compulsory assistance by defence counsel notably during the first judicial questioning of the defendant and during the hearing before the investigating judge and the court hearings, except in proceedings which could not result in a custodial sentence or a preventive measure entailing detention. Assistance by counsel was also compulsory in appeal proceedings. Law no. 59/98 of 25 August 1998, as well as Law no. 48/2007 of 29 August 2007 and Law no. 20/2013 of 21\u00a0February 2013 maintained the requirement of mandatory assistance in criminal proceedings and extended it to other procedural acts (see\u00a0paragraphs 33 and 34 above and 36 and 37 below). According to the information available to the Court when Article 64 of the CCP was examined in 2007, three different proposals were submitted to Parliament by the Government and other political groups. The Government proposal, which was ultimately approved by a majority, indicated that one of the goals of the reform was to extend compulsory representation by a lawyer.",

It further found that the rules of domestic law allowed accused persons to prepare their defence together with defence counsel; they could also submit observations, statements and requests which did not raise questions of law (case no. 7/14, cited above, paragraph XI). The Supreme Court stressed in that context that the dispassionate conduct of a case was a necessary additional safeguard in criminal proceedings (see case no. \u00a07/14.0YGLSB.S1, judgment of 12 June 2014, paragraph B.3). In the situations covered by Article 64 \u00a7 1 of the CCP, the legislature presumed that the accused\u2019s personal defence was weakened, thus increasing the need for technical assistance, which the accused could not refuse (see case no. \u00a03236/04, judgment of 7 April 2005, paragraph IV). In criminal proceedings the responsibilities of defence counsel were incompatible with the status of an accused (see, for instance, case no. 3347/01, judgment of 6\u00a0December 2001, paragraph I).",

It thus served an important public interest, the interest in the proper administration of justice and in ensuring a fair trial that safeguarded the principle of equality of arms as well as the interests of the accused.

It further guaranteed respect for the dignity of the defendant in the proceedings and ensured that all elements which were favourable to the defendant\u2019s legal position were brought before the court. Therefore, the defendant could not waive his or her right to legal assistance in the situations covered by Article 64 \u00a7 1 of the CCP.

In the light of these principles, the Court has to examine, first, whether relevant and sufficient grounds were provided for the legislative choice applied in the case at hand. Second, even if relevant and sufficient grounds were provided, it is still necessary to examine, in the context of the overall assessment of the fairness of the criminal proceedings, whether the domestic courts, when applying the impugned rule, also provided relevant and sufficient grounds for their decisions. In the latter connection, it will be relevant to assess whether an accused was afforded scope in practice to participate effectively in his or her trial.",

Under Article 64 \u00a7 1 (b) of the CCP in particular, in the version applicable at the relevant time, assistance by defence counsel was mandatory at the hearing before the investigating judge and during court hearings unless the proceedings could not result in a custodial sentence (see paragraphs 15 and 33 above). However, under the Portuguese Criminal Code almost all offences can, in principle, lead to a custodial sentence as this Code provides for the possibility of imposing a prison sentence even for most minor offences (see paragraph 49 above). Having regard also to the practice of the Portuguese courts (see paragraph 61 above), representation by legal counsel appears to be mandatory at all key stages of the criminal proceedings. Thus, none of the factors relied on in many other Contracting Parties to the Convention (see paragraphs 81-84 above), indicating that the assistance of defence counsel in criminal proceedings might be dispensed with, have to be addressed by the domestic courts when applying the relevant legislation. There is therefore no doubt that Portuguese law on criminal procedure is particularly restrictive when it comes to the possibility for accused persons to conduct their own defence without legal assistance if they wish to do so. The question whether Portuguese law is also restrictive when it comes to accused persons participating actively in their own defence is examined below (see paragraphs 156-59).",

Those rules seek to guarantee that the accused\u2019s interests are defended in a dispassionate manner. They are also offset by the power of the defendant to revoke any measure carried out on his behalf by defence counsel, and supported by the further possibilities for the accused to intervene in person at any time in the proceedings.

In its decision, the HRC emphasised that the wording of the Covenant clearly provided for a defence to be conducted in person or with legal assistance of one\u2019s own choosing, taking as its point of departure the right to conduct one\u2019s own defence. In this connection the HRC held that the right to conduct one\u2019s own defence, which was a cornerstone of justice, might be undermined when a lawyer was imposed against the wishes of the accused. Nevertheless, the HRC considered that the right to defend oneself without a lawyer was not absolute and that the interests of justice might require the assignment of a lawyer against the wishes of the accused. However, any restriction of the accused\u2019s wish to defend himself had to have an objective and sufficiently serious purpose and not go beyond what was necessary to uphold the interests of justice. The HRC gave particular examples where the interests of justice might require the assignment of a lawyer against the wishes of the accused: in cases of persons substantially and persistently obstructing the proper conduct of trial; cases of persons facing a grave charge but being unable to act in their own interests; and where this was necessary to protect vulnerable witnesses from further distress if the accused were to question them himself. In the particular case at hand the HRC found that Portugal had not provided any objective and sufficiently serious reasons why, in such a relatively simple case, the absence of a court-appointed lawyer would have jeopardised the interests of justice.",

In the other case cited by the majority, the Court did find a violation of Article\u00a06 because the applicant was not allowed to be present at her cassation hearing, and not simply because she was not allowed to appeal. What the Court has consistently held is that if a State sets up courts of appeal or cassation, it is \u201crequired to ensure that persons amenable to the law shall enjoy before these courts the fundamental guarantees contained in Article 6\u201d. This means that there is no \u201cright to appeal\u201d as such, but a right to enjoy Article 6 guarantees during the entirety of the proceedings: not being arbitrarily deprived of a right to appeal that is statutorily established, not suffering from inequality of arms at a higher stage of the proceedings, and so on.

Secondly, and more importantly, the German Code of Criminal Procedure established, and still establishes, self-representation as a general rule, to which the cases of mandatory legal counsel listed in Article 140 are an exception.

The key word in the sentence is \u201cnecessary\u201d, which corresponds to the test to be applied in the judicial \u201cholding\u201d. The necessity test is an integral part of the proportionality test. Secondly, when doing the balancing between the conflicting interests at stake, the interests of justice are to be put on one scale of the balance and the defendant\u2019s choice of form of representation on the other scale. Thirdly, the proportionality test (which includes the necessity test) is an implicit, overarching limitation clause of both rights enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention, the right to defend oneself in person and through legal assistance, no reason existing to treat the first limb of sub-paragraph (c) differently from the second limb in terms of the applicable implicit limitations.",

It would be hard to adhere to the strict disjunctive reading of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) in such a scenario.

First, in Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) the form of self-representation comes prior to that of legal assistance. Second, in the event of legal assistance, the person providing it is a mere agent of the defendant, assisting and not replacing him or her, and that is how the word \u201cthrough\u201d in the second part of the sentence can be more aptly interpreted.

This teleological construction of the Convention flows easily from the above-mentioned three grammatical characteristics of the text at stake. On the basis of the harmonious textual and teleological elements of interpretation, one cannot but conclude that respect for the defendant\u2019s autonomy as a legal subject is the lifeblood of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c).

The Court should have aligned itself with the HRC and concluded, on the one hand, that a general ban on self-representation was diametrically opposed to Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention and, on the other hand, that any restriction of the right of self-representation should \u201cnot go beyond what is necessary to uphold the interests of justice\u201d. This would be in line with the Court\u2019s previous case-law, as shown above. The Court has repeatedly admitted that, in order to justify limitations to the right to legal assistance of one\u2019s own choosing, domestic courts must present \u201crelevant and sufficient reasons for holding that this is necessary in the interests of justice\u201d. This implicit, overarching limitation clause of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) is also applicable to the right to self-representation in criminal procedure. In other words, any interference with that right must respect the core of everyone\u2019s right to defend him or herself and must observe the principle of proportionality. The central question in this regard is precisely to weigh the competing interests at stake, namely, on the one hand, the defendant\u2019s personal autonomy and, on the other hand, the public-interest reasons invoked by the national authorities to limit that autonomy.

Such an approach is called paternalism. We do not rule out the possibility that the State may impose such restrictions.

While we agree with this view we regret the fact that it was not supported by more detailed legal argument and in particular that the rationale and values underlying this right were not set forth by the Committee, as this omission deprives the views expressed of their persuasive force. It would have been useful to accompany the views expressed under the Covenant by more extensive reasoning explaining the interpretive choices made by the Committee.",

In any event, the respondent State has the obligation to adapt its domestic legislation to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the outcome of this case does not affect that obligation. The majority decided to challenge the Human Rights Committee, disregarding the provisions of the Convention and engaging in a fight for the preservation of the margin of appreciation under the Convention in an area where this margin of appreciation has in any event been considerably reduced by the entry into force of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The final result is simply an increased fragmentation of international human rights law.",

Moreover, the criminal proceedings involving the applicant, considered as a whole, were blatantly unfair and violated the right to a fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

In a past case involving very similar facts, the same applicant was refused leave to do so and was instead assigned a lawyer to represent him. A Chamber of this Court dismissed his application as manifestly ill-founded, on the grounds that it fell within the States\u2019 margin of appreciation whether to allow an accused to defend himself in person or to assign him a lawyer. Subsequently, the applicant submitted a communication based on those very same facts to the United Nations Human Rights Committee (hereinafter \u201cthe HRC\u201d), arguing that his analogous right under Article\u00a014 \u00a7 3 (d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights had been violated. In its Views adopted on 28 March 2006, the HRC found that the abovementioned right on the applicant\u2019s part had not been respected.",

Thus the accused is to be perceived as an autonomous subject of the proceedings, a position which was historically far from selfevident.

If proceedings are to be considered fair, the accused cannot be turned into an object of the proceedings and be compelled to testify against himself. The right not to incriminate oneself lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6. A situation where an accused is turned from a subject to an object of the proceedings would be fundamentally unfair.",

In a particular case, his choice may seem to be counterproductive, irrational or simply incompatible with what an independent observer would consider to be in the accused\u2019s best interest. However, in a democratic society an individual is in principle entitled to such choices for various reasons. First and foremost, the State is not omniscient. It might not necessarily understand the rationale behind the accused\u2019s actions and is not necessarily best placed to know what is good for his position in a particular set of criminal proceedings. Furthermore, the State\u2019s intervention is not necessarily designed in good faith. It might interfere with the defence in order to impose its own interests in a particular set of proceedings. Finally, autonomy as such is incompatible with outside interference. Just as a patient may in principle refuse medical assistance, an accused may refuse legal assistance.

Various convincing or even compelling reasons may exist calling for such intervention. First and foremost (a), the autonomy of the accused may be factually diminished, for example, on account of illness, disability or age. Equally (b), the autonomy of the accused may be considerably limited owing to the circumstances of the case. He may be in a situation of special vulnerability, for example in cases of deprivation of liberty coupled with a first appearance or questioning where the interview statement will be used in court, or during plea bargaining. In such situations, an attorney can reasonably act as a buffer preventing the State and its agents from overriding the subject status of the accused. The vulnerability is all the more evident where the accused is facing a long-term custodial sentence or other serious punishment. Likewise, the legal and factual complexity of a case may render the legal assistance of an attorney obligatory. Furthermore (c), the court may establish that the accused is conducting his defence in a manifestly irrational manner. Finally (d), it might be necessary for the court to intervene if the accused abuses his right to self-representation in order to undermine the authority of the court, or has a negative effect on the interest of his co-accused in having the proceedings conducted in an expeditious manner.

However, the Government failed to specify any interest of justice pertaining to the case in question and, in particular, why the applicant should be considered incapable of defending himself effectively.
