The kind of investigation that will achieve those purposes may vary according to the circumstances. However, whatever the method of investigation, the authorities must act as soon as an official complaint has been lodged. Even when strictly speaking no complaint has been made, an investigation must be started if there are sufficiently clear indications that torture or ill-treatment has been used (see, among other authorities, \u00d6zbey v. Turkey (dec.), no. 31883/96, 8 March 2001). The authorities must take into account the particularly vulnerable situation of victims of torture and the fact that people who have been subjected to serious ill-treatment will often be less ready or willing to make a complaint (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 97-98, Reports\u00a01996VI).",

That being said, the Court cannot but notice that the proceedings in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint have been pending before the domestic authorities for almost five years. The Prosecutor\u2019s Office was very slow in initiating the proceedings and it dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint twice on grounds which appear to have been based on a superficial investigation. In particular, in dismissing the complaint for the first time, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office appears to have relied exclusively on the statements of the accused police officers and disregarded the medical evidence, which was inconsistent with the accused police officers\u2019 version of the facts. In dismissing the complaint for the second time, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office again appears to have overlooked the inconsistency of the statements of the accused police officers with the medical documentation on some of the applicant\u2019s injuries. Moreover, no question appears to have been raised in respect of the sudden change in the statements of the accused officers in order to better accommodate the findings in the medical reports. Only in August 2008 did the Prosecutor\u2019s Office remit the case to the courts.\u00a0The situation does not appear to have improved in the proceedings before the courts, where the case has been pending for more than three years and where the Supreme Court has already ordered a re-examination on two occasions.",
