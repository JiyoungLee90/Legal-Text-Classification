The prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment encompasses the obligation not to send a person to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would run a real risk of being subjected to such methods. In order to avoid such a risk in given cases, certain States have chosen the route of seeking assurances from the country of destination that the person concerned will not be ill-treated. This practice is far from new, but has come under the spotlight in recent years as States have increasingly sought to remove from their territory persons deemed to endanger national security. Fears are growing that the use of diplomatic assurances is in fact circumventing the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment.",

However, if in fact there would appear to be a risk of ill-treatment, can diplomatic assurances received from the authorities of a country where torture and illtreatment is widely practised ever offer sufficient protection against that risk? It has been advanced with some cogency that even assuming those authorities do exercise effective control over the agencies that might take the person concerned into their custody (which may not always be the case), there can be no guarantee that\u00a0assurances given will be respected in practice.

Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention, the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v.

This description of the applicant was followed by a statement from the deputy head of the National Interpol Bureau in St\u00a0Petersburg and the Leningrad Region, in which the official stated in affirmative terms that the applicant \u201c... having studied the ideas of the political extremist movement ... had created the \u2018Khalka\u2019 group to spread the ideas of the Wahhabi movement in order to change the existing State order in Uzbekistan, seize power and remove lawfully elected officials\u00a0...\u201d. This statement was not limited to describing the status of the applicant\u2019s pending extradition but presented it as an established fact, without any qualification or reservation, that he had organised the criminal group and committed the offences.",

Given that the deputy head of the National Interpol Bureau represented the lawenforcement authorities when interviewed, he should have exercised particular caution in his choice of words when describing the criminal proceedings pending against the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Khuzhin and Others v. Russia, no. 13470/02, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, 23 October 2008, and Mokhov v. Russia, no. 28245/04, \u00a7\u00a7 31-32, 4 March 2010). Therefore, the Court considers that the official\u2019s statement must have encouraged the public to believe the applicant to be a criminal before he had been proved guilty according to law. Accordingly, the Court finds that there was a breach of the presumption of the applicant\u2019s innocence.",
