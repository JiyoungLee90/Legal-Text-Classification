The sole medical certificate produced by the applicant was issued on 21 July 2000 (see paragraph 25 above), which is eleven years after the date of the alleged ill-treatment. Even if the orthopaedic surgeon consulted by the applicant stated that he had first examined Mrs Olymbiou on 30 October 1993 (more than four years after the demonstration and arrest), the Court considers that such a delayed medical examination could not determine whether the injuries and pain alleged by the applicant had been provoked in the ambit of the events of 19\u00a0July 1989.",

The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 42, Reports 1996-III).",

The Court therefore concluded that when, as in the Foka case, an act of the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities was in compliance with laws in force within the territory of northern , it should in principle be regarded as having a legal basis in domestic law for the purposes of the Convention. It does not see any reason to depart, in the instant case, from that finding, which is not in any way inconsistent with the view adopted by the international community regarding the establishment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d or the fact that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus remains the sole legitimate government of Cyprus (see Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a025781/94, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 61 and 90, ECHR\u00a02001\u2013IV).",

Taking part in an unlawful assembly is an offence under section 71 of the Cypriot Criminal Code and is punishable by up to one year's imprisonment (see paragraph 34 above).

The Court further notes that according to Chapter 155, section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a police officer may, without warrant, arrest any person who commits in his presence any offence punishable with imprisonment or who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of his duty (see paragraph 37 above \u2013 see also Protopapa, cited above, \u00a7 61, and Chrysostomos and Papachrysostomou, Commission's report, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0147).",

Moreover, on the same day, during the court hearing, an interpreter explained in Greek that the suspects were accused of having illegally entered the territory of the \u201cTRNC\u201d and of having assaulted the local police (see paragraph 18 above).

In the Court's view, the intervention of the Turkish and/or Turkish-Cypriot forces was not due to the political nature of the demonstration but was provoked by its violent character and by the violation of the \u201cTRNC\u201d borders by some of the demonstrators (see Protopapa, cited above, \u00a7 110).",
