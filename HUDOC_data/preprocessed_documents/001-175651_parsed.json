The District Court granted the request, quashed the earlier judgments allowing the privatisation of the flats and re-examined the cases.

It granted the city\u2019s claims in full invalidating the decisions of the Ministry of the Defence in respect of the flats and ordering the applicants\u2019 eviction. The court also found that the applicants had acquired the flats in good faith. However, it ruled that the cases fell under one of the two exceptions to the protection of a bona fide purchaser\u2019s title, which required that precedence be given to the City of Moscow given that the flats had left the City\u2019s possession against the latter\u2019s will.",

The Court further reasoned that such restitution of property to the State or municipality, in the absence of any compensation paid to the bona fide owner, imposed an individual and excessive burden on the latter and failed to strike a fair balance between the demands of the public interest on the one hand and the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions on the other.",

The Court notes that the flats left the City\u2019s \u201cpossession\u201d as a result of the alleged fraud committed by a third party. The Court further observes that there were safeguards in place to ensure that the flats changed hands in accordance with the domestic law. The lawfulness of each transaction and title in respect of the flats were subject to control by registration authorities. The Government, however, did not proffer any explanation, as to why those safeguards had not been effective in detecting the fraud and protecting the City\u2019s interests. In particular, neither the domestic judicial authorities nor the Government clarified why it had been possible for the authorities to approve the transfer of title to the flats to new owners while the flats were still registered as the City\u2019s property and the City had not been a party to the relevant transactions. In such circumstances, the Court considers that it was not for the applicants to assume the risk of the title to the flat being revoked on account of the said omissions on the part of the authorities in procedures specially designed to prevent fraud in real-property transactions. The Court reiterates that mistakes or errors on the part of State authorities should serve to benefit the persons affected. In other words, the consequences of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Stolyarova, cited above, \u00a7 49). The Court therefore concludes that the forfeiture of the title to the flat by the applicants and the transfer of the ownership of the flats to the City of Moscow, in the circumstances of the case, placed a disproportionate and excessive burden on them. There has therefore been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention.",

In so far as the Government may be understood to argue that he did not exhaust domestic remedies in respect of the alleged violation of his rights, the Court observes that his family members took part in the proceedings and the national courts, having examined their arguments, found in favour of the city authorities and ordered their eviction. In such circumstances, the Court does not see how, if the complaint had also been raised by Mr Presnyakov, it could have led to a different outcome. Accordingly, it dismisses the Government\u2019s objection. The Government\u2019s objections are therefore dismissed.",
