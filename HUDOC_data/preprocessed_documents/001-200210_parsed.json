Instead, the available documents suggest that during his arrest and before being questioned for the first time upon the charges of Kl.\u2019s murder, the theft from K.\u2019s house and unlawful possession of ammunition, which were the subject matters of a different set of proceedings, the applicant was informed in writing of his right to legal assistance and expressly waived his right to a lawyer (see paragraphs 9, 12, 18 and 20 above). His waivers were permissible under domestic law at the time they were made as the charges at issue did not require mandatory legal representation. The authorities, therefore, cannot be held responsible for any consequences those waivers entailed for his conviction on those charges (see, Zakshevskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0112 and 113, and, mutatis mutandis, Sitnevskiy and Chaykovskiy v.

After the interview, he appeared before Investigator P. and confessed firstly to having committed a theft from K.\u2019s house and then to a number of murders (see paragraph 13 above). It is apparent from testimonies given by police officers in the domestic proceedings that they knew that the applicant was going to confess to murders as he had allegedly informed them of this fact (see paragraph 40 above). Assuming that it was so, the Court considers that from that time the police had every reason to suspect the applicant of having committed multiple murders, given that by then he had already confessed to the murder of Kl. The authorities thus must have been aware of the legal consequences such a charge would entail, including the risk of a life sentence, and that the domestic law barred waivers of the right to legal assistance in cases involving such a charge and entitled the applicant to mandatory legal representation (see Zakshevskiy, cited above,\u00a7 48).",

As a result, the exhumation of the alleged victims\u2019 corpses and the relevant forensic examinations as well as the inspections of the crime scene had been held.
