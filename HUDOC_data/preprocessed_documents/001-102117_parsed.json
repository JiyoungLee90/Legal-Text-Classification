Absent such leave, albeit he might be notified of a claimant's proposal to proceed against him, he was not to be troubled by such proceedings.

And that is not a protection that can be secured save by a clear and inflexible rule such as section 139(2) (and its legislative predecessors) have always hitherto been understood to provide. Just such a rule applies in respect of those adjudged vexatious litigants under section 42 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 and Parliament clearly intended to achieve the same result under the Mental Health Act legislation. Whether or not such protection is necessary or desirable is, of course, open to question and has, indeed, been extensively debated over recent years. But your Lordships' task is not to decide whether it is desirable but whether presently the legislation confers it.\u201d",

Nor can it be seen to have 'an effect out of all proportion to the aim which it is attempting to pursue.' Of course, in a rare case (perhaps such as this one) a combination of circumstances\u2014ignorance of the law (ie\u00a0of section 139(2)), the delay in the issue of proceedings until the very end of the six year limitation period, and the inflexibility of section 2 of the Limitation Act 1980 itself (assuming the defendant chooses to take the Limitation Act defence) will operate to deprive the prospective claimant of his claim. But that, of course, is equally so in the case of a litigant in person ignorant of the six year limitation period itself. In each case the loss of the claim is the price paid for certainty\u2014just as there is a price to be paid for the established principle (and the assurance it provides) protecting various classes of prospective defendant against claims in negligence ... None of these cases can properly be characterised as a denial of access to the courts contrary to article 6 and it seems to me unsurprising that the point was not even taken in the courts below.\u201d",

But it is not obviously rational to brand every person who is or has been subject to the compulsory powers in the Mental Health Act as a potential vexatious litigant. There are some compulsory patients who suffer from paranoid delusions; there are some who suffer from psychopathic disorders who may be more inclined than others to make trouble. But the blanket restriction in section 139(2) takes no account of these subtleties. It assumes that everyone who has ever been subject to Mental Health Act compulsion is automatically suspect. This is not only empirically unproven. It certainly cannot be taken for granted when Mental Health Act powers may be exercised by people with no mental health expertise whatsoever. On the one hand, therefore, section 139(2) goes too far. On the other hand, however, it may not go far enough, because it is limited to acts done in pursuance of the Mental Health Act itself. If certain mental patients are ex hypothesi vexatious litigants, then people who exercise authority over them otherwise than under the Mental Health Act may also deserve protection.",

Further, the domestic courts had proceeded on the basis that the defendant would rely on the 1980 Act and the Circuit Judge had expressly considered whether it would be open to the applicant to make an application for leave and had concluded that the defendant would raise the limitation defence (see paragraph 18 above).

This Court is concerned with the supervision of the implementation by Contracting States of their obligations under the Convention. It cannot, and must not, usurp the role of Contracting States whose responsibility it is to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined therein are respected and protected on a domestic level. The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection. States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see Akdivar and Others v.

First, the Court considers it highly improbable that, having successfully applied to strike out part of the claim on the basis that the limitation period had expired (see paragraph 15 above), the defendant in the domestic proceedings would nonetheless not have raised the Limitation Act defence in subsequent proceedings regarding the remainder of the claim. In this regard, it observes that the domestic courts appear to have operated on the assumption that if the proceedings were held to be a nullity, the applicant would be without further recourse in respect of this part of his claim (see paragraph 18 and generally the opinions handed down in the House of Lords at paragraphs 23-31 above).",

However, it is not suggested that the applicant falls under any of the above categories. The Court observes that, according to the Government, section 139(2) of the 1983 Act is not directed at limiting the power of individuals to commence any court proceedings whatsoever but at restricting access to court for anyone who wishes to complain about the exercise of powers under the 1983 Act when the claim is manifestly unmeritorious. This explanation is supported by the terms of section 139(2) itself, which make it clear that the requirement to obtain leave applies to all seeking to pursue a claim under the Act, whether of unsound mind or not. The Court is thus satisfied that the provision is aimed at providing an additional layer of protection for those exercising sensitive powers under the 1983 Act and does not assume that all those who are, or have been, subject to the compulsory powers contained in the Mental Health Act 1983 are potential vexatious litigants.",

In that case, the Court concluded that the aim was legitimate (\u00a7\u00a058 of the judgment). In the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that the protection from litigation afforded by section 139(2) benefitted the police, who were the respondent to the applicant's claim. In principle, it considers that closer scrutiny is required in respect of provisions which restrict access to court in cases alleging an abuse of power by the police. However, the Court notes that the restriction in section 139(2) of the 1983 Act was in the form of an additional procedural requirement before the commencement of a civil claim and did not grant any immunity from civil proceedings. Further, any request for leave was considered by an independent High Court judge and would be granted in the case of a well-founded claim. Given the sensitive nature of the section 136 power, and the difficult and urgent circumstances in which that power is likely to be exercised, the Court considers that the general aim of protecting those who exercise powers under that Act, including the police, by requiring a claimant to demonstrate a prima facie case before being permitted to commence a claim, pursued a legitimate aim.",

The Court recalls that the effect of the application of the relevant legislation in the applicant's case was that his claim against the police regarding misuse of powers under section 136 of the 1983 Act was struck out at a time when the limitation period for commencing such an action had expired. In this regard, the Court observes, first, that the incident which prompted the applicant's claim occurred in December 1997. However, no steps appear to have been taken by the applicant to seek redress for the alleged abusive behaviour of the police until 5 August 2003, when his solicitors sent a letter to the police (see paragraph 11 above). No explanation has been provided for this delay. The letter itself contended that there was no justification for the applicant's detention under section 136 of the 1983 Act. It was thus clear to the applicant at that time, if not before, that the detention of the applicant in December 1997 had been based on section 136 of the 1983 Act. It should equally have been apparent to the applicant's legal advisers at that time that any subsequent court claim would require the leave of the High Court by virtue of section 139(2) of that same Act. The applicant has not argued before the court that he and his solicitors were unaware of the requirement for leave. Nor has he suggested that there was insufficient time between August 2003 and the expiry of the limitation period in December 2003 for the necessary leave to be sought from the High Court. Indeed, he has offered no explanation for his failure to comply with the requirement to seek leave. Had he sought the prior leave as requested or lodged his claim in sufficient time to rectify the oversight and obtain the necessary leave, the merits of his claim would have been considered.",

The Court emphasises that the applicant had received legal advice in respect of his complaint against the police and did not suggest that he was unaware of the applicable limitation period. The Court has previously found that a six-year limitation period in respect of personal injury claims was compatible with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (Stubbings and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 56-57). In the present case, the nature of the incident forming the basis of the claim was apparent at the time and there is no suggestion that the applicant only became aware of a potential claim against the police at a later date (compare and contrast Stubbings and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 17).",

Following the decision of the House of Lords, the applicant was not wholly deprived of the opportunity to pursue his claim as only the parts of the claim relating to the exercise of powers under section 136 of the 1983 Act were a nullity and it was open to him to continue with the parts of his claim which had been lodged within the relevant limitation period and which did not relate to the exercise of those powers.",

He has provided no explanation to justify his delay in lodging his claim or his failure to seek prior leave. In the particular circumstances of the present case, the decision to strike out the applicant's claim did not impair the very essence of the applicant's right of access to court and was not disproportionate.",
