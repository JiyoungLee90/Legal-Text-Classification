Galperin.
The applicants complained, in particular, about their conditions of their detention and transfer to and from prison, the length of their pre-trial detention and of excessively long proceedings in the judicial review of their detention.
The above-mentioned complaints were communicated to the Government between 30 June and 1 December 2016 and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The three applicants were born in 1980, 1981 and 1983 respectively and are in detention in Moscow.
The facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
The applicant was arrested on 8 March 2015 on suspicion of murder.
On 8 March 2015 a court ordered his pre-trial detention, which was further extended on several occasions, in particular on 24 August and 25 November 2015. The applicant appealed against the extension orders on 26 August and 26 November 2015 respectively. The appeals were dismissed on 16 December 2015 and on 8 February 2016.
The applicant has been detained in remand prison no. 77/6 in Moscow since 17 March 2015, except for twenty-one days in May 2015 when he was detained in remand prison no. 77/1 in Moscow (hereinafter “IZ-77/6” and “IZ-77/1”). In IZ-77/6 the applicant has around 3 square metres (sq.m) of personal space, the cell is extremely hot in the summer and extremely damp in the winter, it lacks natural light and fresh air, while access to potable water and hot water is restricted. The applicant has not been provided with bedding and can have no more than one ten-minute shower a week. Daily physical exercise in the fresh air is limited to one hour.

Personal space in the van was limited and there was not enough fresh air; the applicant had no access to a toilet and no food or drinking water was provided. Upon his arrival to the court building and before returning to the remand prison he was detained for about 15 hours in a convoy cell where he disposed of around 0.5 sq. m of personal space and had no access to natural light, fresh air, the toilet or drinking water.
The applicants were arrested on 7 March 2015 on suspicion of murder.

On 12 May 2015 the applicants were transported from remand prison No. 77/2 in Moscow (“IZ-77/2”) to the Moscow City Court and back in a prison van. The conditions of the applicants’ transfer to and from the court building were identical to those described by the applicant in case no. 18496/16.
By a letter of 26 October 2016 the Government asked the Court to strike application no. 18496/16 out of its list and enclosed the text of a unilateral declaration with a view to resolving the issues it raised.
On 13 December 2016 the applicant’s lawyer disclosed the terms of the Government’s declaration to the media stating that the Russian Government and the Court had “entered into an agreement under which Russia [would] pay a compensation” of six thousand euro to the applicant, that “Russia ha[d] acknowledged” the violations and that the applicant was “thinking over the offer but [would] most likely accept it”. The lawyer’s statements were published, in particular, on the websites of the Vedomosti and Kommersant newspapers and on the website of the Ria Novosti news agency.
On 14 December 2016 the applicant accepted the Government’s declaration.
By letters of 12 December 2016 the applicants in applications nos. 61249/16 and 61253/16 were informed of the Court’s decision to communicate their applications to the Government. The information note in the Russian language attached to the letters included, inter alia, information on the strictly confidential nature of all friendly-settlement negotiations. The Court also provided the parties with declarations prepared by the Registry, aimed at securing a friendly settlement of the cases.
On 30 January 2017 the applicants’ lawyer informed several media outlets that the Court “had found for the applicants and awarded 6,500 euros to each [applicant]”. That information was published, in particular, on the websites of the Kommersant, Vedomosti and Izvestiya newspapers.
