It notes that the Federal Social Court ruled in a leading decision that disputes over the allowance belonged to the realm of labour law because the allowance was so closely linked to the contract of employment and the occupation as ballet dancer (see \u00a7 10 above). The Court observes that the applicant was not affected in her relations with the administrative authorities as such, acting in the exercise of discretionary powers; she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming an individual, economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in the regulation of the Minister of Culture. The protection of this basic right is, moreover, organised in such a way that at the judicial stage disputes over it come within the jurisdiction of the labour courts. Therefore, and despite the public law features pointed out by the Government, the Court sees no convincing reason to question that the entitlement to the allowance was a \u201ccivil\u201d right within the meaning of its case-law (see, mutatis mutandis, Mennitto v. Italy [GC], no. 33804/96, \u00a7\u00a028, ECHR 2000X).",
