The Court has already distinguished on several occasions between complaints about police brutality made for the purpose of contesting evidence in the criminal proceedings, on one hand, and a civil action aimed at establishing the existence of ill-treatment which may eventually result in a compensation award, on the other hand (see Ksenzov v.

In any event, the exercise of the guarantees inherent in the right to a fair trial cannot depend on the court's giving a preliminary assessment of the claim as potentially successful. A distinction must be made, in this respect, between claims that are not genuine and serious (see Skorobogatykh v. Russia, cited above, and the Court's finding in paragraphs 28 and 29 above) and claims that are unlikely to succeed for lack of evidence. Given that the applicant's claim was, by its nature, largely based on his personal experience, his statement would have been an important part of the plaintiff's presentation of the case, and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings. In refusing to order his attendance, the domestic courts therefore failed to ensure a fair hearing of the applicant's claim.",
