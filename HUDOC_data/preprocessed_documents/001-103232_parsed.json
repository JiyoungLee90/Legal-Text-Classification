There is nothing in the text of Article 5 to suggest that this provision prevents that measure from being applied by the State to an individual abusing alcohol, in order to limit the harm caused by alcohol to himself and the public, or to prevent dangerous behaviour after drinking. On this point, the Court observes that there can be no doubt that the harmful use of alcohol poses a danger to society and that a person who is in a state of intoxication may pose a danger to himself and others, regardless of whether or not he is addicted to alcohol. Therefore, under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) of the Convention, persons who are not medically diagnosed as \u201calcoholics\u201d, but whose conduct and behaviour under the influence of alcohol pose a threat to public order or themselves, can be taken into custody for the protection of the public or their own interests, such as their health or personal safety. At the same time, it means that Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) of the Convention does not permit detention of an individual merely because of his alcohol intake (see Witold Litwa v. Poland, no. 26629/95, \u00a7\u00a7 61-64, ECHR 2000III, and Hilda Hafsteinsd\u00f3ttir v.\u00a0Iceland, no. 40905/98, \u00a7 42, 8 June 2004).",

On this point, the Convention essentially refers back to national law and states an obligation to comply with its substantive and procedural provisions. It also requires that any measure depriving the individual of his liberty must be compatible with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see K.-F. v. Germany, 27 November 1997, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VII). The detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less stringent measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or the public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained. That means that it does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is in conformity with national law, it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see Witold Litwa, cited above, \u00a7 78, and Enhorn, cited above, \u00a7 42).",

The applicant disputed the Government's version of events, noting that it was based on written statements by a shop assistant, Ms V., and a shop security guard, Mr G., which they had made almost four years after the events under consideration. Bearing in mind the primary role played by national authorities, notably courts, in interpreting and applying national law, the Court finds it particularly regrettable that it has to resolve the difference of opinion between the applicant and the Government in a situation when, and this was the argument on which the Government strongly relied in their submissions, at no point in the proceedings did the domestic courts review the applicant's behaviour prior to his admission to the sobering-up centre, and determined whether it had presented a danger to the applicant's own or public safety, thus necessitating his detention in the sobering-up centre. Before embarking on the analysis of other matters which could have warranted the authorities' conclusion that it was necessary to detain the applicant, the Court considers it important to stress that there can be no question of the authority of a State in the exercise of its police power to regulate the management and use of alcohol with a view to preventing or limiting harm which an intoxicated person is capable of causing to himself or to public order. The right to exercise this power is so manifest in the interest of public health and welfare that it is unnecessary to enter into a discussion of it beyond saying that it is too firmly established to be successfully called into question. The Court further observes that State regulation could take a number of valid forms. A State might establish a programme of compulsory treatment for those addicted to alcohol, or introduce a measure of requiring short periods of involuntary confinement for intoxicated persons. In both cases the limitation imposed on the individual's right to liberty would only be justified by the interests of the protection of the well-being of the individual or others around him.",

Although not disputing the State's interest in protecting public morality, the Court, having regard to the prominent place which the right to liberty holds in a democratic society, considers that detention of an individual for the mere reason that his physical appearance, under the influence of alcohol, presents an insult to public morals, is incompatible with the purpose of sub-paragraph (e) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Witold Litwa, cited above, \u00a7 62). An offensive physical appearance, standing alone, is not a sufficient ground upon which to justify detention; this rationale would be only a step away from introducing a system of compulsory confinement for any abnormal appearance which might be perceived by some as offensive or insulting to human dignity and public morality. Mere public intolerance or animosity cannot justify the deprivation of a person's liberty, particularly so because the loss of liberty produced by the detention is more than a loss of freedom from confinement, since it can engender adverse social consequences for the individual.",

In particular, on the basis of the written statement by the shop assistant, Ms V., and shop guard, Mr\u00a0G., as well as the official reports filed by the police officers in the aftermath of the events on 11 October 2001, the Court finds it established that in the evening of 11 October 2001 the applicant had a heated argument in the shop with assistant V. Following the applicant's refusal, accompanied by the use of offensive language and threats, to leave the shop, the police were called and escorted the applicant from the shop. In the street the applicant continued his unruly conduct attempting to start a fight with the police officers, waving his hands about, using offensive language and throwing his bag around. Similar behaviour continued in the police car and later in the sobering-up centre. In these circumstances the Court is able to conclude that the applicant's arrest and subsequent detention in the sobering-up centre were effected on account of his conduct in a state of serious intoxication, causing a disturbance in a public place and presenting a danger to other individuals or himself, as described in paragraph 18 of the Regulations (see paragraph 23 above). The Court is of the opinion that the police had sufficient reasons to detain the applicant in the centre until he had sobered up, having given serious regard to his right to liberty and having balanced it against the public interests of maintaining order and guaranteeing security of other individuals. The Court further considers that the police had no other means at their disposal but to detain the applicant, that is to say the applicant's detention was the last resort in the circumstances of the case.",

It also appears that the police contemplated less serious measures, found them insufficient to safeguard the public interest and reasonably considered that it was necessary to detain the applicant (see, for similar reasoning, Hilda Hafsteinsd\u00f3ttir, cited above, \u00a7 52). Moreover, the Court considers that by releasing the applicant immediately after he had sobered up and gone through the administrative formalities the authorities struck a fair balance between the need to safeguard public order and interest of other individuals and the applicant's right to liberty (see, by contrast, Enhorn, cited above, \u00a7 55).",

Adopting a relaxed approach, it stressed that Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) applied not only to cases of detention of \u201calcoholics\u201d in the limited clinical meaning of the term, but also to cases of detention of persons under the influence of alcohol. However, the Court insisted that, for the detention of such person to be considered \u201clawful\u201d, two additional criteria had to be present: the person must have posed a danger to himself or to public safety, and the detention must have been a measure of last resort, after the domestic authorities had considered other measures but had found them to be insufficient for the protection of the public interest.",

This finding is based on a disputed version presented by the Government, relying on written statements by a shop assistant and a shop security guard made almost four years after the events under consideration (paragraph 42). The factual findings of the Court go far beyond the findings of the domestic courts. This raises a methodological issue, which will be dealt with separately in the second part of the present dissenting opinion. It suffices to mention here that the sole justification for the applicant's detention in the sobering-up centre was his physical appearance, which, according to the domestic authorities, had been offensive to human dignity and public morals as a result of his inebriation.",
