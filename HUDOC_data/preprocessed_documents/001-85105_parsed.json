The Presidium of the Stavropol Regional Court conducted a full review of the case, and quashed not only the two most recent judgments which had been contested by the company, but also of its own motion quashed another judgment adopted earlier in the proceedings and reinstated the judgment which had been previously quashed on appeal (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above).",

In the Court\u2019s view, only errors of fact which could not have been corrected by an ordinary appeal because they became apparent only after the judgment had acquired binding force could be considered a circumstance of a substantial and compelling character justifying a departure from the principle of legal certainty. The Court observes that the arguments invoked by the company in its application for supervisory review were identical to those invoked in its grounds for appeal. Since these arguments have been already examined and rejected by the appeal court, the supervisory review proceedings were, in essence, an attempt by the company to re-argue the case on the same points which failed on appeal.",

The quashing of the enforceable judgment frustrated the applicant\u2019s reliance on the binding judicial decision and deprived him of an opportunity to retain the disputed money and to receive an additional sum of money he had legitimately expected to receive. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the quashing of the enforceable judgment of 10\u00a0October 2002, as upheld on 27\u00a0November 2002, by way of supervisory review placed an excessive burden on the applicant and was incompatible with Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01.
