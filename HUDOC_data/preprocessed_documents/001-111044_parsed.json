The Grand Chamber points out that the Hirst judgment makes no explicit mention of the intervention of a judge among the essential criteria for determining the proportionality of a disenfranchisement measure. The relevant criteria relate solely to whether the measure is applicable generally, automatically and indiscriminately within the meaning indicated by the Court (see paragraphs 85, 86 and 96 above). While the intervention of a judge is in principle likely to guarantee the proportionality of restrictions on prisoners\u2019 voting rights, such restrictions will not necessarily be automatic, general and indiscriminate simply because they were not ordered by a judge. Indeed, the circumstances in which the right to vote is forfeited may be detailed in the law, making its application conditional on such factors as the nature or the gravity of the offence committed.",

In addition, the length of the sentence actually served may be reduced in accordance with the early release mechanism provided for in section 54 (1) of Law no. 354 of 1975, under the terms of which a reduction of forty-five days for every six months served is granted if the detainee takes part in the re-education scheme (see paragraph 39 above).

The fact that in its recapitulation of the arguments in paragraph 82 of the Hirst judgment the Court does not repeat this argument does not in my view in any way diminish its relevance and importance in the finding of a violation. It is to be noted in this connection that in sentencing the applicant in the present case the Italian courts did not make any specific reference to his disenfranchisement, and it is not apparent, beyond the fact that a court considered it appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment, that there is any direct link between the facts of his case and the removal of his right to vote.",

                        "content": "As to the second point, just like the United Kingdom legislation, Italy\u2019s legislation, is a blunt instrument stripping of their Convention right to vote a significant number of persons and doing so in an indiscriminate manner and to a large extent regardless of the nature of their crimes, the length of their sentences and their individual circumstances. In this regard it is worth recapitulating the differences between the two States\u2019 legislation. In the  section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (\u201cthe 1983 Act\u201d) provides that a convicted person, during the time he is detained in a penal institution, is legally incapable of voting in any parliamentary or local election. This disqualification does not apply to persons imprisoned for contempt of court (section 3(2)(a)) or to those imprisoned only for default in, for example, paying a fine (section 3(2)(c)) (see Hirst, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 23). Moreover, under this legislation prisoners automatically regain their right to vote on release from prison (Hirst \u00a7 51). In Italy Section 2 of Decree 223/1967 provides that persons sentenced to penalties entailing a ban from public office may not vote. The consequence of this is that persons sentenced to less than three years in prison continue to enjoy the right to vote. Those sentenced to three to five years forfeit their right to vote for five years, and lastly, persons sentenced to five years or more are deprived of their right to vote for life. Thus the loss of the right to vote under the Italian system is an automatic consequence of deprivation of the right to hold public office.",

                        "content": "The main difference between the two is that the Italian legislation deprives of voting rights only those who are sentenced to three years or more in prison, while the United Kingdom\u2019s legislation deprives all persons sentenced to imprisonment, for the duration of their time in prison. While the Italian legislation may seem for this reason to be more lenient in comparison with that of the , it is stricter in the sense that it deprives prisoners of their right to vote beyond the duration of their prison sentence and, for a large group of prisoners, for life. Therefore, unlike the majority, I find that these differences are not sufficient to reach a different conclusion. In fact the Italian legislation is just as blunt as the legislation in the , albeit for slightly different reasons. The fact that a former prisoner may, under Articles 178 and 179 of the Italian Criminal Code, apply for rehabilitation three years after the date on which the principal penalty was completed does not alter that. Moreover, I find that it makes no difference that disenfranchisement under Italian law follows from a ban on holding public office. The result is nonetheless automatic forfeiture of the right to vote as a result of a prison sentence. Furthermore, there is not necessarily any link between the right of an individual to hold public office and his right to vote in general elections.",

No sufficient assessment of proportionality has been made in the present case, either by the legislature or by the courts, as regards the justification for depriving all these prisoners in Italy of their voting rights beyond the end of their prison sentence, and many of them for life, as a result of their forfeiture of the right to hold public office.",

The present judgment offers a very narrow interpretation of the Hirst judgment and in fact a retreat from the main arguments advanced therein.
