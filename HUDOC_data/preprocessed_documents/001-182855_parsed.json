Turkey [GC], no.\u00a036391/02, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2008). The Court does not consider it necessary to examine whether the systematic nature of the restriction on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer was, in itself, sufficient to find a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention, as, in any event, the Government have not offered any compelling reasons for the restriction or demonstrated that the absence of legal assistance at the initial stage of the investigation did not irretrievably prejudice the applicant\u2019s defence rights (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 58, and Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 50541/08, 50571/08, 50573/08 and 40351/09, \u00a7\u00a0274, ECHR 2016). In that respect, the Court notes that in convicting the applicant, the first-instance court not only relied on the applicant\u2019s incriminatory statements before it, but also on her more detailed statements to the police. Moreover, it did not examine the admissibility of evidence at the trial. Likewise, the Court of Cassation dealt with this issue in a formalistic manner and failed to remedy this shortcoming (see Bayram Ko\u00e7 v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 38907/09, \u00a7 23, 5 September 2017).",
