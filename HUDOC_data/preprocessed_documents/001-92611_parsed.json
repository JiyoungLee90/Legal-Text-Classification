Bearing in mind the special character of these proceedings, the court was of the view that at this stage the mere fact that the convicted person was granted legal aid was sufficient to ensure an effective exercise of his or her defence rights. It was the lawyer\u2019s task to analyse the case and establish whether there were grounds on which to lodge a cassation appeal against the judgment of the appellate court. If the lawyer was of the opinion that there were no grounds on which to do so, there was no legal basis in the Code of Criminal Procedure that would either oblige the lawyer to prepare such an appeal against his or her better judgment, or oblige the court to assign another lawyer to prepare such an appeal in the case.",

It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of 1 December 1999. The Supreme Court observed that the court could only assign a new legal-aid lawyer to the case if it were shown that the first lawyer had been negligent in his or her task of assessing whether a cassation appeal had any prospects of success. If this were not the case, a court was not obliged to assign a new legal-aid lawyer to represent the convicted person and its refusal was not subject to appeal (III KZ 139/99).",

It examined a particular situation where a legal-aid lawyer had refused to represent a convicted person for the purposes of cassation proceedings, finding that a cassation appeal would offer no prospects of success. It held that in such a situation the appellate court was obliged to instruct the defendant that the time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run only on the date on which the defendant was served with the lawyer\u2019s refusal and not on the earlier date when the judgment of the appellate court was served on the defendant himself. It stated that it was not open to doubt that a defendant faced with the legal-aid lawyer\u2019s refusal had a right to take other measures to seek legal assistance necessary for an effective lodging of a cassation appeal (III KZ 87/01). The Supreme Court reiterated its position in a decision of 6 May 2008 and in a number of similar decisions given in 2008. It observed that there had been certain discrepancies in the judicial practice as to the manner in which the time-limit in such situations was calculated, but the strand of the case-law launched by the decision given in February 2002 was both dominant and correct, and also accepted by doctrine as providing to the defendants adequate procedural guarantees of access to the Supreme Court within a reasonable time-frame (II KZ 16/08).",

The Court is aware that under the caselaw of the Supreme Court the mere refusal of a legalaid lawyer to prepare a cassation appeal did not constitute a sufficient ground for a new lawyer to be assigned to the case under the legalaid scheme (see paragraphs 23\u201324 and 26 above). However, the Court is of the view that Article 6 of the Convention does not confer on the State an obligation to ensure assistance by successive legalaid lawyers for the purposes of pursuing legal remedies which have already been found not to offer reasonable prospects of success. In the present case the first lawyer appointed under the legalaid scheme found no legal grounds on which to prepare a cassation appeal. In the absence of indications of negligence or arbitrariness on the lawyer\u2019s part in discharging her duties, the State can be said to have complied with its obligations to provide effective legal aid to the applicant in connection with the cassation proceedings.",

The failure of the Katowice Court of Appeal to inform the applicant, who was not represented by a lawyer, of his procedural rights meant that he had no way of knowing that he had a new time-frame within which to find a lawyer who might be persuaded to file a cassation appeal on his behalf. The Court notes in this connection that the procedural framework governing the making available of legal aid for a cassation appeal in criminal cases, as described above, is within the control of the appellate courts. When notified of a legal-aid lawyer\u2019s refusal to prepare a cassation appeal, it is entirely appropriate and consistent with fairness requirements, that an appeal court indicate to an appellant what further procedural options are available to him or her. The Supreme Court\u2019s case-law stresses this point.

When assessing whether an interference was \u201cnecessary\u201d the Court will take into account the margin of appreciation left to the State authorities but it is a duty of the respondent State to demonstrate the existence of the pressing social need motivating the interference (see, among other authorities, McLeod\u00a0v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, judgment of 23\u00a0September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, p.\u00a02791, \u00a7\u00a052; P\u0142oski\u00a0v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a026761/95, \u00a7 35, 12\u00a0November 2002; and Baginski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a037444/97, \u00a7 89, 11\u00a0October 2005).",

In particular, it has not been shown when the relevant decisions were given by the domestic authorities and on what grounds they held that the restrictions were justified. Nor did the applicant specify the periods during which these restrictions remained in force. In the absence of detailed factual submissions in support of this complaint, it is impossible for the Court to examine, in particular, whether the authorities considered any alternative means of ensuring that the applicant\u2019s contact with his children would not obstruct the process of taking evidence. Such alternative restrictions could entail, for example, supervision of their visits by a prison officer or possibly also other restrictions on the nature, frequency and duration of contact (see Klamecki (no.2) v.\u00a0, no.\u00a031583/96, \u00a7\u00a0151, 3\u00a0April 2003). In this context the Court notes that it is reasonable to assume that different restrictions were called for during the investigation and, later on, when the proceedings entered their judicial stage. However, an examination of the restrictions imposed on the applicant\u2019s contacts and correspondence with his family from the angle of their proportionality with the legitimate aim sought would only have been possible had the applicant made sufficiently detailed submissions as to the facts. In the light of the information before it the Court considers that it has not been shown that the measures complained of went beyond what was necessary in a democratic society \u201cto prevent disorder and crime\u201d in the context of family visits in prison during pre-trial detention and an on-going criminal investigation.",

Additionally, I do not see this problem as related exclusively to criminal proceedings. It also concerns both civil and administrative ones, although the facts of this case do not allow me to extend my opinion to such proceedings.",

The letter containing both the legal-aid lawyer\u2019s decision not to lodge a cassation appeal and the court\u2019s decision not to appoint another legal-aid lawyer was served on the applicant only two days before the time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal was to expire. The main reason for the Chamber to find a violation of Article\u00a06, in accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law, was \u201cthat the relevant procedural framework available under Polish law as from February 2002 was not applied in the applicant\u2019s case in such a manner as to afford him a realistic opportunity of taking further steps to have his cassation appeal lodged with and argued before the Supreme Court and to have thereby his access to a court secured in an effective manner\u201d. However, in my view, the refusal by a lawyer appointed under a legal-aid scheme to prepare grounds of appeal for consideration by the Supreme Court, as well as the requirements for lodging a cassation appeal, are issues that represent a breach of the applicant\u2019s right of access to the court and reflect the existence of a serious problem in the legal-aid scheme set up by the Polish legislation in general.",

The applicant in this case complained that as a result of the legal-aid lawyer\u2019s refusal to lodge a cassation appeal he had been denied effective access to the Supreme Court. The provisions of Article\u00a06 stipulate that everyone charged with a criminal offence has, among other rights, a right \u201cto defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.\u201d",

The negligence of the first legal-aid lawyer, additionally, had to \u201cbe shown\u201d in separate civil proceedings against the lawyer for compensation, the applicant being required to prove that the court should, in the circumstances, have assigned a new legal-aid lawyer. To my mind, this part of the legal-aid scheme is simply too far removed from what I would consider sufficient to ensure effective access to the court.",

Nevertheless, in my opinion, they should have been further developed and taken a step further in order to criticise the conceptual confusion surrounding the domestic provisions governing the legalaid scheme, namely the fact that under the applicable domestic regulations the legal-aid lawyer is not obliged to prepare a written legal opinion on the prospects of success of the appeal and, moreover, the law does not set any standards as to the quality of the legal advice that has to be given to justify the lawyer\u2019s refusal to lodge the appeal.",

                        "content": "Furthermore, I strongly believe that the decision whether a case offers reasonable prospects of success should not be taken by a legal-aid lawyer. I would stress in this connection that the right of access to the Supreme Court should be based on the idea that each and every individual should be granted the right to state his case before a last-instance jurisdiction if she or he considers that the law has been violated or misinterpreted by the lower courts. Giving a right to a legal-aid lawyer to decide on the fate of the case even before it is brought before the Supreme Court and without any written reasons for that decision, is, for me, arbitrary, even, as Judge Bonello pointed out, capricious. Of course, a legalaid lawyer\u2019s opinion should matter. However, I see legal-aid more in terms of free legal representation than legal advice or, even worse, only the legal (and very personal) attitude of an individual having no judicial status. Additionally, as a Judge, I find the formula \u201cin a legal-aid lawyer\u2019s opinion, a cassation appeal lacked prospects of success\u201d not only arbitrary, but offensive and prejudicial, especially bearing in mind the fact that the Court of Appeal in this case relied on this \u201copinion\u201d by refusing the applicant\u2019s requests for the appointment of a new legal-aid lawyer and thereby finally preventing the applicant from having his case decided by the highest judicial authority. That is what I see as the essence of this problem and that is why I think that the European Court\u2019s case-law should have dealt with this situation more carefully instead of finding a violation of Article 6 for the sole reason that the time-limits set by the Polish legislation had not been respected.",
