Austria, no. 23459/94, 30.01.01, \u00a7\u00a7 24-25, to be published in ECHR-2001), except where there has already been a substantial delay before the entry into force of this provision on 1 January 1990 (Holzinger (no. 2) v.

Shortly before then, the Court had given a decision in which it had found, in general terms, that Section 91 of the Courts Act was not an effective remedy as regards length of proceedings (Holzinger (no. 2) v. Austria [decision], no. 28898/95, 12.10.1999, unreported). However, at that time this was the Court\u2019s only decision on the issue and it had not yet been confirmed by a judgment. This is all the more important, as it cannot be said that there was any constant case-law of the Commission with regard to Section 91 of the Courts Act. Moreover, on 2 December 1999, the Court found that an application under Articles 108 and 109 of the Portuguese Code of Criminal Procedure was an effective remedy as regards complaints about the length of proceedings (Tom\u00e9 Mota v. Portugal [decision], no. 32082/96, ECHR 1999-IX). This remedy is comparable to an application under Section 91 of the Austrian Courts Act, as it provides for an interlocutory application which allows a superior authority inter alia to fix a time-limit for taking a procedural measure which the competent court has failed to take. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the Government could have been expected to raise the issue of non-exhaustion either in their observations on admissibility, or at least following the Tom\u00e9 Mota decision, which was given well before the Court\u2019s admissibility decision of 21 November 2000 in the present case. As there are no particular reasons which would have absolved the Government from raising this objection in the proceedings on admissibility, they are estopped from doing so now (see also the recent judgment in the case of Schweighofer and Others v. Austria, no. 35673/97, 09.10.01, \u00a7 26, concerning the same issue).",
