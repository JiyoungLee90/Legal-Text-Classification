Satakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi Oy and Satamedia Oy, judgment of 16 December 2008 (Grand Chamber)). It found first of all that the activities in question constituted \u201cprocessing of personal data\u201d to which the Directive applied. Moreover, activities involving the processing of personal data such as that relating to personal data files which contained solely, and in unaltered form, material that had already been published in the media, also fell within the scope of the Directive. In order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society, it was necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly. However, in order to achieve a balance between the two fundamental rights, the protection of the fundamental right to privacy required that the derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of data provided for in the Directive had to apply only in so far as was strictly necessary. In conclusion, activities such as those involved in the domestic proceedings, relating to data from documents which were in the public domain under national legislation, could be classified as \u201cjournalistic activities\u201d if their object was to disclose to the public information, opinions or ideas, irrespective of the medium which was used to transmit them. They were not limited to media undertakings and could be undertaken for profitmaking purposes.",

The court noted first that the term \u201cjournalism\u201d was not defined in Directive 95/46/EC but that, according to the Court of Justice of the European Union, it was necessary to interpret notions relating to freedom of expression, such as journalism, broadly. However, when balanced against the right to privacy, any derogations to the latter were to be kept only to what was strictly necessary. When balancing the right to freedom of expression against the right to privacy, the Court had found that the decisive factor was to assess whether a publication contributed to a public debate or was solely intended to satisfy the curiosity of readers. The Supreme Administrative Court found that the publication of the whole database collected for journalistic purposes could not be regarded as journalistic activity. The public interest did not require such publication of personal data to the extent seen in the present case, in particular as the derogation in the Personal Data Act was to be interpreted strictly.

Nor was it possible to use \u201cpublic interest\u201d as a criterion for preventing publication when preventive restriction of freedom of expression was concerned.

Still, the idea of a sanction is repeated immediately further down in the same paragraph.

The only problematic area for the national authorities and courts was the \u201cextent of the published information\u201d, which would determine whether the activities of the applicant companies fell under the notion of journalism or processing of personal data, which the applicant companies had no right to do (see paragraph 68 of the judgment). The conclusion reached by the majority here served as the basis for shifting the balance from the applicant companies\u2019 freedom of expression (Article 10) to the protection of the private life of the taxpayers concerned (Article 8). I do not consider that the judgment has persuasively ascertained that the prescribed limitations on processing and consequently publishing taxation data were necessary for the protection of the right to privacy of either specific individual(s) or of society as a whole.

Moreover, restricting the rights and duties of newspapers to purvey information that is already available on a matter of legitimate public concern has been held to endanger democracy and to be characteristic of a totalitarian regime, as Lord Bridge put it in the Observer and Guardian case (cited above, \u00a7 36).",

No negative effect or harm was identified as having been inflicted upon any individual, nor had society been otherwise imperilled through publication of these data. Moreover, the publishing of taxation data has not been considered to jeopardise the privacy of taxpayers in Finland, even though a number of newspapers and websites have continuously published such data (see paragraph 41 of the judgment). Without sustainable grounds to believe that the right of privacy has been violated or that an imminent/real danger of such a violation existed, the imposition of severe restrictions on media freedom cannot serve the legitimate interest of society.",

It should be recalled that the inalienable elements of journalism are data collection, interpretation and storytelling. The judgment, however, could lead to an interpretation that journalists are so limited in processing data that the entire journalistic activity becomes futile. This may be the case especially in circumstances where there are continuous efforts to limit freedom of expression, particularly in the light of the dynamic and evolving character of the media. The judgment does not follow the postulate that any interference with freedom of expression must be convincingly established and narrowly interpreted (see, for example, Hertel v.\u00a0Switzerland, 25 August 1998, \u00a7 46, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI). By limiting the opportunity to publish data already disclosed to the public, the national authorities restricted the contribution of the applicant companies to debate on questions of public interest (see S\u00fcrek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a026682/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999\u2011IV, and Morice v. France [GC], no.\u00a029369/10, \u00a7 125, 23\u00a0April 2015).",

Establishing a quantitative framework for publicly available information and limiting the freedom guaranteed by Article 10 on this ground does not correspond to the notion of a \u201cpressing social need\u201d. It is vital that freedom of expression is safeguarded against vague and disproportionate interference. Such an interpretation of the term \u201cjournalistic activities\u201d cannot be in the best interests of a democratic society as understood in the case-law of the Court. This interpretation also deviates from the approach developed by the Court of Justice of the European Union to the interpretation of Directive 95/46/EC (see paragraphs\u00a068 and 69 of the judgment). The Court should have construed and assessed the journalistic activities of the applicant companies against the backdrop of the essential role played by the media, including the press, in a democratic society and the fact that all persons who exercise their freedom of expression, including journalists, undertake \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d, the scope of which depends on their situation and the technical means they use (see, for example, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, \u00a7 49, Series\u00a0A no. 24). The respondent State should not have been afforded a wide margin of appreciation in the particular circumstances of the case (see, for example, Fressoz and Roire, cited above \u00a745, and Bladet Troms\u00f8 and\u00a0Stensaas v.

In paragraph 73 the Court concludes that the interference by the domestic authorities with the applicant companies\u2019 activities amounted to sanctions, albeit necessary and proportionate ones. I agree with Judge Nicolaou\u2019s view, as expressed in his concurring opinion, that they were not sanctions as such (contrast and compare with Weber v. Switzerland, 22 May 1990, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 177; \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v. Turkey [GC], no. 22479/93, \u00a7 66, ECHR 1999VI; and \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem v. Turkey, no. 23144/93, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2000-III). Nonetheless, the decisions of the domestic authorities entailed an extremely serious interference with the applicant companies\u2019 activities. In practice, while publishing as such was not prohibited, the domestic authorities\u2019 decisions prevented the applicant companies to a certain extent from processing data for publishing purposes. This led to futile attempts to continue publishing such data. As a result, the measures imposed not only limited the companies\u2019 participation in and contribution to debate on matters of legitimate concern (see, for example, Lingens v.\u00a0Austria, no. 9815/82, \u00a7\u00a044, 8\u00a0July 1986; Bladet\u00a0Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a064; and Mosley v. the United Kingdom, no. 48009/08, \u00a7 116, 10 May 2011) but also led to the discontinuation of publication. In addition, this would inevitably have had financial consequences for the applicant companies. Hence, the severity of the measures imposed should have played a role in the proportionality analysis.",

Consequently, the Court should have exercised its supervisory function and should have concluded that the interference with the applicant companies\u2019 right to freedom of expression was not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.
