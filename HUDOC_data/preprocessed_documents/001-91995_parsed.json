He put forward an additional complaint arguing that the authorities had failed to enforce the new judgment issued in his favour on 29 February 2000.",

The Court further notes that the quashing of a final judgment is an instantaneous act, which does not create a continuing situation, even if it entails a re-opening of the proceedings as in the instant case (see Sitokhova v.

The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise. The outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question. As the Court has consistently held, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences are not sufficient to bring Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 into play (see Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v.

Furthermore, Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is applicable where an action is \u201cpecuniary\u201d in nature and is founded on an alleged infringement of rights which are likewise pecuniary rights, notwithstanding the origin of the dispute (see, for example, Beaumartin v.

They insisted that the proceedings at issue constituted a part of the enforcement proceedings pertaining to the judgment debt awarded to the applicant against the Bank and, thus, in the Government\u2019s opinion, Article 6 was inapplicable. Bearing in mind the finding in the previous paragraph and without accepting the Government\u2019s argument as to the essence of the proceedings at issue, the Court considers it worth reiterating its case-law to the effect that Article 6 applies to enforcement proceedings because, in the absence of the necessary measures to comply with a final, enforceable judicial decision, Article 6 \u00a7 1 can be deprived of all useful effect (see Hornsby v. Greece, judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 45; Silva Pontes v.

The Court notes that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article\u00a06 is to ensure that the applicant is put, as far as possible, in the position he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012, and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v.

Stetsenko v. , no.\u00a0878/03, \u00a7\u00a069, 5\u00a0October 2006 and Stanislav Volkov v. , no. 8564/02, \u00a7\u00a040, 15\u00a0March 2007).
