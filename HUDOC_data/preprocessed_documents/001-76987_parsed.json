The first opinion was issued by a general practitioner, Dr A.H., on 3 March 1995, who had seen H. four times at a child welfare clinic, the last occasion being in December 1993. The other opinion was given by a nurse, I.L., of the same clinic on 7 March 1995. She had seen H. last in October 1994. The opinions found nothing exceptional in the child's development and no failure on the part of the applicant in providing her with proper care. Given that H. had been staying with her mother during the period of examination, the applicant argued that it could not be excluded that the latter had influenced the child's behaviour. He reiterated that although H. had been monitored while in day care, he had not been informed of the suspicions until January 1995. He furthermore argued that he had not been heard in accordance with section 15 of the Administrative Procedure Act (hallintomenettelylaki, lagen om f\u00f6rvaltningsf\u00f6rfarande; Act no. 598/1982). When invited to the meeting on 27 January 1995, he had not been informed of its real purpose, namely the plan to take the child into public care.

The taking into care of a child should normally be regarded as a temporary measure to be discontinued as soon as circumstances permit, and any measures of implementation of temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the natural parent and child (see Olsson (no. 1), cited above, pp. 36-37, \u00a7 81; Johansen, cited above, pp. 1008-09, \u00a7 78; and E.P. v.

The Court also notes that restrictions on access were imposed in the care plans of 11\u00a0October 1995, 9 March 1998 and 24 April 1998 although the applicant objected to them. However, having regard to the impact of these measures on the applicant's right to respect for family life, he should have been given an opportunity to contest them. No such opportunity was given and no sufficient justification for that shortcoming has been made out.",

While it appears that no meetings could take place during certain periods of time, this seems to have resulted from the abduction and further abduction threats and unwillingness on the part of the applicant to discuss access arrangements (see paragraphs 71-72 and 76-77 above). In addition, there is no indication that the applicant was unable to keep in touch with H. by telephone. Given the suspicion that the child had been sexually abused by the applicant, the Court finds that the interferences with the applicant's rights can be considered proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and that the Finnish authorities could reasonably consider it justified to restrict access. The case file shows that the social welfare officials were not unaware of the applicant's objections to the restriction on access or the reason for his objections. Accordingly, the Court cannot find that he was excluded from putting forward his views or that he was otherwise insufficiently involved in the decision-making. The measures were thus justified under Article 8 \u00a7 2.",
