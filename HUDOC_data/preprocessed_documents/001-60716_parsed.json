It furthermore observes that on 26\u00a0October 1995 the proceedings were postponed until 21\u00a0June 1996 in order to enable the lawyers of the Avellino Bar Association to take part in an assembly, and that the hearings of 17\u00a0January, 23\u00a0February, 6 April, 22 June 1995 and 18 June 1997 were adjourned because of two lawyers\u2019 strikes. In this respect, the Court recalls that a delay in the criminal proceedings caused by a lawyers\u2019 strike cannot be attributed to the State, whereas the period of time elapsed between the end of the strike and the new hearing is to be imputed to the conduct of the authorities (see the Portington v. Greece judgment of 23\u00a0September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2633, \u00a7\u00a033). In the present case, the Court notes that the first lawyers\u2019 strike lasted from 13\u00a0January until 9 October 1995 and that in this period four hearings were scheduled. Therefore, the resulting delays cannot be attributed to the State authorities. On the other hand, the Court observes that the second strike lasted only four days, from 16 until 20\u00a0June 1997. However, the subsequent hearing was fixed at 27\u00a0April 1998, which is more than ten months after the end of the strike. Even if the Court is not unaware of the complications which strikes may cause by overloading the list of cases to be heard by courts (see the Papageorgiou v. Greece judgment of 22\u00a0October 1997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 2291, \u00a7 48), it considers that this delay is excessive and must be imputed, at least in part, to the State authorities.",
