The Court considers that these arguments indicate that the applicant wished to secure a review by the Court of Appeal of the factual circumstances in which the crimes had been committed and a new assessment as to the admissibility and reliability of the evidence obtained. Furthermore, in his grounds of appeal the applicant also complained that the first-instance court had not adequately reasoned its decision to apply the most severe sentence provided for in the Criminal Code.

It follows that in the circumstances of the present case, it was essential to the fairness of the proceedings that the applicant be present at the appeal hearings, unless he had validly waived that right (see Chernega and Others v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 74768/10, \u00a7 180, 18 June 2019). The Court reiterates that neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 of the Convention prevents a person from waiving of his own free will, either expressly or tacitly, the entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial. However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, such a waiver must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance. Such a waiver need not be explicit, but it must be voluntary and constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right. Before an accused can be said to have implicitly, through his conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be. Moreover, the waiver must not run counter to any important public interest (see Simeonovi v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 21980/04, \u00a7 115, 12 May 2017, with further\u00a0references).",

Nevertheless, contrary to that decision, at the main hearing held on 28 June 2006 the Court of Appeal decided to continue the hearing in the absence of the applicant and explained its decision by citing the impossibility of transferring him to the courtroom as he had been placed in a high-security prison (see paragraph\u00a08 above). In the circumstances, the Court does not see how the applicant\u2019s failure to lodge a cassation appeal against the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 16 June 2006 could be considered to amount to a waiver of his right to be present at the hearings before the Court of Appeal since the decision in question stated that the appellate hearing was to be held in the presence of all the parties to the case, including the applicant.",

Furthermore, the applicant expressly requested the Supreme Court to ensure his presence at the hearing before it (see paragraphs 13-14 above). However, there is nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to indicate that it addressed separately the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning the procedural shortcomings identified in the proceedings before the Court of Appeal. Whilst\u00a0the Court cannot speculate\u00a0as to the outcome of the hearing before the Supreme Court, it also takes into account the fact that the latter remained silent as regards the applicant\u2019s request to participate in the cassation proceedings, which would have rectified the above-mentioned shortcomings (see paragraph 15 above). It is therefore clear that the applicant\u2019s complaints before the Supreme Court linked to the Government\u2019s second argument above remained unexamined.
