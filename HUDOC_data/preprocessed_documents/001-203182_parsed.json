However, as the phrase did not contain any allegation of dishonesty, unethical behaviour or criminality, it was not actionable in defamation.

The Russian courts did not identify any reasons for holding the applicants responsible for statements which had been quoted directly from their respective authors. As noted above, even though Mr\u00a0G.V. did not admit in the domestic proceedings to being the author of the line quoted on the banner, the photograph demonstrated that the applicants had accurately reported its content.",

Their decisions were confined to the assessment of damage which Mr Luzhkov\u2019s reputation may have suffered in connection with the applicants\u2019 reporting on a public event and the lack of substantiation of what they considered to be factual allegations of criminal conduct. They failed to recognise that the instant case was one where the margin of appreciation available to the authorities in establishing the necessity for the impugned measure was particularly narrow. Nor did they attempt to perform a balancing exercise between the need to protect the plaintiff\u2019s reputation and the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression. Those failings call for the conclusion that the Russian courts did not \u201capply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010\u201d and failed to give relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the interference (see Terentyev v. Russia, no. 25147/09, \u00a7 24, 26\u00a0January 2017).",
