In their observations the Government contended that decisions regarding legal aid were given by the judges on the basis of the case files and that there was no obligation for them to grant it under the domestic law.

It is central to the concept of a fair trial, in civil as in criminal proceedings, that a litigant is not denied the opportunity to present his or her case effectively before the court and that he or she is able to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2005II).",

Turkey, no. 50939/99, \u00a7\u00a7 74-78, 12 June 2007; Mehmet and Suna Yi\u011fit, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 31-39; Ey\u00fcp Kaya v. Turkey, no. 17582/04, \u00a7\u00a7 22-26, 23 September 2008; and Kaba v. Turkey, no. 1236/05, \u00a7\u00a7 19-25, 1 March 2011). The Court has also examined the present case and finds no particular circumstances which would require it to depart from its findings in the aforementioned cases. In this respect, it would once again reiterate that pursuant to Article 469 of the CCP, decisions regarding legal aid are binding and are delivered on the basis of the case file, without hearing the applicants (see Bakan, cited above, \u00a7 76). The Court further holds that the refusal of the applicant\u2019s legal aid request deprived him of the possibility of submitting his case before a tribunal.",
