The Court also found in subsequent cases concerning the Transdniestrian region that up until at least July 2010, the \u201cMRT\u201d was only able to continue to exist, and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region, because of Russian military, economic and political support (see Ivan\u0163oc and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 116-20; Catan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0121-22; and Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110). The Court concluded in Mozer that the \u201cMRT\u201d\u2018s high level of dependency on Russian support provided a strong indication that the Russian Federation continued to exercise effective control and a decisive influence over the Transdniestrian authorities and that, therefore, the applicant fell within that State\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 1 of the Convention (Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011011).",

The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative, and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, in particular, Jussila v.\u00a0Finland\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a073053/01, \u00a7 30-31, ECHR 2006XIII and Blokhin v.\u00a0Russia [GC], no. 47152/06, \u00a7\u00a7 179 and 180, ECHR 2016).",

However, in view of the lack of cooperation by the \u201cMRT\u201d authorities that investigation could not continue. Having examined the materials in the case file, the Court considers that the Republic of Moldova did not fail to fulfil its positive obligations in respect of the applicant (see Mozer, cited above, \u00a7 154). While the applicant argued that his minibus and the merchandise had been seized by the \u201cMRT\u201d authorities and a Moldovan police officer had not opposed this, the present case does not involve a complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. Therefore, this particular inaction by the Moldovan police cannot be regarded as a failure by the Republic of Moldova to observe its positive obligations.",

In the light of this conclusion, and in accordance with its case-law, it is not necessary to determine whether or not Russia exercised detailed control over the policies and actions of the subordinate local administration (see Mozer, cited above, \u00a7 157). By virtue of its continued military, economic and political support for the \u201cMRT\u201d, which could not otherwise survive, Russia\u2019s responsibility under the Convention is engaged as regards the violation of the applicant\u2019s rights (ibidem).",
