The case originated in an application (no. 14099/12) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Péter Tóth (“the applicant”), on 29 February 2012.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Justice.
On 12 June 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Budapest.
The applicant’s employment was terminated unlawfully according to the judgment of the Budapest Labour Court dated 24 August 2004.
Relying on this decision, on 19 October 2004 the applicant lodged a claim for unpaid wages and other claims against his former employer.
The Pest County Labour Court rejected the claim on 5 May 2006.
On appeal, the second-instance court quashed the judgment and transferred the case to the competent Budapest Regional Court on 24 January 2007.
In the resumed proceedings, the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s claim on 28 November 2008.
On appeal, the Budapest Court of Appeal upheld in essence the firstinstance decision on 14 September 2010.
The applicant lodged a petition for review. On 11 July 2011 the Supreme Court reversed the previous decision and awarded the applicant 2,053,440 Hungarian forints in salary arrears.
