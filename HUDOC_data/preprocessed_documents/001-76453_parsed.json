The absence of a requirement of malice would impose liability for negligence and potentially expose chief constables to the possibility of civil action on almost every occasion when warrants were obtained. The fact that a search proved to be unsuccessful did not in itself give rise to a cause of action. Primary protection was given to a person\u2019s rights in regard to invasion of property by the requirement that a search be on a warrant granted by a judicial officer who must be satisfied that there was reasonable cause. They relied on judicial dicta that this judicial supervision was not merely a rubber stamp, because it was not sufficient for the judge to be satisfied by the officer\u2019s oath that he believed the grounds for the warrant; the cause for the belief also had to appear reasonable to the judge. Further, the grant of warrants was subject to procedural conditions set out in domestic law, warrants could be quashed in proceedings for judicial review, and where the police acted maliciously, they would be liable in damages.",

In the present case, the police obtained a warrant from a Justice of the Peace, giving information under oath that they had reason to believe the proceeds of a robbery were at the address which had been used by one of the suspected robbers. No doubt was cast, in the domestic proceedings or before the Court, on the genuineness of the belief of the officers who obtained the warrant or those who executed it.

As the County Court Judge noted, it is difficult to conceive that enquiries were not made by the police to verify who lived at the address the suspected robber had been known to give and that if such enquiries had been properly made (via the local authority or utility companies), they would not have revealed the change in occupation. The loss of the police notes renders it impossible to deduce whether it was a failure to make the proper enquiries or a failure to transmit or properly record the information obtained that led to the mistake that was made. In any event, as found by the domestic courts, although the police did not act with malice and indeed with the best of intentions, there was no reasonable basis for their action in breaking down the applicants\u2019 door early one morning while they were in bed. Put in Convention terms, there might have been relevant reasons but, as in the circumstances they were based on a misconception which could, and should, have been avoided with proper precautions, they cannot be regarded as sufficient (see, mutatis mutandis, McLeod, cited above, where the police did not take steps to verify whether the applicant\u2019s ex-husband had the right to enter her house, notwithstanding his genuine belief, and did not wait until her return).",

The Court cannot agree that limiting actions for damages to cases of malice is necessary to protect the police in their vital function of investigating crime. The exercise of powers to interfere with home and private life must be confined within reasonable bounds to minimise the impact of such measures on the personal sphere of the individual guaranteed under Article 8 which is pertinent to security and well-being (see, for example, Buckley v. the United Kingdom, 25 September 1996, \u00a7 76, Reports 1996IV).

The courts were unable to examine issues of proportionality or reasonableness and, as various judges in the domestic proceedings noted, the balance was set in favour of protection of the police in such cases.

Accordingly they claimed a sum of 15,000 pounds sterling (GBP) as a total award to the family, with a separate award to each member to reflect the psychiatric and psychological injury suffered, namely, GBP 12,000 to Gerard Keegan, GBP 12,000 to Moira Keegan, GBP 12,000 to Carl Keegan (aged 14 at the time), GBP 8,000 to Michael Keegan (aged nearly 4 at the time), and GBP 7,000 each to Katie and Sophie Keegan (aged two at the time).",

As contrasted with cases where the awards were for acts going beyond the simple fact of intrusion upon the home (see, for example, Connors v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a066746/01, 27 May 2004), this case involved an entry lasting only fifteen minutes and the police had arranged for repairs to the door.
