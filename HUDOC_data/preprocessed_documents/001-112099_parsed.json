In the concluding remarks before the trial court (see paragraph 20 above) and in his appeals before the Appeal and Supreme Courts (see paragraphs 22 and 24 above), the applicant complained that he had not been able to confront the migrants during the investigation. In doing so, he contested the credibility of their evidence, pointing to concrete aspects of their statements. The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s appeals were based, inter alia, on sections 355 \u00a7 2 and 413 \u00a7 1(3) of the Act (see paragraphs 28 and 31 above), according to which an alleged violation of defence rights was a valid ground for quashing a defective judgment. The appellate courts were accordingly well placed to consider whether the proceedings, in view of the applicant\u2019s complaint, were fair (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the  [GC], nos.\u00a026766/05 and 22228/06, \u00a7 35, 15 December 2011). It is true that the applicant did not explicitly phrase this complaint as a violation of his right to mount a defence. However, the Court considers that it would be unduly formalistic to interpret this failure to the applicant\u2019s detriment, in particular given that it was the only complaint concerning his defence rights. Lastly, with regard to the Government\u2019s submissions that the applicant had neither objected that the trial court had read out the migrants\u2019 statements (see paragraph 19 above) nor explicitly requested that the migrants be heard at the trial, the Court considers, in the first place, that the applicant cannot be regarded as having waived, in an unequivocal manner, his rights under Article 6 as to the opportunity to examine the migrants (see Vladimir Romanov v. , no. 41461/02, \u00a7 98, 24 July 2008), and secondly, that the Contracting States are required to take positive steps, in particular to enable an accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him (see Sadak and Others v. , nos. 29900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2001VIII). In such circumstances, the Court is convinced that the applicant had raised, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, the complaint that he had not been allowed to confront the migrants. Consequently, the Government\u2019s non-exhaustion objection must be rejected.",

As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him \u2013 either when he was making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Sa\u00efdi v.

The rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the requirements of Article 6 if the conviction is based solely, or to a decisive extent, on the depositions of a witness whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, either during the investigation or at trial (see Khametshin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 18487/03, \u00a7 32, 4 March 2010).",

In the present case, the trial court made no attempt to find the migrants after they had been deported, nor did it give any explanation justifying the failure to ensure their attendance at the trial. On the other hand, it is not in doubt that the applicant could have confronted the migrants during the investigation while they were still in the respondent State (see paragraph 11 above).

Three issues need to be examined: first, whether it was necessary to admit the migrants\u2019 statements; second, whether their untested evidence was the sole or decisive basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction; and third, whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors including strong procedural safeguards to ensure that the trial, judged as a whole, was fair within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3(d) (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 152).",

They were directly involved in the incident and were the only eyewitnesses who could have produced evidence relevant for the applicant\u2019s conviction. The other evidence was that given by T.S. and B.G., the police officers who had apprehended the migrants, and the evidence given by Ms S.S. and Mr M.T., who had been present at  bus station when the applicant had agreed to drive the migrants. The former gave evidence concerning the place of arrest and the migrants\u2019 comments regarding the incident (see paragraph 14 above). Consequently, their evidence was circumstantial in nature and, at best, could only provide indirect support for the applicant\u2019s guilt. Ms S.S. and Mr M.T. produced evidence corroborating some of the details of the applicant\u2019s testimony (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above), but the trial court disregarded it as unreliable. In such circumstances, it is clear that the evidence given by the migrants was obviously of great weight and without it the chances of the applicant\u2019s conviction would have been at least significantly reduced. In support of this conclusion are the impugned judgments, in which the domestic courts relied heavily on this evidence in order to establish the applicant\u2019s guilt (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above).",

It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the impugned proceedings would have been had there been no violation on this ground. It therefore finds no causal link between the damage claimed and its finding of a violation of Article 6. Accordingly, the Court makes no award under this head.",

France, no. 58148/00, \u00a7\u00a064, ECHR 2004-IV). Having regard to the fee note submitted by the applicant, the Court finds that only EUR 340 related to lawyer\u2019s fees which were expended with a view to seeking prevention before the national courts of the violation found by the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Stoimenov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 17995/02, \u00a7\u00a056, 5 April 2007, and Traj\u010de Stojanovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a01431/03, \u00a7 46, 22 October 2009). Furthermore, the applicant having substantiated the full amount claimed in respect of the legal fees expended in the proceedings before it, the Court finds the sum of EUR 190 reasonable and awards it to him. It therefore considers that the applicant is entitled to be reimbursed a total of EUR 530, plus any tax that may be chargeable to him thereon. Lastly, it rejects as unsubstantiated the applicant\u2019s claim for reimbursement of mailing, copying and translation expenses.",
