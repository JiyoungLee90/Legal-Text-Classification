The Government termed them \u201cunlawful items\u201d that had to be seized. The Court notes first that the applicant was never accused of having issued any banknotes. Moreover, it considers that this reasoning and the term used are very broad, as many other items could be included in this category. For instance, any old coin or old banknote would have to be considered \u201cunlawful\u201d. The notion of \u201cunlawful items\u201d as defined by the Government is unacceptably flexible and allows for selective application by the authorities, without any clear criterion. It is also apparent from the Government\u2019s submissions under Article 41 of the Convention (see paragraph 40 below) that despite considering them \u201cunlawful items\u201d, these banknotes could be returned to the applicant in the event of this Court\u2019s finding of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention and that, moreover, in such a case the applicant would be able to fulfil the contract by delivering the bills to the company.",

Indeed, even if the contract between the applicant and the \u201cMRT\u201d bank was void, nobody other than the applicant claimed ownership of the banknotes, which were also in his physical possession, and he thus had to be assumed to be their owner. This distinguishes the case from those where a person attempts to obtain possession of an item and the authorities refuse him or her such a right. It also makes this case different from Agneessens, cited above, in which, unlike in the present case, the applicant no longer wanted to obtain the return of money bills, but rather compensation for the loss of value of those bills during the time of their retention by the Belgian authorities.",

Ireland [GC] (no. 45036/98, \u00a7\u00a7 141 et seq., ECHR 2005VI) the applicant company could no longer use leased aircraft, following sanctions adopted by the United Nations Security Council and the European Union. By virtue of these sanctions, all aircraft belonging to the former Yugoslavia (FRY) were to be impounded. This rendered the contract signed between the applicant company and a FRY airline for the lease of two aircrafts void for lack of a lawful object. However, the Grand Chamber did not have any doubt as to the applicability of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention on account of the applicant company\u2019s inability to use the aircraft after it was impounded by Ireland. In that case the applicant company was essentially seeking to continue using aircrafts, the use of which was unlawful in international law, yet this did not preclude the applicability of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",
