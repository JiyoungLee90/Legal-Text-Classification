Malta (dec.) no.\u00a037448/06, 2\u00a0December 2008 (where the court had found that the applicants in those cases had not raised the issue of compensation before the domestic courts) the Government submitted that the complaint before the domestic courts was strictly limited to a claim that the lands had not been taken for a public purpose since the Freeport was a commercial entity and the issue of compensation was only referred to in a generic manner. This claim concerning the public interest was repeated all throughout their application to the domestic courts, together with the fact that the violation arose as a result of the failure to use the land. No claim relative to compensation for the taking was made before the domestic courts. Their only claim for compensation was in respect of the occupation of the property, indeed they had asked the court to \u201crelease the property\u201d and \u201cestablish the compensation due to the applicants for the sixty years during which they were deprived of the use of this property\u201d meaning that they were only claiming rent for the occupation of the land. Thus, they had not exhausted domestic remedies on that point and they could still today start new constitutional redress proceedings claiming compensation.

Subsequent to that, the applicants lodged proceedings before the Civil Court (First Hall) requesting all those remedies which were needed to satisfy the finding of a violation. In their application to that court they had specifically noted that the applicants had received no compensation. They considered that no other ordinary proceedings were available, and had they to institute a new set of constitutional redress proceedings after being unsuccessful before the ECtHR, the Government would no doubt raise the plea of res judicata. Without prejudice to that factual submission the applicants also noted that Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 had to be seen as a whole, thus any assessment of the proportionality of a measure had to take account of whether any compensation was paid. Lastly, the applicants noted that this Court had repeatedly chastised the judgments of the Constitutional Court of Malta.

From the documents in the Court\u2019s possession it appears that the applicants had challenged, before the constitutional jurisdictions, the public interest of the taking of Land A, and they requested the domestic jurisdictions to award compensation for the use of that property, and not for the expropriation itself. The Court observes that, in the present case, no compensation had been awarded for the expropriated land since according to domestic law the institution of compensation proceedings before the LAB was dependent on the CoL, and in the present case the CoL had withdrawn proceedings in 2003 (see paragraph\u00a012 above). Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, the situation is one which merited a specific complaint to that effect. While it is true that the applicants argued on appeal that the absence of any compensation would render the measure disproportionate, the Constitutional Court replied that the applicants could not raise new issues at that stage of the proceedings.",

Bearing in mind the specific circumstances of the present case, in particular the fact that the applicants\u2019 grievances related to different aspects under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as well as different properties, the Court considers that the applicants failed to fulfil domestic remedies in respect of their complaint concerning compensation for the expropriation of Land A (compare Bezzina Wettinger and Others, cited above, \u00a7 104 and J.

In reality, having examined in detail the casefile, the Court finds that the only doubt which had arisen about Land B was concerning its exact measurement, and therefore not the ownership of the majority of such property, but only an extra part which appeared to have been included in the plans by the architects. Indeed, as noted by the Constitutional Court, before it, no objections had been raised in this respect, and the notice of expropriation as well as the notice to treat, concerning the property were addressed to the applicants\u2019 father as owner, and at no stage was this contested. The firstinstance constitutional jurisdiction had found in favour of the applicants, and awarded them compensation for the taking of Land B. Thus, despite the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding, these facts indicate that the applicants have been at least tacitly acknowledged as having title to the land by both the authorities and the firstinstance domestic court (see paragraph 15 above).

The Government explained that the applicants\u2019 ancestor had not agreed with the value attributed to the land as he had considered it to be a building site. However, the land was purely agricultural and the applicants had not indicated what, in their view, would have been a fair value of the property. Thus, the offer made, according to the relevant law, had been fair. Moreover, if it were to be paid today, upon the applicant\u2019s providing proof of title, the amount would be payable together with interest from the date of the taking of the property. However, without prejudice to that statement, they further considered that when pursuing legitimate interests compensation needed not reflect market values.",

As already held in Frendo Randon and Others (cited above \u00a7 61), which concerned the same Freeport project, the Court is convinced that a project of this scale may require further expansion; however, it is of the view that the Government, when expropriating the relevant land, should have had some concrete plans at least for its forthcoming, if not for its imminent, development. Any further expansion after the start of the project or, as in the present case, one which might have been necessary four decades after the initiation of the project, may require further expropriation of land at later stages. The Court considers that the same applies for \u201cexpansion\u201d for the purposes of the introduction of gas lines which  according to the testimony relied on by the Government  remains only a hypothetical future use. In addition, no details have been put forward considering an alleged buffer zone. In this connection the Court notes that, as also confirmed by the firstinstance court, and not disproved on appeal, no use has been made of the part of Land\u00a0B owned by the applicants, and taken nearly fifty years ago. Given the above, it cannot be said that the delay in making use of that land was itself based on any publicinterest concern. Moreover, it is indisputable that the land has seen an increase in value, of which the applicants have been deprived (ibid.).",

Given that the finding concerning the public interest at issue has an impact on the compensation due, as well as the fact that to date there is no final decision concerning the compensation due to the applicants (see, mutatis mutandis, Vassallo v. Malta (just satisfaction), no.\u00a057862/09, \u00a7\u00a019, 6\u00a0November 2012) the Court does not find it necessary to examine the adequacy of the compensation offered \u2013 a matter not debated before the domestic courts after the withdrawal by the CoL of the compensation proceedings. It suffices to hold, in this connection, that given that nearly fifty years after the taking the applicants have not received any compensation whatsoever, they have been required to be bear a disproportionate burden (see, mutatis mutandis, Vassallo v. Malta, (merits), no.\u00a057862/09, \u00a7\u00a7 4445, 11 October 2011).",
