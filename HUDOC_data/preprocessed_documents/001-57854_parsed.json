Accordingly, an administrative decision could infringe that provision only if it proved to have no legal basis, or its legal basis was unconstitutional or again had been applied in an arbitrary manner (in denkunm\u00f6glicher Weise an[ge]wendet).

In the Government\u2019s view, only the system in force, based on the monopoly of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, made it possible for the authorities to ensure compliance with these requirements. That was why the applicable legislation and the charter of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation made provision for the independence of programming, the freedom of journalists and the balanced representation of political parties and social groups in the managing bodies.",
