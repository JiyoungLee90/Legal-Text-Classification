The Law provided for the restoration of ownership rights neither to all former owners, nor to the whole formerly possessed property. That was a compromise decision which sought to restore justice for the people who had suffered under the occupation government. However, one had also to take account of the existing socio-economic relations and factual possibilities of the accomplishment of the restitution. The establishment of the conditions of the restoration of ownership rights is a prerogative of the legislature ... In parallel, the Constitutional Court notes that the legal regulation of compensation for property compulsorily bought by the State was conditioned by, among other factors, limited material and financial capacities of the State. When the State undertakes a respective liability under the law, it must be grounded in adequate material and financial resources; otherwise the law becomes ineffective. Therefore, taking into consideration the capacities of the State, the respective amounts of compensation for property bought by the State may be established. The amounts of compensation provided for by the Methodology [as confirmed by the Government resolution] do not constitute grounds to assess them as fair or unfair. In addition, in the context of the equality of rights of all members of society, it is an important consideration that the obligation assumed by the Law to pay corresponding compensation to a certain category of persons for property bought by the State in effect falls on all the other members of society.\u201d",

The State of Lithuania, while striving to restore justice, in part at least, that is to say to restore the violated rights of ownership, chose restricted restitution, not restitutio in integrum. This restoration of justice, where the owners are compensated for the existing real property which has not been returned in natura has two sides: it is justice for the owner as well as justice for the whole of society; the unlawful actions of the occupation government inflicted enormous damage not only on the owners whose rights of ownership were denied but also on the whole of society and the entire State; while restoring justice to owners, one cannot ignore justice for society as a whole, whose members are also the owners; in the process of restoring the rights of ownership, one must strive for a balance between the persons whose rights are being restored and the interests of society as a whole (the Constitutional Court ruling of 4 March 2003)\u201d.",

That notwithstanding, the value of the land calculated by the Government Methodology had plainly differed from the market value established by the data from the Real Estate Registry. As a result, if the applicant had agreed to compensation for the land according to the valid legal regulation and refused to wait for an equivalent plot of land in another place in Vilnius city, such a decision would evidently have been unjust because the State could have profited at the applicant\u2019s expense by later selling or leasing that land to another party at market prices.",

On the first point, the Court observes that, pursuant to Article 12 \u00a7 1 (6) of the Law on Restitution, the State indeed had to order the purchase of the land that had been taken into private ownership in accordance with the law (see paragraph\u00a044 above).

Nothing in the case-file indicates that either the municipal authorities or M.P. acted in bad faith by, respectively, transferring or acquiring that plot (see Padalevi\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 12278/03, \u00a7 68, 7\u00a0July 2009). The Court is also cautious to note that in regulating the restitution process the Contracting States have a wide discretion, including over the rules of how compensation for long-extinguished property rights should be assessed (see Jantner v. Slovakia, no. 39050/97, \u00a7 34, 4 March 2003, and Bergauer and Others v.\u00a0the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 17120/04, 13\u00a0December 2005). Even so, on numerous occasions in the context of revocation of property titles granted erroneously, the Court has emphasised that the principle of good governance may not only impose on the authorities an obligation to act promptly to correct their mistake (see Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, \u00a7\u00a069, 15 September 2009), but may also necessitate the payment of adequate compensation or another type of appropriate reparation to a bona fide former holder (see Pincov\u00e1 and Pinc v.\u00a0the Czech Republic, no. 36548/97, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2002-VIII, and To\u015fcu\u0163\u0103 and Others v. Romania, no. 36900/03, \u00a7 38, 25 November 2008). In other words, the terms of compensation are material to the assessment of whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicant (see Albergas and Arlauskas v. Lithuania, no. 17978/05, \u00a7 73, 27 May 2014).",

Indeed, the Court has repeatedly held that the decision to enact laws affording publicly funded compensation for expropriated property will commonly involve consideration of political, economic and social issues. The Court has declared that, finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, it will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation. This logic applies to such fundamental changes of a country\u2019s system as the transition from a totalitarian regime to a democratic form of government and the reform of the State\u2019s political, legal and economic structure, phenomena which inevitably involve the enactment of large-scale economic and social legislation (see Broniowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0149).

Although the applicant insisted that market-value compensation should be paid to him for the remaining part of his father\u2019s land, the Court does not share this view. As the applicant himself admitted, market-value compensation had never been an option under Lithuanian law (see paragraph\u00a059 above), because of the principle of partial restitution chosen by Lithuania to rectify the old wrongs, as was explained by the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 41, 46-48 above). On this point the Court also finds it pertinent that by 2004 the Methodology set out by the Government had been used in 88% of cases where compensation was given (see paragraph 19 above). It is also noteworthy that as early as in 1999 the applicant was given a plot for building a house while in 2013 over 4,000\u00a0persons were still awaiting the first legal decision to allot them a plot of land in Vilnius city (see paragraphs 8 and 50 above). Lastly, even though compensation for the remaining part of his father\u2019s land had been proposed to the applicant, he himself failed to choose the means of restitution (see paragraphs 85 and 86 below).",

It follows that certain impediments to the realisation of the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions are not in themselves open to criticism (see Igarien\u0117 and Petrauskien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058). Even so, it has emphasised that that uncertainty \u2013 be it legislative, administrative or arising from the practices applied by the authorities \u2013 is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State\u2019s conduct. Indeed, where an issue in the general interest is at stake, it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time and in an appropriate and consistent manner (see Vasilescu v. Romania, 22\u00a0May 1998, \u00a7 51, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III; Beyeler v.

The applicant was then duly informed about the forms of compensation available to him for this under the Law on Restitution, but he refused to avail himself of any of these (see paragraphs 22, 23, 26-28 and 34 above). Furthermore, once the Law on Restitution was amended in 2012, the authorities informed the applicant about it without delay, asking him to express his preference regarding the forms of compensation available (see paragraphs 30-32 above). To accommodate the applicant\u2019s tenacious demands, in 2013 the authorities also verified once again whether there was any land which could be returned to him in natura, again with no positive result for the applicant (see paragraphs 35 and 36 above).",
