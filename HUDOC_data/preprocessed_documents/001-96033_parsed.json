According to B.H., the proceedings had been transferred to the Fier District Court, to the applicant's detriment, at a point when the Berat District Court had been nearing the end of the examination of the case and had been likely to conclude that there was insufficient evidence against him. Furthermore, B.H. maintained that the Fier District Court had admitted witness statements obtained at the police station rather than those obtained during the trial before the Berat District Court. He also maintained that the Fier District Court had not considered a ballistics report submitted during the trial before the Berat District Court, from which it transpired that the automatic guns allegedly used by the applicant belonged in fact to the Berat Police Force. Moreover, he stated that the applicant's lawyers had withdrawn from defending him during the trial before the Fier District Court as a consequence of threats to their own lives and those of their families.",

Where the domestic judicial authorities are confronted by several conflicting versions of truth offered by the same person, their final preference for a statement given to the investigative authorities over one given in an open court does not in itself raise an issue under the Convention where this preference is substantiated and the statement itself was given of the person's own volition (see Lutsenko v. , no. 30663/04, \u00a7 49, 18 December 2008). While M.'s testimony was relevant, it was corroborated by other material evidence such as the crime scene investigation report, the applicant's arrest report and the ballistics report and, crucially, witnesses such as K., L. and N., who were cross-examined by the applicant. In addition, the applicant put forward no convincing argument explaining how M.'s cross-examination would have been crucial for the establishment of the facts of the case and his involvement in the offence.",

The Court notes that the testimonies of the three police officers constituted evidence of, at least, prima facie relevance to the applicant's defence. The failure of the respondent State (namely the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior and the Police Directorate) to ensure the attendance of the police officers who act as the depository of the public authority responsible for protecting the general interests of the State, combined with the trial court's inability to secure the enforcement of its summons, falls short of the diligence which the Contracting States must exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (see Sadak and Others v. , nos. 29900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2001VIII, and Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v.
