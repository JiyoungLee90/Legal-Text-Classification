Contrary to the Court\u2019s established case-law on the assessment of the reasonableness of the length of proceedings, the courts did not examine the overall length of the proceedings but only selected parts of them. In some cases the courts disregarded periods occurring before the 2004 Act\u2019s entry into force and examined only the length of proceedings at the current instance. The Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation allowing for \u201cfragmentation of proceedings\u201d applied until 20 March 2013, when the Supreme Court issued the 2013 Resolution, analysing critically its previous case-law on the matter and endorsing a new interpretation in compliance with the Court\u2019s case-law on the assessment of the reasonableness of the length of proceedings. Moreover, the Court reiterated the standards for \u201cappropriate and sufficient redress\u201d for violations of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement and its strong, although rebuttable, presumption in favour of non-pecuniary damage being normally occasioned by the excessive length of proceedings (ibid, \u00a7 182). In view of the above, the Court found in its pilot judgment that the 2004 Act failed to provide the applicants with \u201cappropriate and sufficient redress\u201d in terms of adequate compensation for the excessive length of the proceedings in their cases (Rutkowski, cited above,\u00a7 183).",

The Court has already found that declaring a complaint inadmissible on the grounds that an applicant \u201chad not specified the circumstances on which his/her complaint had been based\u201d is too formalistic an approach, which may prevent an applicant\u2019s claims from being examined on the merits (see Wende and Kuk\u00f3wka v.
