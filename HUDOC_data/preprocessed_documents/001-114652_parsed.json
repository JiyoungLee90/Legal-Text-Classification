Furthermore, if he believed that he was sharing a prison cell with inmates infected with TB in Tbilisi Prison no. 5, he could have requested the prison authorities, under the Imprisonment Act of 22 July 1999, to arrange for him to be transferred to another, uncontaminated cell.

However, prior to 1 October 2010 Georgian law and practice, including the Imprisonment Act of 22 July 1999, did not provide for an effective legal avenue for obtaining injunctive relief in such medical situations; consequently, it was sufficient for an ill detainee who wished to complain to the Court under Article 3 of the Convention about a lack of adequate medical care to have placed the relevant domestic authorities on alert with respect to his state of health (see Goginashvili v.

In this respect, it is incumbent upon relevant domestic authorities to ensure, in particular, that diagnosis and care are prompt and accurate, and that supervision by proficient medical personnel has been regular and systematic and involved a comprehensive therapeutic strategy. The mere fact of a deterioration of the applicant\u2019s state of health, albeit capable of raising, at an initial stage, certain doubts concerning the adequacy of the treatment in prison, does not suffice as such for a finding of a violation of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention, if, on the other hand, it can be established that the relevant domestic authorities have in timely fashion resorted to all reasonably possible medical measures in a conscientious effort to hinder development of the disease in question.
