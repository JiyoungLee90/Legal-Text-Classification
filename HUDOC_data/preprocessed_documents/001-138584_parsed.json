Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2000IV). Treatment has been considered \u201cdegrading\u201d when it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them and possibly breaking their physical or moral resistance or driving them to act against their will or conscience (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2006IX). In this connection, the question whether such treatment was intended to humiliate or debase the victim is a factor to be taken into account, although the absence of any such purpose does not inevitably lead to a finding that there has been no violation of Article 3 (see Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a7 67, 68 and 74, ECHR 2001-III, and Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, \u00a7 95, ECHR 2002-VI).",

They were also asked to provide copies of the deportation order and notification form for the removal, but they failed to do so. The Government failed to respond to the Court\u2019s aforementioned questions and there are no documents in the case file to show that a formal deportation order had been communicated to the applicants. Nor is there any proof that on 11 October 2008 the applicants were handed over to the Iranian authorities or that the latter guaranteed their admission to Iran. All of the above leads the Court to conclude that the applicants \u2013 refugees recognised by the UNHCR \u2013 were illegally deported to Iran, a non-member State of the Council of Europe, in the absence of a legal procedure providing safeguards against unlawful deportation, and without a guarantee from the Iranian authorities that the applicants would be admitted to Iran. The Court is particularly struck by the fact that the applicants\u2019 removal on 11 October 2008 was not even officially recorded by the Turkish authorities. In this connection, the Court reiterates the absolute nature of Article 3 of the Convention. The fact that the national authorities considered some of the applicants to be dangerous for national security could not justify their removal in such circumstances (compare with, mutatis mutandis, Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7\u00a7 138-39, ECHR 2008).",

The applicants were forcibly removed from Turkey and it appears that the authorities\u2019 acts were premeditated and carried out without respect for either the applicants\u2019 status as refugees, or for the personal circumstances of the applicants, most of whom were children who had a stable life in Turkey. The Court considers that the circumstances up until the time of their removal must have caused the adults feelings of despair and fear, as they were unable to take any step to prevent their removal in the absence of procedural safeguards and were being sent to an unknown area with their young children and babies.",
