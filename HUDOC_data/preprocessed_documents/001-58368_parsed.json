They observed that the application had been lodged with the Commission more than a year after the date of the final decision within the meaning of former Article 26 of the Convention. The Court of Cassation\u2019s decision dismissing his application for rescission of the exclusion order was delivered on 19 December 1995, but the applicant had not lodged his application until 26 December 1996. The Government said that, as required by the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment had subsequently been sent (on 16 February 1996) to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office at the Lyons Court of Appeal for service. However, staff at the Court of Appeal had been unable to effect service as the applicant had provided no information regarding his home address in Algeria. The Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office at the Lyons Court of Appeal had attempted to obtain the address but had had to resign itself to the fact that it would be physically impossible to serve the decision on the applicant. It followed that the failure to serve the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment was not attributable to the relevant judicial department but, on the contrary, to the applicant\u2019s conduct. In addition, there was circumstantial evidence to suggest that the applicant had in fact become aware of the final domestic decision early enough to have been able to comply with former Article 26 of the Convention. A telephone call to the registry of either the Court of Cassation or the Court of Appeal would have sufficed to establish the tenor of the judgment of 19 December 1995. Furthermore, although the applicant was not represented by counsel at the hearing before the Court of Cassation, he had since 1994 been assisted by a lawyer, Mr J. Debray, who had prepared the notice of appeal on points of law on his behalf and had represented him before the Convention institutions. In conclusion, a combination of those factors showed that it had been the applicant\u2019s own conduct that had prevented his being served with the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment and that he could have found out what the decision was from the day it was delivered. Consequently, the Government contended that the application was inadmissible ratione temporis.",

He maintained that under the Commission\u2019s settled case-law, the six-month time-limit could not start to run until the applicant had effective and sufficient knowledge of the final decision. In the instant case, the Government did not deny that neither the applicant nor his representative had been informed of the date of the hearing or that there had been a failure to serve the decision on the applicant. Accordingly, the time-limit could not have started to run until communication of the decision to him in September 1996, when, after repeated requests, it was received by his lawyer. Furthermore, under the domestic rules of criminal procedure, only a lawyer at the Conseil d\u2019Etat and Court of Cassation Bar could act for an appellant before the Court of Cassation. The fact that an applicant had filed his own memorial did not mean that he was entitled to representation before the Court of Cassation. Moreover, contrary to what the Government maintained, he had not lost interest in his appeal on points of law although it was obviously difficult, following his forced departure to Algeria, to follow the Court of Cassation proceedings closely. In any event, the Court of Cassation registry had not provided any information to either the appellant or his lawyer, the latter not being a member of the Conseil d\u2019Etat and Court of Cassation Bar. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s objection had to be dismissed.",

Furthermore, it is for the State which relies on the failure to comply with the six-month time-limit to establish the date when the applicant became aware of the final domestic decision (see, mutatis mutandis, the Deweer v. Belgium judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, pp. 14-15, \u00a7 26). In the instant case, the Court observes that the Government did not deny that the judgment of the Court of Cassation had not been served on the applicant, but maintained that if the applicant had not become aware of the judgment until 26 June 1996, it was through his own lack of diligence. The Court observes, however, that when the judgment of the Court of Cassation was delivered, the applicant was in an unstable situation in Algeria that had almost certainly made it difficult for him to obtain information about the outcome of his appeal in France. In addition, the decision was not served on the applicant\u2019s counsel either, despite the fact that he had lodged the notice of appeal on points of law on the applicant\u2019s behalf, and the Court of Cassation registry had his address. Under those circumstances and in the absence of any irrefutable evidence showing that the applicant or his counsel was aware of the judgment of the Court of Cassation before the date indicated, the Court finds the applicant\u2019s affirmation that he only became aware of the judgment in question in September 1996 credible (see, mutatis mutandis, Papachelas v. Greece [GC], no. 31423/96, \u00a7\u00a7 30 and 31, ECHR 1999-II). Consequently, the Government\u2019s preliminary objection must be dismissed.",

He had no close family in Algeria. With regard to the nature and seriousness of the offence of which he had been convicted, he pointed out that two-thirds of his sentence had been suspended. He argued that the exclusion order, even though for a temporary period of ten years, had the same effects as a permanent exclusion order, which could not be regarded as a measure that was necessary in a democratic society, within the meaning of Article 8. In that connection, the applicant referred to a report delivered to the Minister of Justice in November 1998 by a commission established to review exclusion orders.

Moreover, as the Lyons Court of Appeal had found, he had supplied other users in the syndicate, adulterating the heroin in a way that made it particularly hazardous for them, namely by mixing it with other products, undoubtedly so that he would have larger quantities to sell. Added to that, of all the people implicated in the trafficking, it was the applicant who had received the heaviest sentence. He appeared in practice to have been at the heart of the syndicate. Under the circumstances, the Lyons Court of Appeal had increased the term of imprisonment imposed by the first-instance court and made the exclusion order.
