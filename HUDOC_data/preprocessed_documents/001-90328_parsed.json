He initially brought two separate claims concerning the same issues of fact and law which led to their being joined in single proceedings; he increased his claim several times; he challenged the impartiality of one judge and brought criminal charges against another one; and he questioned the competence of the expert involved in his case. In this connection, the Court reiterates that although a party to civil proceedings cannot be blamed for using the venues available to him under domestic law in order to protect his interests, he must accept that such actions necessarily prolong the proceedings concerned (see Malicka-W\u0105sowska v. Poland, (dec.), no.\u00a041413/98, 5 April 2001). The Court finds that the applicant was responsible for one-year delay of the proceedings in question. On the other hand, the applicant attended all scheduled hearings.",

While the higher courts examined the applicant\u2019s appeals with reasonable expedition, the first-instance court gave the first and only decision nearly seven years after the introduction of the applicant\u2019s claim, of which nearly five years fall within the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction. Despite the latter\u2019s behaviour, that time cannot be regarded as reasonable. During this period, a number of hearings were adjourned because either the defendants were not summoned properly or the sitting judge was absent. It further took about six months for the court-appointed expert to produce his opinion. That delay can be attributed only to the State (see Stojanov v. the , no. 34215/02, \u00a7\u00a060, 31\u00a0May\u00a02007). The changes of the composition of the adjudicating panel added to the length of the proceedings since the hearing restarted after each change. Finally, it took a total of about eleven months to serve two court decisions on the applicant (see paragraphs 14 and 17 above).",
