The Board also found the applicant\u2019s story to be vague, for example concerning the assault on his father.

The Board stressed that the applicant had been able to stay in  between June and September 2007, without anything happening to him.

When it had become clear to the police that the case concerned honour-related issues, they had stated that they did not have the resources to protect him. The reason he had been able to stay in  for several months was that he had been in hiding at his cousin\u2019s home.

First, the Court agreed with the Board\u2019s assessment that the general situation in  was not sufficient to justify granting the applicant\u2019s request. Turning to the individual circumstances of the case, the court considered that the applicant\u2019s story had been consistent and had not departed from what was generally known. The court further held that the applicant had given reasonable explanations for the inconsistencies highlighted in the Migration Board\u2019s decision. Thus, the court held, the applicant had made probable that he had been in a relationship with the woman, that they had been caught hugging, that he had then been attacked with scissors, that his shop had later been burnt down and that his father had been beaten and told that the applicant would be harmed. It did, however, note that the applicant\u2019s statements regarding the death of the woman and the further assault on the father were second-hand information of low evidential value. The court further stressed that two years had passed since the attack on the applicant and held that the interest from the woman\u2019s family had probably diminished. The risk that the applicant would be subjected to revenge upon return to  could, however, not be disregarded. The court further noted that the Migration Board had accepted that the applicant could not count on protection from the authorities. Thus, the applicant had made out that there was an individual threat against him which was local to  and the surrounding area. There was, however, nothing to suggest that the applicant would not be safe in other provinces. The court held that an internal relocation alternative, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq being an example, was reasonable and relevant even if the applicant had no social network there.",

We observe that although the May 2012 UNHCR Guidelines emphasise the harm caused by the ethno-sectarian conflict between different communities, especially that between Sunni and Shi\u2019a, they do not state there is a need for international refugee protection purely because a person is a Sunni or Shi\u2019a and we do not consider that the evidence shows that there is a real risk of Article 15(c) [of the Refugee Qualification Directive 2004/83/EC] harm arising solely because a person is a Sunni or Shi\u2019a civilian. And even where concern is expressed about both Sunnis and Shi\u2019as living in or returning to areas in which they would constitute a minority, the substance of what UNHCR is saying is not that Sunni Arabs living in majority Shi\u2019a areas and Shi\u2019a Arabs living in majority Sunni Arab areas \u201cwill\u201d be at Article 15(c) risk but simply that \u201cthey may be exposed to targeted violence on account of their religious identity\u201d. In our judgement the other evidence relating to Sunnis and Shi\u2019as reveals a similar picture. However, whilst for the above reasons we find the evidence as a whole insufficient to establish Sunni or Shi\u2019a identity as in itself an \u201cenhanced risk category\u201d under Article 15(c), we do accept that depending on the individual circumstances, and in particular on their facing return to an area where their Sunni or Shi\u2019a brethren are in a minority, a person may be able to establish a real risk of Article\u00a015(c).

Armed groups reportedly have operatives in many parts of the country and, as a result, a viable IFA/IRA will likely not exist for individuals at risk of being targeted by such groups in southern and central Iraq. As reported throughout these Guidelines, armed groups are present in many parts of the country and have demonstrated mobility in accessing areas where they do not have strongholds. The mobility and reach of armed groups should not be underestimated in determining the relevance of an IFA/IRA. Persons seeking to relocate to other areas in central and southern Iraq may be at risk of facing renewed violence given the high levels of violence prevailing in many areas. UNHCR protection monitoring shows that lack of physical safety remains a concern for both IDPs [internally displaced persons] and returnees, particularly in the central governorates. Reports have been received of returnees being targeted because they do not belong to the majority sect in their area of return. In some cases, these attacks have been fatal. The presence of IDPs can at times result in tensions with host communities that consider them a destabilizing factor.",

However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v.

The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001-II).

The perpetrators of the crimes visited upon the applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e cannot be considered as \u2018reasonable\u2019 people and, to my mind, it cannot be assumed that the passage of time has abated their desire for revenge.",
