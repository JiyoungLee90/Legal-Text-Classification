He further relied on Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 with regard to the domestic court\u2019s failure to reply to his complaints about the unlawfulness of his arrest. The applicant maintained under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that the proceedings against him had been unreasonably long and that he had been unable to have the relevant authorities held accountable for his allegedly unlawful prosecution and conviction. He also cited Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, stating that the fact of broadcasting his photograph on television during the pre-trial investigation, as a person \u201cwanted by the police\u201d, had been contrary to the presumption of innocence. The applicant alleged that the interference with his correspondence, as well as the authorities\u2019 failure to provide him with certain documents, had violated his right to obtain information as guaranteed by Article 10. Lastly, he complained under Article 13 that his numerous complaints to the President, the Ministry of Justice, the General Prosecutor Office and the domestic courts had been unsuccessful.",
