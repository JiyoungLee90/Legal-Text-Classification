As regards the latter remedy, the Government argued that it had been effective at the time when the applicant had lodged his application with the Court. They cited a number of domestic cases in which various provisions of the Civil Code had been successfully relied on, resulting in prisoners being awarded compensation for nonpecuniary damage suffered on account of an unlawful interference with their right to protect themselves from passive smoking, food poisoning, being beaten up by fellow inmates or being at an increased risk of contracting HIV.

The Court, nevertheless, indicated that where the alleged violation no longer persisted and could not, therefore, be eliminated with retrospective effect, the only means of redress was pecuniary compensation. In such situations, regard being had to the principle of subsidiarity, it could not be excluded that applicants who complained of degrading treatment because of the conditions of their detention might be required to first avail themselves of the civil action relied on by the Government (ibid. \u00a7 109 ).",

The Court adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.
