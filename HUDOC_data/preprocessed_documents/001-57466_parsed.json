The Commission ordered the joinder of the first two applications on 6 May 1980 and the joinder of the third application to the other two on 11 October 1982.

In particular, they contended that the auditeur-militair and, as far as Mr. van den Brink was concerned, the officier-commissaris could not be regarded as such \"officers\".

The Commission, in its decision of 7 May 1981 on the admissibility of applications nos. 8805/79 and 8806/79, limited its attention to the failure to sue under Article 1401 for damages for prejudice suffered.",

However, the Government substantially supplemented their pleading in several ways at the hearing before the Court on 22 November 1983, notably by advancing fresh grounds for their objection of non-exhaustion. Firstly, they extended this objection to Mr. van den Brink. Secondly, so the Government stated, although under Article 1401 compensation was recoverable only in respect of material loss, Mr. de Jong and Mr. Baljet could have sought from the civil courts a declaratory judgment as to the unlawfulness of their detention and then, on the basis of that judgment, requested compensation for non-material prejudice from the Minister of Defence (see paragraph 21, fourth sub-paragraph, above); Mr. van den Brink, alternatively or in addition to suing for damages in the civil courts, could have asked for compensation for both material and non-material loss in the proceedings before the Military Court in accordance with the \"interim provision\" of 26 June 1979 making Articles 89 and following of the civilian Code of Criminal Procedure applicable to military criminal proceedings (see paragraph 21, second sub-paragraph, above). Finally, the Government pleaded \"another possibility provided for by Article 1401 of the Civil Code\" but \"overlooked by the Commission\": the applicant servicemen, whilst still in custody, could have had recourse to Article 1401 in summary proceedings before the President of a District Court in accordance with Articles 289 and following of the Code of Civil Procedure in order to obtain a provisional order of immediate release on the ground that their detention was \"unlawful\" by reason of the alleged violations of the Convention (see paragraph 21, fifth sub-paragraph, above).",

At the hearing before the Court, the Government recognised that \"the scope of this Article [1401]\" - in also permitting injunctions to be obtained without the need to prove actual \"damage\" and \"fault\" as specified in the text of the Article (set out at paragraph 21, third sub-paragraph, above) - \"is wider than the text suggests\".",

In the Court\u2019s view, claiming compensation after the event for damage caused and applying whilst still in custody for immediate release are in substance two different remedies, albeit based in  law on the same Article in the Civil Code. The Court cannot accept that, when invoking the latter remedy for the first time at the hearing on 22 November 1983, the Government were simply developing further the argument they had already put forward on Article 1401 of the Civil Code before the Commission: they were alleging failure to exhaust a remedy of a quite different nature from that considered by the Commission at the admissibility stage. Furthermore, as the Delegate of the Commission rightly pointed out, the applications having been communicated to the Government for their observations on admissibility, it was not for the Commission to ascertain of its own motion whether Article 1401 offered an additional remedy other than that which was apparent on the face of the text and which had been discussed in the pleadings (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Foti and Others judgment, ibid.).",

Referring to the risk of arbitrariness, they concluded that since this ground was not listed in paragraph 1 of Article 5 (art. 5-1) and in particular in sub-paragraph (c) (art. 5-1-c), their deprivation of liberty was not justified in terms of that provision.",

In making the need to maintain discipline amongst other servicemen an additional condition, Articles 7 and 14 of the Military Code do not lay down a further instance to those listed in Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) of the Convention where deprivation of liberty is permitted, but a further requirement to be satisfied under Netherlands law before a serviceman can be placed or kept in custody on suspicion of having committed an offence. Whether the mere persistence of suspicion suffices to warrant the prolongation of a lawfully ordered detention on remand is covered, not by Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) as such, but by Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) (see the St\u00f6gm\u00fcller judgment of 10 November 1969, Series A no. 9, p. 40, para. 4): it is essentially the object of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), which forms a whole with paragraph 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) (see the Schiesser judgment of 4 December 1979, Series A no. 34, p. 12, para. 29, and the authorities cited there), to require provisional release once detention ceases to be reasonable (see, for example, the above-mentioned St\u00f6gm\u00fcller judgment, p. 39, para. 3).",

According to the literal terms of the relevant national law, prior to referral for trial the auditeur-militair had no power to order the applicants\u2019 release: Article 11 of the Military Code conferred on him only an investigatory and advisory role which was, moreover, confined to the sole question of referral for trial (see paragraph 16, first sub-paragraph, above). In the Government\u2019s submission, however, this apparent limitation in the law has to be read in the light of the actual practice followed whereby the advice also extended to the issue of detention and was invariably followed by the referring officer (see paragraph 16, final sub-paragraph, above). This \"standard procedure\" meant, so it was argued, that the auditeur-militair in fact decided since his advice as to whether to detain or not was treated as a \"binding recommendation\" by the officer who had the formal power of decision. In sum, the Government maintained that \"the substance should prevail over the form\".",

Nonetheless, the Court, like the Commission (see paragraph 85 of the report), is unable to accept the Government\u2019s reasoning. Admittedly, in determining Convention rights one must frequently look beyond the appearances and the language used and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see, for example, in relation to Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), the above-mentioned Van Droogenbroeck judgment, Series A no. 50, p. 20, para. 38). However, formal, visible requirements stated in the \"law\" are especially important for the identification of the judicial authority empowered to decide on the liberty of the individual in view of the confidence which that authority must inspire in the public in a democratic society (see, mutatis mutandis, the Piersack judgment of 1 October 1982, Series A no. 53, p. 14, para. 30 (a)). There was no official directive or even policy instruction to auditeurs-militair and referring officers to interpret the Military Code in this way, only a purely internal practice of no binding force that could at any moment lawfully be departed from. That is not sufficient to constitute authority given by \"law\" to exercise the requisite \"judicial power\" contemplated by Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) (see the final part of the passage from the Schiesser judgment cited above at paragraph 47).",

He would thereby become a committed party to any criminal proceedings subsequently brought against the serviceman on whose detention he was advising prior to referral for trial. In sum, the auditeur-militair could not be \"independent of the parties\" (see the extract from the Schiesser judgment quoted above at paragraph 47) at this preliminary stage precisely because he was liable to become one of the parties at the next stage of the procedure (see the judgment of today\u2019s date in the case of Duinhof and Duijf, Series A no. 79, para. 38).",

The procedure followed for bringing a person before the \"competent legal authority\" in accordance with paragraph 3 taken in conjunction with paragraph 1 (c) (art. 5-3+5-1-c) may admittedly have a certain incidence on compliance with paragraph 4. For example, where that procedure culminates in a decision by a \"court\" ordering or confirming deprivation of the person\u2019s liberty, the judicial control of lawfulness required by paragraph 4 is incorporated in this initial decision (see the De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 40, para. 76, and the above-mentioned Van Droogenbroeck judgment, Series A no. 50, p. 23, paras. 44-45). However, the guarantee assured by paragraph 4 (art. 5-4) is of a different order from, and additional to, that provided by paragraph 3 (art. 5-3). The Court itself has on several previous occasions examined whether the same set of facts gave rise to a breach of both paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 5 (art. 5-3, art. 5-4), without ever suggesting that the safeguards provided might not apply concurrently (see the Neumeister judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, pp. 36-41 and 43-44, paras. 3-15 and 22-25; the Matznetter judgment of 10 November 1969, Series A no. 9, pp. 31-35, paras. 2-13; the above-mentioned Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment, Series A no. 25, pp. 75-77, paras. 199-200).

Mr. de Jong was seven days, Mr. Baljet eleven days and Mr. van den Brink six days in custody before being referred for trial (see paragraphs 23 and 27 above) and hence without a remedy. In the Court\u2019s view, even having regard to the exigencies of military life and military justice, the length of absence of access to a court was in each case such as to deprive the applicant of his entitlement to bring proceedings to obtain a \"speedy\" review of the lawfulness of his detention. Mr. de Jong and Mr. Baljet were in fact released on being referred for trial, and Mr. van den Brink, although maintained in detention, did not take advantage of the possibility of seeking release under Article 34 of the Military Code following his referral for trial.

It cannot be said on the evidence that the applicants would probably have been released or released earlier from custody on remand had they received the benefit of the guarantees contained in the two latter paragraphs (cf. the Artico judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, p. 20, para. 42). At the very least, each applicant did however forfeit the opportunity of a \"prompt\" or \"speedy\" judicial control of his detention. The applicants must have suffered, by reason of the absence of the relevant guarantees, some non-material prejudice not wholly compensated by the findings of violation or even, in Mr. van den Brink\u2019s case, by the deduction of the period spent in custody on remand from the sentence of imprisonment ultimately imposed (see, mutatis mutandis, the Van Droogenbroeck judgment of 25 April 1983, Series A no. 63, p. 7, para. 13). In the circumstances and in view of the modest nature of the claims made, the Court sees no reason to draw a distinction between the three applicants. The Court awards each applicant a lump sum of 300 Dutch Guilders by way of just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50).",
