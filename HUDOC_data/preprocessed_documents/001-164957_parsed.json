Moreover, unlike some of the cases examined in Velikovi and Others, the applicants had not lost their property due to errors committed by the authorities, and the State \u2012 not having participated in the sale of the land in 1993 \u2012 could not be held responsible for the consequences of the invalidation of their title.

These cases concerned the application of different legislation, which was adopted in 1992 and was applicable to urban properties, especially dwellings. Even though that legislation provided for the restoration, in principle, of titles to property owned at the time by the State, exceptionally it gave former owners of nationalised properties the possibility of seeking restitution even where such property had in the meantime been acquired by private individuals. To that end, they had to demonstrate that the buyers had acted in breach of the law or through abuse of office. It was initially provided that they could make their claims within a year following the respective legislation\u2019s entry into force, but in 1997 the deadline was renewed. The applicants to the Court were the third parties whose properties had been taken to satisfy the former owners\u2019 restitution claims.",

It held, first, that the years after 1989 in Bulgaria had represented a unique period of social, economic and legal transition, during which difficult decisions had had to be taken with regard to the restitution of nationalised property (see Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7 166). Thus, for the Court, the taking of private property to satisfy restitution claims and the challenging of property titles \u2012 some of them decades-old \u2012 could only, exceptionally, be justified when associated with that transition; otherwise, it could not be reconciled with the principle of legal certainty (ibid., \u00a7 189). This led the Court to find violations of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in several cases where the applicants\u2019 titles had not been challenged before the initial deadline of one year after the entry into force of the restitution legislation \u2013 the period associated with the beginning of Bulgaria\u2019s social and legal transition \u2013 but at a later date, after the initial deadline had been renewed (see Tsonkovi v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 27213/04, \u00a7\u00a7 24-27, 2 July 2009; Georgieva and Mukareva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37-39; and Tonov and Others v.

For the Court, this meant that the cases at issue did not fall within the scope of the legitimate aim of restoring justice and the rule of law pursued in principle by the restitution legislation (see Velikovi and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7 190). In these cases, as well as in others where it found that the national courts had extended excessively the scope of application of the restitution legislation, in disregard of the principle of legal certainty (see the cases of Todorova and Eneva and Dobrev, examined in Velikovi and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 240-41 and 245-58 of the judgment), the Court held that the fair balance required under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 could not be achieved without appropriate compensation. The applicable legislation provided for a compensation scheme, and the Court, examining its operation in practice, found that in some cases the applicants had managed to obtain compensation which sufficed to restore the fair balance required under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and that in other cases that they had not, in breach of the requirements of that provision.",

The applicants lost title to that plot following the adoption of restitution legislation by the Parliament in Bulgaria and its subsequent application by the national courts. In particular, section\u00a010(13) of the ALA provided that former owners\u2019 title to agricultural land would be restored even in cases where the land had in the meantime been sold or transferred to third parties, also precluding the possibility for those third parties to rely on acquisitive prescription (see paragraph 15 above). Applying this provision to the case in question, the courts found that the heirs of Mr K. had, on the basis of restitution, become owners of the land bought earlier by the applicants (see paragraphs 10 and\u00a012 above).",

Thus, where, in the cases of the Velikovi group, the applicants\u2019 titles had been challenged in 1997-98, long after the initial deadline of one year following the entry into force of the respective restitution legislation had expired, the Court found that the interference with the applicants\u2019 property rights could not be seen as falling within the scope of the legitimate aims that the said legislation pursued in principle, since it represented a significant departure from its transitional character (see Tsonkovi, \u00a7 23-26, and Georgieva and Mukareva, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, both cited above).",

In addition, taking due account of the Bulgarian Constitutional Court\u2019s position that former owners had not lost their property rights with the collectivisation of agricultural land, but had merely been prevented from exercising those rights (see paragraphs 17-18 above), the Court nevertheless cannot conclude that before the adoption of its section 10(13) the ALA provided any valid grounds for the restitution of title to plots which had in the meantime been transferred to private parties. The Court relies in that regard on the Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s position before 1997, demonstrated by its Interpretative Decision of 25 June 1996, pointing out that where buyers of agricultural land \u2012 such as the applicants \u2012 had acted in good faith and their title was not otherwise defective, that title had to be considered valid and could be used to combat former owners\u2019 restitution claims (see paragraph\u00a014 above). Moreover, before 1990 the view was held that agricultural co-operatives owned the land they used and could validly sell it to private individuals (see paragraph 19 above).",

The measure cannot thus be seen as \u201cexceptional\u201d and strictly related to the period of political and economic transition in Bulgaria, which, as in many of the Velikovi-type cases, would have justified it in principle. It is also striking that the possibility for former owners to challenge private parties\u2019 title to agricultural land on the basis of section 10(13) of the ALA was definitely not limited in time. Once in possession of a favourable restitution decision, those former owners could wait for years before claiming their land, since, in particular, the persons who had acquired the land could not rely on acquisitive prescription. This is precisely what happened in the present case: while the heirs of Mr K. obtained favourable restitution decisions in 1995 and 1996, in was only in 2003 that the persons to whom they transferred the land took possession of it, provoking the applicants\u2019 defence through a rei vindicatio claim (see paragraph 8 above).",

In fact, that provision quite simply wiped out the consequences of contracts of sale concluded after collectivisation without requiring that they be demonstrated to be in any way defective. This was also the situation in the case. As already noted (see paragraph 43 above), it was not argued that the applicants\u2019 title was in itself invalid, and even though the applicants had bought the land in 1993, it had been privately owned since 1967 (see paragraph 7 above).",

Assessing the applicants\u2019 plot to be slightly inferior to these ones, it calculated on this basis its possible selling price at BGN 57,980, the equivalent of EUR 29,580. In addition, the report hypothesised that there might have been a more substantial potential profit from the land if the applicants had been able to keep it and had found an investor who wanted to build a hotel on it. On this basis it calculated the \u201cjust market price\u201d indicated above and claimed by the applicants.",

It observes that the claim made in the report that the applicants could have received a significant profit had they had a hotel built on the plot is purely speculative (see Todorova and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7 18) and it will not take it into account.
