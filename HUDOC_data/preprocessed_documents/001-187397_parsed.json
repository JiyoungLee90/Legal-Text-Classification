On the same day that web portal also published a statement by the chairman of the Croatian Helsinki Committee, \u017d.P., who expressed his organisation\u2019s support for Narodni List and stated that the photojournalist had been taking photographs in a public place, which was not against the law. He added that what was going on was \u201ctotally crazy\u201d, that whoever went along with the criminal complaint against A.M. was \u201cnot in his right mind\u201d (nije pri sebi), and that the entire topic was \u201ctoo stupid\u201d to warrant any discussion. The next day Index published a commentary defending freedom of the press and criticising the conduct of the police and judicial authorities in the matter. The article was accompanied by two photographs of the building in which another municipal and county court were located. By publishing those photographs the portal satirically expressed its support for A.M. by joining him, as ironically stated in the article, in his seditious and \u201csubversive actions\u201d of photographing court buildings.",

The applicant company further argued that the expressions used in the article had reflected the general atmosphere in society and the judiciary, and had corresponded to the level of public dialogue in Croatia at the relevant time. Furthermore, the supposedly insulting character of the article had matched the level of arbitrariness in decision-making when Judge B.B. had issued a warrant to search the applicant company\u2019s premises in 2006. Finally, the arbitrary character of both the criminal investigation against one of its journalists and of the contested judgments whereby the applicant company had been ordered to pay compensation for tarnishing the reputation of Judge B.B. had instilled fear in the journalists of Narodni List as to how they would continue to make a living and had consequently led to self-censorship.",

Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, \u00a7 83, 7 February 2012). In order for Article 8 to come into play, however, an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see, for example, B\u00e9dat v.\u00a0Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, \u00a7 72, 29 March 2016, and Axel Springer AG, loc. cit.). In that connection, the Court considers that the article published in the weekly magazine Narodni List on 31 October 2008 (see\u00a0paragraph 11 above) amounted to such attack on the reputation of Judge\u00a0B.B. (see paragraphs 56 and 61 below). In cases which require the right to respect for private life to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression, the outcome of the application should not, in principle, vary according to whether it has been lodged with the Court under Article 8 of the Convention by the person who was the subject of the news report, or under Article 10 by the publisher. These rights deserve equal respect. Accordingly, the margin of appreciation should in principle be the same in both situations (see, for example, Satakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v. Finland [GC], no. 931/13, \u00a7 163, 27 June 2017).

Some two years before the publication of the impugned article, the judge in question had issued a warrant for a search of the applicant company\u2019s premises, which the journalists at the magazine, considered was in breach of their journalistic freedom. Two years later the judge again caught the attention of the journalists of Narodni List when he attended a party to celebrate the opening of another newspaper started by a controversial local entrepreneur. This triggered the publication of the impugned article, which suggested that, by attending the party, the judge had put himself in a situation of a potential conflict of interest, which was contrary to the Code of Judicial Ethics. The article also recalled what its author saw as the unlawful issuing of the search warrant against the applicant company two years before. The message that the article seemed to convey, through suggesting \u201cin metaphorical way\u201d, as the applicant company stated (see paragraph 37 above), that the said judge should be put in the pillory (literally, \u201cchained to the pole of shame\u201d), was that the public should see his actions as shameful and criticise him for it.",

The protection afforded by Article 10 of the Convention to journalists is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism (see, for example, B\u00e9dat, cited above, \u00a7 72).",

While it is true that the article was coloured by Narodni List journalists\u2019 personal experience and discontent with that particular judge, the Court considers that in the given circumstances, this did not call into question the fact that the article concerned a matter of public interest.",

The Court further reiterates that it may sometimes be difficult, as in the instant case, to distinguish between statements of fact and value judgments (see, for example, Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v.

Especially in cases where such difficulty arises it should be reiterated that the interpretation of remarks for the purposes of characterising them as statements of fact or value judgments falls primarily within the margin of appreciation afforded to national authorities, in particular the domestic courts (see Prager and Oberschlick, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036, and Peruzzi v. Italy, no. 39294/09, \u00a7 48, 30 June 2015). In any event, the difference between factual statements and value judgments lies ultimately in the degree of factual proof, which has to be established (see\u00a0Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft, cited above, loc. cit.) because even a value judgment may be excessive in the absence of sufficient \u201cfactual basis\u201d (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7 126).",

The Court takes due note of the Government\u2019s argument that Judge B.B. would not have brought a civil action for defamation and sought damages if the applicant company had published an apology (see paragraph 48 above). While this is an important element to be borne in mind it does not mean that the domestic courts were free to make any award they saw fit since, under the Convention, an award of damages for defamation must bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered (see,\u00a0mutatis mutandis, Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, 13 July 1995, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 316B).",

That being so, the Court further considers that in the present case the applicant company must have sustained non-pecuniary damage as a result of the violation found which cannot be sufficiently compensated by mere \ufb01nding of a violation. Therefore, ruling on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant company EUR 5,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
