The Government further argued that a recount of votes had not been possible in the present case, because in accordance with Article 106.3.6 of the Electoral Code in force at the material time (this provision was subsequently repealed in 2008), ballots which were not in envelopes were considered invalid. As all the ballots submitted to the CEC had already been pulled out of their envelopes during the original count in the relevant polling stations and had not been put back into them, the recount of these ballots was impossible.",

In particular, it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, \u00a7 52, and Gitonas and Others v.\u00a0Greece, 1 July 1997, \u00a7 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV).

Turkey, 30\u00a0January 1998, \u00a7 33, Reports 1998-I; Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, \u00a7 100, ECHR 1999-III; and Lykourezos v.

The right to stand as a candidate in an election, which is guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a01 and is inherent in the concept of a truly democratic regime, would only be illusory if one could be arbitrarily deprived of it at any moment. Consequently, while it is true that States have a wide margin of appreciation when establishing eligibility conditions in the abstract, the principle that rights must be effective requires that the eligibility procedure contain sufficient safeguards to prevent arbitrary decisions (see Podkolzina v. Latvia, no.\u00a046726/99, \u00a7\u00a035, ECHR 2002-II). Although originally stated in connection with the conditions on eligibility to stand for election, the principle requiring prevention of arbitrariness is equally relevant in other situations where the effectiveness of individual electoral rights is at stake (see Namat Aliyev, cited above, \u00a7 72), including the manner of review of the outcome of elections and invalidation of election results (see Kovach v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 39424/02, \u00a7\u00a055 et seq., ECHR\u00a02008-...).",

However, it observes that, unlike the Kerimova judgment, where it was apparent from the established facts that the applicant would have won the election had the election results not been invalidated arbitrarily (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 47), in the present case it is not possible to establish with certainty that the applicant would have won the election in his electoral constituency. Specifically, while the applicant claimed that he had received the highest number of votes based on the copies of PEC results records in his possession, no similar aggregated vote count showing him as the winner has ever been officially produced by the relevant ConECs or CEC (unlike in the Kerimova case). In this respect, the Court notes that, unless it is rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of the case, it is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute itself for domestic electoral authorities or to take on the function of a first-instance tribunal of fact by attempting to determine the exact vote counts on the basis of records of election results issued by electoral commissions of the lowest level or to determine who should have won the elections in the applicant\u2019s constituency (see, mutatis mutandis, Namat Aliyev, cited above, \u00a7 77). Nevertheless, it is sufficiently clear from the facts of the case that the applicant was one of the frontrunners among other candidates in his electoral constituency and that the authorities\u2019 decision to annul the election results affected the applicant\u2019s chances of being elected to the National Assembly. In this connection, the Court also reiterates that Article\u00a03 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 guarantees not a right to win the election per se, but a right to stand for election in fair and democratic conditions (ibid., \u00a7\u00a075).",

Even accepting the Government\u2019s argument that under Azerbaijani law an election recount was optional (at the CEC\u2019s discretion) and not mandatory, the Court considers that in the present case the CEC could have considered the possibility of a recount or explained the reasons for passing up this opportunity before deciding on an invalidation of the election results. Secondly, the Court notes that the domestic authorities ignored the requirements of Article 114.5 of the Electoral Code, which prohibited invalidation of election results at any level on the basis of a finding of irregularities committed for the benefit of candidates who lost the election. Accordingly, it appears that according to this provision, prior to considering a decision to annul the results of an election, the authorities first had to specify the total vote counts and determine in whose favour the alleged irregularities had been committed. However, this was not done in the present case. In the Court\u2019s view, the authorities\u2019 failure to order a recount of votes or to take into account the requirements of Article 114.5 of the Electoral Code, and the lack of any explanation for that failure, contributed to the appearance of arbitrariness of the decision to annul the election results (compare Kerimova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 49-51).",
