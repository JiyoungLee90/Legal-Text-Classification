The judge heard submissions from the prosecution and defence during a preliminary hearing (\u201cvoir dire\u201d) on 11 and 12 January 1999. On 14 January 1999, the trial judge ruled that the evidence should be admitted. When shortly afterwards this judge became unable to sit, the new trial judge heard the matter afresh. In his ruling of 26 February 1999, he found that the police had failed to comply with paragraphs D.2.11, D.2.15 and D.2.16 of the Code of Practice, inter alia with regard to their failure to ask the applicant for his consent to the video, to inform him of its creation, to inform him of its use in an identification parade, and of his own rights in that respect (namely, to give him an opportunity to view the video, object to its contents and to inform him of the right for his solicitor to be present when witnesses saw the videotape). However, the judge concluded that there had been no unfairness arising from the use of the video. Eleven persons had been filmed for comparison purposes rather than the required eight and were all within comparative height, age and appearance. Even though the applicant's solicitor was not present to verify the procedures adopted when the witnesses were shown the videos, the entire process had been recorded on video and this had been shown to the court which had the opportunity of seeing exactly how the entire video identification process had been operated. The judge ruled that the evidence was therefore admissible.",

In his summing-up to the jury, the trial judge warned the jury at considerable length about the \u201cspecial need for caution\u201d before convicting any defendant in a case turning partly on identification evidence and told the jury to ask themselves whether the video was a fair test of the ability of the witnesses to pick out their attacker, telling them that if it was not a fair test they should not give much, if any weight, to the identifications and also that if there was any possibility that the police planned a video identification rather than a live identification to put the applicant at a disadvantage, they could not rely safely on the video identification evidence.

The Code provided for a video identification procedure and the collection of footage without the suspect's knowledge if the suspect does not consent to take part in an identification parade. The fact that the Code was breached in three respects in the applicant's case however did not change its status as the basis for the compilation of the tape in domestic law and the domestic courts regarded the Code as sufficient legal basis for the compilation of the tape.

Belgium, applications nos.\u00a032200/96 and 32201/96, Commission decision of 14 January 1998, DR\u00a092-A, p. 92). On the other hand, the recording of the data and the systematic or permanent nature of the record may give rise to such considerations (see, for example, Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-44, ECHR 2000-V, and Amann v.

While the permanent recording of the voices of P.G. and J.H. was made while they answered questions in a public area of a police station as police officers listened to them, the recording of their voices for further analysis was regarded as the processing of personal data about them amounting to an interference with their right to respect for their private lives (the above-cited P.G. and J.H. judgment, at \u00a7\u00a7 59-60). Publication of the material in a manner or degree beyond that normally foreseeable may also bring security recordings within the scope of Article 8 \u00a7 1. In Peck v. the United Kingdom (no. 44647/98, judgment of 28 January 2003, ECHR 2003-...), the disclosure to the media for broadcast use of video footage of the applicant whose suicide attempt was caught on close circuit television cameras was found to be a serious interference with the applicant's private life, notwithstanding that he was in a public place at the time.

The permanent recording of the footage and its inclusion in a montage for further use may therefore be regarded as the processing or collecting of personal data about the applicant.",

That is not however the end of the matter. As pointed out by the applicant, the trial court, with which the appeal court agreed, found that the police had failed to comply with the procedures set out in the applicable code in at least three respects. The judge found shortcomings as regarded police compliance with paragraphs D.2.11, D.2.15 and D.2.16 of the Code of Practice (see paragraph 17 above), which concerned, significantly, their failure to ask the applicant for his consent to the video, to inform him of its creation and use in an identification parade, and of his own rights in that respect (namely, to give him an opportunity to view the video, object to its contents and to inform him of the right for his solicitor to be present when witnesses saw the videotape).
