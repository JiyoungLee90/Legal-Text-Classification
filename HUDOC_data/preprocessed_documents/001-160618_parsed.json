Simultaneously, the court ordered the applicant\u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital pursuant to Article 63 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 31 below). It held that the applicant was suffering from a disturbance in his sexual preference taking the form of sadism and found that the commission of further crimes was to be expected. The verdict of the Regional Court was based mainly on the conclusions of a psychiatric expert opinion but also took into account the applicant\u2019s previous conviction for indecent assault in 1990. It also observed that the applicant had tried to subjugate several prostitutes whom he had been seeing in recent years. The Regional Court found that this indicated an evolution in his behaviour. It noted that the applicant had refused psychiatric therapy so far and shared the expert\u2019s opinion that the applicant would not be able to resist his urge to humiliate and abuse women in order to satisfy his sexual drive. The Regional Court concluded that similar crimes were to be expected and the applicant therefore represented a danger to the public.",

Even assuming that the applicant might have a sadistic sexual disposition, he experienced this without suffering and had no desire to change. According to the verdict of the trial court, the applicant had probably fulfilled his sexual inclinations with prostitutes in order to avoid being charged with an offence. Neither the files nor his statements revealed the development of an addiction or of a pressing perverted imagination or of pathologic impulsiveness. There was no call for therapy as the applicant neither suffered from his behaviour nor desired to change it.

It explained that detention in a psychiatric hospital could be terminated on the grounds of an erroneous treatment order only if it was established with certainty that the applicant was not suffering from a mental illness warranting his detention under Article 63 of the Criminal Code owing to a diminished criminal responsibility from the very beginning. In this context the Regional Court observed that neither the statement by the psychological expert at the hearing nor the current and prior expert opinions had excluded the possibility that the applicant was suffering from sexual sadism, although this diagnosis had been found to be rather unlikely (see paragraphs 10 to 14, above). Furthermore, the court took into account that the applicant had refused to provide credible and full information about his sexual history and had thus rendered a certain diagnosis impossible. It therefore held that a committal to hospital by mistake had not been established beyond doubt. For this reason alone, therefore, the conditions for application of Article 67\u00a0d \u00a7 6 of the Criminal Code were not met. Lastly, the Regional Court noted, but explicitly without basing its decision on this fact, that the expert opinion which had been delivered in the course of the re-opening proceedings of the criminal trial had confirmed the diagnosis of sadism.",

Such an expert report would have to be based on the files only, since the applicant had announced his refusal of any examination. Under these circumstances the Court of Appeal found that no new conclusions could be expected from such an external expert opinion. Moreover, it found that the applicant\u2019s condition and dangerousness had not changed since his last examination as he had refused to undergo any therapy. The Court of Appeal further rejected the applicant\u2019s allegation that the Regional Court had reproached him for failing to undergo therapy, while the hospital considered him to be an erroneous admission. It held that in any event the root cause of the applicant\u2019s serious sexual crimes should be reappraised through therapy. In its view that would have been a requirement even if the applicant had been sentenced to imprisonment. The applicant himself had to bear the consequences of his refusal to participate in any therapy as the hospital offered therapy in order to reappraise the causes of crime even for patients who had been placed in hospital erroneously.",

The causal link required by subparagraph (a) might be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release or to redetain was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the initial decision (by a sentencing court) or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives.

Having regard to the domestic courts\u2019 reasoning, it is clear that the reason for refraining from ordering a new external expert opinion was the applicant\u2019s explicit refusal to allow himself to be examined by an expert at that time (see paragraphs 21 and 22, above; compare, mutatis mutandis, Constancia v.\u00a0the Netherlands (dec.), no. 73560/12, \u00a7 30, 30 March 2015). Furthermore, the Court observes that the domestic courts had obtained external expert opinions in the context of both the re-opening proceedings in 2010 and the review proceedings in 2014 and that on each occasion the applicant had refused to allow himself to be examined (see paragraphs 18 and 28, above).",

Despite the fact that, with the passage of time, the link between the applicant\u2019s initial conviction and the further deprivation of liberty may have become less strong, the domestic courts\u2019 decision not to obtain a fresh expert opinion and their assessment that the applicant was still dangerous as he had not undergone any treatment were not arbitrary. Having regard to the above considerations, the same holds true for the domestic courts\u2019 assessment that the applicant\u2019s detention in a psychiatric hospital was still justifiable in view of his having been diagnosed with a dissocial personality disorder, alcohol abuse and presumptive sexual sadism with a high risk of re-offending.",

In this context the enforcement courts observed that neither the explanation of the psychological expert at the hearing nor the current or prior expert opinions had excluded the possibility that the applicant was suffering from sexual sadism, although this diagnosis had been found to be rather unlikely. As a consequence, the conditions for application of Article 67d \u00a7 6 of the Criminal Code were not met. Having regard to the domestic courts\u2019 reasoning, the Court cannot subscribe to the applicant\u2019s view that in the proceedings at issue the courts established that he had never suffered from a mental illness which could be classified as sexual sadism because they explicitly did not exclude this diagnosis. In these circumstances the Court finds that the applicant was able to foresee \u2012 if necessary with the aid of legal advice \u2012 that the domestic courts would consider Article 67d \u00a7 6 of the Criminal Code to be not applicable in his case.",

It observes, in particular, that they found Article 67d \u00a7 6 of the Criminal Code to be inapplicable as its conditions were not met. Furthermore, they made it clear that the applicant had a right to be released under Article 67d \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code as soon as it could be expected that he would not commit any further unlawful acts on his release. The domestic courts\u2019 application of the domestic law thus did not render the applicant\u2019s release impossible. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the applicant was not arbitrarily deprived of his liberty in the circumstances of the present case. The Court is therefore satisfied that the order for the applicant\u2019s continued confinement in a psychiatric hospital as a result of the review proceedings at issue was \u201clawful\u201d and \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d as required by Article 5 \u00a7 1.",
