An applicant who has used a remedy which is apparently effective and sufficient cannot be required also to have tried others that were available but probably no more likely to be successful (see Aquilina v.

A further point of concern for the Court is the fact that no attempts were made to conduct an expert medical examination of the first applicant with a view to making an accurate record of his injuries and establishing their cause. This failure on the part of the investigator is particularly striking, given that officer G. had told him that force had been used against the first applicant during his arrest, and also in view of the overall complexity of the events surrounding the first applicant\u2019s arrest and placement in custody. The Government did not dispute that the first applicant had asked to be examined by a forensic expert. However, it appears that his requests were left without reply.

In the Court\u2019s view, this deferential attitude to their statements, accompanied by the failure to look for corroborating evidence, indicates a lack of any appearance of independence on the part of the investigator (see Ayd\u0131n v.

While the investigator may not have been provided with the names of individuals who could have seen the first applicant at the police station, he could have been expected to take steps of his own initiative to identify possible eyewitnesses. Furthermore, he took no meaningful steps to determine the identity of the police officers involved in the questioning of the first applicant in the police station (see Akulinin and Babich v.

Reiterating its considerations concerning the complexity of the events surrounding the alleged ill-treatment, the Court is further surprised that the investigator made no attempts to question at least those witnesses whose identities should have been known to him, that is, the victims of the robberies, who had witnessed the fight, and the first applicant\u2019s codefendants, who had been taken into custody together with him.",

With reference to the findings of the domestic courts that the first applicant had violently assaulted the victims, the Government argued that he might have sustained the injury spotted by K. while committing the crimes of which he was subsequently convicted. In this connection the Court observes that neither report no.\u00a01904, compiled some nine hours after the first applicant\u2019s arrest and recording a burn on his wrist, nor the letter of 7 June 2002 attesting to his further injuries, mentioned any injuries to the first applicant\u2019s knuckles. Hence, the Government\u2019s explanation that the injury might have been caused during the first applicant\u2019s scuffle with the victims is of no relevance to the Court\u2019s analysis.",

Indeed, given the conflicting statements by officers G. and K. as to whether or not force was used during the first applicant\u2019s arrest (see paragraphs 25, 32 and 36 above), it cannot be established with the required degree of certainty whether force was used and whether he obtained those injuries when being arrested. As regards the fight, the Court is mindful of the fact that the first applicant himself confirmed before the trial court that during the scuffle with the victims he had been hit and thrown onto his back (see paragraph 31 above). However, even if it cannot be reasonably excluded that the injury to the left elbow and the abrasion in the lumbosacral area might have been caused in the fight (compare Jasar v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a069908/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050-52, 15\u00a0February 2007), nothing in the first applicant\u2019s description of that fight or in the related findings of the domestic courts appears to provide a plausible explanation for the burn on his right wrist, recorded firstly by the narcotics specialist and then by the medical staff of the remand centre.",

Having regard to the foregoing considerations and the first applicant\u2019s submissions, the Court is led to conclude that, at the very least, the burn to the first applicant\u2019s right wrist was sustained between his arrest on 1\u00a0March 2001 at around 11.40 p.m. and his examination by the narcotics specialist on 2\u00a0March 2001 at 8.45 a.m., that is, while he was under the control of the police. Accordingly, the Government was under an obligation to provide a plausible explanation for that injury (see Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 87). However, besides denying the existence of the burn, they failed to provide any explanation as to how the first applicant had acquired it. In these circumstances, bearing in mind the authorities\u2019 obligation to account for injuries caused to persons within their control in custody, and in the absence of a convincing and plausible explanation by the Government in the instant case, the Court finds it established to the standard of proof required in the Convention proceedings that the injury sustained by the first applicant was a result of the treatment of which he complained and for which the Government bore responsibility (see, among many other authorities, Mikheyev v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0104-105).",

Treatment has been held by the Court to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering (see Labita, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0120). Treatment has been considered \u201cdegrading\u201d when it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them and possibly breaking their moral resistance, or when it was such as to drive the victim to act against his will or conscience (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a054810/00, \u00a7\u00a068, ECHR 2006...). In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment (see Labita, cited above, \u00a7 120).",

France, no.\u00a021788/93, Commission decision of 31\u00a0August 1994, Decisions and Reports (DR) 79, p. 54). In the absence of any evidence of violent behaviour on the part of the first applicant at the police station, the Court finds it difficult to understand why it was necessary to handcuff him, still less why he should have been handcuffed to a hot radiator. Having regard to the nature of the treatment, its duration and the resulting bodily injury, the Court considers that the suffering experienced by the first applicant went beyond the inevitable level of suffering connected with a given form of treatment and amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.",

When assessing conditions of detention, account must be taken of the cumulative effects of those conditions, as well as the specific allegations made by the applicant (see Dougoz v.

In this connection the Court notes that, apart from a general submission to the effect that the conditions of the first applicant\u2019s confinement in the Khamovnicheskiy District Court had conformed to the Detention of Suspects Act, the Government failed to furnish any detailed information as to the cells in which the first applicant had been detained, their dimensions, the number of inmates held there together with the first applicant, the availability of access to a toilet and other physical conditions of his detention there. Neither did they contest the first applicant\u2019s detailed description of those conditions, in particular as regards his allegations of overcrowding, insufficient lighting and ventilation and lack of access to drinking water and a toilet (see paragraph 46 above). In the absence of specific comments from the Government, the Court is therefore inclined to accept the first applicant\u2019s submission that on the days of court hearings he was held in cells for escorted prisoners measuring 5\u00a0sq.\u00a0m together with eight to ten inmates, that those cells were poorly ventilated and lit and that he only had access to the toilet as directed by the warden (compare Starokadomskiy v.

The Government did not contest the assertion that on the days of court hearings the first applicant left the remand centre before breakfast and did not return there until after dinner (see Vlasov v. Russia, no. 78146/01, \u00a7\u00a096, 12 June 2008; compare Starokadomskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058; see, by contrast, Bagel v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a037810/03, \u00a7\u00a069, 15\u00a0November 2007). Moreover, the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s unsupported assertion that the first applicant was provided with a dry ration on the days of his transfers to the court. They failed to produce a copy of the certificate to that effect from the head of the remand centre mentioned in their observations (see paragraph 49 above) or any other evidence to support that contention (see, by contrast, Bagel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069). Neither did the Government dispute the first applicant\u2019s submission that, despite his not being fed, his relatives had not been allowed to supply him with food on the hearings days. Similarly, it appears that the first applicant had access to drinking water only when the wardens let him visit the toilet (see Kadi\u0137is v.  (no.\u00a02), no.\u00a062393/00, \u00a7\u00a055, 4 May 2006). In connection with its findings above, the Court would emphasise that it considers it unacceptable for a person to be detained in conditions in which no provision is made for meeting his or her basic needs (see Riad and Idiab v. Belgium, nos. 29787/03 and 29810/03, \u00a7\u00a0106, ECHR 2008... (extracts)).",

Occasionally, he remained in a cell for most of the day, since some of the court hearings started at 3, 5 or 6\u00a0p.m. (see paragraph 46 above). Although the first applicant\u2019s detention in these cramped conditions was not continuous, the Court considers that the overall number of times he had to endure them cannot be deemed negligible (see, by contrast, Seleznev v. Russia, no. 15591/03, \u00a7\u00a061, 26 June 2008). It further should not be overlooked that the first applicant\u2019s detention in the cramped conditions described above alternated with his detention in the remand centre, which the Court has already found above to have amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. In these circumstances, the cumulative effect of the first applicant\u2019s detention in the overcrowded, poorly ventilated and poorly lit courthouse cells, without food, drink or free access to the toilet, must have been of an intensity such as to induce physical suffering and mental fatigue. This must have been further aggravated by the fact that the above treatment occurred during the first applicant\u2019s trial, that is, when he most needed his powers of concentration and mental alertness (see Starokadomskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a065). Having regard to the foregoing, the Court concludes that the first applicant was subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.",

Hence, once the first applicant, who had been placed in custody as a \u201csuspect\u201d, had been charged and had changed his procedural status, the authorities had been under an obligation to consider anew the issue of his detention.

The Government replied that the first applicant\u2019s detention had been covered by the prosecutor\u2019s initial decision of 4 March 2001 which, according to Article 97 of the CCrP, had remained a valid basis for his detention for two months, that is, until 4 May 2001.",

Indeed, no such obligation on the part of the competent authorities can be found in the text of Article 90 (see paragraph 54 above). Under that provision, the authorities were under an obligation either to charge the suspect within ten days of his arrest or to release him if no charges had been brought within that time-limit.",

Under Article 96, pre-trial detention could be ordered in respect of a person suspected of or charged with having committed offences punishable by more than two years\u2019 imprisonment. The first applicant was suspected of attempted murder and several robberies and the conditions set out in Article\u00a096 were therefore met. Furthermore, the charges against the first applicant were brought eight days after the Khamovniki district prosecutor had authorised his placement in custody as a suspect, that is, within the ten-day time-limit prescribed by Article 90. Hence, the domestic authorities complied with the requirements set out in Articles\u00a090 and 96 of the Code. Under Article 97, the initial period of pre-trial detention lasted two months. Bearing in mind that the first applicant was arrested on 2 March 2001on suspicion of having committed the above-mentioned offences, that initial period would have expired on 2 May 2001, as noted in the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 27 April 2001 (see paragraph 12 above). Having regard to the text of Article 97, the Court is satisfied that this period of time was sufficiently foreseeable to enable the first applicant to regulate his conduct, if necessary with appropriate advice.",

It falls in the first place to the national authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end, they must, while paying due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a public interest requirement justifying a departure from the rule in Article 5, and must set them out in their decisions on the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the well-documented facts stated by the first applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7 3 (see, for example, Labita, cited above, \u00a7 152, and Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 110).",

It reiterates in this respect that in cases involving numerous defendants, collecting evidence is often a difficult task, as it is necessary to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources and to determine the facts and degree of alleged responsibility of each of the co-accused (see, mutadis mutandis, \u0141aszkiewicz v. , no. 28481/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a059 and 61, 15\u00a0January 2008). The investigation in the present case required measures involving taking evidence from various sources, confronting the alleged perpetrators with the victims and carrying out a number of forensic examinations. Having regard to the amount of work carried out by the investigating authorities in the initial three months of the first applicant\u2019s detention (see paragraph 14 above), the Court does not find any failure on their part to act with due diligence during that period of time.",
