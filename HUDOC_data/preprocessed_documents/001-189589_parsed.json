The effect of that provision is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint. However, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law. The \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the \u201cauthority\u201d referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 16483/12, \u00a7 268, 15\u00a0December 2016).",

Article 6 \u00a7 1 imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time. Where the judicial system is deficient in this respect, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy. Hence, this type of remedy is \u201ceffective\u201d in so far as it hastens the decision by the court concerned. At the same time, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings may not be adequate to redress a situation in which the proceedings have clearly already been excessively long. In such situations, different types of remedy may redress the violation appropriately, including a compensatory remedy. Furthermore, States may choose to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation, although they may also choose to introduce only a compensatory remedy without such remedy being regarded as ineffective (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 183-187, ECHR\u00a02006V, and Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, \u00a7\u00a7 74-78, ECHR 2006V).",

It was the responsibility of the domestic courts which ordered the expert examinations to satisfy that requirement by choosing the most appropriate expert organisation, following up their own orders, and making sure that those orders were promptly implemented, if necessary through compulsory enforcement. Furthermore, it appears that the main reason for the failure to carry out a timely expert examination was the experts\u2019 inability to access the premises of company H., where the examination was to be conducted, even though the authorities attempted to secure such access with the assistance of DEJA (see paragraph 23 above). It is therefore unclear how the actions suggested by the Government could have remedied that situation. Lastly, the Court does not see how contesting the decisions staying the proceedings could have expedited the proceedings in question, taking into account that those decisions were the result rather than the cause of the failure to carry out the required expert examinations. Moreover, contesting the decisions staying the proceedings before the Civil Court of Appeal, aside from being unlikely to expedite the proceedings, could itself have become a factor delaying those proceedings (see, for example, Efimenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a055870/00, \u00a7 64, 18 July 2006).
