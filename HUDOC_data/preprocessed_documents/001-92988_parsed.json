The Court has already found that, in the context of the conflict in , when a person is detained by unidentified servicemen without any subsequent acknowledgment of the detention, this can be regarded as life-threatening. The absence of Abu Khasuyev or of any news of him for more than seven years supports this assumption.

Moreover, the stance of the prosecutor\u2019s office and the other law enforcement authorities after the news of Abu Khasuyev\u2019s detention had been communicated to them by the applicant contributed significantly to the likelihood of the disappearance, as no necessary steps were taken in the crucial first days and weeks after the arrest.

The Court notes that the investigation was opened on 27 October 2001, that is one month and twenty-seven days after the detention had occurred. This delay in itself was liable to affect the investigation of a crime such as abduction in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. The crime scene investigation in the applicant\u2019s flat was conducted only on 6 July 2006, which is four years, ten months and seven days after the abduction (see paragraph 73 above). It also appears that within the two years following the abduction the applicant was the only witness questioned by the investigators. In April 2008 the supervising prosecutor criticised the investigation, indicated the number of crucial steps which had been delayed and ordered the investigators to carry them out (see paragraph 81 above).",
