The Government further submitted that the slogans chanted had incited violence and that the concert had turned into a meeting of a terrorist organisation. The Government also noted that the applicant had been on the concert\u2019s organising committee, and not simply a member of the audience. According to the Government, the applicant had had a responsibility to prevent disorder and to protect public safety: a responsibility which he had failed to discharge, as he had manipulated the crowd by chanting slogans. Noting that the applicant\u2019s conviction had been based on his participation in a propaganda event in favour of the DHKP/C  a terrorist organisation that had committed heinous acts \u2013 and on his chanting slogans in favour of that organisation, the Government concluded by stating that the applicant\u2019s conviction had responded to a pressing social need and had therefore been necessary in a democratic society.",

The applicant denied the allegation that he had chanted the slogans noted in the indictment, while acknowledging that he had attended the concert and chanted slogans (see paragraph 8 above). Hence, by acknowledging some of the facts concerning the exercise of his freedom of expression, the applicant must be considered to have raised his complaint under Article 10 of the Convention in substance before the national courts (see Ulusoy v.
