Assuming that it did furnish a sufficient legal basis, it appears illogical and peculiar that on 1\u00a0July 2006 \u2013 almost three years after the applicant's placement in custody \u2013 the prosecutor considered it necessary to ask the court for a fourteen-day extension of his detention and the District Court granted the request (see paragraph 37 above). In doing so, the District Court explicitly cited Article\u00a0109 as the legal basis for its decision. It did not specify, however, which part of that Article permitted continued detention of the applicant, who had by then spent more than one year in custody in excess of the maximum eighteen-month time-limit set out in paragraph 4 of that Article (see paragraph 51 above). The Government omitted to comment on the legal provisions on which that decision could have been premised. Nor did they state what the legal basis for the applicant's detention had been after 14\u00a0July 2006, that is after the expiry of the detention period extended by the decision of 1 July 2006. Furthermore, it is likewise illogical and peculiar that on 13\u00a0September 2006 that decision was found to have been lawful and justified by the Moscow City Court, notwithstanding the fact that that finding was diametrically opposed to the same court's earlier decision of 21\u00a0August 2006, by which it had ordered the applicant's release with reference to Article 109 on the ground that the maximum detention period had already expired (see paragraphs 38 and 45 above).",

In one case, to which the Government referred, the Supreme Court had expressed the view that the detention of persons whose extradition from Russia had been sought was to be governed, after the initial forty-day period provided for by the 1993 Minsk Convention, by foreign criminal law, i.e. that of the requesting party (see the Government's submissions and also paragraph 56 above). The same view was apparently held by the International Cooperation Department of the Prosecutor General's Office, which advised the applicant's counsel to petition the Tajikistani authorities for his release (see paragraph 23 above). However, a Moscow district court (Nagatinskiy) pointed out to the applicant's representative that her references to the provisions of the Tajikistani Code of Criminal Procedure were irrelevant for the purposes of criminal proceedings in  (see paragraph 22 above). Another district court in  (Tverskoy) expressed the opposite view, holding that the applicant was not a party to criminal proceedings within the meaning of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 28 above). That finding implied that his detention was not attended by any of the safeguards and guarantees that ordinary suspects or defendants enjoyed. The same District Court subsequently opined that the Prosecutor General's Office, that is the authority processing the request for the applicant's extradition, was not responsible for the applicant's detention and therefore could not be held liable for a failure to put an end to his continued unlawful detention (see paragraph 33 above).",

In this connection the Court notes that the application of a custodial measure is governed by Articles 108 and 109 of the Code. While Article 108 covers the initial placement in custody, Article 109 sets specific time-limits by which the prosecutor must solicit the court for an extension of the custodial measure. In examining the application for an extension, the court must decide whether continuation of the custodial measure is lawful and justified and, if it is not, release the detainee. Admittedly, the detainee has the right to take part in these proceedings, make submissions to the court and plead for his or her release. There is nothing, however, in the wording of either Article\u00a0108 or Article 109 to indicate that these proceedings could be taken on the initiative of the detainee, the prosecutor's application for an extension of the custodial measure being the required element for institution of such proceedings. In the instant case it transpires that the proceedings under Article 109 were instituted only once in the three years of the applicant's detention and followed an application by a prosecutor. In these circumstances, the Court cannot find that Article 109, even assuming it was applicable, secured the applicant's right to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention would be examined by a court.",

In general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article\u00a046 of the Convention (see Shofman v. , no.\u00a074826/01, \u00a7\u00a053, 24\u00a0November 2005, with further references). By finding a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 in the present case, the Court has established the Government's obligation to take appropriate general measures to remedy the existing legal deficiencies. Whether such measures would involve amending the Code of Criminal Procedure, reviewing the existing case-law, issuance of binding clarifications by the Supreme Court, or a combination of these and other measures, is a decision that falls to the respondent State. The Court, however, emphasises that any measures adopted must be compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court's judgment (see Assanidze v.\u00a0Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7\u00a0202, ECHR 2004II, with further references).",
