The District Court found the applicant\u2019s action admissible, as he had submitted a statutory declaration that he had had sexual intercourse with the child\u2019s mother during the period of conception. The action was well-founded, as it had been proved by expert opinion that the applicant was the child\u2019s biological father. The District Court considered that the applicant had not been precluded from challenging paternity under Article 1600 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code (see relevant domestic law below), as there had been no social and family relationship between Mr M. and the child at the time of the last court hearing. It could not be assumed that Mr\u00a0M. bore actual responsibility for the child. This would have required the legal father and the child to have lived together for a longer period of time, which, according to the District Court, necessitated a minimum period of approximately two years. Taking into account the constitutional right of the biological father under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Basic Law, it was necessary that the factual relationship between the legal father and the child enjoyed a certain stability. This stability could only be assumed after a period of two years, which had not passed in the instant case. Under these circumstances, it was not relevant that the applicant actually took care of the child together with the child\u2019s mother.",

The Court of Appeal considered that such a relationship had not only existed at the time it decided on the appeal, but already a long time before, as Mr M. had lived together with the child and her mother in a joint household since the child\u2019s birth. A young child could not possibly live together with another person for a period of time longer than his or her own lifetime. The legislature had not strictly defined which period of time would amount to a \u201clonger period of time\u201d, but had left this assessment to the courts adjudicating each individual case.",

There was no doubt that a child, during the first months of his or her life, developed a social and family relationship with the persons taking care of him or her on a daily basis. During the first two years of his or her life, a child was in particular need of secure family relationships, which allowed him or her to develop further social contacts. A child\u2019s interest in learning about its true descent could only become relevant at a more advanced age. According to the intentions of the legislature, who were guided by the \u2019s case-law, external disturbances should be avoided in the child\u2019s best interests and in the interest of the already existing family relationship. The constitutional rights of the biological father should not prevail over the equally protected rights of the legal father, if and as long as the latter assumed parental responsibility within the meaning of social parentage. Against this background, even a period of a few months which elapsed between a child\u2019s birth and the bringing of an action to challenge paternity could be considered as a \u201clonger period\u201d within this specific context.",

According to the case-law of the Federal Law Court, in cases in which the child had lived since birth without interruption together with his or her legal parents, the existence of a social-family relationship had to be assumed if the cohabitation persisted and the judge was convinced that the legal father assumed actual parental responsibility in a way which appeared to be long-lasting. It was not decisive whether the social and family relationship already existed when the action was lodged, but only whether there was a social and family relationship at the time of the last court hearing. The applicant had failed to point to any circumstances which could call into question the existence of such a relationship in the instant case. Conversely, the fact that the relationship between the legal parents had endured the crisis which had been caused by the mother\u2019s breach of trust indicated that the relationship was particularly stable. The Court of Appeal did not allow an appeal on points of law.",

Under Article 1600 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code, entitlement to challenge paternity lies with the man whose paternity exists under Article\u00a01592 nos. 1 and 2, with the mother and with the child, and also with the man who makes a statutory declaration that he had sexual intercourse with the child\u2019s mother during the period of conception.

A social and family relationship is considered to exist if the legal father has or had actual responsibility for the child at the relevant point in time. There is, as a rule, an assumption of actual responsibility if the legal father is married to the mother of the child or has lived together with the child in a domestic community for a long period of time (Article\u00a01600 \u00a7 4).",

In the present case, R. had lived together with her mother and her legal father in a stable family unit. No factual family relationship had existed between the applicant and the child R. The Government stressed that the intimate relationship between the applicant and Ms P. had ended eight months prior to R\u2019s birth. Even before the end of all contact between Ms P. and the applicant, the two of them had already not had an established relationship since September 2003, but merely occasional sexual contact.

However, following a decision of the  dated 9 April 2003 (no. 1 BvR 1493/96 and 1724/01) the legislature had decided to allow a biological father to challenge paternity if no social-family relationship existed between the legal father and the child. The decisive consideration was that, in the interest of the social family and of the required legal certainty in the law on parentage, the biological father had no constitutional right to be granted paternity as a matter of priority, if the legal father exercised his parental responsibility in the sense of social parentage. The decision to grant precedence to the legal family was in line with the case-law of the Court (the Government referred to the case of Nylund v. Finland ((dec.), no. 27110/95, ECHR 1999VI).",

The Court observed, in that application, that the domestic court had refused the applicant access to his children without giving any consideration to the question whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, contact between the twins and the applicant would be in the children\u2019s best interest. The Court accordingly found that the domestic court had failed to fairly balance the competing rights involved. As the reasons given for refusing Mr Anayo contact with his children had thus not been \u201csufficient\u201d for the the purposes of paragraph\u00a02 of Article 8, Article 8 had been violated (see Anayo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 6773).",

By contrast, in a substantial minority of nine Member States the presumed biological father does not have the standing to contest the paternity of the legal father.

The reasons why the biological father has not previously established such a relationship are irrelevant; the provisions thus also cover cases in which the fact that such a relationship has not yet been established is not attributable to the biological father (compare Anayo, cited above, \u00a7 67). The Court refers to its findings in the Anayo case that this legal situation led to a violation of the biological father\u2019s right to respect for his private life (see Anayo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07073).",

Accordingly, the biological father must not be completely excluded from his child\u2019s life unless there are relevant reasons relating to the child\u2019s best interests to do so. However, this does not necessarily imply a duty under the Convention to allow the biological father to challenge the legal father\u2019s status. Neither can such an obligation be deduced from the Court\u2019s case-law. The present case has to be distinguished from the R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski case relied upon by the applicant, as in the latter case the domestic authorities had refused to deal with Mr R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski\u2019s request to establish his paternity by mere reference to the recognition of paternity by another man, without, however, examining the factual background of the case, as for example the question whether the child lived with his legal father in a social and family relationship (see R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski, cited above, \u00a7 78). In the case of Mizzi v. Malta (no. 26111/02, ECHR 2006I), the Court found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in that the applicant, who was the legal \u2013 but not the biological \u2013 father of a child born in wedlock, and had never lived with the child, was never afforded the possibility of bringing, with reasonable prospect of success, an action aimed at contesting paternity (see Mizzi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108-111). The Court considers that this case falls to be distinguished from the instant case in that Mr Mizzi alleged that the presumption of legal paternity had not been in line with social reality, as he had never entertained any factual relationship to the child (see Mizzi, cited above, \u00a7 11). Conversely, in the instant case Mr M.\u2019s legal paternity coincided with his factual role as the child\u2019s social father.",

This discrimination was further exacerbated by the fact that the growing intensity of the social and family relationship between the legal father and the child during the paternity proceedings had not impaired the mother\u2019s right to contest paternity. Furthermore, it had to be borne in mind that children, when challenging paternity, did not have to take into account their own social relationship with their mother and legal father. By contrast, the biological father was precluded from challenging paternity even if this would serve the child\u2019s best interests.",
