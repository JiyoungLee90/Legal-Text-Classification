It would appear from the documents that the applicant had in court, at least partially, retracted her earlier statement. The case materials also suggest that the other statements were admitted as evidence because the witnesses in question had been unwilling to testify before the court. The Court does not have to decide whether those statements played a decisive role in the applicant\u2019s conviction. It notes in this connection that, unlike the District Court, the Court of Appeal, which also held an oral hearing, did not rely on the above-mentioned statements as evidence. Any possible disadvantages caused to the applicant by the District Court\u2019s decision to admit and rely on those statements as evidence were, therefore, remedied in the appellate proceedings. In these circumstances, this complaint must also be rejected as manifestly ill-founded in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

In her letter of appeal to the Court of Appeal, the applicant requested that 24 persons be heard. The court received testimony from 17 of them. Most of the witnesses who were not heard before the court were independent medical experts who normally, under the national legislation, only give a written statement but are not heard in person. However, two medical experts, called by the applicant, were heard before the Court of Appeal. Unlike the District Court, the Court of Appeal, which gave reasons for its decision, did not regard the medical evidence as relevant in deciding the matter. In these circumstances the Court cannot conclude that the adversarial nature of the proceedings was disrespected or that the national courts exceeded their margin of appreciation in the admission and assessment of evidence. It follows that these complaints must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

In the Government\u2019s understanding, the applicant had not objected to these requests. The remaining adjournments had been requested by the prosecutor.

Furthermore, the Government have not offered any explanation for the length of the proceedings before the Court of Appeal, which took up more than two years.
