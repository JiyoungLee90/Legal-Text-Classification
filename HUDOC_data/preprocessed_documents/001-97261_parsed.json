If the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions were not consistent with Convention principles, the Court held that the applicants were not required to lodge further constitutional complaints, as that would overstretch their duties under Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, for example, Kozlica v. , no. 29182/03, \u00a7\u00a7 23 and 28, 2\u00a0November 2006).",
