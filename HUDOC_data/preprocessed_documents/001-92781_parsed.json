The Court reiterates that under the international law the term \u201cState organisation\u201d is not limited only to organs of the central Government. In cases where State power is decentralised it extends to any national authority which exercises public functions (see, for example, Mikryukov v. Russia, no.\u00a07363/04, \u00a7\u00a021, 8\u00a0December 2005 with further references). It follows that the actions and/or omissions of the local authorities are attributed to the respondent State and for these reasons the Court concludes that the latter is accountable for the debts of municipal enterprises to the same extent as it is accountable for the debts of State-owned enterprises.

The Court further notes that Mr Shylkin was not legally represented before it and, as his case is not particularly complex, he was not required to be. His transportation costs cannot be regarded as necessarily incurred whereas his postal and other (copying and typing of documents) expenses are substantiated with pertinent vouchers to the amount of less than EUR\u00a01 only. However, it is obvious that he has incurred postal expenses in relation to making his application to the Court.",
