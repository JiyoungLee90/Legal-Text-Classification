In this regard there is disagreement between the parties as to whether the applicant could get the letter back. The applicant submitted that his requests to have the documents returned to him had been ignored and that that was why he had asked the Court for a new set of documents. On the other hand, the Government contended that the prison officials, having examined the seized documents, had attempted to return them and that it had been the applicant who had refused to collect them. In support of their position the Government submitted a report drawn up by the prison officials documenting the applicant's refusal to collect the seized items. The Court notes, however, that when the applicant signed the report he added a comment to the effect that the facts described therein had been distorted. Accordingly, this piece of evidence is contradictory and cannot persuade the Court to accept the Government's version.
