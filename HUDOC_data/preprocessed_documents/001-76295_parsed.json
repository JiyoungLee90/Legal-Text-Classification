The Court notes further that the applicant\u2019s lawyers clearly informed the State authorities that it would be necessary for them and a doctor to see the applicant and his medical file for the purpose of defending his rights before the Court (see paragraphs 60-61 above). The request was reasonable in the Court\u2019s view and it does not appear that there was any public interest in rejecting it. Moreover, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s lawyers were unable to present their observations in respect of pecuniary damage due to the lack of access to the applicant and to his medical file. The Court concludes that this constituted an interference with the applicant\u2019s right of individual petition, which amounted to a failure on the part of the respondent Government to comply with their obligation under Article\u00a034 of the Convention.
