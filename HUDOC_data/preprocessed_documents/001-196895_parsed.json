They did not suggest that the courts had made an appropriate assessment of facts relevant to the question of whether such a preventive measure was necessary in the circumstances at the respective stages of proceedings. Moreover, with the passage of time, the applicants\u2019 continued detention required further justification, but the courts did not provide any further reasoning. Furthermore, with the exception of the decision of 11 April 2013 (see paragraph 30 above), the domestic authorities did not consider any other preventive measures as an alternative to detention (see Osypenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 4634/04, \u00a7\u00a7 77 and 79, 9\u00a0November 2010).",
