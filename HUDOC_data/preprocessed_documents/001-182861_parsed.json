Ultimately they decide to have the child but they decide to do so in order to save their relationship, one might say for somewhat impure motives, they feel that having this child will keep them together. However their relationship continues to disintegrate and at one point during a fight they are having between themselves when their attention is diverted elsewhere, the child is involved in an accident and then dies. Obviously this is a huge trauma for them and they are driven apart. They come back together again sometime later, maybe a year later and meet and for them their relationship is not quite finished and they come back together in their grief because they are the only other people who understand the depths of their grief. When they come together they can only do so in a perverted fashion, where Abby actually poses as a prostitute.

Indeed the specific scenes referred to, as well as other parts of the play, were an affront to the dignity of the individual, which was an integral part of the civil and moral fabric (tessut) of the country. Even in a pluralistic and democratic society, such as the Maltese one, human dignity could not be trampled on, even if the aim was \u201cpresumably\u201d a genuine one. As problematic as the relationship of the couple might have been, one could not make extensive use of vulgar, obscene and blasphemous language to highlight perversions, vilify (ikasbar) the right to life and the right to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, and vilify the respect towards a woman\u2019s dignity. It was not acceptable to publicise uncivil behaviour, which broke the law, debased the suffering of women during the holocaust, portrayed women as the object of sexual satisfaction, as well as ridiculed family life and the responsibilities parents have towards their children. A democratic society, while being tolerant, could not permit its values to be turned on their head in the name of freedom of expression. In the court\u2019s view, the stitching of a vagina as an act of sexual pleasure, bestiality, the depravity arising from the thought of a woman eating another woman\u2019s excrement, the pleasure obtained in raping children, the murder of children and sexual intercourse with parents of violated and murdered children, were unacceptable even in a democratic society. The court noted that under Maltese law, blasphemy was a contravention, and a person could not be immune from punishment simply because he or she was acting on stage. The Shoah, the court went on, \u201cwas a historical fact where innocent victims underwent unprecedented suffering. Instead of treating this sensitive and delicate subject...with due respect to the dignity of the victims, the character Stu shows only sexual depravity...the author permits the demeaning and humiliation of that tragedy totally out of context and for no other reason than for perversions. No matter how the text of the play is looked at, it runs aground on the reef of the inalienable dignity of the human person, and the court understands that this was the underlying reason for the Board\u2019s decision.\u201d",

These instances were so strong that they affected the play in its entirety and prevailed over any genuine aim presumably intended by the play. The court emphasized that the production despised the dignity of the individual, in particular sectors, such as women and children, whether because of their nationality or religion, and opined that even though the main characters were acting in this way because of tension, pressure and depression, such contempt could not be justified as art. In the court\u2019s view while art was a wide concept covering any type of manifestation of expression, it could not include language which was obscene and despised the trauma of a genocide, and which, in itself, was against the laws of the country. For a strong moral message to be portrayed it was possible to cause discomfort and annoy other persons, but not to the extent of insulting them because of their beliefs, their people, or simply because they were a woman or a child.",

Moreover, according to the Guidelines for Film Classification (hereinafter \u201cthe Guidelines\u201d) issued by the Board in accordance with Regulation 42\u00a0(2) a production could be banned if in the opinion of the classifiers it was contrary to morality, decency and good behaviour in public.

This was the result of the use of vulgar, obscene and blasphemous language so much so that the play glorified perversions and the lowest human instincts. The author himself during the domestic proceedings had admitted that it contained swear words and described sexually explicit images. They considered that the play depicted perversion as being the norm rather than the exception and that all the classifiers had acted independently and fully understood the play. The Government submitted that it was the right and sometimes the duty of the State to limit the freedom of expression in order to protect morals and religious sentiment. Thus, the banning of the play was in accordance with the applicable legislation at the time.",

The Court has frequently examined preventive restrictions and prior restraints, reiterating that the dangers inherent in prior restraints are such that they call for the most careful scrutiny on its part (see, inter alia, Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7\u00a047, concerning blocking access to websites; Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2004XI, concerning the prohibition of journalistic activity; Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v.\u00a0Switzerland (no. 2) [GC], no. 32772/02, \u00a7 93, ECHR 2009 concerning a refusal to broadcast an advert; and Association Ekin v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a039288/98, \u00a7\u00a056, ECHR 2001VIII concerning bans on dissemination of publications). Indeed, a legal framework is required, ensuring both tight control over the scope of bans and effective judicial review to prevent any abuse of power. In that regard, the judicial review of such a measure, based on a weighing-up of the competing interests at stake and designed to strike a balance between them, is inconceivable without a framework establishing precise and specific rules regarding the application of preventive restrictions on freedom of expression (see, inter alia, Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7\u00a064).",

In this respect, the Court notes that, irrespective of their content, the Guidelines where not accessible to the public. It follows that the completeness and therefore the precision of Regulation 42 (2) is questionable. Indeed it was intended for the Guidelines to elaborate the meaning of, inter alia, the criteria mentioned in Regulation 42 (2) (a), namely the levels of morality, decency and good general behaviour. Thus, in the absence of guidelines which fulfilled the quality requirements (at least that of accessibility), the criteria mentioned in Regulation 42 (2) (a), left room for an unfettered power since the law did not indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any discretion conferred on the authority and the manner of its exercise.",

Having also eliminated the Guidelines, any supposed legal basis for a total ban of a stage production could only be derived by a convoluted reading of the law with indirect references to, and in the light of, practice. In particular, in Regulation 47 mention was made of the possibility of a total ban, and that only in so far as the regulation provided for an appeal against a decision banning a production. However, again Regulation 47 only referred to films (pellikoli). The Court considers that, given the specific reference to films (unlike in Regulation 42), even an extended reading in conjunction with Regulation 64, would not suffice to make the Regulations (on whether banning a stage production was at all possible) precise and foreseeable.",

The Court considers that if the provision had to apply to stage productions, then it had to apply in its entirety. This means that the applicants\u2019 appeal review would have had to be undertaken by three persons who had not been part of the first assessment. It has not been disputed that in the applicants\u2019 case this was not so, as the review had only been done by one classifier, namely J.C. (see paragraph above 36). In this connection the Government solely relied on the argument that the rule concerning the composition of the board examining the appeal applied only to films, an argument the Court cannot uphold for the reasons just mentioned. It follows that not only Regulation 47 was not precise as to whether it allowed for such a procedure or not, but even if it did, the procedure undertaken in the present case had not been regular and therefore the decision-making procedure which led to the interference with the applicants\u2019 rights cannot be accepted as a procedure prescribed by law.",

As stated in paragraph 87, that finding is based on \u201cvarious\u201d considerations presented in the three preceding paragraphs. In my opinion, that \u201cvariety\u201d could be kept to a minimum. For a finding of a violation of Article 10, the reason indicated in paragraph 84, with some rewording, should have sufficed on its own: namely that the guidelines for the classification of stage productions were inaccessible to the public, and therefore the impugned \u201cinterference was a result of a procedure which was not prescribed by law\u201d (see paragraph\u00a087). The latter statement is relevant not only to the guidelines which were legally absent. But the fact that Regulation 47 deals explicitly only with films does not necessarily mean that it could not be interpreted  extensively or by analogy \u2013 so as also to cover stage productions: if Regulation 64 (1) could be read together with Regulation\u00a045, why could it not be read together with Regulation 47, which is an \u201cextension\u201d of Regulation 45 in its own right? In order to prefer a verbatim interpretation of Regulation 47 (as the Chamber does \u2013 though with a very cautious reservation \u2013 in clear contradiction to the reading by the Constitutional Court of Malta), at least some consideration of the method(s) of its interpretation was more than desirable.",

                        "content": "2.\u00a0\u00a0If, however, these contiguous shortcomings of the law applied in the applicants\u2019 case were to be addressed, then there was something else which had to be addressed too. The Chamber found that \u201cthe law relied on ... was not of a sufficient quality\u201d. Again, this applies not only to the guidelines mentioned above, but also to Regulation 42 (2), the \u201ccompleteness\u201d and \u201cprecision\u201d of which has been rightly recognised as \u201cquestionable\u201d. But the shortcomings of the Regulation are not confined to its \u201cincompleteness\u201d and \u201cimprecision\u201d. They encompass also the Board\u2019s power to rule on the \u201cliterary, artistic or educational merit\u201d of productions, \u201cif any\u201d, and to ban some of them as \u201cnot fit for exhibition\u201d. This privilege, so indiscriminately worded, smells of discretionary censorship, especially (but not only) having regard to the Board\u2019s (whatever its members\u2019 professional and moral merits) appointment by the Parliamentary Secretary for Culture and Local Government, that is to say, by members of the Government. After all, Regulation 47A mentions the \u201cBoard of Film and Stage Censors\u201d and not their \u201cClassification\u201d (compare paragraphs 58 and 7 respectively; emphasis added). The word \u201ccensors\u201d is perhaps rather too instructive. However, the deeper problem of the limits of discretionary censorship was not touched upon in the judgment.",

In order to be able so to conclude, the Chamber gave prominence to the fact that that applicant had not lodged an appeal against that part of the judgment of the first-instance court which found him to have no victim status \u201cin his own capacity\u201d and interpreted this omission as \u201cacceptance\u201d of the finding of the first-instance court by the second applicant. But the Chamber does not know the real reasons behind the failure to lodge such an appeal. The second applicant might have not accepted the said finding at all, but had not appealed against it owing to some overriding personal circumstances. Who knows? Rather than taking on board this far-fetched \u201cacceptance\u201d excuse, the Chamber should have stated directly and determinedly (as did the first-instance court) that that applicant could not claim to be a victim of a violation of the right to freedom of expression under Article 10, because the latter does not cover the activities of theatre directors (unless they are artists at the same time), just as it does not cover the work of accountants, managers, service providers, stewards etc. At times excessive caution gratuitously leaves questions open where there should be full clarity.",
