The Court further notes that the criminal case against the applicant was complex. It initially concerned three criminal charges, which were subsequently joined in one criminal case. The prosecutor's office extended the preliminary investigation several times in order for the investigation to gather evidence in all the episodes of the case. These extensions appear neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. After the preliminary investigation was completed, the case was pending before the trial court and the court of appeal for one year, seven months and twenty seven days. During that time the Court observes no substantial periods of the courts' inactivity. On the contrary, the hearings were held and the decisions were taken at regular intervals by the first instance and on appeal. The Court concludes that the period of three years and seven months when the judicial authorities were constantly dealing with the case does not as such offend the guarantees of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01.",
