Even assuming that this statement should not be interpreted as an implicit withdrawal of the Government\u2019s objection, the Court recalls that an individual can no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention when the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, the breach of the Convention and afforded redress (Eckle v. Germany, judgment of 15\u00a0July\u00a01982, Series A no. 51, p. 30, \u00a7 66. For the application of this principle in the context of Article 6, see L\u00fcdi v.\u00a0Switzerland, judgment of 15\u00a0June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 18, \u00a7 34 and Schlader v. Austria (Dec.), no. 31093/96, 7\u00a0March 2000). Accordingly, in principle, where domestic proceedings are settled and include an admission of the breach by the national authorities and the payment of a sum of money amounting to redress, the dual requirements established in Eckle are satisfied and the applicant can no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention (Rechachi and Abdelhafid v. the United Kingdom (Dec.), no. 55554/00, 10\u00a0June 2003).",

Moreover, the case did not stay with the Milan District Court and was forwarded first to  and then, on 4 November 1998, to the  judicial authorities, which eventually adopted a judgment on the merits of the charges (see paragraphs\u00a016, 19 and 20 above). While accepting that the issue of determining the competent jurisdiction could have been of some complexity and might have required to establish facts and to clarify legal points, the Court considers that a delay of more than seven months to solve a question of competence ratione loci is excessive. It follows that during an overall period of more than one year and four months, there was either a total stay of the proceedings, or a suspension of the examination of the merits of the case awaiting a ruling on a preliminary issue.",
