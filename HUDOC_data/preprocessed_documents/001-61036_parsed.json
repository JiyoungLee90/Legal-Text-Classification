As to the delay in the proceedings before the Administrative Court, the Government submitted that it was due to the heavy increase in that court\u2019s work load.

Complainants must now turn to these Panels prior to seizing the Administrative Court.

As to the Government\u2019s argument that these delays were due to a heavy increase in the Administrative Court\u2019s workload, the Court reiterates that it is for Contracting States to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can guarantee the right of everyone to obtain a final decision on disputes relating to civil rights and obligations within a reasonable time (see, for instance, Vocaturo v. Italy, judgment of 24 May 1991, Series A no. 206-C, p. 32, \u00a7 17). The Court notes that the respondent State has  taken certain measures to reduce the workload of the Administrative Court, particularly with the introduction of Independent Administrative Panels. This measure took effect at the beginning of 1991. Nevertheless, in the first and second applicants\u2019 case, it took over two years, namely from November 1991 until November 1993, until the Administrative Court requested  the Constitutional Court to review the constitutionality of section 15 \u00a7 1 of the Tirol Land Planning Act. The Constitutional Court then took another two years to give its decision. In the third applicant\u2019s case it took two and a half years, namely from June 1993 until December 1995,  and in the fourth applicant\u2019s case almost three years, namely from June 1993 until May 1996, until the Administrative Court decided upon their complaints.",
