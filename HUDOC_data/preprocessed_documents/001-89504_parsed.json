The discrepancy in the records concerning Mr\u00a0A.Kh.\u2019s height appeared to be due to a typographical error by the mortuary registrar. The gloves on the table had been left by one of the medical experts. As regards the hammer, the first applicant had mentioned having taken it together with the gloves and Mr\u00a0A.Kh.\u2019s linen, but its existence was doubtful as he had refused to surrender these objects without explanation. The investigation further found that the applicants\u2019 hypothesis that Mr\u00a0A.Kh. had been killed late on 28\u00a0April\u00a02002 was improbable, in particular, as the case file records contained a certificate from Mr\u00a0A.Kh.\u2019s employer that he had undergone a medical test on the morning of 29\u00a0April\u00a02002.",

Three years later the General Prosecutors\u2019 Office explicitly acknowledged that the circumstances of this death warranted the initiation of criminal proceedings. The Court, for its own part, recalls that Mr\u00a0A.Kh.\u2019s death occurred against the background of his participation as a witness in several criminal proceedings potentially involving organized crime. Although none of these proceedings resulted in eventual convictions, the applicants\u2019 fears of reprisals were at one point recognized by the authorities to the point where the allocation of bodyguards to the family was warranted. This measure had been lifted, with reference to the first applicant\u2019s inappropriate conduct towards the guards, only several months before Mr\u00a0A.Kh. was found dead (see paragraph\u00a010 above). In light of all the above, the Court considers that the State authorities were under a Convention duty to investigate the circumstances of Mr\u00a0A.Kh.\u2019s death.",

The applicants\u2019 assertion that particular individuals could have organized Mr\u00a0A.Kh.\u2019s murder was not checked. Furthermore, the Court notes that the case file materials contain no record concerning the collection of forensic and corporal evidence.

Moreover, the failure of the experts to examine the deceased\u2019s medical history coupled with a possible mistake in recording his height undermines the credibility of the Government\u2019s allegation that due care was exercised in this respect. As regards the applicants\u2019 contention that the authorities were also at fault for the body\u2019s rapid decomposition, the Court notes that no evidence has been presented to this effect. However, it recalls that in its decision of 4\u00a0June\u00a02002 to remit the case for further investigation, the Prosecutors\u2019 Office marked it unusual that the body had significantly decomposed by 2\u00a0May, given that 28 April had been recorded as the probable date of the death and in circumstances where the body had been stored in the mortuary since the morning of 30 April.",

It notes that the contents of this certificate were not incorporated into the analysis of the probable cause of the death and the employer appears not to have been questioned. Furthermore, it appears that the investigation made no attempts to reconcile the fact that on 29\u00a0April the deceased had undergone a medical check up with the fact that on the morning of 30\u00a0April his body was found in an allegedly significantly decomposed state and with the mortuary record proposing 28\u00a0April as the most probable date of the death.",

This conclusion was based on the examination of medical evidence and the testimonies of numerous witnesses, including the applicants and their witnesses (Mrs\u00a0S. and Mrs\u00a0). The decision not to prosecute the police officers was subsequently upheld by courts at two levels of jurisdiction following contested proceedings, in which the applicants participated and were able to present all necessary arguments to defend their interests.

These findings were upheld by the courts in the course of adversary proceedings. In light of this reasoning by domestic authorities and in the absence of any indication from the Government that another remedy was available to the applicants in respect of the modalities of their detention, the Court must conclude that there were no effective remedies to exhaust in respect of the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article\u00a05 in the context of the present case.

Thus, the criminal limb of Article 6 \u00a7 1 does not apply (see e.g. Kositsina v. Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a035157/02, 15\u00a0January\u00a02008). Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 under its \u201ccivil head\u201d may, however, be applicable to criminal proceedings, where an applicant shows that from the moment when he joined them as a civil party until their conclusion the civil component remained closely connected with the criminal component, i.e., the criminal proceedings affected the civil component. In other words, the applicant must show that prosecution for a criminal offence was indissociable from his ability to exercise a right to bring civil proceedings in domestic law (see e.g. Perez v. France [GC], no.\u00a047287/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a067-70, ECHR 2004I, and Serdyuk v. , no.\u00a015002/02, \u00a7\u00a025, 20\u00a0September 2007). The Convention, however, does not confer any right to \u201cprivate revenge\u201d or to an actio popularis. Thus, the right to have third parties prosecuted or sentenced for a criminal offence cannot be asserted independently (see e.g. Perez, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070). Where an applicant has an effective possibility in domestic law to assert his civil rights regardless of the outcome of criminal proceedings, which serve a purely punitive purpose, applicability of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 reaches its limits, even where within the framework of the criminal proceedings an applicant might have lodged a pecuniary claim (see Sigalas v. , no.\u00a019754/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027-30, 22\u00a0September\u00a02005 and Garimpo v.

In 2002 the applicants also raised this complaint in civil proceedings, which, according to the case file materials, have been pending since that date in parallel to the criminal proceedings. The trial court, bound by domestic law to suspend the proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal case, should it establish that the findings by the criminal court would be decisive for the determination of the parties\u2019 civil rights and obligations, has never resorted to this option. On the contrary, the criminal proceedings were discontinued on several occasions with reference to the private-law nature of the dispute between the parties. Their resumption appears attributable largely to the public interest in establishing the facts concerning possible abuse in the handling of humanitarian aid. As regards the establishment of the facts related to the applicants\u2019 pecuniary interests, it should be noted that Messrs\u00a0V. and R. never denied the fact that they had a debt to the first applicant. The only matters disputed were the amount, which had been repaid, and the obligation to pay further amounts in light of the fact that the first applicant had received some 4,000 kilos of goods from the humanitarian aid cargo. The civil proceedings concerning this dispute were eventually discontinued on account of the applicants\u2019 systematic failure to appear at the hearings.",
