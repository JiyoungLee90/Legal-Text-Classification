The police supervising the scene called on the applicant either to remove the banner or leave. The applicant refused to do so, pointing out that this flag was a historical symbol and that no law forbade its display. Subsequently he was committed to the Budapest Gyorskocsi Police Holding Facility, where he was held in custody and under interrogation for six hours.

Despite the opinion of a heraldic expert, submitted by the applicant and stating that the flag in question was a historical one, the court considered its display offensive in the circumstances, because it had been placed higher than the national flag representing the Republic of Hungary. Therefore, the applicant\u2019s behaviour was considered to have been provocative.",

A requirement to pre-notify a demonstration would normally be for reasons of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

According to this judgment, the burning of a cross is a \u201csymbol of hate\u201d, regardless of whether the message is a political one or also meant to intimidate. And while cross-burning sometimes carries no intimidating message, at other times the intimidating message is the only message conveyed. The protections afforded by the First Amendment are not absolute, and the government may regulate certain categories of expression, including the ban of a \u201ctrue threat\u201d. Intimidation, in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word, is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. The fact that cross-burning is a symbolic expression does not resolve the constitutional question. Sometimes the cross-burning is a statement of ideology, a symbol of group solidarity. The Supreme Court required effort to distinguish among these different types of cross-burnings and considered the contextual factors that were necessary to decide whether a particular cross-burning was intended to intimidate.

In cases such as the present one, which require the right to freedom of assembly to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression and, allegedly, against the right of others to freedom of assembly, the Court considers that the outcome of its scrutiny should not, in theory, vary according to whether the case has been lodged by a \u201cdemonstrator\u201d or a \u201ccounter-demonstrator\u201d. Accordingly, the margin of appreciation afforded to the national authorities should in principle be the same in both cases. Where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts as long as an overall, optimal balance between the competing rights has been achieved (see, mutatis mutandis, Von Hannover v.

In the light of Article 17 of the Convention (see Witzsch v.

In addition, in Vajnai, the symbol in question (a red star) had been displayed by a person who belonged to a group with no totalitarian ambitions \u2013 a lawfully registered left-wing political party with connections to the international workers\u2019 movement. Taking due account of the context, the Court held that the display of the red star was unrelated to any racist or totalitarian propaganda, and was merely a symbol of the left-wing political movement (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 25, 51 and 52). In the case at hand, the \u00c1rp\u00e1d-striped flag was not prohibited in general.

Within the police\u2019s general powers of prevention of public disorder (section 30 of Act no. XXXIV of 1994 on the police), they could have continued to observe the situation closely. Such surveillance had been effective up until the moment the police interfered and there is nothing to suggest that it had become ineffective. In fact, the detention of the applicant corresponded to the most intrusive measure the police could have taken: it caused not only the physical removal of the flag from the place where the applicant was displaying it, but the removal of the applicant himself. Thus, he was hindered from manifesting his political views in any other way in that particular place and at that particular time.",

                        "content": "The impairment of the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression was compounded by the fact that, after his detention, he was even fined for disobedience. It is specious to argue, as the Government did, that the penalty imposed on the applicant was not a punishment for the use of the flag, but for disobeying police instructions, since the applicant only disobeyed the police\u2019s instruction in order to express his opinion. Furthermore, according to the applicable national law, the fine imposed could be replaced by prison in the event that it was not paid. If on the one hand the regulatory administrative nature of the offence for which the applicant was punished diminishes its seriousness, on the other hand the system whereby a fine can lawfully be converted into regulatory confinement in prison enhances the excessive character of the State\u2019s interference. In sum, the essence (or minimum core) of the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression was not respected.",
