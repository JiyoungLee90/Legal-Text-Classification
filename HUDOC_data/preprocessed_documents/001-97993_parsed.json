Originally living by hunting, fishing and collecting, the Sami activities changed over time to concern mainly reindeer herding. Their historical use of the land has given rise to a special right to real estate, the reindeer herding right (rensk\u00f6tselr\u00e4tten). Presently regulated in  by the Reindeer Husbandry Act (Renn\u00e4ringslagen, 1971:437), it comprises the right to use land and water for the Sami's own sustenance and that of his reindeer. The right may only be exercised by the members of a Sami village. Such villages are both geographical grazing areas and economic entities. They do not have any public legal status (see K\u00f6nk\u00e4m\u00e4 and 38 Other Sami Villages v. Sweden, no. 27033/95, Commission decision of 25 November 1996, Decisions and Reports 87, p.\u00a085 in fine). The reindeer herding area comprises approximately one-third of the surface of  and is divided into all-year land and winter grazing land. In certain parts of the country, the borders of the herding area are controversial and have not been statutorily defined, especially as concerns the winter grazing land.",

It found that, from the 16th to the late 19th century, there had not been any winter grazing which had established a right for the Sami to such grazing on the relevant properties and that, from the late 19th century, the actual winter grazing, as annually recorded by the socalled Lapp bailiffs (lappfogdar), had not lasted long enough in the respective parishes to create a right to grazing on those properties based on prescription from time immemorial, such prescription requiring at least 90 years' use of the land. For these reasons, the Sami villages could not claim a right to use the properties under the various laws, including the Reindeer Husbandry Act presently in force. Moreover, the court found that a right to real property could not legally be established through \u201ccustom\u201d and that a right to winter grazing on the properties in question could not be based on the provisions of the UN Convention and the Instrument of Government. The court therefore concluded that there was no right of the Sami villages to reindeer grazing on the plaintiffs' land without a valid contract and accordingly gave judgment in favour of the landowners. The court ordered the Sami villages jointly to pay the plaintiffs' legal costs, amounting to approximately 4,000,000 Swedish kronor (SEK; about 400,000 euros (EUR)).",

It also rejected the landowners' request that the villages not be allowed to invoke certain circumstances in their defence, with one exception. Thus, the court did not allow the villages to argue that winter grazing without protests from landowners for a period of less than 90 years would qualify for a continued right to such grazing based on prescription from time immemorial or the provisions of the reindeer grazing and reindeer husbandry acts. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal rejected the Sami villages' requests for an inspection of the locus in quo and for an order against the landowners to produce maps of the areas concerned.

However, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, for a right to winter grazing on the disputed lands to be deemed to have arisen on the basis of prescription from time immemorial, it must be required in addition that the results of the investigation indicate with sufficient strength that Sami have used the lands in question or parts of them for winter grazing for their reindeer with at least some regularity without hindrance, that is, without objection from other holders of rights.\u201d",

They further asserted that the reason for the allegedly enormous legal costs for both sides in the proceedings was the legislation, which was defective in that it did not define the winter grazing areas, which had necessitated the pursuit of thorough and time-consuming historical research. The applicants thus had not had any reason to blame the landowners for making the proceedings complex, as that responsibility had rested with the State. With this in mind, and having regard to the vital values at stake, the applicants submitted that their right to an effective access to court and a fair hearing had necessitated the grant of legal aid. The loans received from the Sami Fund will have to be repaid and were of no relevance in this respect. Rather, the payment of the legal costs in the case, together with increasing costs for reindeer herding through the payment of fees to lease land for grazing, puts strain on the economy of the Sami villages and may lead to bankruptcies.",

Instead, the crucial issue was whether the applicants had been afforded a reasonable opportunity to present their case effectively under conditions that had not placed them at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the landowners, and thus whether they had been granted a fair hearing within the meaning of Article 6. The Government maintained that this was the case and argued that the applicants had been represented by legal counsel during the entire domestic proceedings and had been able to appeal to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. Moreover, during the major part of the proceedings, they had been assisted by two counsels, one of whom was a member of the Swedish Bar Association. In the Government's opinion, there was nothing to indicate that the legal representation was insufficient or that the courts handled the issue of legal costs in an unreasonable way or otherwise in contravention of domestic law. The Government further pointed out that the applicants' opposite party had not been a powerful company like, for example, McDonalds in the case of Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a068416/01, ECHR 2005-II), but had mainly consisted of private individuals.

It is central to the concept of a fair trial, in civil as in criminal proceedings, that litigants are not denied the opportunity to present their case effectively before the court and that they are able to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side. Article 6 \u00a7 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants the above rights. The institution of a legal aid scheme constitutes one of those means but there are others, such as for example simplifying the applicable procedure. The question of whether the provision of legal aid is necessary for a fair hearing must be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of each case and will depend, inter alia, upon the importance of what is at stake for the applicants in the proceedings, the complexity of the relevant law and procedure and the applicants' capacity to represent themselves effectively.",

During these periods, there cannot have been much activity on the part of the opposing parties, which contributed to an increase in their legal costs.

Apart from the question whether it is appropriate and fair to place such a burden on the Sami, it is clear that this process required extensive research and contributed to the legal costs of the proceedings. So that the Sami could participate in the proceedings, they had to borrow a considerable amount of money from the Sami Fund. According to Swedish law, Sami villages are not entitled to legal aid.

Only a very limited range of issues was left for the merits stage. Nevertheless, the Chamber declared admissible the issue of effective access to court, at least as far as the high legal costs incurred by the Sami villages in the proceedings were concerned. In the circumstances of this case, and given the burden of proof that the Sami had to satisfy, as well as the number of years spent in the domestic courts, it is no surprise that the legal costs reached such a level. The legal costs incurred show the unfairness of the approach adopted in  as concerns land disputes between the Sami people and Swedish landowners. In the view of the CERD, this amounted to de facto discrimination. The European Court of Human Rights was not asked to deal with a claim of discrimination.

In cases where one party by definition is disadvantaged, proper access to court is ensured by adopting such procedures and safeguards as indeed enable that party to enjoy the same opportunities. This is what the CERD meant when criticising the fact that the burden of proving the right rests exclusively with the Sami, because the whole system presumes that the landowners have the right and they do not have to prove anything. There is therefore no doubt in my mind that the applicants' access to court was not effective. It could not be effective until and unless the entire approach to land disputes of this kind is revised to take account of the rights and particular circumstances of indigenous peoples.
