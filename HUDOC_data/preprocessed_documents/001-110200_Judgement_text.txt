The case originated in an application (no. 44038/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Rezo Akhmedovich Kochalidze (“the applicant”), on 9 November 2005.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 2 April 2009 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
In accordance with the pilot judgment Burdov v.  (no. 2) (no. 33509/04, ECHR 2009), the applications were adjourned pending their resolution at the domestic level.
The Government informed the Court that the authorities could not enforce the judgments in the applicant’s favour and requested to consider the application on the merits. The Court therefore decided to resume examination of the present case.
The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Rostov-on-Don.
The applicant served in the military. By a judgment of 18 October 2002 the Military Court of the Vladikavkaz Garrison declared unlawful the refusal of the commander of military unit 66156 to pay the applicant additional monthly combat allowance, obliged the head of the finance department of the North Caucasus Military Circuit to allocate funds for such payment and recovered in the applicant’s favour the allowance arrears in the amount of 58,900 Russian roubles (RUB). By another judgment of 17 December 2002 the same court delivered a similar judgment and recovered additionally RUB 121,600 in favour of the applicant.
On 18 August 2005 the regional office of the Federal Treasury returned the writs of execution to the applicant on the ground that the military unit did not have an account there. The writs of execution were also returned by the main office of the Federal Treasury on 28 September 2005. In their letter of the same date the Federal Treasury suggested that the applicant submit the writs of execution to the bailiff service. It is not clear from the parties’ submissions whether the applicant has done so.
The judgments remain unenforced to date.
