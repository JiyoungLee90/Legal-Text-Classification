The passage of time does not mean either that a child\u2019s need to know his or her both parents and to have the paternity confirmed would disappear but it may even grow.

The restriction concerning a man\u2019s death was justified, as in such cases it was usually no longer possible to obtain sufficient evidence of paternity.

In the instant case the Court is not called upon to determine whether the proceedings to establish parental ties between the applicant and his biological father concern \u201cfamily life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8, since in any event the right to know one\u2019s ascendants falls within the scope of the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d, which encompasses important aspects of one\u2019s personal identity, such as the identity of one\u2019s parents (see Odi\u00e8vre v.

In this connection, it should be observed that the expression \u201ceveryone\u201d in Article 8 of the Convention applies to both the child and the putative father. On the one hand, people have a right to know their origins, that right being derived from a wide interpretation of the scope of the notion of private life (see Odi\u00e8vre v.

A person has a vital interest, protected by the Convention, in receiving the information necessary to uncover the truth about an important aspect of his or her personal identity and eliminate any uncertainty in this respect (see Mikuli\u0107 v.

Cyprus, no. 23890/02, ECHR 2007XIV (extracts)). The Court has also on several occasions found that it has difficulties in accepting inflexible limitation periods which do not provide any exceptions to the application of that period (see, mutatis mutandis, Shofman v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7 43; Gr\u00f6nmark v. , no. 17038/04, \u00a7\u00a055, 6 July 2010; and Backlund v. , no. 36498/05, \u00a7 53, 6\u00a0July 2010). The main problem therefore is the absolute nature of the time-limit rather than its dies a quo as such. In view of the fact that in the present case the biological father had already died, judicial proceedings before the national courts were the only avenue by which the applicant could have legally established the legal status of his biological father. As a result of this rigid time-limit, as upheld by the Supreme Court, the applicant was deprived of the possibility of obtaining a judicial determination that K.R. was his father. He was deprived of this right even though he was in a situation where he had not had any realistic opportunity to go to court during the limitation period due to his incorrect perception that paternity had already been established when K.R. had been ordered by the District Court to pay child support to him (see, mutatis mutandis, Phinikaridou v. Cyprus, cited above, \u00a7 62; and Turnal\u0131 v. Turkey, no. 4914/03, \u00a7 44, 7\u00a0April\u00a02009).",

In the present case, the national courts did not have any possibility to balance the competing interests but only concluded that the applicant\u2019s claim was time-barred. Thus, the national courts could not consider at all whether or not the general interest in protecting legal certainty of family relationships or the interest of the father and his family outweighed the applicant\u2019s right to have an opportunity to seek a judicial determination of paternity. The Court considers that such a straightforward restriction of the applicant\u2019s right to institute proceedings for the judicial determination of paternity was not proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In this connection the Court reiterates that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Airey v.

In other words he was under the mistaken belief that as the domestic court had confirmed K.R.\u2019s liability for the payment of child support, paternity had been legally established. This, to my mind, is a mistake of law, that is a mistake as to the legal consequences of the court\u2019s decision on child support. This mistake was in any case easily avoidable if only the applicant had bothered to consult a lawyer. As the Helsinki Court of Appeal held (\u00a7 12) no legal impediment had prevented the applicant from initiating proceedings within the five-year time-limit.

The instant case is certainly not one where a legal presumption has been allowed to prevail in unreasonable circumstances over biological and social reality \u2013 the period of limitation was reasonable in length and pursued a legitimate aim, and the applicant was aware of the biological and social reality. Time-limits, which in themselves are designed to secure the proper administration of justice in compliance with the principle of legal certainty (Mizzi v. Malta, no. 26111/02, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2006I (extracts)), cannot be circumvented by the spurious argument that one was not aware of what the law said or provided, or was not aware of the legal effects or consequences of certain decisions (like the \u201cincorrect perception\u201d \u2013 see \u00a7 52 \u2013 as to the court order to pay child support). Even in Backlund v. Finland (no. 36498/05, 6 July 2010) the Court was quick to dismiss \u201cthe applicant\u2019s alleged ignorance of the statutory time-limit\u201d (see \u00a7\u00a053 of that judgment), although it then went on (wrongly, in my view) to find a violation of Article 8.",

In particular neither the fact that many States do not set a time-limit for an action for filiation (\u00a7 52), nor the fact that the Finnish courts did not have the possibility to \u201cbalance the competing interests\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 53 and 55), are relevant to the issue at hand. Had the Finnish courts carried out this balancing exercise, they should nonetheless have dismissed the applicant\u2019s request because a \u201cfair balance was struck\u201d in this case \u2013 the applicant had only himself to blame for ignoring the law.",

The Helsinki Court of Appeal has established that no legal impediment prevented the applicant from initiating proceedings within the statutory time-limit imposed by Finnish legislation. This time-limit, as applied in the circumstances of the present case, did not deprive the applicant of the possibility of fully exercising his rights protected under the Convention. In this context, I agree with Judge De Gaetano\u2019s view that the applicant has only himself to blame for the situation in which he found himself after the expiry of the five-year transitional period to bring an action for filiation. However, I am not certain whether we can qualify the situation of the applicant as a mistake of law (a mistake as to the content of legislation) or rather as a mistake as to the content of the official registers. This doubt is, nonetheless, irrelevant for the solution of the case.",

This pertains also to family law. The requirement of due diligence is the necessary correlate of the legal recognition of individual freedom and personal autonomy. In other words, freedom and diligence are two sides of the same coin.",

I am neither convinced by the argument referring to the content of legislation in the majority of the High Contracting Parties nor by the reference to an existing tendency among the High Contracting Parties (paragraph 52). Firstly, these arguments indirectly confirm that there is no unanimity among the High Contracting Parties on the issue. Secondly, it has not been ascertained that the tendencies referred to really constitute a practice in the application of the Convention which would be relevant for the purposes of its interpretation under the applicable principles of international law pertaining to treaty interpretation.",
