The work of the ILO supervisory bodies has served to clarify both of these elements. The penalty does not need to be in the form of penal sanctions, but may also take the form of a loss of rights and privileges. Moreover, the menace of a penalty can take many different forms. Arguably, its most extreme form involves physical violence or restraint, or even death threats addressed to the victim or relatives. There can also be subtler forms of menace, sometimes of a psychological nature. Situations examined by the ILO have included threats to denounce victims to the police or immigration authorities when their employment status is illegal, or denunciation to village elders in the case of girls forced to prostitute themselves in distant cities. Other penalties can be of a financial nature, including economic penalties linked to debts. Employers sometimes also require workers to hand over their identity papers, and may use the threat of confiscation of these documents in order to exact forced labour.",

Here too, there can be many subtle forms of coercion. Many victims enter forced labour situations initially out of their own choice, albeit through fraud and deception, only to discover later that they are not free to withdraw their labour, owing to legal, physical or psychological coercion. Initial consent may be considered irrelevant when deception or fraud has been used to obtain it.\u201d",

The Government submitted that in the present case the Prosecutor had considered that no error of law made it necessary for him to appeal to the Court of Cassation. In addition, the Government explained that the rule according to which a civil party could appeal on points of law only in respect of his civil interests did not prevent the Court of Cassation from verifying the conformity with the law of the judgment given by the Court of Appeal in the criminal proceedings.

In reaching that conclusion the Court found that the provisions concerned were open to very differing interpretations from one court to the next (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0147). It also noted that, as the Principal Public Prosecutor did not appeal on points of law against the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment acquitting the offenders, the appeal to the Court of Cassation concerned only the civil aspect of the case (ibid., \u00a7 146). Emphasising that the increasingly high standard being required in the area of the protection of human rights and fundamental liberties correspondingly and inevitably required greater firmness in assessing breaches of fundamental values, the Court found in the Siliadin judgment that there had been a violation of the French State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 4 of the Convention.",

They acknowledged, however, that there was also the specific complaint resulting from the need to apply to the Court to find a violation of the rights guaranteed under Article 4 of the Convention.

Ruling on an equitable basis, the Court awards the first applicant the sum of EUR\u00a030,000, plus any taxes that may be payable on that sum.
