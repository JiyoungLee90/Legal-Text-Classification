The parties disagree as to whether the applicant used this opportunity to call Ms V. and Ms G.: according to the Government, he did not; according to the applicant, he did. From the transcript of the hearing provided by the applicant, it appears that the first hearing took place on 28\u00a0October 1999. The applicant asked the District Court to examine his request lodged earlier under Article 223 of the CCrP. The District Court replied that that motion had been received after the assignment of the case for trial. However, the District Court noted that it would be examined later, at the preliminary hearing stage.",

He indicated that in mid-July 1997 Ms V. had seen him paying for the car; he had paid Mr Sh., who acted as an intermediary between the applicant and the car repair shop. The applicant also testified that Ms G. had been present at the time when he had handed money to Mr Sh., and that later the applicant had told her about the deal. In his words, he gave money to Mr Sh. in a closed envelope and did not specify what was in it, since Mr Sh. knew that it was money for the car.

The applicant claimed that he had bought it and that Ms V. and Ms G. had seen him pay for it. In his request of 9 June 1999 the applicant explained what Ms V. and Ms G. would say and indicated their whereabouts. Therefore, the request to call witnesses was sufficiently reasoned, relevant to the subject matter of the accusation and could arguably have led to the applicant\u2019s acquittal (see, in this respect, Perna v.  [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2003V, and Guilloury v. France, no. 62236/00, \u00a7 64, 22 June 2006).

The Court further notes that the applicant asked the first instance court to rectify the hearing record by putting on it his request to call Ms V. and Ms G. However, that request was rejected (see paragraph 33 above).",

However, as was confirmed by the defence in the course of the trial, neither Ms V. nor Ms G. had seen him paying money for the car to Mr Sh. In his words, he handed Mr Sh. a closed envelope and did not say what was inside. Only afterwards did he mention to Ms G. that he had paid money for the car to Mr Sh. In sum, the probative value of the testimony of Ms G. and Ms V. was very low. On the contrary, the arguments in favour of the applicant\u2019s guilt were quite weighty. Several people testified at the trial that they had bribed him with the car. Therefore, even if Ms G. and Ms V. had been called and heard, their testimony would most likely not have led to the applicant\u2019s acquittal. The Court reiterates in this respect that, although the silence of the trial court and the court of appeal in that respect is regrettable, regard must be had to the proceedings as a whole. In Vidal, cited above, the applicant\u2019s conviction rested mostly on the materials of the case file and the testimonies of the co-defendants (\u00a7\u00a034). In the present case, on the contrary, the conviction was supported by a solid evidentiary base, in particular by the testimonies of several independent witnesses given at the trial. In view of that it is possible to distinguish the present case from Vidal, cited above.",

Only in exceptional circumstances would a refusal to hear such witnesses violate Article 6, cf. paragraph 65 of the judgment.

The parties disagree as to what the applicant answered to a question of the trial court whether he wanted to call additional witnesses, but it appears from the transcript of the hearing on 28 October 1999 that the court knew about his earlier request and noted that it would be examined later, at the preliminary hearing stage.
