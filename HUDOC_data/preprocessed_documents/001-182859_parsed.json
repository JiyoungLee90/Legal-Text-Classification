The Court also noted the unanimous agreement of internationally recognised experts and organisations active in the field of public health that entry, stay and residence restrictions on people living with HIV could not be objectively justified by reference to public-health concerns: HIV is not transmitted through casual contact or by airborne particles, but rather through specific behaviours. The limited ways in which HIV can be transmitted does not put prevention exclusively within the control of the HIV-positive non-nationals, but rather enables HIV-negative persons to take steps to protect themselves against the infection through safer sexual relations and safer injections. Excluding HIV-positive non-nationals from entry or residence in order to prevent HIV transmission is based on the assumption that they will engage in specific unsafe behaviours, and that the national will also fail to protect himself or herself. This assumption amounts to an unwarranted generalisation with no basis in fact and fails to take into account the specific situation of the individual concerned (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 102-05).",
