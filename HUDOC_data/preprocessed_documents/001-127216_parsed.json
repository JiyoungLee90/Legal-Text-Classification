Her father had gone there to find out why his sons had been arrested. He had also been arrested and a week later had been released. After his return to Chechnya, in January 2001 her father had been taken away by armed men who had introduced themselves as officers of the UrusMartan ROVD. Her aunt had gone to the ROVD and asked an officer named Sergey about Supyan Khutsayev\u2019s fate. Sergey had told her that a certain Mr Shaid Takayev had lodged a criminal complaint against Supyan Khutsayev for unknown reasons. Sergey had come to an agreement with her father that they would release him in exchange for USD 2,000. Two days after the money had been paid her father had been released. On 13 February 2001 her father had been abducted again by officers of the same ROVD. One of the officers, Lechi Mamatsuyev, had acted as the negotiator and told her mother, the applicant, that Supyan Khutsayev would be released in exchange for USD 4,000. Her mother had paid the money and the abductors had told her where to meet them to hand her husband over. On the same day her father, who had been blindfolded, had been thrown out of a moving UAZ vehicle in the vicinity of Urus-Martan. Supyan Khutsayev had been severely beaten and could not walk. As to the circumstances concerning his abduction on 26 February 2001, Ms\u00a0Madina Kh. gave a statement similar to that of her sister Ms Malika Ts.",

The Court has previously concluded that the discovery of remains bearing signs of violence and buried in circumstances highly suggestive of extra-judicial execution or murder trigger a renewed obligation on the authorities to take investigative steps to identify the remains, the likely cause and circumstances of death and the identity of the perpetrators of any unlawful violence. The finding of the bodies in a particular location, bearing signs from which the cause of death may be ascertained and allowing the pursuit of leads that might possibly lead to identification of those responsible for the killings must be regarded as crucial evidence casting new light on the case (see Charalambous and Others v.

Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, the Court must apply particularly thorough scrutiny (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v.\u00a0Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 336, and Av\u015far, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0283), even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place.",

If, in response to such allegations made by the applicants, the Government then fail to disclose crucial documents to enable the Court to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation, strong inferences may be drawn (see Varnava, cited above, \u00a7 184, with further references). The State bears the burden of providing a plausible explanation for injuries and deaths occurring to persons in custody (see Ribitsch, \u00a7 32, and Av\u015far, \u00a7 283, both cited above, with further references). The Court reiterates in this connection that the distribution of that burden is intrinsically linked to, among other things, the specificity of the facts of the case (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos.  and , \u00a7 147, ECHR 2005VII). In cases concerning armed conflicts, the Court has extended that obligation to situations where individuals were found injured or dead, or had disappeared, in areas under the exclusive control of the authorities and where there was prima facie evidence that State agents could be involved (see Akkum and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 211, ECHR 2005II; To\u011fcu v. Turkey, no. , \u00a7 95, 31 May 2005; Gandaloyeva v. Russia, no. , \u00a7 89, 4 December 2008; and Varnava, cited above, \u00a7 184).",

The prima facie threshold was reached primarily on the basis of witness statements, including the applicants\u2019 submissions to the Court and to the domestic authorities, and other evidence leading the Court to conclude that there were military or security personnel in the area concerned at the relevant time. The Court relied on references to military vehicles and equipment; the unhindered passage of the abductors through military roadblocks, in particular during curfew hours; the conduct typical of security operations, such as the cordoning off of areas, checking of identity documents, searching of premises, questioning of residents and communicating within a chain of command; and other relevant information about the special operations, such as media and NGO reports. Given the presence of those elements, it concluded that the areas in question had been within the exclusive control of the State authorities in view of the military or security operations being carried out there and the presence of servicemen (see, for example, Ibragimov and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 82, 29 May 2008; Abdulkadyrova and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 120, 8 January 2009; and Kosumova and Others v. Russia, no. , \u00a7 67, 7 June 2011). If the Government failed to rebut this presumption, this would entail a violation of Article 2 in its substantive part. Conversely, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Movsayevy v.\u00a0Russia, no. , \u00a7 76, 14 June 2011).",

Generally, these findings have been reached in response to claims made by the respondent Government that the person was still alive or has not been shown to have died at the hands of State agents. The presumption of death is not automatic and is only reached on examination of the circumstances of the case, in which the lapse of time since the person was last seen alive or heard from is a relevant element (see Varnava, cited above, \u00a7 143, and Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no. , \u00a7\u00a7 82-83, ECHR 2000VI).",

In their submissions to the authorities the applicants consistently maintained that their relatives had been abducted by State agents. The domestic investigations accepted as fact the versions of events as presented by the applicants, and took steps to check whether State servicemen had been involved in the incidents.

While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that each set of criminal proceedings have been plagued by a combination of the same defects as those enumerated in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0123-25).
