The Court cannot, therefore, accept these calculations. Taking into account the amounts awarded to the applicants, the periods within which the respondent State failed to enforce the decisions in the applicants' favour, and the above-mentioned average consumer prices inflation index for the relevant period, the Court calculates the inflation losses at EUR\u00a0900 and EUR\u00a01,800, which the Court awards respectively to the applicants.
