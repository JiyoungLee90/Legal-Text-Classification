In that judgment it had been presumed that Article\u00a06 applied, unless the Government demonstrated that a civil servant applicant had not had a right of access to a court under national law and that this exclusion had been justified under Article 6. The Government pointed out that in the present case, the applicant had not had, according to an express provision in national legislation, any right to appeal against the Appeal Court\u2019s decision of 23\u00a0August 2004 but that the Supreme Court had annulled that decision on the basis of Article 21 of the Constitution on 8\u00a0September 2004 and had granted the applicant a right to appeal.

There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article\u00a06 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, first, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, second, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v.
