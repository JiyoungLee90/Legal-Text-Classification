However, if the infringement of the right to life or to personal integrity is not caused intentionally, the procedural obligation imposed by Article\u00a02 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case ([see Mastromatteo v.  [GC], no.\u00a037703/97, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2002VIII]). In the specific sphere of medical negligence the obligation may for instance also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any responsibility of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and/or for the publication of the decision, to be obtained. Disciplinary measures may also be envisaged (Calvelli and Ciglio, cited above, \u00a7 51, and [Vo v. France [GC], no.\u00a053924/00, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2004VIII]).",
