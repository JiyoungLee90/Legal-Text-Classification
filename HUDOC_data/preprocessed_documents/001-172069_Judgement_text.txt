The case originated in an application (no. 59341/09) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Koka Hybro Komerc DOO Brojler, a limited liability company based in Serbia (“the applicant”), on 22 October 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Živković, a lawyer practising in Leskovac. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Ms V. Rodić, being more recently substituted by their current Agent, Ms. N. Plavšić.
On 23 October 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
On 26 June 2006 the Leskovac Commercial Court ordered AD Perper-Agrar, a socially-owned company based in Bošnjace (hereinafter “the debtor”) to pay the applicant specified amounts on account of damages. That judgment became final on 14 July 2006.
On 31 October 2006, upon the applicant’s request to that effect, the Leskovac Commercial Court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicant the enforcement costs.
On 27 May 2011 the Leskovac Commercial Court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor.
The applicant duly submitted his claim.
On 3 February 2012 the applicant’s claim was formally recognised.
The insolvency proceedings are still ongoing.
On 22 April 2003, the debtor had been privatised and changed its name to AD Perper-Agrar.
On 5 May 2005 the privatisation contract had been annulled and on 8 September 2006 the debtor’s name was changed to Agrar Fruit.
According to the Serbian Ministry of Economy, the debtor is still a company predominantly comprised of socially-owned capital (see , accessed on 6 December 2016).
In their additional observations of 19 April 2016 the Government informed the Court that the applicant had transferred its judgment claims to a third person on 28 October 2015.
On 9 November 2016, as a response to the Government’s additional observations, the applicant submitted that the contract regarding the transfer of the claims in question had been terminated by 11 December 2015.
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially-owned companies, as well as enforcement and insolvency proceedings, has been outlined in the cases of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06 et al., §§ 57-64 and 71-76, 15 January 2008, and Jovičić and Others v. Serbia (dec.), no. 37270/11, §§ 88-93, 15 October 2013. Furthermore, the case-law of the Constitutional Court in respect of socially-owned companies, together with the relevant provisions concerning constitutional redress has likewise been outlined in the admissibility decision in Marinković v. Serbia (dec.), no. 5353/11, §§ 26 -29 and 31-44, 29 January 2013, the judgment in Marinković v. Serbia, no. 5353/11, §§ 29-31, 22 October 2013, and the decision in Ferizović v. Serbia (dec.), no. 65713/13, §§ 12-17, 26 November 2013).
