Nor did the court examine the slogans chanted during the event. The assize court found that the declaration, the slogans and the banner carried during the event constituted propaganda in favour of the TKP/ML, without providing an explanation as to why it considered the slogans and the content of the banner referred to in the indictment (see paragraph 6 above) as encouraging violence, armed resistance or an uprising, or being capable of inciting to violence. These are essential elements to be taken into account. Besides, slogans were chanted and the press statement was read out during a peaceful public gathering, and there is nothing in the case file showing that the applicants were involved in any violent acts or had the intention of inciting violence.
