In Fatma Nur Erten and Adnan Erten v. Turkey (no. 14674/11, \u00a7\u00a7 29-33, 25\u00a0November 2014), the Court found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in respect of a similar set of circumstances relating to the same procedural restriction in the Law on the Supreme Military Administrative Court. Having noted that the only reason why claimants could not modify their claims was the strict application of the procedural rule, the Court took the view that it would be unreasonable to expect the applicant to have known at the time of lodging his case with the military administrative court the exact extent of the pecuniary damage he had sustained, or to require him to overestimate his claim deliberately and lodge a claim for a higher amount by paying higher court fees, which would result in a disproportionate limitation on the right of access to a court (see, for a similar conclusion regarding the similar restriction in administrative court procedure, Mikail\u00a0T\u00fcz\u00fcn v. Turkey, no.\u00a042507/06, \u00a7\u00a7 22-24, 27 November 2018).",

Where the applicant\u2019s cooperation is required, it must not go beyond what is strictly necessary and in any case does not relieve the authorities of their obligation under the Convention to take timely action of their own motion, on the basis of the information available to them, with a view to honouring the judgment against the State (see Krasnov v. Russia, no. 18892/04, \u00a7 25, 22\u00a0November 2011). The Court further notes that the applicants did not complain about the non-enforcement of a judicial decision but the depreciation of the compensation awarded due to the very high rate of inflation in Turkey.",

Having regard to the economic data for the period between the years 1997 and 2011, in particular the fact that the statutory interest rates applied between the years 1997 and 1999 were 30%, 50% and 60% respectively, whereas the actual inflation rate varied between 60% and 99%, the Court finds in the present case that the difference between the statutory interest rates applied to the amount of compensation and the actual inflation rate must have caused the applicants to sustain financial loss. Consequently, the applicants had to bear an individual burden that has upset the fair balance which must be maintained between the demands of the general interest and protection of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions.",

Moreover, the Court emphasises that the present applications were lodged in January 2012 and that it has found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the loss incurred by the applicants because of long-term inflation not compensated for by the statutory interest rate, effectively reducing the real value of the compensation awarded to them by the domestic courts.
