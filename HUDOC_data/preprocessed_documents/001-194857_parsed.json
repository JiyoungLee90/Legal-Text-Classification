The court considered that the applicant and D. did not have a good relationship and that D.\u2019s presence during the meetings would negatively affect the applicant\u2019s communication with the child. The court added that the applicant had developed a very close connection with his granddaughter. He was well aware of her health problems and needs and could take care of her.

In the present case, it was not disputed that such family ties existed between the applicant and his granddaughter. Notably, the domestic courts found that the applicant had developed a very close connection with his granddaughter (see paragraph 11 above).

While acknowledging the necessity of imposing a meetings schedule, the courts did not formally impose any duty on D. in that context, notably the courts did not oblige D. to respect the meetings schedule. However, this technicality prevented subsequently the bailiffs from interfering in any manner (see paragraph 15 above). The applicant had therefore to institute the auxiliary proceedings in which the courts specifically compelled D. to hand over the child to the applicant on the relevant dates. The courts therefore imposed in a separate set of proceedings an obvious duty which indispensably followed from the fact that a meetings schedule had been established. Only that additional ruling \u2013 as suggested by the domestic courts (see paragraph 19 above) \u2013 eventually made enforcement of the contact arrangements by the bailiffs possible. However, even that court decision could not be enforced given that the higher court suspended the enforcement proceedings (see paragraph 20 above). With that suspension, which was not supported by any specific reasons, the applicant did not have real possibilities of compulsory enforcement of his contact arrangements.",
