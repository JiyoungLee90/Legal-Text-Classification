In decisions of 6 March and 5\u00a0June\u00a02007 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal elaborated in greater detail on the reasons for continuing to apply the measure in question. The court noted that the decision to impose pre-trial detention in connection with a criminal case involving several co-defendants was taken in the light of the circumstances of the case vis-\u00e0-vis the position of each individual defendant. Thus, the fact that, in the instant case, a few of the applicant\u2019s co-defendants had been released pending trial did not have any bearing on the applicant\u2019s situation. Similarly, the court observed that the argument that there was strong evidence against the applicant, which had been relied on to justify the preventive measure, did not undermine the principle of the presumption of innocence in criminal proceedings. Finally, the court admitted that the applicant\u2019s detention had been lengthy; however, its length was considered proportionate to the penalty envisaged under domestic law for the offences with which he had been charged.",
