In particular, the Court of Cassation noted that, at the initial stage of the investigation during which the applicant had been involved as a witness, he was in fact already considered a suspect and should have been able to avail himself of the rights enjoyed by a suspect in criminal proceedings, including the right not to incriminate himself and to have a lawyer. However, he had been interviewed only as a witness and had not been provided with a lawyer from the very start and, moreover, in a situation where a lawyer\u2019s participation was mandatory. Thus, the evidence in question had been obtained as a result of investigative measures conducted in breach of the applicant\u2019s right to defence, including his interview as a witness and a confrontation between him and another suspect.",

He argued that he was entitled to compensation, as his acquittal had rendered unlawful the time that he had spent in detention. He relied on, inter alia, Articles 17 and 1064 of the Civil Code (CC), Article 66 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d), and Article 5 \u00a7 5 of the Convention.",

It noted that the applicant had been deprived of his liberty between 17 October 2008 and 17 April 2010 and that on 5\u00a0October 2010 he had been acquitted. The law stipulated the grounds and the procedure for awarding compensation for damage caused as a result of unlawful deprivation of liberty. In particular, under Article 66 of the CCP, an acquitted person had the right to claim compensation for pecuniary damage (including lost income and legal costs) sustained as a result of unlawful arrest, detention, prosecution and conviction. Under Article 1064 of the CC, such compensation was to be paid by the State. An award of damages was to be made if it were to be established that the plaintiff had sustained such damage, the respondent had behaved unlawfully, and there was a causal link between the damage and the unlawful behaviour. Finding that the applicant had been unlawfully convicted and had incurred pecuniary damage \u2013 namely lost income and legal costs \u2013 as a result of unlawful actions on the part of the respondent, the Regional Court decided to allow in part his claim for compensation for pecuniary damage. As regards the applicant\u2019s claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damage, the Regional Court decided to terminate that part of the proceedings on the grounds that the law did not allow for the awarding of compensation of that type. In reaching its findings, the Regional Court also relied on Article 16 of the Constitution, Article 17 of the CC, Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a05 of the Convention, and the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision of 1 July 2011 in the case of A.\u00a0Davtyan and Vank Ltd v. the Republic of Armenia.",

[Citations of Article 66 \u00a7 3 of the CCP and Article 1064 of the CC]. It follows from an analysis of these provisions that \u2013 taking into account the specifics of the status of an acquitted person, the necessity to remedy his legal and de facto situation, and the constitutional and international legal provisions \u2013 the legislature has stipulated the rule [that] full compensation should be paid to an acquitted person for damage sustained owing to his having been unlawfully deprived of his liberty. Furthermore, damage to be compensated for is that resulting from unlawful conviction, punishment, detention or [the requirement that he give] a written undertaking not to leave his residence.\u201d",

The Court reiterates in this respect that the Convention organs have consistently refused to uphold applications from persons convicted of criminal offences who complain that their convictions or sentences were found by the appellate courts to have been based on errors of fact or law (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III)). Similarly, a period of detention is, in principle, \u201clawful\u201d if it is based on a court order. A subsequent finding of a superior domestic court that a lower court erred under domestic law in making the order will not necessarily retrospectively affect the validity of the intervening period of detention (see Mooren v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a011364/03, \u00a7 74, 9 July 2009). Furthermore, a conviction that has been imposed by a judgment following a breach of substantive provisions of domestic law in criminal proceedings does not automatically render the detention by virtue of that judgment unlawful (see Gruber v. Germany (dec.), no. 45198/04, 20 November 2007). The Court has, however, held that\u00a0mere mistakes are to be distinguished from a flagrant denial of justice undermining not only the fairness of a person\u2019s trial, but also the lawfulness of the ensuing detention and that, as a consequence, in such circumstances Article 5 \u00a7 5 will only apply\u00a0where the\u00a0detention followed a conviction imposed in manifestly unfair proceedings amounting to a flagrant denial of justice automatically implying a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Shulgin v.

Furthermore, on the question whether detention is \u201clawful\u201d, including whether it complies with \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d, the Convention refers back essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, and disregard of that law entails a breach of the Convention (see \u00d6calan v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2005IV, and Merabishvili v.\u00a0Georgia [GC], no. 72508/13, \u00a7 191, 28 November 2017). Thus, in view of the fact that the applicant\u2019s detention was rendered unlawful within the meaning of domestic law following his acquittal and considered as such by the domestic courts, the Court concludes that, in the particular circumstances of the case, a breach of the guarantees of Article 5 \u00a7 1 has been established in substance at the domestic level and that, consequently, Article 5 \u00a7 5 is applicable to the applicant\u2019s case.",

In a number of cases concerning other countries the Court has considered, in their particular circumstances, the compensation due to the applicants as a result of their acquittal to be sufficient for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 5 and consequently found no violation of that provision, on the ground that such compensation was indissociable from any compensation they might have been entitled to under Article 5 \u00a7 5 of the Convention as a consequence of their deprivation of liberty being contrary to the other paragraphs of Article 5 (see N.C., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57-58; Staykov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108-110; and, in contrast, W\u0142och v.

Thus, his claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damage was dismissed by the domestic courts on the grounds that Armenian law did not recognise \u201c[compensation for] non-pecuniary damage\u201d as a type of compensation. The Court reiterates in this connection that Article 5 \u00a7 5 should not be construed as affording a right to compensation for purely pecuniary damage, but should also afford a right to compensation in respect of any distress, anxiety and frustration that a person may have suffered as a result of a violation of other provisions of Article 5 (see Khachatryan and Others v.
