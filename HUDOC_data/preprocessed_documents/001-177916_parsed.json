The applicants put forward several examples: the different statutory time-limit for divorce versus the time-limit for dissolution of a registered partnership in the event of an irretrievable breakdown (unheilbare Zerr\u00fcttung) of the relationship; the alimony payment obligations following a divorce/dissolution where blame could be placed on one spouse/partner; the obligations conferred by the respective legal institutions, in particular as regards trust, faithfulness and contributions to the household; and the consequences of a declaration of the death of a spouse/partner.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants argued that the Court\u2019s considerations in Schalk and Kopf in respect of marriage were not applicable to the registered partnership, which was a new legal institution, introduced in the twenty-first century.

They argued that the assumption that the right to family life also entailed a right for different-sex couples to enter into a registered partnership would lead to an imbalance where same-sex couples \u2013 in line with the Convention and the Court\u2019s case-law \u2013 had access to only one legal institution, namely the registered partnership. The restriction of registered partnerships to same-sex couples in Austria therefore struck a balance between the partnership institutions available to different-sex and same-sex couples, based on the restriction of marriage to different-sex couples expressly authorised by the Convention, and did not exceed the margin of appreciation available to States for establishing a legal framework in sensitive socio-political areas.",

If differences in the legal treatment of the two groups were admissible from the point of view of one group, they must necessarily also be admissible from the point of view of the other group. Despite the existence of separate provisions for marriage and registered partnerships, there were hardly any differences in the legal consequences: it was the express intention of the legislator that the effects of registered partnerships should in substance be the same as the rights and obligations of married persons, which was in fact the case. The Court had already confirmed in Schalk and Kopf that the existing differences were in compliance with the trend in other States, and legal amendments introduced after the entry into force of the Registered Partnership Act had led to further harmonisation. The remaining legal differences that cannot be abrogated by mutual consent are the maximum statutory periods for divorce of a married couple versus those for the dissolution of a registered partnership, as well as the legal consequences of a declaration of the death of one spouse/partner.

An applicant must demonstrate that, having regard to the particular nature of his or her complaint, he or she was in a relevantly similar situation to others treated differently. However, not every difference in treatment will amount to a violation of Article 14. Firstly, the Court has established in its case-law that only differences in treatment based on an identifiable characteristic, or \u201cstatus\u201d, are capable of amounting to discrimination within the meaning of Article 14. Secondly, a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see F\u00e1bi\u00e1n v. Hungary [GC], no. 78117/13, \u00a7 113, 5 September 2017 with further references). In examining whether persons subject to different treatment are in a relevantly similar situation, the Court takes into account the elements that characterise their circumstances in the particular context. The elements which characterise different situations, and determine their comparability, must be assessed in the light of the subject-matter and purpose of the measure which makes the distinction in question (F\u00e1bi\u00e1n v. Hungary [GC], cited above, \u00a7 121).

Austria [GC], no.\u00a019010/07, \u00a7 99, ECHR 2013). Where a difference in treatment is based on sex or sexual orientation, the State\u2019s margin of appreciation is narrow (see Karner v.

The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background; in this respect, one of the relevant factors may be the existence or non-existence of common ground between the laws of the Contracting States (see Schalk and Kopf, cited above, \u00a7 98, and Petrovic v.

The Court\u2019s examination of alleged discriminatory treatment in such matters was thus conducted from the standpoint of a minority group whose access to legal recognition was still an area of evolving rights with no established consensus among the Council of Europe member States (see Schalk and Kopf, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0105).

Observing that marriage had deep-rooted social and cultural connotations which may differ widely from one society to another, the Court held that neither Article 12 of the Convention nor Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 imposed an obligation on the Contracting States to grant same-sex couples access to marriage (see Schalk and Kopf, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06263 and 101). As regards the applicants\u2019 complaint regarding differences between the status of marriage and that of registered partnerships, the Court considered that the States enjoyed a certain margin of appreciation as regards the exact status conferred by alternative means of recognition (ibid., \u00a7 108). Moreover, the Court noted that the Registered Partnership Act gave same-sex couples the possibility to obtain a legal status equal or similar to marriage in many respects. Whereas substantial differences remained in respect of parental rights, there were only slight differences in respect of material consequences (ibid., \u00a7 109).",

The registered partnership was introduced as an alternative to marriage in order to make available to same-sex couples, who remain excluded from marriage, a substantially similar institution for legal recognition (see paragraph 13 above). Thus, the Registered Partnership Act (see paragraphs 13-16 above) in fact counterbalances the exclusion of same-sex couples in terms of access to legal recognition of their relationships which existed before the Act entered into force in 2010. In the case of Schalk and Kopf the Court found that the Registered Partnership Act gave the applicants, a same-sex couple, the possibility of obtaining a legal status equal or similar to marriage in many respects. The Court concluded that there was no indication that the respondent State had exceeded its margin of appreciation in its choice of rights and obligations conferred by the registered partnership (see Schalk and Kopf, cited above, \u00a7 109). Thus, the institutions of marriage and the registered partnership are essentially complementary in Austrian law. In this connection, the Court observes further that, as has already been pointed out in Schalk and Kopf, the legal status initially provided for by the Registered Partnership Act was equal or similar to marriage in many respects, and there were only slight differences in terms of material consequences (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0109). Moreover, the Court observes that the legal frameworks governing marriage and the registered partnership were further harmonised after the Court had adopted its judgment in the case of Schalk and Kopf and also after the applicants had lodged the present application, and that to date no substantial differences remain (see paragraph 16 above).",

This step has decisive consequences for the case, since a finding that there is no comparator precludes the Court from entering into an assessment on the merits.

                        "content": "The Court has previously held that the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage is compatible with the Convention because it is justified, and not because same-sex couples are not in an analogous situation to differentsex couples. As mentioned above, in Schalk and Kopf the Court explicitly stated that these two groups were in an analogous situation. After reaching this conclusion, the Court then looked into whether the refusal to provide access to marriage was justified, and it agreed that for reasons of history and tradition, it was. The same approach, in our view, should have been followed in the present case. The alternative takes the Court down a road that justifies in perpetuity a separate but equal approach, one for which we see no justification in the Convention and the case-law of the Court. And it is a risky course, as any justification not rooted in hundreds of years of history and tradition, but rather in fresh legislative choices made today, inevitably runs the risk of sliding into stereotypes about the \u201cdifferent\u201d nature of a heterosexual and a homosexual relationship.",
