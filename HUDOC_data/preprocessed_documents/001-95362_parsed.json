However, where the respondent State is able to show that there were objective impediments to reasonable efforts on the part of the domestic authorities to ensure observance of an applicant's rights under Article 34, the latter provision will not have been breached (see, mutatis mutandis, Paladi v.\u00a0 [GC], no. 39806/05, \u00a7 92, ECHR 10 March 2009). The Court notes that in the present case the request to access the file was made on 18\u00a0July 2005 (see paragraph 34 above). Even though the main proceedings had ended on 12\u00a0September 2002 (see paragraph 14 above), the enforcement proceedings, including the issue of registration of the applicants' ownership of , were still on-going. Moreover, two judgments were adopted just before and after the request for access to the file (see paragraphs 27 and\u00a028 above), which shows clearly that the case file was in active use by various courts during the relevant period. It is unfortunate that the filing systems in the various domestic courts were so confusing that they prevented the staff from quickly determining which court had the file at the time of the applicants' lawyer's request. However, the Court also notes that the applicants attended the hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice of 21\u00a0September 2005 and that the court had examined the case file (see paragraph\u00a028 above). It follows that the applicants were aware of the whereabouts of the file on 21\u00a0September 2005 and there is nothing in the materials before the Court to show that they had asked to see the file at the Supreme Court of Justice on that date. Thus the applicants had missed an opportunity to access their file a month before their lawyer eventually managed to access it.",

For instance, only one court hearing had been held in 1999 and only three in 2000.

However, the final judgment awarding the applicants, inter alia, a part of 's building, was never enforced. The courts eventually determined that that part of the judgment could not be enforced since S. was the registered owner of the building (see paragraph\u00a033 above). However, it took them six years and two months from the date of the final court judgment to reach that conclusion, despite their obligation to verify the legal basis for awarding property rights already in the original proceedings. In this respect the Court refers to the finding of the Supreme Court of Justice that the existence of real estate could be proved only with evidence of registration in the land register (see paragraph\u00a033 cited above).
