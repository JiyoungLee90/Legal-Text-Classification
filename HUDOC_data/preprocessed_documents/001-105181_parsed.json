In their submissions to the Court in February 2009 the applicant, his mother and cousin insisted that parts of one such device had been collected by the investigator in the autumn of 2008 and submitted for an expert examination. On the other hand, it notes the absence of any reference to this in the documents produced by the Government. To the contrary, the Government allege that the materials of the case file contain no reference to the \u201cGrad\u201d projectiles or any other clue as to the nature of the explosive device which had injured the applicant. The Court assumes that the documents made available to it have been selected so as to demonstrate to the maximum extent possible the effectiveness of the investigation in question.

In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (see McCann and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0146150; Andronicou and Constantinou v.

The Government submitted some thirty-five pages of the file (see paragraph 31 above). The quantity and contents of the remaining documents were not specified. The Court reiterates that the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, pp. 64-65, \u00a7 161, Series A no. 25) and that it can draw inferences from the Government\u2019s conduct in this respect. In so far as the Government mentioned Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court observes that in previous cases it has found this explanation insufficient to justify the withholding of key information requested by it (see Imakayeva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7615/02, \u00a7 123, ECHR 2006XIII).",

If in such situations the Court is prevented from reaching factual conclusions owing to the lack of documents which are in the Government\u2019s exclusive possession, it is for the Government to argue conclusively why the documents in question cannot serve to corroborate the allegations made by the applicants, or to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred.

Even thought the Government acknowledged that on 4 December 1999 the applicant received splinter wounds, they denied that the State was responsible for it, because it was impossible to establish the perpetrators of the injuries. They also stressed that in their testimonies before the investigator none of the witnesses had alleged that he or she had been aware of the identities of the perpetrators or of the type of weapons used. The Government denied that any other material traces of the crime had been identified by the investigators once such proceedings started. Finally, the Government questioned the reliability of the information notes issued by the Martan-Chu village administration, in view of the inconsistencies between them (see paragraphs 20 and 22 above) and suggested that the applicant could have been injured as the result of an explosion of a mine or of a shell launched by an illegal armed group.",
