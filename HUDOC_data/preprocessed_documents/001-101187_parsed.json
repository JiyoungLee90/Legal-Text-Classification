Then the applicant denied completely that any drugs had ever been in his possession and stated that the police had planted money and drugs and forced him to confess. The court considered that despite this retraction the applicant's guilt was confirmed by the body of evidence, including the written statements of Shch., as well as statements made at the hearing by police officers N. and K., who had conducted the operation, and witnesses K. and E. who had been invited by the police to observe the operation.

The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness. Moreover, it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, pp. 752-53, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a040-41).",

Taking into account that the applicability of sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 also triggers the protection provided by Article 5 \u00a7 3, which constitutes an important additional guarantee for an arrested person, the Court considers it appropriate to analyse first whether this sub-paragraph is applicable to the present case.",

To conclude otherwise would run counter to the plain meaning of the text of the provision. Moreover, the Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, the judicial control foreseen by Article 5 \u00a7 3 must meet certain requirements, one of those being that the judicial officer must himself or herself actually hear the detained person before taking the appropriate decision (see De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051, and Aquilina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050). The Court notes that in the present case the first applicant failed to appear before the court when the decision concerning his arrest was taken. This fact in itself does not give rise to an issue under Article 5 \u00a7 3, as a requirement cannot be derived from the Convention to the effect that a person who is evading court proceedings should be present at the court hearing where authorisation for his or her arrest is dealt with (see Harkmann v. Estonia (dec.), no. 2192/03, 1 March 2005). However, the Court observes that the first applicant had no chance to present the court with possible personal or other reasons militating against his detention after his actual arrest on 8 December 2003, despite the authorities' obligation under Article 5 \u00a7 3 to give him the opportunity to be heard.",

The applicant therefore challenged the reasonableness of the security measures taken in respect of witness Shch. if she indeed was Ms M, whom he knew well.

As a general rule, paragraphs 1 and\u00a03(d) of Article 6 require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he makes his statements or at a later stage (see L\u00fcdi v.
