In the Court\u2019s opinion, this circumstance to a certain extent rendered the legal issues involved in the case more difficult. The Court further notes that the nature of the applicant's compensation claim necessitated that his state of health be established and, in particular, that the loss of health which he had allegedly suffered as a result of stress caused by his dismissal be assessed.  Also, the courts had to assess the damage sustained by the applicant in that he had not received his salary for the period during which he remained unemployed, as well as other prejudice caused by his dismissal. In the Court\u2019s view, however, all this can hardly be deemed exceptionally difficult as these are normal obligations of labour courts in cases arising out of allegedly unjustified dismissals. ",
