It is the task of the national authorities to evaluate the evidence put before them in a particular case and the Court\u2019s task is to review the decisions of these authorities under the Convention (see Luberti v. Italy, 23 February 1984, \u00a7\u00a027, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a075). Moreover, it is not the Court\u2019s task to reassess various medical opinions, but rather to ascertain for itself whether the domestic courts, when taking the contested decision, had at their disposal sufficient evidence to justify the detention (see Herz v. Germany, no.\u00a044672/98, \u00a7\u00a051, 12\u00a0June 2003).",

Moreover, the Court emphasises that the notion of \u201clawfulness\u201d in the context of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(e) of the Convention might have a broader meaning than it does in national legislation. For detention to be lawful, it is a prerequisite that there has been a \u201cfair and proper procedure\u201d, including the requirement \u201cthat any measure depriving a person of his liberty should issue from and be executed by an appropriate authority and should not be arbitrary\u201d (see Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a7 45; Johnson v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1997, \u00a7\u00a060, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VII; and more recently Venios v.\u00a0Greece, no. 33055/08, \u00a7 48, 5 July 2011, with further references).",

In this regard the Court reiterates that the detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained (see Karamanof, cited above, \u00a7 42, with further references).",

Secondly, contrary to the Government\u2019s submissions, the applicant had clearly informed the national authorities of her desire to participate in the appeal hearing. The entry of 5 July 2007 in the applicant\u2019s treatment record (see paragraph 31 above) shows that as soon as she had learned about the hearing she had brought her interest to the attention of her primary care-provider at that moment, that is to say the psychiatric facility. Indeed \u2012 as the Regional Court noted in its decision \u2012 the applicant \u201cwas duly informed about the date and time of the hearing, but did not appear\u201d (see paragraph 29 above), although it seems unlikely that she could have appeared without the permission and assistance of the MRPC\u2019s administration.

Unaware of the reasoning given by the Town Court, the applicant was forced to confine her statement of appeal to expressing discontent with the outcome of the first-instance hearing and a restatement of her previous arguments. This mode of reasoning was a significant factor in the dismissal of her appeal by the Regional Court (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above). The Government in their submissions contended that a full copy of the first-instance court\u2019s decision had been sent to the Head of the MRPC to be passed on to the applicant, and delivery of the decision to the hospital is confirmed by the postal receipts and internal records. While the Court does not doubt that the decision was indeed delivered to the hospital, no evidence in the present case supports the assertion that the applicant was provided with it or even made aware of its availability.",
