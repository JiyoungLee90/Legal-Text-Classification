The question - which was in dispute among learned writers - whether the defendant, having been declared in default, is entitled to have his defence conducted for him by counsel was decided by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 23 November 1971 (NJ 1972, 293). Although the Procurator General (procureur-generaal) had suggested an answer in the affirmative, the Supreme Court came to the opposite conclusion. It reasoned that, were such an entitlement to be recognised, trial in absentia would take on an adversarial character incompatible with the basic idea of the Code of Criminal Procedure that a defendant who had been declared in default and convicted might always file an objection if he felt that he would not have been convicted had the court heard his defence. The Supreme Court went on to hold that it was true that since the introduction of the Code of Criminal Procedure the right to file an objection had been considerably curtailed, but pointed out that in so doing the legislature had not changed the character of trial in absentia. In conclusion, no section of the Code of Criminal Procedure nor any principle of unwritten law entitled a defendant who had been declared in default to have his defence conducted in his absence by counsel.",

They stressed the importance of the accused\u2019s attendance. The system was in their view well balanced and not incompatible with Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (c) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-c). The latter provision in no way implied that, contrary to the relevant provisions of domestic law, the accused always had the right to be absent from the hearing while his counsel conducted the defence.",

As a general rule, this is equally true for an appeal by way of rehearing. However, it is also of crucial importance for the fairness of the criminal justice system that the accused be adequately defended, both at first instance and on appeal, the more so if, as is the case under  law, no objection may be filed against a default judgment given on appeal (see paragraph 22 above).",

Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to be defended by counsel. For this right to be practical and effective, and not merely theoretical, its exercise should not be made dependent on the fulfilment of unduly formalistic conditions: it is for the courts to ensure that a trial is fair and, accordingly, that counsel who attends trial for the apparent purpose of defending the accused in his absence, is given the opportunity to do so.",
