The case originated in an application (no. 29763/07) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Miroslav Jovanović (“the applicant”), on 3 July 2007.
The applicant was represented by Ms V. Kočić-Mitaček, a lawyer practising in Belgrade. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Ms V. Rodić, being more recently substituted by their current Agent, Ms. N. Plavšić.
On 18 December 2014 the complaint concerning the length of criminal proceedings was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Kaluđerica.
On 22 December 2006 the applicant was deprived of liberty on suspicion of participating in criminal association within the police operation “Customs mafia” during which 43 persons were also arrested. The applicant was released on 15 June 2007.
On 31 July 2009 the investigation against all the accused was transferred to the Prosecutor’s Office for Organised Crime.
On 28 June 2012 the investigation was closed.
On 17 January 2013 the criminal proceedings against the applicant were suspended.
