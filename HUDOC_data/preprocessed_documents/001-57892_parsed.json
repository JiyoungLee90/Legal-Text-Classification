France and Vall\u00e9e judgments, the Court reiterates that a period of more than four years to obtain a judgment in first-instance proceedings far exceeds a reasonable time in a case of this nature. Such a reasonable time had been exceeded even before the applicant was paid compensation by the Fund on 1 June 1992 and 18 February 1993 (see paragraph 18 above). After the latter date, what was at stake in the proceedings, in both pecuniary and non-pecuniary terms, continued to be of great importance to Mr Karakaya.",
