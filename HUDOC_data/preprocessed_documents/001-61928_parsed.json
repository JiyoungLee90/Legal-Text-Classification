They contended that the domestic law at the material time did not permit the supervisory instance to convict the applicant, but only to quash the previous judgments and to remit the case for fresh examination in adversarial proceedings. In support of their position, they referred to the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling of 17 July 2002 in the applicant\u2019s case. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s acquittal could not be said to have been invalidated or suspended at any time, given that the Procurator General\u2019s request was dismissed by the Presidium.",

This procedure obviously falls within the scope of Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No.\u00a07.

The subject matter of such proceedings remained the same criminal charge and the validity of its previous determination. If the request was granted and the proceedings were resumed for further consideration, the ultimate effect of supervisory review would be to annul all decisions previously taken by courts and to determine the criminal charge in a new decision.

They informed the Court that, just as Article 380 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure prohibited the Presidium from increasing a sentence or changing a legal classification to a more serious one without remitting the case for new examination, the Presidium itself was unable to replace an acquittal with a conviction while simultaneously granting the request for reopening.

The position regarding criminal cases is somewhat different, at least in so far as acquittals are concerned, as a review could only be requested during a period of one year following the date of the acquittal in question.",

The possibility of re-examining or reopening cases was also considered by the Committee of Ministers as a guarantee of restitution, particularly in the context of the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments. In its Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at the domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, it urged member States to ensure that their domestic legal systems provided for a procedure whereby a case could be re-examined or reopened.",

Had it quashed the acquittal, this would necessarily have entailed a separate set of adversarial proceedings on the merits before the competent courts. The decision by the Presidium thus marked a procedural step which was no more than a precondition to a new determination of the criminal charge. The Court notes that the Presidium of the Supreme Court dismissed the Procurator General\u2019s request, having found that it relied on defects which it had been entirely within the prosecution\u2019s control to redress before, not after, the final judgment. The Procurator General\u2019s request could itself be criticised as being arbitrary and an abuse of process. However, it had no decisive impact on the fairness of the procedure for reopening as a whole, which was primarily a matter for the Presidium\u2019s deliberation (see, mutatis mutandis, Voloshchuk v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 51394/99, 14 October 2003, and Sardin v.  (dec.), no. 69582/01, ECHR 2004-II).
