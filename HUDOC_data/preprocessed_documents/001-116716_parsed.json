It noted that the domestic courts had considered that the applicant could not benefit from those provisions at the time of lodging his action for abatement of the inter vivos gift of 1970. According to the Court of Appeal, the transitional provision of the 1972 Law precluded any challenge to inter vivos gifts granted before the Law came into force. The Court of Cassation had held that as division of the estate had taken place on the mother\u2019s death in 1994, this precluded \u2013 under section 25(2) of the 2001 Law \u2013 application of the new provisions providing for equal inheritance rights. Those interpretations of domestic law pursued the legitimate aim of safeguarding the principle of legal certainty and the long-standing rights of the legitimate children. Moreover, they did not appear unreasonable, arbitrary or blatantly inconsistent with the prohibition of discrimination. The Chamber distinguished the specific situation in the present case from the cases in which there had not yet been division of the estate (Mazurek, cited above, and Merger and Cros v. France, no.\u00a068864/01, 22 December 2004) in concluding that the difference in treatment in question was proportionate to the aim pursued and that there had been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraphs 50-59 of the Chamber judgment).",

Neither the 1972 Law nor the 2001 Law had had the effect of enabling him to acquire the share in the estate to which he would have been entitled if the deed of 1970 had not existed. Unlike the cases of Mazurek and Merger and Cros, in which the applicants had automatically acquired inheritance rights following the death of their parent, the succession in the present case had been settled in 1970 before the death of the applicant\u2019s mother. Moreover, division of the property had taken effect several years before the applicant\u2019s filiation had been established in 1983. Consequently, according to the Government, the applicant had no inheritance rights in respect of the estate (they referred, mutatis mutandis, to Alboize-Barthes and Alboize-Montezume v. France (dec.), no. 44421/04, 21\u00a0October 2008).",

Section 25 of the 2001 Law thus excluded application of the new rights to successions already open on the date of its publication that had given rise to division before that date.

A legitimate expectation must have a \u201csufficient basis in national law\u201d (see Kopeck\u00fd, cited above, \u00a7 52; Depalle v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 34044/02, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2010; and Saghinadze and Others v. , no. 18768/05, \u00a7 103, 27 May 2010). Likewise, the concept of \u201cpossessions\u201d may extend to a particular benefit of which the persons concerned have been deprived on the basis of a discriminatory condition of entitlement (see Andrejeva v.  [GC], no. 55707/00, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2009). However, the hope of recognition of the survival of an old property right which it has long been impossible to exercise effectively cannot be considered as a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, nor can a conditional claim which lapses as a result of the non-fulfilment of the condition (see the recapitulation of the relevant principles in Malhous v. the Czech Republic (dec.)

The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and the background, but the Court must determine in the last resort whether the Convention requirements have been complied with. Since the Convention is first and foremost a system for the protection of human rights, the Court must however have regard to the changing conditions in Contracting States and respond, for example, to any emerging consensus as to the standards to be achieved (see Konstantin Markin, cited above, \u00a7 126).",

In that connection it considers that the applicant\u2019s half-brother and half-sister knew \u2013 or should have known \u2013 that their rights were liable to be challenged. At the time of their mother\u2019s death in 1994 there was a statutory five-year time-period for bringing an action for abatement of an inter vivos division. The legitimate heirs should therefore have known that their half-brother had until 1999 to claim his share in the estate and that such an action was capable of calling into question not the division as such, but the extent of the rights of each of the descendants. Moreover, the action for abatement that the applicant did finally bring in 1998 was pending before the national courts at the time of delivery of the judgment in Mazurek, which declared that inequality of inheritance rights on grounds of birth was incompatible with the Convention, and at the time of publication of the 2001 Law, which executed that judgment by incorporating the principles established therein into French law. Lastly, the applicant was not a descendant whose existence was unknown to them, as he had been recognised as their mother\u2019s \u201cillegitimate\u201d son in a judgment delivered in 1983 (see paragraph 12 above; see, mutatis mutandis, Camp and Bourimi, cited above, \u00a7 39). That was sufficient to arouse justified doubts as to whether the estate had actually passed on Mrs\u00a0M.\u2019s death in 1994 (see the conclusions of the advocate-general, paragraph 22 above).",

The applicant challenged that submission (see paragraph 46 above). In the particular circumstances of the case, in which European case-law and the national legislative reforms showed a clear tendency towards eliminating all discrimination regarding the inheritance rights of children born outside marriage, the Court considers that the action brought by the applicant before the domestic courts in 1998 and dismissed in 2007 is a weighty factor when examining the proportionality of the difference in treatment (see paragraphs 22 and 68 above, and paragraph 72 below). The fact that that action was still pending in 2001 could not but relativise the expectation of Mrs M.\u2019s other heirs that they would succeed in establishing undisputed rights to her estate.",

It had pursued a legitimate aim, namely, guaranteeing peaceful family relations by securing long-standing rights. Relying on the Court\u2019s judgment in Marckx, the Government submitted that it would be contrary to the principle of legal certainty to set aside a division implemented several years (1972 Law) or even several decades (2001 Law) before the legislative and jurisprudential changes amending the inheritance rules applicable to children \u201cborn of adultery\u201d. Lastly, that interference had been proportionate because the implementation of the impugned provisions by the domestic courts was limited both in time and in respect of the voluntary dispositions concerned. The Government concluded that the transitional provisions, as interpreted by the domestic courts, were in conformity with the decision in Mazurek and with the Convention. The 2001 Law, in particular, provided for application of the new provisions with regard to the time factor, taking account of acquired situations that it would be undesirable from a social point of view \u2013 and unfeasible in certain cases \u2013 to call into question.

Thus, the Court has on many occasions refused to strike out a case, even though the applicant had sought to withdraw his or her application, because it considered that the case raised questions of a general character affecting the observance of the Convention. The same underlying general interest justified the introduction of the concept of \u201cpotential victim\u201d and the practice of third-party intervention. The \u201cmaintenance and further realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms\u201d in the Council of Europe and the \u201cachievement of greater unity between its members\u201d indeed call for this broad understanding of the Court\u2019s mission, not only in regard to the conditions for admissibility of applications to the Court and the striking out of applications, but also to the effects of its judgments. The collective nature of the Court\u2019s input logically impacts on the erga omnes nature of its output. States Parties not involved in the proceedings must not turn a blind eye to the authoritative interpretation of the Convention made by the Court, which is the final instance invested with that power. If they were to do so, either wilfully or negligently, they would be at variance with their own Convention engagements as interpreted by the Court, and thus fail to show the attentive commitment to the fulfillment of treaty obligations which is called for by the principle of good faith in performing a treaty. However, if the States Parties abide by the standards set in the Court\u2019s case-law, even when they have not been involved in the particular disputes in respect of which the case-law was established, they not only avoid future findings of a violation, but also anticipate the implementation of the rights and freedoms foreseen in the Convention. This proactive approach by the States Parties is also required by a rigorous application of the principle of subsidiarity. The full implementation of the Convention at national level requires States Parties to take all measures necessary to redress, and preferably to prevent, violations. Failure to comply with the Court\u2019s case-law, even by States not party to the disputes in respect of which this has been established, would run counter to the aforementioned obligation to act effectively, promptly and in a preventative way in order to secure to everyone the rights and freedoms of the Convention. These developments have culminated in the recognition of the Convention as a \u201cconstitutional instrument of European public order\u201d and therefore of the Court as \u201cEurope\u2019s Constitutional Court\u201d. Hence, all bodies and representatives of any public authority of the respondent State, at all levels of its organisation (national, federal, regional or local), are directly bound by the Court\u2019s judgments and therefore, to use the phrase coined by the Brighton Declaration, \u201call laws and policies should be formulated, and all State officials should discharge their responsibilities, in a way that gives full effect to the Convention\u201d. In this context, the Court being tasked with the power to interpret and apply the Convention through final and binding judgments (Article 19 of the Convention), the direct and erga omnes effect of the Court\u2019s judgments may not be restricted by the States Parties. Only the Court itself can determine a restriction of the effects of its judgments.",

In view of the increasingly prescriptive nature of the Court\u2019s judgments, and consequently of the growing dual facet of the States Parties\u2019 obligation to comply with the Court\u2019s judgments as an obligation of result and means, the Court\u2019s control of the application of Article 46 of the Convention is crucial.",

The entire system of human rights protection would be sacrificed on the altar of politics, the Court\u2019s judgments being downgraded to provisional statements on disputes in need of a subsequent political satisfecit to be effective. The applicant\u2019s victory at the Human Rights Building would be a Pyrrhic one, the respondent State having a second chance to fight the case in the Palais de l\u2019Europe. Human rights would then be a deceptive mirage in Europe. To ensure that human rights do not become a mere mirage, the most protective interpretation of the Convention\u2019s rights and freedoms is required: to guarantee real, not virtual, independence of the judicial power and an effet utile, not apparent, of the rights and freedoms of the Convention, it is indispensable that the Court be vested with the implied power to oversee the execution of its judgments, and, if need be, to contradict a decision of the Committee of Ministers in this regard.",

In the European legal framework of human rights, the Court\u2019s power to supervise the execution of its judgments is implied in its duty to ensure compliance with States Parties\u2019 obligations under the Convention and its power to decide any question regarding the application of the Convention (Article 19 in conjunction with Article 32).",

The Protocol provides for an enlargement of the Court\u2019s power to control the execution phase: the Court can interpret its own judgments and decide that a respondent State has not complied with them when problems arise during the execution process. The explicit recognition in Protocol No. 14 that these important powers vest in the Court does not conceal the fact that they are dependent on a request by the Committee of Ministers, that is, by the States Parties. If the same powers to interpret the Court\u2019s judgments and determine that the respondent State had not complied with them were not conferred on the Court when the initiative belonged to the injured party, not only would the injured party be placed in a position of inferiority with regard to the respondent Government, but, worse still, the respondent State could \u201cblock\u201d the effects of the Court\u2019s judgments at the level of the Committee of Ministers, the Court being powerless to oppose any political \u201cblockage\u201d during the execution phase. In the event of failure of the aforementioned supervisory mechanism of the Committee of Ministers, the injured party\u2019s only effective legal avenue by which to address an incorrect interpretation of or non-compliance with a Court\u2019s judgment remains access to the Court itself. Faced with some regrettable cases of clear non-compliance with its judgments, the Court has affirmed its power to censure such non-compliance. It could not have done otherwise. This was the only way to protect the Court\u2019s authority and the Convention\u2019s legal force. The danger of denial of the authority of the Court\u2019s judgments and the concomitant deprivation of the legal force of the Convention were wisely avoided by the enlightening judgment in the case of Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) (no. 2). With a firm statement of the Court\u2019s power to oversee the infringement of Article 46 of the Convention, Emre (no.\u00a02) applied the crowning touch to that approach. In the crystal-clear and decisive wording of paragraph 75, the Court censured the respondent State\u2019s conduct after the first Emre judgment. Furthermore, the Court affirmed in straightforward terms what would have been the \u201cmost natural execution\u201d of the first Emre judgment: nullification with \u201cimmediate effect\u201d of the impugned measure of expulsion from the national territory. In this context, the finding of a violation of Article 46 was a logically necessary consequence of the reasoning.",

The exercise of the Court\u2019s competence to supervise the execution of its own judgments prevails over a contrary decision of the Committee of Ministers.

The retroactive effect of the Court\u2019s judgments calls into question the foreseeability of judicial activity. Hence, legal certainty favours the prospective effect of judgments. Nevertheless, the full implementation of the rights and freedoms protected by the Convention may require that a Court\u2019s judgment be applied retroactively, that is to say, to facts submitted in a new application which have occurred prior to the date when the judgment became final. In the instant case, the applicant had a legitimate expectation of being counted among the inheritors of his mother\u2019s estate from 24 November 1983, the date on which his filiation was established, until his mother\u2019s death on 28 July 1994. On the day of his mother\u2019s death, the applicant\u2019s legitimate expectation condensed into an acquired right to his reserved portion of his mother\u2019s opened succession. Although the inter-vivos gift in 1970 had the effect of transferring property to the donees, this did not become a division of the donor\u2019s estate for inheritance purposes until the date of her death. By that time, the applicant\u2019s filiation had already been established and an event prior to the opening of his mother\u2019s succession \u2013 the inter-vivos division \u2013 could not deprive him of his right to obtain his reserved portion. To argue otherwise would be tantamount to disregarding the filiation established in 1983 and depriving of all useful effect the abatement action brought by the applicant in due time. In other words, the establishment of the applicant\u2019s maternal filiation in 1983 vested inheritance rights in him at the opening of his mother\u2019s succession which fall within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1.",

This exception was applied by the Court of Cassation in the instant case. In the light of Mazurek, this transitional rule of the 2001 Law cannot stand. The choice made by the national legislature by means of the transitional provisions still differentiates, without any plausible reason, between children born in and children born out of wedlock. In other words, this Law runs counter to Mazurek, which had censured all discriminatory treatment regarding inheritance rights of children born out of wedlock. Hence, the Court should have distanced itself from Resolution ResDH(2005)25, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 25 April 2005, and from Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)191, adopted on 2 December 2010, according to which the respondent State had satisfactorily implemented the Mazurek judgment in its domestic legal order.",

This force, which has been steadily strengthened by the Court\u2019s and the Committee of Ministers\u2019 practice, as has been demonstrated, is certainly not called into question by the unfortunate sentence included in paragraph 75 of the present judgment which says \u201cin conformity with their constitutional orders and having regard to the principle of legal certainty\u201d. That sentence apparently limits the States Parties\u2019 obligation to give full effect to Convention standards as interpreted by the Court to their \u201cconformity with their constitutional order\u201d. If it is understood as implicit authorisation for a fully-fledged, unrestrictive filtering mechanism of the domestic constitutionality of the Court\u2019s judgments, this sentence would simply annihilate decades of construction of the European human rights system, empty the Convention of its legal force and reduce the Court to the position of an annex to domestic constitutional courts. Moreover, it would be a blow to Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, in so far as it would allow a State Party to the Convention to invoke the provisions of its constitutional law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. The Court\u2019s judgments\u2019 validity and efficacy do not depend on a fiat of national constitutional courts. Hence, the reference to the \u201cconformity with their constitutional orders\u201d is nothing but an anodyne reference to the principle of the safeguard for existing human rights foreseen in Article 53.",
