There had therefore been only 3.3 sq. m of general living space or 1.65 sq. m of living space per applicant. The Government submitted that the applicants had been held in cells measuring 5 sq. m, without specifying whether the applicants had been held in those cells individually or together. In the absence of more precise submissions from the Government, the Court is inclined to give weight to the applicants\u2019 explanations of this matter and concludes that, even assuming that the cells measured 5 sq. m, as contended by the Government, the living space, reduced by a sanitary unit, was too little per applicant to comply with the standards recognised by the Court (see, for example, Kalashnikov v. , no. 47095/99, \u00a7 97, ECHR\u00a02002VI, and Melnik, cited above, \u00a7 47, 28 March 2006).",

Moreover, those reports were prepared in 2010, while the period complained of dates back to 2002 \u2013 2004. The Court therefore cannot exclude that the applicants\u2019 contentions as to the inadequacy of lighting, heating and water supply systems, insufficient provisions of clothes and bed linen and inappropriate sanitary conditions were based on the real circumstances of their detention. These submissions are consistent with the similar numerous cases concerning conditions of detention in Ukrainian pre-trial detention facilities (see, for example, Nevmerzhitsky v.
