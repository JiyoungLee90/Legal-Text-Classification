Where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons who are under their control, strong presumptions of fact will arise when injuries are sustained by people who are in that situation. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000VII).",

The subsequent report taken on 30 July 1999 indicated that the applicant had two scars on the gluteal region and finally the fifth report, taken on the last day of his custody revealed merely a scar measuring 1\u00a0x\u00a01\u00a0cm.",

The Court considers that such a treatment, as described by the applicant, would have left more serious marks on his body other than the superficial injuries noted above (see Milan v.

Turkey, 23501/07, 3 June 2014), when, as in this case, a person has been accused of a crime, taken into police custody for questioning and has made incriminating statements without a lawyer being present, his subsequent conviction at trial for a criminal offence must, in principle, be considered unsafe and a retrial is the appropriate response. That is the logic behind the seminal Grand Chamber judgment in Salduz v.\u00a0Turkey ([GC], 36391/02, ECHR 2008; see \u00a7 55, in fine). Hence, when the fundamental fairness of criminal proceedings have been irremediably undermined due to a violation of this nature, there is no need, in general, for this Court to examine other complaints under Article 6 concerning the fairness of the same proceedings. My view on this issue is thus based on legal principle as well as on grounds of practical necessity.",

Apart from the complaint relating to a violation of the right to legal assistance, which the Court examined, he also raised complaints with respect to the lack of independence and impartiality of the domestic court, that court\u2019s reliance on evidence obtained under duress, the unreasonable length of the proceedings, his inability to attend hearings during the first year of the proceedings, and his inability to hear and cross-examine witnesses against him.",

I do not find these reasons convincing. First, the complaint relating to the violation of the right to legal assistance is of a different nature to the other complaints. The finding of a violation of the right to legal assistance during the initial stage of the criminal proceedings does not necessarily imply that the applicant could not have had a trial before an independent and impartial tribunal, or a trial within a reasonable time. At least these two aspects of the right to a fair trial deserved, in my opinion, a separate examination. Second, it is not at all certain that the applicant will request a retrial (he is not obliged to do so), and even less that he will obtain one. However, what is certain is that at this stage he is unable to obtain just satisfaction in respect of the non-pecuniary damage allegedly caused by the violations that are the object of his additional complaints.",
