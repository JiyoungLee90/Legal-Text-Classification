Six other police officers on duty that day were acquitted. The court found it established that when the applicant arrived at the police station he was drunk. He started swearing and threatening the officers, threw himself right and left and hit a couple of police officers. In order to stop him, the police officers handcuffed, blindfolded and gagged the applicant. One police officer, M.G.I., hit the applicant with a truncheon. He also told the other police officers to hit the applicant. Three other police officers consequently hit the applicant with truncheons. Based on this finding, the court held that the actions of the four police officers who had beaten the applicant had constituted a breach of Article 245 of the Criminal Code. Considering that the swearing and threats of the applicant amounted to provocation within the meaning of Article 51 of the Criminal Code, the court then reduced their sentences and accordingly sentenced each of them to a fine. Furthermore, the court decided to suspend the execution of their sentences pursuant to Section\u00a06 of Law no. 647 on the basis that the accused officers did not show any likelihood of reoffending.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates the absolute nature of the prohibition of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the victim\u2019s conduct. Accordingly, provocation can never be regarded as justification for the infliction of severe ill-treatment on an individual, in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (Atalay, cited above, \u00a7\u00a043). In this connection, the Court firstly notes that the \u0130zmir Criminal Court considered that the swearing and threats of the applicant at the police officers had amounted to provocation within the meaning of Article 51 of the former Criminal Code, and as a result the sentences of the police officers, who were found guilty of ill-treatment, were reduced. Secondly, the pronouncement of the judgment was suspended pursuant to Article\u00a0231 of the Criminal Procedure Code (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). In the Court\u2019s opinion, these two shortcomings cannot be considered as compatible with the Convention standard of protection from ill-treatment. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, suspension of such sentences undeniably falls into the category of the \u201cmeasures\u201d which are unacceptable as its effect is to render convictions ineffective (see Okkal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73-78, and Zeynep \u00d6zcan v. Turkey, no. 45906/99, \u00a7\u00a7 40-46, 20 February 2007). In this respect, the Court notes that the suspension of the pronouncement of the judgment, regulated by Article 231 of the Code on Criminal Procedure (Law no.\u00a05271), has a stronger effect than the deferral of the execution of the sentence and results in the impunity of the perpetrators. That is because the former\u2019s application removes the judgment with all its legal consequences, including the sentence, provided that the offender abides by the suspension order, whereas in the latter, neither the sentence nor the judgment ceases to exist. The Court considers therefore that the impugned court decision suggests that the judges exercised their discretion to minimise the consequences of an extremely serious unlawful act rather than show that such acts could in no way be tolerated. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that as a result of the shortcomings observed in the prosecution of the police officers, combined with the fact that no disciplinary measures had been taken against them, the  failed to fulfil its procedural obligation under Article 3 of the Convention.",
