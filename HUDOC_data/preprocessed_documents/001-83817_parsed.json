The Court has already found that the practice of issuing collective detention orders without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention in respect of each detainee was incompatible, in itself, with Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Shcheglyuk\u00a0v. , no.\u00a07649/02, \u00a7\u00a045, 14\u00a0December 2006; Korchuganova, cited above, \u00a7 76; and Dolgova, cited above, \u00a7 49).

The Court accepts that a detainee\u2019s foreign nationality could be a relevant factor in assessing the risk of flight. However, the danger of an accused absconding does not result just because it is possible or easy for him to cross the frontier: there must be a whole set of circumstances, such as, particularly, the lack of well-established ties in the country, which give reason to suppose that the consequences and hazards of flight will seem to him to be a lesser evil than continued imprisonment (see St\u00f6gm\u00fcller\u00a0v. Austria, judgment of 10\u00a0November 1969, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a09, \u00a7\u00a015). The domestic courts did not mention any such circumstance in their decisions or point to any specific aspects of the applicant\u2019s character or behaviour that would justify their conclusion that the applicant presented a persistent flight risk. The applicant, on the other hand, constantly invoked the facts showing his close ties with Russia that mitigated the risk of his absconding abroad, such as his permanent place of residence and family in  and ongoing studies at a Russian university. In any event, the applicant, who was also a Russian national, could only cross the Russian border with his Russian travel passport (see paragraph 53 above). The domestic authorities did not explain why the withdrawal of his Russian travel passport, a measure explicitly envisaged in domestic law for removing flight risks, would not have been sufficient to prevent him from absconding abroad.",

At the same time the Court emphasises that even if a detainee by the very nature of his situation must be subjected to various limitations of his rights and freedoms, every such limitation must be nevertheless justifiable as necessary in a democratic society.

Thus, a violation of Article 8 was found in the P\u0142oski case, where the applicant, who had not been convicted, was charged with a non-violent crime and sought leave to attend the funerals of his parents, who died within one month of each other, whereas the authorities did not give compelling reasons for the refusal and did not consider the possibility of escorted leave. By contrast, in the Sannino case, the refusal was justified because the applicant had been convicted of murder and was of dubious character. He sought leave to visit his grandfather who was not a close relative and whose state of health was not really precarious. In the most recent case, Schemkamper, the Court also found the refusal justified because the applicant\u2019s father was not so unwell as to be unable to visit the applicant in prison.",

Although the period of detention in the present case is the same as in the Dolgova case, there are factors which, in my opinion, distinguish it from Dolgova and warrant the conclusion that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3, such as the applicant\u2019s chronic kidney disease, the inhuman conditions of his detention (see paragraphs 42-45) and his father\u2019s terminal illness and death. The domestic courts had an obligation under Article 99 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure to take those factors into account.",
