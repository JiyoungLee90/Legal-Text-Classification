It argued that there was no other religious entity registered under the same name. In this connection, it submitted that there were six registered religious entities that contained the term \u201cChristian\u201d in their name and two registered entities that used the term \u201cIslamic\u201d. The intention of the 2007 Act was not to ban the use of terms that had a generic and not exclusive meaning. Otherwise, it would mean that the law would only allow the registration of one religious entity containing the term Christian, Islamic, Bektashi, Jewish, Tarikat, Buddhist, Zen or Zoroastric. It also argued that it had sought registration as a religious community, as opposed to \u201cEhlibeyt Bektashi\u201d, which was registered as a religious group. Its intended name was substantially different from the name of that entity; it had existed for decades and centuries, as was evident from the directory and correspondence with various State institutions. As regards the doctrinal sources, it argued that they could not be regarded as official insignia within the meaning of section 10(1) of the 2007 Act. Doctrinal sources could be identical for multiple religious entities (as the Bible was common for Orthodox Christians and Catholics, and the Koran was common for the Islamic Religious Community, the Bektashi Order and Shia or Sunni Muslims). They were of an ideological nature and were not constant, nor could they be interpreted in that way. Official insignia concerned symbols (crosses, crescents, graphic symbols), a flag or a totem that represented something. In this connection, it stated that the interpretation which the court had given regarding its doctrinal sources, namely that they were identical to the doctrinal sources of all Islamic teaching, was wrong. The mere fact that the court had interpreted its doctrinal sources implied that the State was not separated from religion. Furthermore, if that interpretation had been based on some material, it had not been communicated to the applicant association. Nor had it been given the opportunity to present its views at a public hearing. In this connection, it requested that the Court of Appeal hold a public hearing. Lastly, it complained that the refusal of registration was discriminatory.",

The national authorities, including the Constitutional Court, have accepted that it had the requisite standing. It was only in the proceedings upon the constitutional appeal that the second applicant complained in his own name. In the absence of any indication that the applicant association had no capacity to lodge the application with this Court, it considers that the individual applicants could not themselves claim to be victims of a violation resulting from the domestic authorities\u2019 refusal of re-registration, which affected only the applicant association as such (see Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses of Moscow v.

Its main grievance was therefore that it had been unable to preserve that status so as to act collectively in the religious sphere. Accordingly, the Court will examine whether a constitutional appeal would have been an effective remedy that the applicant association should have used regarding the application of a legal provision, which prevented religious associations from maintaining that status unless they had been registered at least ten years before the 2007 Act entered into force (see paragraph 39 above).",

It also noted the Constitutional Court\u2019s practice in 2009 to 2010, at the time when the recognition proceedings had been completed (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above), of declining jurisdiction to deal with appeals of an association or organisation through which individual members acted collectively in a field of mutual interest (ibid., \u00a7 70). Similarly, the Constitutional Court rejected constitutional appeals of individuals submitted in their name and on behalf of the non-registered religious associations with which they were associated. In so doing, it stated that it \u201cha[d] no jurisdiction to decide on the rights and interests of citizens in specific cases before administrative and judicial bodies ...\u201d; that \u201c[it] cannot rule on the request for the protection of human rights and freedoms in relation to specific final decisions of competent bodies\u201d; and that \u201cthe [assessment of] the application of the law by the registration court ... was beyond its jurisdiction\u201d (see ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 20, 21, 36 and 55). Lastly, and more importantly, the Court observes that all those cases concerned registration proceedings (similar to the proceedings described in paragraphs 23-33 above) in which the competent authorities had refused to register a newly established religious association.

The Skopje Court of Appeal stated that the term \u201cBektashi\u201d was \u201cdecisive and represented a synonym for the religious entity\u201d. It accordingly held that the registration of the applicant association under the intended name would create confusion among the believers (see paragraph\u00a030 above, mutatis mutandis, Bekir-Ousta and Others v. Greece, no.\u00a035151/05, \u00a7 14, 11\u00a0October 2007; Emin and Others v. Greece, no.\u00a034144/05, \u00a7 10, 27\u00a0March 2008; and Macedonian House of Civilization v. Greece, no.\u00a01295/10, \u00a7 8, 9\u00a0July 2015). The Constitutional Court relied on a more detailed explanation (see paragraph 33 above), with which the Court, in principle, agrees (see the OOA case, \u00a7 111). However, similarly to the OOA case, the Court considers that the name chosen for the applicant association in the present case was sufficiently specific to distinguish it from the \u201cEhlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia\u201d. Another distinguishing element in the intended name of the applicant association was the proposed form of its organisation (religious community) which was different from the form of association of the \u201cEhlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia\u201d. Lastly, the Court notes that the domestic courts did not provide any substantive reasons to justify the potential risk of confusion among believers in the present case. In the Court\u2019s opinion, mere reference to the name of the religious associations in question was not sufficient in this respect.",

That conclusion was made on the basis of an assessment by the domestic courts of the applicant association\u2019s fundamental precepts and their comparison with the precepts of the \u201cIslamic Religious Community\u201d (see paragraph 32 above). No prior consultation with the applicants preceded that finding, notwithstanding that the registration court could have asked for an additional explanation (see paragraph 23 above). In the Court\u2019s view, such an assessment and interpretation of the applicant association\u2019s basic tenets of creed was incompatible with the State\u2019s role as a neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, which excludes, save for very exceptional cases, any discretion on the part of the State to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see paragraph 43 above, also Leyla \u015eahin v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, \u00a7 107, ECHR 2005XI). Furthermore, no explanation was given for the resulting finding of this fresh scrutiny carried out under the 2007 Act, having regard to the fact that both the applicant association and the \u201cIslamic Religious Community\u201d had been active and had already existed in the respondent State for many years (see paragraphs 6, 27 and 32 above) and there was no argument that their doctrinal sources in the meantime had changed or had led to confusion among believers.",

In these circumstances, and having regard to the fact that the applicant association had lawfully existed and operated in the respondent State as an independent religious community for many years before the 2007 Act had entered into force, the Court considers that the reasons for refusing registration of the applicant association should have been particularly weighty and compelling.

Accordingly, unless there are exceptional circumstances which justify dispensing with a hearing, the right to a public hearing under Article 6 \u00a7 1 implies a right to an oral hearing at least before one instance. A hearing may be dispensed with if a party unequivocally waives his or her right thereto and there are no questions of public interest making a hearing necessary. A waiver can be made explicitly or tacitly, in the latter case for example by refraining from submitting or maintaining a request for a hearing (see Juri\u010di\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 58222/09, \u00a7 87, 26 July 2011).
