The Court further observes that, since remittal is usually ordered because of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency in the judicial system (Wierciszewska v. Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7 46, 25\u00a0November 2003).\u00a0The Court further notes that by the judgment of 29\u00a0March 1999 a part of the applicant's case was sent for fresh consideration. However, it was only on 16 November 2000, after the decision of 7\u00a0July 2000 by which other parts of the applicant's case were remitted for new consideration, that the court scheduled a first hearing and ordered a bookkeeping expertise to be held. The expertise was completed only by June of next year and the hearings in the applicant's case were resumed only on 6 November 2001. Therefore, this period of inactivity of two years and seven months excluding the time of an expertise, which was also quite lengthy, is completely attributable to authorities. Finally, the Court notes that the domestic courts twice closed the proceedings in the applicant's case as she allegedly failed to appear in a court hearing without valid reason while the court of appeal established that the applicant had not been properly informed about the hearings.",
