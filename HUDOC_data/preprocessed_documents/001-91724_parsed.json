The applicant submitted that he had been living in a community of preachers since 28\u00a0July\u00a01997 and devoted all his time to religious activities. On 17\u00a0April\u00a01998 he had become a deacon and aspired to assume the function of an elder within the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Referring to German law (section\u00a010(1)(3) of the German Civilian Service Act) and the case-law and practice of the  (BVerwG, 29\u00a0September\u00a01989, Zl.\u00a08\u00a0C\u00a053.87), he argued that persons in a similar situation (preachers and deacons) were exempt from compulsory military or civilian service. Further, the applicant complained that section 13a(1) of the Civilian Service Act exempted only members of recognised religious societies performing specific services relating to worship or religious instruction from the obligation to perform civilian service, whereas he held a comparable clerical position within the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Furthermore, section 11(1) of the newly introduced Federal Act on the Legal Status of Registered Religious Communities (Bundesgesetz \u00fcber die Rechtspers\u00f6nlichkeit von religi\u00f6sen Bekenntnisgemeinschaften, hereafter referred to as the \u201c1998 Act\u201d), which had entered into force on 10 January 1998, established that recognition under the Recognition Act was only possible after ten years\u2019 existence as a registered religious community. Therefore this new provision precluded any recognition during the following ten years and made the Recognition Act inapplicable until 2008. The applicant requested the  to revoke the restriction limiting the application of section\u00a013a(1) of the Civilian Service Act to \u201crecognised religious societies\u201d, and in the alternative to revoke the ten-year\u2019 requirement laid down in section 11(1) of the 1998 Act.",

In the alternative, he requested that the provision at issue be interpreted in conformity with the principle of equality. He thus argued that, in view of his position as a deacon in the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, he should be dispensed from the obligation to perform civilian service as his position involved supporting elders by guiding the communities, carrying out clerical work in cooperation with other fellow Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, giving Bible readings, speeches and commentaries during worship and offering guidance for prayers; accordingly, his functions were equivalent to those of members of registered religious societies who provided services relating to spiritual welfare or clerical teaching after graduating in theological studies, or to those of students of theology who were preparing to assume a clerical function.",

It noted that the 1998 Act and in particular section\u00a011(1) had not been applied and were not to be applied by the Ministry for Internal Affairs in the applicant\u2019s case. Rather, the Ministry had to apply section\u00a013a(1) of the Civilian Service Act, requiring recognition of a religious society as a precondition for exemption from civilian service. The provision as such raised no concerns as regards constitutionality, since its objective was not to grant an exemption from the obligation to perform civilian service to every functionary of a religious community, whether or not it was recognised. It further held that the impugned provision, on account of its explicit wording, could not be interpreted in the manner suggested by the applicant.

The Court observed that under Austrian law, religious societies enjoyed privileged treatment in many areas, including, inter alia, exemption from military service and civilian service. Given the number of these privileges and their nature, the advantage obtained by religious societies was substantial. In view of these privileges accorded to religious societies, the obligation under Article 9 of the Convention incumbent on the State\u2019s authorities to remain neutral in the exercise of their powers in this domain required therefore that if a State set up a framework for conferring legal personality on religious groups to which a specific status was linked, all religious groups which so wished must have a fair opportunity to apply for this status and the criteria established must be applied in a non-discriminatory manner (ibid., \u00a7 92). The Court found, however, that in the case of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses one of the criteria for acceding to the privileged status of a religious society had been applied in an arbitrary manner and concluded that the difference in treatment was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d. Accordingly, it found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 9 (ibid., \u00a7 99).",
