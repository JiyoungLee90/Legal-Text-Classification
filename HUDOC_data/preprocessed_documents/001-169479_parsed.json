The rule is based on the assumption that the domestic legislative system provides an effective remedy in respect of the alleged breach.

However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see, amongst many others, Akdivar and Others v.

Turkey, no. 28940/95, \u00a7\u00a7 74-79, 24 June 2008, and M.A. v. Cyprus, no. 41872/10, \u00a7\u00a7 186-193, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). The Court therefore considers that the applicant was under the authorities\u2019 control throughout the entire period, and concludes that, despite the relatively short period of time in question (compare Tomaszewscy v.\u00a0Poland, no. 8933/05, \u00a7 130, 15 April 2014; and Baisuiev and Anzorov, cited above, \u00a7 55, where the applicants were held for even shorter periods of time of two and three hours respectively) he was deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

The words \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 essentially refer back to national law and state the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. While it is normally, first and foremost, up to the national authorities, especially the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, the position is different in relation to cases where failure to comply with the law entails a breach of the Convention. This applies, in particular, to cases in which Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is at issue and the Court must then exercise a certain power to review whether national law has been observed (see Baranowski v. Poland, no. , \u00a7 50, ECHR 2000-III). In particular, it is essential, in matters concerning deprivation of liberty, that the domestic law clearly defines the conditions for detention and that the law be foreseeable in its application (see Zervudacki v. France, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 43, 27 July 2006, and Creang\u0103, cited above, \u00a7 101).",

While the Government contended that the measure had been justified by the type of crime and the status of the other person accused in the file, those reasons were not included in the warrant presented to the applicant. Moreover, the Court considers that the fact that the co-suspect was a police officer could have constituted a reason justifying that person\u2019s warrant, but not the applicant\u2019s. The Government also alleged that the applicant, when appearing before the investigating prosecutor, could have asked the latter what the reasons were for the warrant issued in his name. On this point the Court considers that the purpose of the requirement to provide reasons for a warrant to appear issued directly \u2012 without summoning the accused \u2012 is not only of a purely informative nature but also serves the purpose of avoiding abuse of this legal provision. The Court therefore concludes that by omitting to specify the reasons on which it was based, the prosecutor\u2019s warrant failed to conform to the rules applicable to domestic criminal procedure (see Ghiur\u0103u v.

This complaint is to be separated from his claim that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty for the period he spent under police officers\u2019 control and at the T.N.A.D. prior to his placement in police custody. The Convention specifically empowers our Court not only to review whether, in a particular case, the conditions of Article 5 \u00a7 1 were met, but also and independently whether the person deprived of his or her liberty was entitled to challenge the lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty before a national court in conformity with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",

Accordingly, in the case at hand this required that a judicial remedy be available whereby the applicant could have challenged his detention and obtained release (see Petkov and Profirov v. Bulgaria, nos.\u00a050027/08 and 50781/09, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67, 24 June 2014). If an appropriate remedy is not available, this in itself is a violation of the Convention, more precisely of Article 5 \u00a7 4. Such an eventual violation is independent from the question whether a particular case of deprivation of liberty met the substantive criteria outlined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

In examining that part of the complaint, it has dismissed the Government\u2019s preliminary objection as to the applicability of the Articles 278 or 140 of the Romanian Code of Criminal Procedure in the instant case. In addition, the Court has already established the absence of an effective domestic remedy in a similar case where the applicant was deprived of his liberty for twelve hours on the basis of a warrant to appear (see Iustin Robertino Micu, cited in the judgment, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0109-110). Moreover, the applicant in the present case had raised before the domestic courts his complaint concerning unlawful deprivation of liberty prior to his placement in police custody, but the courts had considered that they were not competent to decide on this complaint. Therefore, the Court should conclude that the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty from 8.00 a.m. to 5.10 p.m. on 12 December 2008 was not subject to any judicial review and that there has accordingly been a breach of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7 4 of the Convention.",
