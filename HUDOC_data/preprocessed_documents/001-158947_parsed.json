To that end, legislation should make it possible to take into account the particular circumstances of each case, so that individuals who have acquired their possessions in good faith are not made to bear the burden of responsibility.

(see paragraphs 7 and 11 above). Furthermore, to date it has not been established whether any crime had actually been committed in awarding property rights to L.S.G. (see paragraph 15 above).

However, as already stated above, that did not affect the applicant\u2019s legitimate expectation of being able to enjoy her possession. Nor could it be assumed that she had not had any expenses related to the maintenance of the property. In this connection the Court notes that the applicant held the plot of land from October 2001 (when it was registered in the Land Registry under her name) until November 2008, and that she stated that during this time she had made substantial efforts to render the land suitable for agricultural activity (although no documents supporting the cost had been presented \u2013 see paragraph 62 below).",
