Moreover, the State\u2019s positive obligation under Article 8 to safeguard the individual\u2019s physical integrity may also extend to questions relating to the effectiveness of a criminal investigation (see M.C. v. Bulgaria, no. 39272/98, \u00a7 152, ECHR 2003XII). The Court reiterates that, for an \u201cinvestigation to be regarded as \u2018effective\u2019, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means\u201d (see Kir\u00e1ly and D\u00f6m\u00f6t\u00f6r v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 10851/13, \u00a7 79, 17 January 2017).",

Bulgaria, no. 26827/08, \u00a7 44, 11 March 2014; and with respect to Article\u00a014 in conjunction with Article 8, R.B., cited above, \u00a7 84). Accordingly, where any evidence of racist verbal abuse comes to light in an investigation of violent acts, it must be checked and, if confirmed, a thorough examination of all the facts should be undertaken in order to uncover any possible racist motives for the violence (see Bal\u00e1zs v. Hungary, no.\u00a015529/12, \u00a7\u00a061, 20 October 2015). Admittedly, in practice it is often extremely difficult to prove a racist motive. The obligation on the respondent State to investigate possible racist overtones to an act of violence is, however, an obligation which concerns the means employed rather than the specific result achieved. The authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumstances to collect and secure the evidence, explore all practical means of discovering the truth, and deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of racially induced violence (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0160korjanec, cited above, \u00a7 57, and Abdu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-45, with further references).",

The Court further observes that Montenegrin criminal law distinguished between criminal offences to be prosecuted by the State prosecutor and criminal offences to be prosecuted by means of a private prosecution. It also provided for the injured party to act as a subsidiary prosecutor. In respect of criminal offences for which the prosecution was to be undertaken by the State prosecutor, where that official declined to prosecute, on whatever grounds, the injured party could take over the prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor. In these circumstances, the Court is satisfied that, in the present case, the domestic legal framework as such provided sufficient protection (see Isakovi\u0107 Vidovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 62).",

It is also clear that the applicant and his family were not physically harmed by any violent acts.

However, nothing in the case file indicates that anything was done to find out whether it was indeed X who had been shooting, for example taking the collected bullet shells from Y for analysis, checking if X did indeed have a gun and, if so, whether the collected bullets had been fired from that gun, and checking what the motive for the shooting was.",

It was clearly indicated that a criminal prosecution in this regard would become time-barred on 22 September 2012. When dismissing the applicant\u2019s request for an investigation into that incident, the domestic courts held that evidence should have been provided by either the applicant or the police, whom allegedly the applicant had never called. When the applicant objected to that finding by submitting that he had both submitted an official complaint and reported the impugned incident to the police, who had merely taken photos of the scene without taking any further evidence, the courts dismissed his argument by simply stating that it was not up to them to assess the work of the police. The police submitted only in 2016, that is four years after criminal prosecution of the criminal offence had become time-barred, that they \u201chad implemented measures, having dedicated a significant amount of time [to the complaint]\u201d, but to no avail (see paragraph 27 above).

He could not have the benefit of the implementation of a legal framework affording effective protection. This applies all the more, given the fact that the applicant is Roma as well as Muslim, and that there was not one, isolated incident directed against him, but many, and in view of the nature of these other incidents (see paragraphs 29-30 and 34-35 above). The Court is mindful of the ongoing conflictual relationship between the applicant and his neighbours, as well as his own contribution to that conflict (see paragraphs 28-35 above).
