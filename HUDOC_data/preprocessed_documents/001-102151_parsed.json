The applicants subsequently took their properties back by exchange of the expropriation compensation they were paid. The applicants, therefore, lacked victim status concerning these parcels. The Government further contended that the applicants had not exhausted domestic remedies as required by Article 35 of the Convention, as they had failed to make proper use of the remedy available to them under Article 105 of the Code of Obligations. Under that provision, they would have been eligible for compensation for the losses allegedly sustained as a result of the delays in payment of the additional compensation if they had established that the losses exceeded the amount of default interest.",

In the present case, the Court observes that the applicants chose to avail themselves of this optional right and regained their full property rights over the parcels in question. The Court, in this regard, underlines that the applicants were not asked to make any further payment other than the amount of compensation that they had been paid by the State at the time of the expropriation nor did the State apply any interest rate whatsoever. Therefore, the Court considers that the principle of restitutio in integrum was ensured in respect of the impugned parcels of the applicants. Consequently, the Court decides to declare this part of the application inadmissible for being manifestly ill-founded pursuant to Article\u00a035\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

Having examined the facts and arguments presented by the Government, the Court considers that there is nothing to warrant a departure from this conclusion reached in the previous cases. It finds that the difference between the values of the amounts due to the applicants when their properties were expropriated and when they were actually paid caused them to sustain a loss which upset the fair balance that should have been maintained between the protection of the right to property and the demands of the general interest.",
