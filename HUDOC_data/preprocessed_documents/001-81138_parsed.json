On 5 October 1999 the first applicant had to be heard as a witness in the context of criminal proceedings K\u00daV-80/20-98 against Mr I. Those proceedings concerned an unlawful sale of bills of exchange, in 1994, which had resulted in the transfer of approximately SKK\u00a019 million to the account of the company ILaS Vranov, s.r.o. on 7\u00a0July\u00a01994. The offences imputed to the accused comprised also several other actions including the misuse, in 1996, of bonds issued by a company of which  had been the director and transfer of that company's assets to several persons including the applicant. The police investigator had joined the above proceedings, on 2 August 2000, as both the applicant and Mr I. had been accused in the case registered under file number K\u00daV-83/20-98. However, the actions imputed to  in proceedings K\u00daV-80/20-98, in the context of which the applicant had refused to make a witness statement, were entirely unrelated to the facts of the other cases.",

Their rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6. The right not to incriminate oneself is primarily concerned with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent.

This provision, as developed in the domestic practice (see paragraphs 40-41 of the judgment) allowed a refusal to make a statement only after a witness had informed the investigator about the reasons for such refusal. The domestic authorities, when examining the applicant's complaint about the fine, found that he had not indicated the reason for his refusal. Nor did the applicant, at any stage of the proceedings, challenge the compatibility of that requirement with the national Constitution or with the European Convention. This constitutes a sufficient ground not to accept the applicant's claim.",

I am not convinced that this case may be properly addressed by assuming that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention does not apply to fines imposed as a consequence of a refusal to testify based on self-incrimination grounds. The right not to incriminate oneself constitutes one of the basic guarantees for persons who feel that a criminal investigation comes too close to their own security. Even if a compulsion to testify does not lead to any criminal charge and/or conviction against the person affected, the fact that such person had been fined (i.e. punished) for the refusal cannot remain outside the area protected by the Convention. Our interpretation of the Convention should not leave any gaps in that area, particularly in respect of the investigation stage when a witness testifies before a prosecutor and not before an impartial court.",

At the same time, it has been recognised that that principle does not work the other way round and that a decision declaring a case or claim inadmissible immediately becomes final.

A conclusion that Article 35 \u00a7 4 establishes the principle of finality of inadmissibility decisions seems to be based on an argumentum a contrario. But such an argument is, methodologically, not always defendable in the field of human rights. Its application results here in a situation where admissibility decisions (that usually respond to the applicant's position) are less safe than inadmissibility decisions (that are usually more in line with the government's arguments).
