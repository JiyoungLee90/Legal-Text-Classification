Although the Government stated that there was considerable documentary evidence for a case of this kind, there is nothing to suggest that the case was marked by any particular difficulty. The applicant argued that her work and economic situation had been seriously damaged by the length of the procedure. However, the litigation concerned her claims that an article in the press had been insulting and there was no substantiated direct link with either her employment situation or salary claims which would have required that the case be dealt with expeditiously (see, mutatis mutandis, Nibbio v.

In the circumstances the time taken before the District Court \u2013 almost two years \u2013 if not particularly expeditious was not unreasonable. However, the Court finds no convincing explanation for the time taken \u2013 over two years and eleven months \u2013 before the Court of Appeal. It is true the applicant applied for an extension of the time for appealing. This, however, only accounted for a delay of some two months. There was also a short delay of four months when the parties were unable to agree a date for the hearing. The fact that the applicant submitted further written evidence in October 2000 also contributed to the delay as the defendants had to be given an opportunity to comment. It is to be noted that there was a period between 3 May 1999 and the submission of that evidence in October 2000 \u2013 a gap of over seventeen months during which no steps were taken by the court to process the appeal. The Government have accepted that this was a period of inactivity and have stated that this was because the court official responsible for the preparation of the case was engaged in an important criminal case and had also been assigned other criminal cases which were older and had more priority than the applicant\u2019s case. This however is not a sufficient excuse for the delay as domestic courts are under an obligation to organise themselves in such a way as to meet the requirements of Article 6 (P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 1999II). It is not apparent that the problem resulted from an exceptional situation such as might relieve the authorities of responsibility for temporary delays: the Government cannot therefore rely on the Court\u2019s case-law to that effect (see e.g. Sussman v. Germany, judgment of 16 September 1999, Reports 1996-IV, \u00a7\u00a755-60 where the Constitutional Court was entitled, on reunification, to give priority to pensions and employment cases of particular significance or Jankovi\u0107 v. Croatia (dec.) (no. 43440/98, ECHR 2000X) where the courts had a large-scale pension problem to deal with).",
