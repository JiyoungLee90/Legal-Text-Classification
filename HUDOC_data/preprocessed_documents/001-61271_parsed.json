However, the second applicant has enjoyed total control of the first applicant ever since its incorporation in 1986. In particular, from 3 July 1986 until 28 November 1986, he held all of the shares in the first applicant apart from forty shares, which were in his wife's name; from 29 November 1986 onwards he held all shares, apart from one, which was owned by his wife. After 3\u00a0April 1996 the ownership of the property was assigned to the second applicant. In the Court's opinion, both applicants are so closely identified with each other that it would be artificial to regard each as an applicant in its/his own right. In reality, the first applicant is the second applicant's company and the vehicle for his business projects. On that understanding, the Court will consider the alleged violations of the Convention from the standpoint of the second applicant alone (hereinafter \u201cthe applicant\u201d), there being no doubt that he can be considered a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, including in the period between April 1988 and April 1996 when he, through his company, was a co-owner of the property at issue.",

By recognising a right to compensation for claimants with clearly established titles to property, it thereby recognises the continuing rights of property of the persons concerned. The Court has every interest, for example, in comparing these cases with the situation examined in the cases of Pisano and Kalantari (see Pisano v. Italy [GC] (striking out), no. 36732/97, 24 October 2002; and Kalantari v. Germany (striking out), no. 51342/99, ECHR 2001-X).

Since the Handyside v. the United Kingdom case (judgment of 17 December 1976, Series A no. 24, \u00a7 48), the Court has repeatedly said that the Convention the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights. Is any reminder needed that under the Convention system a finding of a violation of a protected right by a State party is a means to be used only as a last resort?",

Since the Loizidou judgment, the Court has in a series of judgments and decisions proved adept at taking into account the \u201cpolitical upheaval brought about by the Second World War and its disastrous consequences\u201d for which global political solutions needed to be found. It has thus succeeded in promoting concepts which go beyond the interests, and even rights, of the individual by adopting a realistic and pragmatic approach that seeks to provide solutions that are balanced or will be beneficial in the long term (see, mutatis mutandis, Wittek\u00a0v. Germany, no. 37290/97, \u00a7 61, 12 December 2002; Prince Hans-Adam of Liechtenstein v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 42527/98, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2001-VIII; and Gorzelik and Others v. Poland, no. 44158/98, \u00a7\u00a069, 20 December 2001). In these judgments, the Court adopted a pragmatic approach against the complex historical political background that required a precise evaluation of the competing interests and even of the individual rights and freedoms. The Court correctly perceived the individual interest as being relative and having to yield to interests that affected the community as a whole and were of vital importance to the group, nation or State.",
