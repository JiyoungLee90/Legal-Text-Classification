Consequently, the six-month period under that provision starts running only from the end of that situation \u2013 hence, in the majority of cases, when the person concerned is released. In addition, in applying Article 35 \u00a7 1, the Court endeavours to look behind mere appearances, without excessive formalism (see, in particular, J\u0117\u010dius [v. , no. 34578/97], \u00a7 44[, ECHR 2000-IX]).

However, the detention in question had been imposed on the applicant in two separate sets of proceedings which had completely different statutory bases (ibid., \u00a7 159). The instant case, on the other hand, concerns a single set of criminal proceedings. The Court notes that after the last order for the applicant's detention had expired on 18 May 2001, she continued to be held in prison under the fifth paragraph of Article 77 of the KPK (see paragraph 60 above). This change in statutory basis had no impact, either in fact or in law, on the applicant's situation, as she remained in detention just as she had been before the above-mentioned date.",

In the instant case, the former First Section of the Court gave notice of the application to the respondent Government on 28 February 2002, asking them two separate questions in relation to Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, concerning the periods before and after 11 October 2001.

Before issuing the orders, the judges had examined the evidence in the file carefully and had heard the observations of both parties, as required by Article 76 of the KPK. Similarly, the Government rejected the applicant's argument as to the uniform wording of the orders in question. In that connection, they stressed that the wording of several of the orders had been different; they could not therefore have been prepared in advance. In any event, the Government argued, only the final orders issued on appeal by the  were to be taken into consideration on this point. The Government therefore contended that the applicant's complaint was \u201cof a formal nature\u201d, and requested the Court to focus on \u201ccontent rather than form\u201d.",

No response had been received to any of these requests. The applicant stressed in particular that, in a letter of 8 January 2001, the prosecuting authorities had rejected her complaints on the ground that these requests had not been recorded in any official report. However, the applicant could not be held responsible for the omissions or negligence of the public prosecutor's office in failing to prepare such a report.

The issue whether an accused person's detention on remand continued to be lawful was quite separate from issues of substance. In any event, new facts were not the only possible reason for releasing an accused; the simple passage of time also called for a regular review of the arguments for and against detention. Latvian law did not make adequate provision for reviewing the lawfulness of detention on remand at the judicial stage of the proceedings. While, in practice, the relevant judge at the Riga Regional Court had considered the applicant's request for release made on 12 October 2001, he had simply rejected it by means of a letter, without holding a hearing or giving the applicant adequate opportunity to make representations.",

One of the most important implications of equality of arms is the right of access to the investigation file; the opportunity of effectively challenging the statements or views which the prosecution bases on these documents presupposes in principle that the defence has access to them. The appraisal of the need for a remand in custody and the subsequent assessment of guilt are too closely linked for access to documents to be refused in the former case when the law requires it in the latter case (see Lamy v.

The decision of 29 March 2001 was different in appearance, but its content was exactly the same. Moreover, several of the orders, which had been typed on a computer and printed out, contained blanks to be filled in by hand; in the order of 22 November 2000 the judge's name had also been corrected using a ballpoint pen (see paragraph 28 above).",

The Court acknowledges the fact that Article 5 \u00a7 4 contains more flexible procedural requirements than Article 6 while being much more stringent as regards speediness (see Reinprecht, cited above, \u00a7 40). It therefore accepts that a procedure of this kind may not always be contrary to Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention; however, it will certainly be in breach of that provision if it reflects the absence of an effective examination of the parties' observations. In the Court's view, the practice of the court of first instance amounts to a classic case of denial of the fundamental guarantees contained in Article 5 \u00a7 4.",

It acknowledges the fact that these decisions were more detailed than those of the first-instance court. However, here again, the appeal court merely made vague references to the seriousness of the offence, the fact that it had been perpetrated by an organised group, the applicant's personality and the risk of collusion, without substantiating these allegations. Only the order of 17\u00a0April 2001 referred to the specific acts committed by the applicant; however, this is merely one exception which is insufficient to render the proceedings as a whole compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",

In any event, on 10 December 2000 the applicant had lodged a second complaint to this effect with the Prosecutor General's Office, which was rejected (see paragraph 31 above). The Government challenged this assertion, claiming that the existence of any such application could not be proved in the absence of a specific written reference to it in the file. However, they acknowledged that in the appeals lodged with the  on 31 January and 2\u00a0May 2001 the defence had raised the question of access to the file.",

In the instant case the Government acknowledged that the applicant's lawyer had complained to the judge of his inability to consult the investigation file; however, they argued that he should have made a request to that effect to the prosecutor. In that connection the Court reiterates that, in cases similar to the present one, both the national authorities and the Court must, as a rule, avoid excessive formalism (ibid., \u00a7 52). The third paragraph of Article 97 of the KPK guaranteed defence counsel \u201cthe right to take cognisance of all the documents in the file ... with the consent of ... the prosecutor\u201d. However, it did not lay down any formal requirement to apply to the prosecutor before making a request to the judge.

However, this legitimate goal cannot be pursued at the expense of substantial restrictions on the rights of the defence. Therefore, information which is essential for the assessment of the lawfulness of a person's detention should always be made available in an appropriate manner to his or her lawyer (see Lietzow, cited above, \u00a7 47, and Garcia Alva v. , no. 23541/94, \u00a7 42, 13 February 2001).",

It seems that at this time the case file, which was already voluminous, contained a series of items which appear to have played a crucial role in the decision to keep the applicant in detention. These included not just the statements from the applicant's four co-defendants, V.S., V.B., I.F. and I.\u010c., naming the applicant as the organiser of the murder (see paragraph 10 above), but also various witness statements, physical evidence, expert reports and information obtained in the context of international judicial cooperation, all of which were extensively cited by the public prosecutor's office in its requests for extension of the applicant's detention. It was therefore vital for the defence to be able to consult the file in order to be able to challenge effectively the lawfulness of the applicant's detention on remand which, by January 2001, had already lasted for over six months. Without that possibility, the proceedings concerning the applicant's detention did not satisfy the fundamental requirement of equality of arms, which is an inherent part of fair judicial proceedings.",

The Court has held that this order failed to meet the fundamental requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention (see paragraph 133 above). However, even assuming that this were not the case, it should be pointed out that under the KPK there was no time-limit on this extension which, in principle, remained in force until judgment had been given on the merits. It appears that no remedy was available under Latvian law whereby the lawfulness of detention could be periodically reviewed at the trial stage. In that connection the Court reiterates that Article 5 \u00a7 4 cannot be construed as making detention immune from subsequent review of its lawfulness merely because the initial decision issued from a court; on the contrary, the very nature of this provision requires a review of lawfulness to be available at reasonable intervals (see, mutatis mutandis, Iribarne P\u00e9rez v. France, 24 October 1995, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 325-C). The Court considers that this principle applies also at the trial stage as defined in Latvian law.",

This remedy did not therefore meet the requirements of accessibility and effectiveness laid down by Article 5 \u00a7 4.
