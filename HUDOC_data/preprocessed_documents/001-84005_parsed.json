By contrast, the hope of recognition of a former property right which has not been susceptible of effective exercise for a long period of time is not to be considered a \"possession\" (see Weidlich and Others v.\u00a0Germany, nos. 18890/91, 19048/91, 19049/91, 19342/92 and 19549/92, Commission decision of 4 March 1996, Decisions and Reports 85, p. 5, and the case-law referred to there on p. 18). According to the jurisprudence of the Croatian courts, it appears that the applicant's title to his flat was considered void ab initio which had the effect that he was considered never to have owned it. The Court considers that the applicant had a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention even if his title was null and void ab initio. The Court notes that for about four years he possessed the flat in question and was considered its owner for all legal purposes. Moreover, it would be unreasonable to accept that a State may enact legislation which allows nullification ab initio of contracts or other titles to property and thus escape responsibility for an interference with property rights under the Convention (see Panikian v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a029583/96, Commission decision of 10 July 1997).

Despite the margin of appreciation given to the State the Court must nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review, determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant's right to property (see Rosinski v Poland, no. 17373/02, \u00a7\u00a078, 17 July 2007). The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention as a whole, including therefore the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332, p. 23, \u00a7 38, and The Former King of Greece and Others v. Greece, [GC], no. 25701/94, \u00a7 89). Thus the balance to be maintained between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of fundamental rights is upset if the person concerned has had to bear a \u201cdisproportionate burden\u201d (see, among many other authorities, The Holy Monasteries v. Greece, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-A, pp. 34-35, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71).",

Second, the glass factory had had no right to dispose of the flat to grant the applicant a specially protected tenancy, since that right had been vested in the .

The national courts' finding that a protected tenancy could not have applied to the flat in question since it was merely provisional accommodation has to be seen against the fact that the applicant's family has lived there since 1988 and that it has thus become their normal dwelling, not significantly differing from any other small flat.
