The case was sent to the City Court on 28 January 2000. However, the first hearing was scheduled only for 5 June 2000. According to the Government, the first hearing was scheduled for such a late date either at the applicant\u2019s request or because of the judge\u2019s workload. However, they did not submit any documents in support of their allegations regarding the applicant\u2019s request. Between 5\u00a0June 2000 and 26 July 2001 (one year, one month and twenty days) no hearings took place because the judge was involved in unrelated proceedings. While the Government acknowledged that those delays had taken place, they argued that they had been due to the heavy workload of the judge in charge of the case. In that respect the Court recalls that it is for Contracting States to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can guarantee the right of everyone to obtain a final decision within a reasonable time (see, for instance, L\u00f6ffler v. Austria, no. 30546/96, \u00a7 21, 3\u00a0October 2000). Therefore, the delays that occurred as a result of the judge\u2019s being involved in unrelated proceedings are imputable to the State.",
