The case originated in an application (no. 25411/10) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Sándor Németh (“the applicant”), on 20 April 2010.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 9 April 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Budapest.
In March 2003 the applicant brought an action against Budapest IX District Municipality, claiming the release of public information in the context of a real estate dispute. So far the Pest Central District Court, the Budapest Regional Court and the Budapest Court of Appeal have dealt with the case.
On 19 March 2011 the examination of the case was suspended, pending the adjudication of a preliminary question in another procedure. This latter case appears to be pending at the appellate level.
According to the information available in the case file, the litigation is still pending.
