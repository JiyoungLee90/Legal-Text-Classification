He stated that he had a permanent place of residence with his parents and that he had been taking care of his sick grandmother, so detaining him would negatively affect his family.

Lastly it noted that over fifty suspects had been arrested in the case and that numerous investigative actions were still being carried out (see paragraph\u00a040 below).

The Court of Appeal held that there were sufficient grounds to believe that the applicant might flee because he was facing a very severe punishment and had no strong social ties. It also held that the applicant might commit further crimes because he had allegedly been the leader of a criminal organisation, had been suspected of committing crimes for personal gain, and had had several prior convictions, all of which contributed to a \u201cnegative description of his personality\u201d (neigiamai charakterizuoja kaltinamojo asmenyb\u0119). Although the court acknowledged that the applicant had been detained for a very long time (more than three years and six months), it reiterated that the public interest outweighed individual liberty, so the nature and seriousness of the charges against the applicant justified keeping him in detention. Lastly the Court of Appeal noted that the maximum length of detention during the examination of the case before the first-instance court was not established either in domestic law or in the Convention, so the necessity of extending detention had to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In the applicant\u2019s case, the court considered that the scope of the case (twenty-seven defendants and, at that time, eighty-two volumes of case-file material) and the complexity of the investigation justified the applicant\u2019s continued detention.

The Government argued that the present case, which concerned a criminal organisation armed with firearms and engaged in large-scale distribution of illegal drugs, had been exceptionally complex and therefore justified the lengthy detention of the applicant, who had been suspected of leading the said organisation and of committing multiple crimes under its umbrella. They also noted the large scope of the case: it had involved twenty-seven accused individuals and two hundred criminal episodes, in fifty of which the applicant had been involved. During the investigation at least fifty witnesses had been questioned, some of them multiple times, and a large number of other investigative actions had been carried out. The Government submitted that the authorities had acted with due diligence and there had not been any periods of inactivity on their part. The Government provided a timeline of all the investigative actions taken in respect of the applicant during the pretrial investigation, as well as a timeline of the seventy-five court hearings scheduled in the criminal proceedings (fifty-seven of them were scheduled before the applicant\u2019s conviction in separate criminal proceedings  see paragraphs 41-42 above), indicating the actions carried out by the court during each hearing or the reasons for adjournment.",

To this end they must, paying due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a public interest which justifies a departure from the rule in Article 5 and must set them out in their decisions on the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the established facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 (see Idalov v.\u00a0Russia [GC], no. 5826/03, \u00a7 141, 22\u00a0May 2012).",

In cases of this kind, continuous control and limitation of the defendants\u2019 ability to contact each other and other individuals may be essential to avoid their absconding, tampering with evidence and influencing or threatening witnesses. Accordingly, longer periods of detention than in other cases may be reasonable (see B\u0105k v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a7 56-57, 16 January 2007; Tomecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a047944/06, \u00a7 29, 20 May 2008; and Lukovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a046).",

In assessing whether the \u201cspecial diligence\u201d requirement has been met, the Court will have regard to, inter alia, the overall complexity of the proceedings, any periods of unjustified delay and the steps taken by the authorities to speed up proceedings to ensure that the overall length of detention remains \u201creasonable\u201d (see Suslov v.

In this respect the Court has previously acknowledged that if a period of liberty in between repeated remands in custody was negligible, it might not break the detention into separate periods (see Velichko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a019664/07, \u00a7\u00a080, 15\u00a0January 2013). Secondly, the applicant\u2019s release was terminated not by a new detention order but by an extension of an already existing detention order (see paragraph 33 above). The decision to release the applicant from detention never became final because it was revoked by a higher court on the grounds that the reasons for keeping him in detention persisted (contrast with Idalov, cited above, in which the applicant\u2019s release on bail was discontinued due to his failure to comply with bail conditions, and S\u00fcveges, also cited above, in which the applicant\u2019s house arrest was replaced by detention on remand ordered in connection with different criminal proceedings). Thus, at the domestic procedural level the applicant\u2019s detention was not broken into separate periods. Accordingly, the Court considers that, on the basis of the above elements, in must assess the applicant\u2019s detention as a single period.",

Having regard to the fact that the pre-trial investigation concerned multiple crimes allegedly committed by a criminal organisation and was thus of considerable complexity, the Court is of the view that the actions of the domestic authorities during that period could be considered as falling within the standard of special diligence under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.",

Bearing in mind that at the start of the court proceedings the applicant had already been detained for a year, the Court is not convinced that scheduling on average one hearing per month displayed sufficient diligence on the part of the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, \u010cevizovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Germany, no. 49746/99, \u00a7\u00a051, 29 July 2004, and El Khoury v.\u00a0Germany, nos.\u00a08824/09 and 42836/12, \u00a7 69, 9\u00a0July\u00a02015; compare and contrast Chraidi v.

The Court further notes that twenty-six of those hearings were adjourned, mainly because of the authorities\u2019 failure to ensure the presence of other co-accused or witnesses (see paragraphs 41-42 above; see also Malkov v. Estonia, no.\u00a031407/07, \u00a7 51, 4 February 2010, and Kobernik v. Ukraine, no.\u00a045947/06, \u00a7\u00a062, 25\u00a0July 2013; compare and contrast Shikuta v.

The authorities have not advanced any exceptional circumstances able to demonstrate otherwise, such as, for example, the need to collect evidence abroad or to request international legal assistance (compare and contrast \u0141aszkiewicz v. Poland, no.\u00a028481/03, \u00a7 61, 15\u00a0January 2008; Ereren v. Germany, no. 67522/09, \u00a7\u00a062, 6\u00a0November 2014; and Mer\u010dep, cited above, \u00a7 110). Furthermore, although the domestic courts acknowledged on several occasions that the period of the applicant\u2019s detention had been very long (see paragraphs 26, 33 and 37 above), it does not appear that any measures were taken to speed up the proceedings. The Court observes that hearings were adjourned mainly because of the absence of witnesses or co-accused (see paragraph\u00a079 above), and acknowledges that in certain situations that could be justified; however, in the present case the Court does not discern any attempts on the part of the domestic authorities to fix a tighter and more efficient hearing schedule in order to avoid the repeated adjournments (see, mutatis mutandis, Dzelili v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a065745/01, \u00a7\u00a080, 10\u00a0November 2005, and Baksza v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a059196/08, \u00a7 38, 23\u00a0April 2013).

One such criterion is capable of covering, like an umbrella, all sorts of factual situations, which may nevertheless involve important differences and which an individualised approach would require to be distinguished one from the other before concluding as to the congruity (or otherwise) of the facts with the law. A situation in which the facts of the case do not correspond to such a criterion, as formulated and applied in previous cases, can be perceived as not leaving the Court any option other than to apply the relevant imperatives in \u201cumbrella fashion\u201d and to find a violation of the relevant provision of the Convention. But the seemingly flawless plausibility of such a legal assessment of the factual situation may, in fact, prove to be illusory and ephemeral. This ostensible plausibility may prove to be plausibility at first sight, which (like love at first sight) can evaporate if and when one casts a second glance at the object of one\u2019s initial fascination. Indeed, the Court\u2019s case-law, which contains a multitude of diverse schemes and patterns for decision-making which can (or even have to) be followed to a greater or lesser extent in subsequent cases, is not unyielding to what would be, in essence, a purely formalistic application of the law of the Convention. However, that formalistic application would be disguised in the robes of strict observance of the Court\u2019s precedents, even if resorting to indiscriminate use of an \u201cumbrella\u201d criterion would amount at times to moving away from the direction of substantive justice.

States (at least most of them) should not be treated by the Court, or by anyone else, with greater suspicion than they actually deserve. And, for sure, they do not deserve to be treated with bias or prejudice, based on the belief that everything that the State in question is doing or has done with regard to an applicant who accuses it of a violation of his or her rights under the Convention is very likely to be tainted with disregard and lack of respect for those rights. In these sorts of disputes States may be proved to have wronged, but they may also be proved to have been right, and not so seldom in cases in which the other party\u2019s conduct, which was at the root of his or her troubles with that State, was the opposite of law-abiding. Presumption of the State\u2019s preconceived sin in each and every case, irrespective of what predicaments or difficulties the authorities might have encountered while sincerely attempting to comply with the imperatives of the Convention, is, to say the least, a very unreliable guide. Such a presumption is even more treacherous \u2013 and unjust to the State \u2013 if it is couched in terms of a seemingly objectivist legal criterion which the conduct of the authorities allegedly fails to satisfy.

For the majority, one (the first) period of the applicant\u2019s detention did not appear to be questionable in any way for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 78 of the judgment). This period expired when the applicant\u2019s case was transferred to the first-instance court for examination on the merits. The applicant was thus \u201cbrought promptly before a judge\u201d and, at that stage, was granted the possibility of what Article 5 \u00a7 3 explicitly requires: \u201ctrial within a reasonable time or release pending trial\u201d. The conjunction \u201cor\u201d in the second quote is of no small importance: the applicant had either to be released pending trial, or the length of his trial had not to exceed the standards of what, in the eyes of an objective observer, is \u201creasonable\u201d. According to the Court\u2019s standard of \u201creasonableness\u201d, that period had to be not \u201ctoo lengthy\u201d in the specific circumstances of the case. As to the hypothetical possibility of the applicant\u2019s release during that period, the majority did not doubt at all the findings of the domestic courts that \u201cduring the entire period under consideration there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged\u201d (see paragraph 75 of the judgment). Furthermore, the majority fully approved of the domestic courts\u2019 periodic evaluation, every three months, of the grounds for the applicant\u2019s continued detention, which it found to have been based not on any stereotype or pre-existing template but on the particular circumstances of the applicant\u2019s situation, to have been stated not in formalistic language or in abstracto, and to have been thorough in all other respects (see paragraphs 76 and 77 of the judgment).

Poland (no.\u00a028481/03, 15 January 2008), the applicant spent almost three years in pre-trial detention in Poland (in addition to over one year which she spent in prison in Sweden). The authorities claimed that the lengthy pre-trial detention of the applicant was justified by the reasonable suspicion against her, but also by the risk that she might tamper with the evidence since a number of suspects had remained at large, the fact that the investigation concerned a criminal gang involved in drug-trafficking on a significant scale, the severity of the penalty to which the applicant was liable, as well as the complexity of the investigation and the danger to society posed by drugtrafficking. The Court considered that \u201cthe need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources, including from abroad, and to determine the facts and degree of alleged responsibility of each of the co-suspects, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention during the period necessary to terminate the investigation\u201d (\u00a7 59).",

For the majority (which compared the instant case with \u0141aszkiewicz), the decisive element was that, in \u0141aszkiewicz, the drug-trafficking was a crossborder activity and thus required much more time to collect the evidence, whereas in the instant case it was \u201clocal\u201d, meaning presumably that all the evidence had to be lying somewhere within easy reach, waiting to be picked up by the investigators.

Croatia (no. 12301/12, 26 April 2016) the investigation also involved an \u201cinternational element\u201d, as \u201cthe investigating judge ... requested international legal assistance from the Serbian authorities in obtaining evidence from the witnesses\u201d (\u00a7 11). Does that in itself prove anything for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3? In my opinion, no less important than the \u201cinternational element\u201d (in the words of the Court, \u201cthe questioning of a number of witnesses; some of which through the international legal assistance in criminal matters\u201d (\u00a7 110)) was the fact that \u201cthe criminal case at issue was very complex, requiring the collection and examination of voluminous documentation and physical evidence, as well as the need to seek expert advice on matters of DNA analyses\u201d (ibid.). \u201cInternational element\u201d or no \u201cinternational element\u201d, what was crucial for the justification of the length of detention of the applicant in that case was the overall complexity of the case, but \u2013 and this should not be overlooked \u2013 also the fact that the applicant spent less than seventeen months in pre-trial detention (although he had not yet been sentenced when the case was examined by the Court). \u201cInternational\u201d is not a substitute for \u201ctruly complex\u201d, and \u201ctruly complex\u201d is not a synonym for \u201cinternational\u201d. It would be very far-fetched to claim that only something which is \u201cinternational\u201d can be \u201ctruly complex\u201d, or that what is \u201ctruly complex\u201d must necessarily be \u201cinternational\u201d. Putting the emphasis, however artificially, on the \u201cinternational element\u201d obscures other important elements of that case. But the presence of that \u201cinternational element\u201d appears to be a very convenient way of substantiating the finding that the applicant\u2019s detention in the instant case was unjustifiable.",

They should have also given at least some consideration to the five pages of the Government\u2019s observations containing a table in small font, in which each and every procedural step taken by the domestic court examining the applicant\u2019s case is thoroughly explained.

Did that break have to be ordered? If one follows the reasoning of the majority, then no. But I believe that the domestic court examining that particular criminal case knew better, especially in view of the fact that the questioning of some individual co-accused and witnesses took more than one day, as well as the fact that many of the other co-accused and witnesses were questioned not once, but at certain intervals, explaining at later hearings, among many other things, why their testimonies given during the pre-trial investigation and those given in court differed.",

Regarding this failure (acknowledged by the Government themselves), I can but agree with the majority, because the management of Luki\u0161k\u0117s remand prison is undoubtedly part of the authorities, with the result that its failure is the authorities\u2019 failure. The fact that the same hearing had to be adjourned anyway because of the illness of another of the co-accused, \u017d.T., is probably immaterial according to the methodology employed in this case, as is the possibility (I am merely speculating, of course) that the prison may have failed to bring A.F.

I do not think so. This is not fair, but not only that: it is factually incorrect. On numerous occasions when some of the co-accused did not appear at the hearing, the authorities did not remain passive but ordered searches in respect of them and imposed remand measures on them.

What would it be in reality, as distinct from on the paper on which the present judgment is printed, and especially in an eighty-two-volume case which involves over fifty suspects and countless witnesses, expert opinions and so forth? The majority would have been satisfied had the authorities brought, if necessary by coercion, all those involved in the applicant\u2019s case (and that of his co-accused) to one place for several months (because weeks would have not been enough) and had the first-instance court then examined this case day in, day out, nonstop. That \u201cone place\u201d would probably be some hotel, but a rather large one that could accommodate not only all those involved in the case, but also a platoon of doctors to see to it that no one fell ill for long. No, this utopia is not stated directly in the judgment itself, but there is no other way to read and implement the majority\u2019s schedule-tightening recommendation in a case of such magnitude. But could this display of \u201cspecial diligence\u201d have prevented the other co-accused, the witnesses, the lawyers or \u2013 again, God forbid! \u2013 the judge from falling ill?

The message sent by this lecturing judgment to the domestic authorities (and not only those in Lithuania) is as simple as this: \u201cYou could do better; you should have done better; you should have treated this case as a special one, regardless of anything.\u201d",

Even an attempt at such an exercise, in cases comparable in scope to this one, cannot be anything other than superficial. But this is exactly what the majority have done, while at the same time avoiding the appearance of superficiality by employing the \u201cumbrella\u201d approach, where the only relevant criterion (and the only relevant fact of the case) that is taken into account in finding a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 is that the criminal proceedings conducted against the applicant (as if there were no other co-accused or, rather, that they were, by some wave of the magician\u2019s wand, not connected to the applicant) were lengthy, and then mechanically attributing this length to a lack of \u201cspecial diligence\u201d on the part of the authorities.",

Why search for more? There is an entertaining story about a man who searched for his lost wallet not where he had lost it but under the street lamp, because it was brighter there.

And there was not a little to investigate (in several separate sets of criminal proceedings), as these activities allegedly included \u201cleading a criminal organisation armed with firearms and possession of a very large amount of narcotic and psychotropic substances with the intention to distribute them\u201d, as well as \u201cproduction of a counterfeit electronic means of payment; fraudulently acquiring another person\u2019s property; unauthorised possession of firearms, ammunition or explosives; destruction of or damage to other person\u2019s property; murder for personal gain; unlawful deprivation of liberty using violence; and violation of public order\u201d.",

This would be a truly Procrustean invention, but how simple it could make the examination of virtually all cases lodged under Article 5 \u00a7 3! If the period of detention is lengthier than the Court\u2019s yardstick (a certain maximum duration of detention on remand for suspects in criminal cases of different categories, which could be longer if an \u201cinternational element\u201d is involved), then a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 must be found, no matter what, because the detention was lengthy, and it could be lengthy for no other reason than the lack of \u201cspecial diligence\u201d on the part of the authorities (any other reason is excluded by this \u201cumbrella\u201d criterion).

Still, those who employ the yardstick of \u201cspecial diligence\u201d should ask, where was the \u201cspecial diligence\u201d with regard to these cases? Or any \u201cdiligence\u201d?

My answer is that criteria such as \u201cspecial diligence\u201d (and there are some others, no less obscure) are unreliable in the pursuit of justice, especially if they are perceived as some master-keys which allow a case to be examined and determined without looking a bit deeper into very important factual elements which do not fall under the chosen methodological \u201cumbrella\u201d.

But one might wonder when and where that mixture will explode with greater force, prompting (among others) those who are burdened with real difficulties in investigating the most serious crimes and/or charged with real tasks in determining the most complex criminal cases (or even some High Contracting Parties) to question the very legitimacy of what have been coined as seemingly universal (\u201cumbrella\u201d) doctrinal criteria to be applied in the Court\u2019s review of the compatibility of the length of domestic criminal proceedings with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3. After all, in this case the domestic authorities were dealing not with a petty theft, not with driving under the influence, not with a brawl in a pub or a slap in the face, but with organised crime on a very large scale. The domestic authorities held the applicant in detention on remand for as long as \u201cfour years, five months and seven days\u201d (as calculated by the majority in paragraph 37 of the judgment) until he was convicted in one of the greater number of (separate) criminal proceedings against him, after which his detention on remand in the instant case became unnecessary because it had been converted into nothing more than detention based on the prison sentence imposed on him by the court (in those separate proceedings). And it took this Court only three years to authoritatively establish that that period was unjustifiably long. Or, to put it more accurately, that period was too long according to the Court\u2019s formalistic \u201cumbrella\u201d doctrinal criterion called \u201cspecial diligence\u201d, which is undefined, imprecise, obscure \u2013 and yet steadily expanding in its scope of application \u2013 and which in the instant case has been invoked by the Court on its own initiative. This, alas, was prompted by the presumption of the State\u2019s preconceived sin with regard to the applicant, who in his turn is considered by the majority to have been, at that stage of his professional career, \u201cmore important\u201d than anyone else and who, in the majority\u2019s opinion, must have suffered \u201cdistress\u201d as a result of not being treated by the domestic authorities as someone whose \u201cimportance\u201d was so extraordinary.",
