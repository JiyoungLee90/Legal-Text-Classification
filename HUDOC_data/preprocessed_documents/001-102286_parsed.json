In June and July 2007 the district prosecutor's office interviewed the second and fourth applicants and another twenty residents of Valerik and issued a refusal to open a criminal case into the seizure of the video cassettes and the mobile phone by the abductors.

The women had allegedly also asked the investigator not to take any action in respect of the video cassettes. Some time later the investigator had typed up their statements on the computer. The applicants had read them and had signed them, without making any other submissions. The Government did not enclose A.Kh.'s statement.
