It was that court which had the authority to decide how to conduct the proceedings, in particular, which evidence to take and how to evaluate acts or omissions of the parties, while bearing in mind all procedural requirements guaranteed by Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. Moreover, the Court observes certain period of inactivity for which the Government provided no explanation (e.g. the first-instance court held no hearings between 12 August 1999 and 25 April 2000 or between 10 August 2000 and 5 June 2001; it took the second-instance court one and a half years to dismiss the plaintiffs' appeal on 9 March 2006).",
