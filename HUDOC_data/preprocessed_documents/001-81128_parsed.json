The applicant was thereby prevented from receiving the money he had legitimately expected to receive. There is, therefore, a causal link between the violations found and the applicant's claim for the pecuniary damage. At the same time the Court bears in mind the fact that the domestic court considered the applicant's claims as examined by the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Rostov-on-Don on 18 July 2005 to be the same as those examined by the Novocherkassk Town Court of the Rostov Region on 15 September 2004. It further recalls that following the judgment of 18 July 2005 the applicant received RUR 14,038.44.
