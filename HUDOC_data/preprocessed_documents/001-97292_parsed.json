The public prosecutor, who took part in the proceedings ex officio, argued that since the law specifically provided that no reasons were to be given for expulsion orders, the court was not competent to review the substantive lawfulness of the order, but only whether the procedure had been followed.",

On 7 May 2008 the  declared Mrs Raza\u2019s application inadmissible, because she was not directly affected by the order, but found Mr Raza\u2019s application admissible and wellfounded. It noted that the immigration authorities had sent three letters to the consular department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with requests for assistance in the process of securing a travel document for Mr Raza, but that no reply had been received. It went on to say that, in view of the difficulties in carrying out the expulsion, the authorities should have reconsidered whether or not Mr\u00a0Raza\u2019s detention continued to be justified. In situations where they had discretion, the authorities had to assess whether or not the impugned measures interfered disproportionately with the individual\u2019s rights and, whenever possible, opt for the option that was less onerous for the individual, in line with the principle of proportionality. The exercise of such discretion was subject to judicial review. Instead of keeping Mr Raza in custody, the authorities could have placed him under an obligation to report daily to his local police station. In choosing between those alternatives, they had to take account of the length of the detention. If it exceeded six months, it became an arbitrary deprivation of liberty, contrary to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention. The inordinate amount of time spent by Mr Raza in custody, owing to the lack of effective measures for his expulsion, had negated the lawfulness of his deprivation of liberty. As the authorities had not taken those matters into account, they had made an unlawful decision. The court therefore quashed the refusal to release Mr\u00a0Raza and instructed the authorities to reconsider the matter in line with its reasoning.",

It reached that conclusion for two main reasons. First, the courts allowed the executive to stretch the notion of national security beyond its natural meaning. Secondly, the courts did not examine whether the executive was able to demonstrate the existence of specific facts serving as a basis for its assessments that the applicant presented a national security risk, and instead rested their rulings solely on uncorroborated averments of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. On that basis, the Court found that the interference with the applicants\u2019 family life was not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d (see C.G. and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 1365/07, \u00a7\u00a7 4247 and 49, 24 April 2008).",

The applicants were unable to support those allegations with proof, as the domestic proceedings were classified and they were not allowed to make copies of the documents in the case file (see paragraph 25 above). In these circumstances, and considering that the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s reasoning was crucial for the determination of the point raised by the applicants, on 10 September 2009 the Court asked the Government to produce a copy of that court\u2019s judgment of 17 January 2008 and to specify what materials that court had had before it when making that judgment. In as much as the domestic proceedings were classified, the Government\u2019s attention was drawn to the possibility, under Rule\u00a033 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, to request that public access to the documents they were asked to provide be restricted (see Imakayeva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7615/02, \u00a7 123, ECHR 2006XIII (extracts)).

Accordingly, and in application of Rule 44C \u00a7 1 of its Rules, the Court finds that it can draw inferences from the Government\u2019s conduct in that respect (ibid., \u00a7 139; see also Nevmerzhitsky v.

It may therefore sometimes be necessary to classify some or all of the materials used in proceedings touching upon such matters and even parts of the decisions rendered in them (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7\u00a7 205, 209, 210 and 215, ECHR 2009...). However, the complete concealment from the public of the entirety of a judicial decision in such proceedings cannot be regarded as warranted. The publicity of judicial decisions aims to ensure scrutiny of the judiciary by the public and constitutes a basic safeguard against arbitrariness. Indeed, even in indisputable national security cases, such as those relating to terrorist activities, the authorities of countries which have already suffered and are currently at risk of terrorist attacks have chosen to keep secret only those parts of their decisions whose disclosure would compromise national security or the safety of others (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 2969, 93 and 215), thus illustrating that there exist techniques which can accommodate legitimate security concerns without fully negating fundamental procedural guarantees such as the publicity of judicial decisions. Moreover, in the absence of information about the facts under consideration before the national courts and the manner in which they examined the case, the Court is not persuaded that it concerned genuine national security issues. Indeed, the only known allegation against Mr Raza was that \u201cthere existed information that [he] had been involved in human trafficking\u201d (see paragraph 17 above). Failing further particulars about the threat to national security which the applicant allegedly posed, the Court is bound to conclude that the situation was identical to that in C.G. and Others, where the Bulgarian authorities had stretched the \u2013 admittedly wide \u2013 notion of national security beyond its natural meaning (see C.G. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 43).",

As noted above, despite a specific question the Government did not disclose what materials that court had had before it when making its judgment. The Court therefore concludes, on the basis of its inference (see paragraph 52 above), that the Supreme Administrative Court did not have access to the full facts grounding the authorities\u2019 assertion that Mr Raza presented a national security risk, which prevented it from conducting a meaningful examination of the case. It is moreover questionable \u2013 and by not presenting the requested information the Government failed to dispel the doubts in that respect \u2013 whether that court considered itself competent to carry out a proper examination of that assertion, given that in C.G. and Others it had confined itself to a purely formal review of an identical expulsion decision and had rested its ruling solely on uncorroborated information tendered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (see C.G. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 47, and Lupsa v. , no. 10337/04, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2006VII).",

However, any deprivation of liberty under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) will be justified only for as long as deportation proceedings are in progress.

It is true that the Bulgarian authorities could not compel the issuing of such document, but there is no indication that they pursued the matter vigorously or endeavoured entering into negotiations with the Pakistani authorities with a view to expediting its delivery (see, mutatis mutandis, A. and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0167). Indeed, both the Sofia City Court and the , which examined that point in detail, specifically found that the authorities were not doing enough in that respect (see paragraphs 26 and 28 above).

However, Mr Chahal\u2019s deportation was blocked, throughout the entire period under consideration, by the fact that proceedings were being actively and diligently pursued with a view to determining whether it would be lawful and compatible with the Convention to proceed with his deportation (see Chahal, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 11517, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Eid v. Italy (dec.), no. 53490/99, 22 January 2002, and Bogdanovski v. Italy, no.\u00a072177/01, \u00a7\u00a7 6064, 14 December 2006). By contrast, the delay in the present case was not at all due to the need to wait for the courts to determine the legal challenge brought by Mr Raza against his deportation. Indeed, his request for a stay of the enforcement of the expulsion order was denied as early as 7 December 2006 (see paragraph 19 above), and the Government conceded that the only reason for the delay was the failure to secure the necessary travel documents from the Pakistani authorities (see paragraph 68 above). It should also be observed that after his release on 15 July 2008 Mr\u00a0Raza was placed under an obligation to report to his local police station at regular intervals (see paragraph 14 above). This shows that the authorities had at their disposal measures other than the applicant\u2019s protracted detention to secure the enforcement of the order for his expulsion. Lastly, the Court notes that after the events in issue in the present case Bulgarian law was changed, in line with the recent European Union Directive 2008/115/EC on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying thirdcountry nationals, and now provides that in situations akin to Mr Raza\u2019s, where deportation is blocked by the failure of a third country to deliver the necessary travel documents, detention cannot exceed eighteen months (see paragraphs 36 and 40 above).

That said, the Court considers that its finding regarding Article 8 of itself amounts to adequate just satisfaction for the purposes of Article 41 (see Beldjoudi v. France, 26\u00a0March 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 84 and 86, Series A no. 234A, and, mutatis mutandis, Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, \u00a7\u00a7 126 and 127, Series A no.\u00a0161, and Chahal, cited above, \u00a7 158). The same goes for the Court\u2019s related finding regarding Article 13 (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v.\u00a0, no. 25389/05, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2007V). Conversely, the Court considers that the distress and frustration suffered by Mr Raza as a result of his detention and the impossibility of obtaining speedy judicial review thereof cannot wholly be compensated by the finding of violation (see Quinn v. France, 22 March 1995, \u00a7 64, Series A no. 311, and Gavril Yosifov v. Bulgaria, no. 74012/01, \u00a7 72, 6 November 2008). Having regard to the awards made in similar cases, and ruling on an equitable basis, as required under Article 41, the Court decides to award Mr Raza EUR 5,500, plus any tax that may be chargeable.",
