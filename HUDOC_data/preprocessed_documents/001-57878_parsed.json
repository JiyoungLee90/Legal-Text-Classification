In his view, 65% of the total investment was referable to cow stands in the new shed for heifers, of which 90% replaced similar stands in the old shed that were now to be used for milch cows and cows in calf; the sum relating to the relevant increase was therefore NLG 125,882.",

The President did not find it necessary to address the question of the increase in the number of stands for milch cows and cows in calf, since he accepted the Minister\u2019s alternative argument concerning the applicant\u2019s investment. He rejected the applicant\u2019s submission that the Minister was estopped from relying on that ground, holding that section 51 of the 1954 Industrial Appeals Act (Wet administratieve rechtspraak bedrijfsorganisatie, Staatsblad (Official Bulletin) 1954, 416, as amended - \"the 1954 Act\") entitled him to supplement his arguments while the applicant had not only had sufficient possibility of replying to the Minister\u2019s alternative submission but had in fact done so.

Starting from the figure which he gave before the President - NLG 215,183.22 (see paragraph 16 above) - he calculated a price per square metre of NLG 240. On that basis he arrived at a figure of NLG 125,882 for the investment referable to the increase in the number of cow stands for milch cows and cows in calf in the existing cowshed. In the alternative, if the Minister\u2019s calculations were to be followed, he submitted that the Minister had based them on incorrect premises; if applied correctly, the Minister\u2019s method resulted in a figure referable to the extension of stands for milch cows and cows in calf of NLG 91,200, which was sufficient since the applicant had carried out the physical work involved in building the new cowshed himself (see paragraph 27 below).",

The rejection by the Director of Agriculture and Food Supply of the applicant\u2019s initial request for a larger reference quantity of milk was based on the consideration that he had failed to show \"that it had always been his intention to increase the number of stands for milch cows\"; the Minister\u2019s dismissal of his objection was grounded on an alleged insufficient increase in the number of cow stands for milch cows and cows in calf. Before the Tribunal, however, the Minister had based his case on the allegation that his investments had fallen short of the figure required. Accordingly there was a violation of the principle of \"equality of arms\" enshrined in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.",

Furthermore, the complaint does not take into account the fact that, although in the proceedings before the Industrial Appeals Tribunal the Minister, making use of the opportunity afforded him under section 51, did indeed base his case on new arguments which differed from those on which he had founded his original refusal of the applicant\u2019s request, the applicant was allowed to submit, inter alia, a report by his accountant as well as counter-arguments.
