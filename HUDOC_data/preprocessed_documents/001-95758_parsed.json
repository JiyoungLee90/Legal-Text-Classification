In both cases the Court found, by reference to Anagnostopoulos v. Greece (no. 54589/00, 3\u00a0April 2003), that the applicants had not enjoyed effective access to a court and that this could not be cured by the possibility of bringing fresh claims in the civil courts (see Atanasova v.

It reiterates that where the domestic legal order provides litigants with an avenue of redress, such as a civilparty claim in the context of criminal proceedings, the State is under an obligation to ensure that they enjoy the fundamental guarantees laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1. Thus, in the Court's view, the applicant could not be expected to wait for the extinction of the criminal liability of the alleged perpetrator of the offence of which his son was the victim, many years after making his original civilparty claim and even longer after the impugned events, to bring a fresh claim before the civil courts (see Atanasova, \u00a7 46, and Dinchev, \u00a7 50, both cited above). This conclusion is not altered by the fact he could have opted to bring a separate civil claim from the outset (see paragraph 28 above). His preference for seeking damages in the context of criminal proceedings does not appear unjustified in the circumstances. Having chosen this remedy, he was entitled to have his claim determined and not required to try the alternative avenue of redress available under Bulgarian law (see Dinchev, cited above, \u00a7 51).",
