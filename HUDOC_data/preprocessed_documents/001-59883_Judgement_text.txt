The case originated in an application (no. 48672/99) against the Slovak Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by eight Slovakian nationals, MM Jaroslav Nemec, Vladimír Rak, Ľudovít Kalina, Pavol Štefanka, Jozef Horváth, Vladimír Jorík, Ján Kučera and Pavol Plesník (“the applicants”), on 1 March 1999.
The Slovakian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Vršanský.
The applicants alleged that the length of the proceedings concerning their copyright action was excessive.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 18 January 2001, the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The parties replied in writing to each other’s observations.
On 27 July 1990 the applicants lodged a copyright action with the Bratislava III District Court (then Obvodný súd, at present Okresný súd). They claimed 10,750,000 Slovak korunas on the ground that a software created by them had been sold to a third person.
On 27 November 1991 the District Court decided that an expert opinion be submitted. It appointed an expert on 30 May 1992. Subsequently the expert informed the court that he was unable to submit an opinion.
On 6 November 1992 the District Court appointed a different expert. On 21 December 1992 the latter informed the court that he was not qualified in the area concerned.
On 17 May 1993 the applicants proposed an expert whom the District Court appointed on 15 June 1993. At the expert’s request an ad hoc software expert was appointed as well. The ad hoc expert was sworn in on 20 January 1994. The expert opinion was submitted on 22 September 1994.
On 2 December 1993 the president of the Bratislava City Court (Mestský súd) admitted that the District Court had not proceeded effectively with the case after 4 August 1993.
On 31 August 1994 the Bratislava City Court upheld the first instance decision on an advance payment of the experts’ fees. The case file was returned to the District Court on 7 October 1994.
On 5 December 1994 the District Court delivered an interim judgment in which it found, with reference to the expert opinion, that the software in question was covered by copyright.
On 13 February 1995 one of the defendants requested that the interim judgment be amended. The request was dismissed on 6 December 1995. On 18 January 1996 the defendant appealed. The case-file was transmitted to the Bratislava City Court on 29 March 1996. The City Court upheld the first instance judgment on 13 June 1996. The City Court’s judgment was served on 26 August 1996.
Subsequently the case was allocated to another judge in the context of restructuring of the Bratislava III District Court.
At a hearing held on 2 July 1997 the applicants withdrew their claim against one of the defendants who had gone bankrupt.
On 16 July and on 5 August 1997 the parties submitted further documents at the District Court’s request.
The next hearing was held on 3 June 1998. The case was adjourned with a view to obtaining further evidence.
On 9 June 1998 the District Court ordered a document to be translated from German. The translation was submitted on 23 June 1998.  A hearing scheduled for 9 September 1998 had to be adjourned as the judge was ill. On 21 October 1998 the District Court adjourned the case as it was necessary to obtain an expert opinion on the value of the software. On 18 January 1999 the court requested the parties for assistance in finding a suitable expert.
On 3 February 1999 the applicants claimed that an expert opinion was not necessary and requested that the relevant decision be quashed.
On 18 August 1999 the District Court appointed an expert. On 27 August 1999 the applicants challenged both the expert and the judge dealing with the case. They also appealed against the decision ordering them to pay an advance on the expert’s fees.
On 17 November 1999 the case file was submitted to the Bratislava Regional Court (Krajský súd) which dismissed the request for exclusion of the District Court judge on 30 November 1999. The case file was returned to the Bratislava III District Court on 8 December 1999.
On 21 February 2000 the case file was again sent to the Bratislava Regional Court for a decision on the applicants’ above appeal of 27 August 1999. The Regional Court returned the case file to the District Court on 10 July 2000 after having decided on the applicants’ appeal on 30 June 2000.
On 13 July 2000 the expert was invited to comment on the applicants’ objections to his person.
On 4 August 2000 the vice-president of the Bratislava III District Court informed the applicants, in reply to their complaints, that she had found no undue delays in the proceedings. She expressed the view that the length of the proceedings was mainly due to the complex character of the case.
On 21 September 2000 the applicants submitted another objection as regards the expert. The defendant commented on the applicants’ objection on 4 October 2000.
On 27 October 2000 the Bratislava III District Court asked an expert for opinion. On 26 February 2001 the expert was requested to submit the opinion without delay.
