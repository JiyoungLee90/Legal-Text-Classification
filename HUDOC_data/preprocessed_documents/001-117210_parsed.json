Latvia, no. 4672/02, \u00a7 60, 2 December 2004). In the particular circumstances of the present case, however, the Court does not find any reason to condemn the system which was put in place by the authorities to secure the adequate and necessary aid to the applicant (see Turzy\u0144ski v.

It is to be noted that the applicant\u2019s access to a shower room was by far more frequent than that of an ordinary prisoner and sufficient for him to keep clean, including, after going to the toilet.

Moreover, there is no evidence in this case of any incident or positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant. The Court holds, therefore, that even though a prisoner with amputated forearms is more vulnerable to the hardships of detention, the treatment of the applicant in the circumstances of the present case did not reach the threshold of severity required to constitute degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see contrary to, Price, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 28-30, Engel v. , no. 46857/06, \u00a7\u00a7 27 and 30, 20 May 2010 and Vincent v. , no. 6253/03, \u00a7 94-103, 24 October 2006).

We note that the applicant formulated two complaints under Article 3. The first concerned his disability and special needs since he was unable to carry out many of his daily or routine tasks and had to seek help from his fellow inmates. Secondly, he complained about the protracted process of providing him with forearm prostheses (see paragraphs 92-93 of the judgment). We can accept that the authorities assisted the applicant and obtained the necessary prostheses after some delay (see paragraphs 124-125). However, we do not agree with the majority view that the arrangements put in place by the prison authorities to assist the applicant in attending to his daily needs were both adequate and made in time to avoid a lasting situation of questionable compatibility with the requirements of Article 3 (compare and contrast with Todorov v.\u00a0Bulgaria (dec.), no. 8321/11, 12 February 2013).",

More generally, the Court has stated as follows: \u201c[Article\u00a03] nonetheless imposes an obligation on the State to protect the physical well-being of persons deprived of their liberty, for example by providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see Hurtado v.\u00a0Switzerland, 28 January 1994, Series A no. 280A, opinion of the Commission, pp. 15-16, \u00a7 79). The Court has also emphasised the right of all prisoners to conditions of detention which are compatible with human dignity, so as to ensure that the manner and method of execution of the measures imposed do not subject them to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention; in addition, besides the health of prisoners, their well-being also has to be adequately secured, given the practical demands of imprisonment (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 94)\u201d (see Mouisel v. , no. 67263/01, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2002IX). In the case of Farbtuhs v. Latvia (no. 4672/02, 2\u00a0December 2004), the Court noted that the prison authorities had permitted the family members to stay with the detainee for twenty-four hours at a time and that this took place on a regular basis. In addition to the family taking care of the applicant, who had a physical disability, he was assisted during working hours by the medical personnel and outside working hours was helped by his co-detainees on a voluntary basis. In that case, the Court found that such a solution was not acceptable. The Court stated that it doubted \u201cthe appropriateness of such a solution, leaving as it did the bulk of responsibility for a man with such a severe disability in the hands of unqualified prisoners, even if only for a limited period. It is true that the applicant did not report having suffered any incident or particular difficulty as a result of the impugned situation; he merely stated that the prisoners in question sometimes \u2018refused to cooperate\u2019, without mentioning any specific case in which they had refused. However, the anxiety and unease which such a severely disabled person could be expected to feel, knowing that he would receive no professional assistance in the event of an emergency, in themselves raise a serious issue from the standpoint of Article 3 of the Convention\u201d (see Farbtuhs v. , no. 4672/02, \u00a7 60, 2 December 2004).",

We would stress again that, according to medical experts, the condition of the applicant in the present case required permanent assistance. The fact that the applicant had to rely on fellow inmates for assistance in meeting his daily personal needs in itself raises an issue as to whether the manner and method of execution of the punishment measures were appropriate to his disabled condition or subjected him to further distress, hardship or humiliation of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention. In our view this issue was insufficiently examined.",
