While the mere absence of a fixed residence does not give rise to a danger of flight (Sulaoja v. , no.\u00a055939/00, \u00a7\u00a064, 15\u00a0February 2005), this element, combined with the placement on the wanted list, could support the existence of a risk of absconding at the initial stages of the investigation. However, the danger of flight necessarily decreases with the passage of time spent in detention (Neumeister v. Austria, judgment of \n27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, p. 39, \u00a7\u00a010). The Court considers that, although these grounds might be relevant and sufficient at initial stages of investigation, the mere reiteration thereof at later stages of investigation without scrupulous examination of evolving circumstances could not be sufficient to justify the applicant's continued detention (Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a069-71, ECHR 2003IX (extracts)). In particular, in their decisions to remand the applicant, the domestic authorities did not address specific grounds for release put forward in the applicant's applications for release, such as her state of health and two dependant children, and failed to consider any alternative preventive measures.",
