That situation could not be rectified through judicial review proceedings. The reason for that was the courts\u2019 finding that they could not review the manner in which the police authorities had exercised their discretion in assessing the necessity of imposing the ban (see paragraph 9 above). Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual\u2019s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the circumstances (see Nalbantski, Sarkizov and Others and Dimitar Ivanov, all cited above).",
