In the first place, the interest of the economic well-being of the country carried more weight in the instant case in view of the fact that the applicant had been in receipt of welfare benefits on expiry of the one year period which he had been granted to find employment. Furthermore, the applicant had only irregularly made financial contributions to the care and upbringing of his son.

In its judgment, the Hague Regional Court referred to the decision whereby the applicant's request for the establishment of a formal access arrangement had been refused, but the stipulation of the Utrecht Regional Court that the existing contacts between the applicant and his son should continue was apparently not taken into consideration. Moreover, at that time, the applicant's appeal in the case pertaining to an access arrangement was pending before the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, before which court a hearing had taken place on 19 April 1995 (see paragraphs 21-23 above).",

Recognising that the applicant was in principle entitled to access to his son, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal ordered on 1\u00a0June\u00a01995 that supervised trial meetings were to be organised by the Child Care and Protection Board in order to clarify the applicant's position vis-\u00e0-vis his son. This did not, however, prevent the Netherlands authorities from taking the applicant into detention on 31 October 1995 with a view to his expulsion without any such trial meeting having taken place (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above). The Court, like the Commission, observes that the delay in organising these trial meetings, which was due to the workload of the Child Care and Protection Board, can in no way be attributed to the applicant who in fact attempted to have matters expedited by requesting that an organisation other than that Board be appointed to make the necessary arrangements (see paragraph 26 above).

It can, moreover, hardly be in doubt that when the applicant eventually obtained a visa to return to the Netherlands for three months in 1999, the mere passage of time had resulted in a de facto determination of the proceedings for access which he then instituted (see the W. v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, p. 29, \u00a7 65).

The Court further observes that the access proceedings commenced in January 1999 are causally linked to the applicant's family rights and it therefore considers that costs of interpretation incurred in those proceedings qualify for compensation in the present context, as do the costs incurred in this respect in the proceedings before the Commission and the Court. In respect of this claim, therefore, the Court awards the applicant the sum of NLG 4,352.50.",
