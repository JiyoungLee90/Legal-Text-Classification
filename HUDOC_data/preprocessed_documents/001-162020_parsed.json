However, he neither filed such a request nor explained why he had failed to do so. Furthermore, the Court notes that even though Mr Shutov was notified promptly in advance of the upcoming hearing and had ample opportunity to submit his request already after filing the statement of appeal, his lawyer lodged his request on the day when the appellate court started examining the applicants\u2019 case and provided no reasons as to why it was belated (see paragraph 50 above). In this regard, the Court also notes that unlike Mr Shutov, Mr Dodonov, for example, filed his request for participation in the appeal hearing well in advance of the hearing and that the appellate court granted it (see paragraph 51 above). In these circumstances, and given that Mr Shutov was also represented by three lawyers on appeal (see paragraph 50 above), the Court considers that Mr\u00a0Shutov\u2019s complaint about his absence from the appeal hearing is manifestly ill-founded and rejects it under Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

Russian was the only language of instruction during his studies. Furthermore, Mr Gimranov had a professional long-term career in the Russian army and drafted various procedural documents in Russian in the course of the criminal proceedings against him. The Court therefore concludes that Mr Gimranov was fluent in Russian and did not require the assistance of an interpreter during the examination of his case.
