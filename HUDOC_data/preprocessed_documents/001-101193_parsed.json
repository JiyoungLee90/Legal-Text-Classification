While the Court is not in a position to assess the need for such repeated assignments, it recalls that they were necessitated by the defects and inconsistencies of the investigative actions, as well as the significant lapse of time that invalidated their results. The Court also observes that on two occasions the hearings had to be adjourned due to the failure of the State medical institution to promptly return the case file to the trial court, and on one occasion due to the authorities\u2019 failure to deliver the applicant\u2019s detained co-defendant to the trial.
