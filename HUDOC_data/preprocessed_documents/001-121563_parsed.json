Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention, the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v.

Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are actual indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty laid down in Article 5 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 110 et seq.).",

All these factors can justify a relatively long period of detention. However, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure (see Osuch v. Poland, no. 31246/02, \u00a7\u00a026, 14 November 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-38, 4\u00a0May 2006). The fact that a person is charged with acting in a criminal conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of detention; his personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account. There is no indication in the present case that the domestic courts had in any way checked whether the applicant had indeed made any attempts to intimidate witnesses or to obstruct the course of the proceedings in any other way. In such circumstances the Court has difficulty accepting the argument that there was a risk of interference with the administration of justice. Furthermore, such a risk was bound to decrease gradually as the trial proceeded and the witnesses were interviewed (compare Miszkurka v.\u00a0Poland, no. 39437/03, \u00a7 51, 4 May 2006) The Court is not therefore persuaded that, throughout the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention, compelling reasons existed for a fear that he would interfere with witnesses or otherwise hamper the examination of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh the applicant\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

Nevertheless, at no point during the three years and seven and a half months that the applicant was awaiting determination of the criminal charges against him did the courts\u2019 reasoning evolve to the point where it sought to check whether that risk still persisted or whether it could be avoided by bail or other alternatives.",

The Court observes that the domestic authorities failed to provide any clarification as to which of the acts the applicant was likely to commit amounted to interference with justice. When reasoning that he should be detained pending trial to minimise that risk, the courts did not refer to any matters which had allowed them to draw such an inference. There is nothing in the materials in the Court\u2019s possession to indicate that the applicant had ever tried, in particular, to put any pressure on witnesses during either the pre-trial investigation or the trial. In any event, it appears that the domestic authorities had sufficient time to take statements from witnesses in a manner which could have excluded any doubt as to their veracity and would have eliminated the necessity to continue the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty on that ground (see, for similar reasoning, Solovyev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 2708/02, \u00a7 115, 24 May 2007).
