They had lodged their appeal on points of law three days later, and could therefore not maintain that, not having been served in person with a copy of the arrest warrant, they were not obliged to comply with it.

France judgment of 23 November 1993, Series A no. 277-A, p. 15, \u00a7 38). This principle was applicable in the Gu\u00e9rin case because a day after delivery of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment the applicant was admitted to a psychiatric institution. Consequently the applicant was objectively not at all in a position to comply with the court order. Declaring his appeal inadmissible on the ground that the applicant had not surrendered to custody \u2013 which under the circumstances was objectively impossible for him \u2013 genuinely restricted the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court.",

In this case it was entirely foreseeable that the applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law against the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment would be declared inadmissible simply because they deliberately avoided complying with the warrants for their arrest. On this point I fully share the view of Judges Ryssdal, Sir\u00a0John\u00a0Freeland and Lopes Rocha in the Poitrimol judgment according to which \u201chad [the applicant] surrendered to the warrant for his arrest, the grounds on which his appeal to the Court of Cassation was dismissed would not have existed.
