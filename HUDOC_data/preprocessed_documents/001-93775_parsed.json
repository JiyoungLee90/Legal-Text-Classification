The lower courts\u2019 decisions affected the whole organisation of the judicial system and the separation of powers within it. Our Court recognises that the rules of jurisdiction were clarified in 2002: disputes concerning the registration of non-profit organisations fall outside the competence of the commercial courts. To a certain extent the initiative by the Vice President of the  anticipated this clarification. With all due respect to the opinion of our colleagues, we do not agree that \u201cthe judgment was quashed primarily for the sake of legal purism, rather than in order to rectify an error of fundamental importance to the judicial system\u201d (see paragraph 38). On this occasion we regret that the respondent State opposed the relinquishment of the case to the Grand Chamber, where the concept of \u201cfundamental error\u201d could have been clarified further.",

We would also point out that the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation found that, although the provisions challenged did not establish any time-limits for bringing an extraordinary appeal, the time within which the appeal was brought in the applicant\u2019s case had not exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d and the applicant\u2019s rights had not been breached by it (see paragraph 14).
