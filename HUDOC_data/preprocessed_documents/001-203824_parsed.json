(\u201cthe building\u201d) formerly used for village festivities (Cas\u0103 de cultur\u0103). The reason for the sale was the high degree of deterioration of the building and the lack of resources available to restore it. The building had been partially destroyed by fire, lacked windows and doors, the roof was damaged and it had no working electricity or heating and no water supply. For the purpose of the sale, the local council decided to change the use of the building from that of a building with a social-cultural purpose to a simple building. An auction was organised, but since nobody showed an interest in participating, the local council decided to sell the building directly to any interested person, a possibility provided for by law in such situations. Following direct negotiations with the applicant, it was agreed to sell the building to her for the price of 49,000\u00a0Moldovan lei (the equivalent of some 3,474 euros (EUR).",

It reiterates that under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Serbia (preliminary objection) [GC], nos. 17153/11 and 29 others, \u00a7 71, 25\u00a0March 2014). The burden of proof is on the Government to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to show that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (Manic v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 46600/11, \u00a7 80, 13 January 2015).",

Indeed, according to Article 296 of the Civil Code such buildings as the one purchased by the applicant are part of the private domain unless otherwise specified by law. Since there was no law which included the building in the public domain, the conclusion of the domestic courts to the effect that the building was part of the public domain was wrong and contrary to Article 296 of the Civil Code.

The court of first instance rejected that action twice after finding, inter alia, that it had been lodged out of time (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above).

Moreover, the contract was registered by a public notary and the applicant\u2019s title was registered by the cadastral authority (see paragraph 6 above).

The Court reiterates that mistakes or errors of the State authorities should serve to the benefit of the persons affected, especially where no other conflicting private interest is at stake. In other words, the risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Gashi v.
