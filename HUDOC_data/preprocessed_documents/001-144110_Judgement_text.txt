The case originated in an application (no. 758/11) against the Republic of Finland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Finnish national, Mr Väinö Rainer Häkkä (“the applicant”), on 22 December 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr Heikki Uotila, a lawyer practising in Helsinki. The Finnish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
The applicant complained under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention about double jeopardy (ne bis in idem) involving a taxation procedure in which a tax surcharge had been imposed, and criminal proceedings for aggravated tax fraud.
On 18 June 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Helsinki.
The tax inspector conducted a tax inspection in three different companies in 2006 and 2007.
On 26 March 2007, concerning the first company, the tax authorities considered that the applicant had received, in 2004, 175,433.07 euros (EUR) and in 2005, EUR 10,351.79 as disguised dividends. They imposed on the applicant an additional tax and tax surcharges (veronkorotus, skatteförhöjning), amounting to EUR 8,100 in respect of the tax year 2004 and to EUR 510 in respect of the tax year 2005.
On 2 May 2007 the tax authorities found in respect of the second company that the applicant had received in 2004 EUR 78,690 as disguised dividends and imposed EUR 3,900 as tax surcharges. Moreover, the applicant had received in 2005 EUR 86,936 as disguised dividends and EUR 4,300 were imposed as tax surcharges.
On 11 November 2007 the tax authorities considered that the applicant had received, in respect of the third company, EUR 227,994 as disguised dividends in 2005 for which a tax surcharge of EUR 11,000 was made.
The applicant apparently did not seek rectification of any of these decisions. Nor were there any appeal proceedings pending. The time-limits for seeking rectification and lodging an appeal ran until 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2011 respectively.
On 3 April 2008 the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant on, inter alia, four counts of aggravated tax fraud (törkeä veropetos, grovt skattebedrägeri) and one count of tax fraud (veropetos, skattebedrägeri) concerning the tax years 2004 and 2005. According to the last count, the applicant was accused of aggravated tax fraud as he had under-declared his income. The undeclared income amounted to EUR 240,953 for the tax year 2004 and EUR 318,676 for the tax year 2005. Consequently, the tax imposed in 2004 had been EUR 108,851 too low and in 2005 EUR 117,036 too low. The tax imposed on the applicant had thus been in total EUR 225,887 too low.
On 27 June 2008 the Helsinki District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) convicted the applicant as charged and imposed a prison sentence of 2 years and 7 months. He was ordered to pay the taxation authority EUR 225,887 plus interest in respect of the last count.
By letter dated 18 August 2008 the applicant appealed to the Appeal Court (hovioikeus, hovrätten), requesting that the charges be dismissed or at least, as far as aggravated tax fraud was concerned, that he be convicted of tax fraud. He also requested that the sentence be mitigated.
On 12 February 2010 the Helsinki Appeal Court upheld the District Court judgment.
By letter dated 8 April 2010 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen) requesting, inter alia, that as concerned the last count of aggravated tax fraud, the charges be dismissed without examining the merits and that the compensation for damages be rejected. He claimed that in this respect the ne bis in idem principle had been violated as tax surcharges had already been imposed for the same acts. That count concerned at the earliest the tax year 2004, in respect of which the time-limit for an appeal in the taxation proceedings was still running until 30 December 2010, meaning that those proceedings had not yet been finalised. An effective use of the ne bis in idem principle would require a lis pendens effect preventing the pressing of charges if an administrative tax surcharge matter was still pending. Otherwise two separate sets of proceedings concerning the same facts could be pending. Moreover, applicants would be treated unequally if the possibility of pressing charges depended on the finality of the taxation proceedings.
On 23 April 2010 the applicant was granted leave to appeal as far as the last count was concerned.
On 29 June 2010 the Supreme Court upheld the Appeal Court judgment. It found, after a detailed analysis of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention and the Court’s case-law, that it was clear since the Jussila judgment that the imposition of a tax surcharge rendered the case criminal and that the ne bis in idem principle applied to such a case even though, under the domestic law, it fell within the domain of administrative law. Both the taxation and the criminal proceedings concerned the same facts, namely the failure to declare the same income. For the ne bis in idem principle it was relevant whether the proceedings had become final. The principle did not prohibit a situation in which two sets of proceedings concerning the same matter were pending at the same time. There was thus no lis pendens effect attached to this principle. Even if this lack of lis pendens effect was problematic in the sense that it might result in unequal treatment of applicants due to the fact that the point of time when taxation decisions became final varied, its acceptance might create even more profound problems. As the taxation decisions in the present case concerned the tax years 2004 and 2005, the time-limits for seeking rectification ran until 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2011 respectively. The charges had been pressed on 3 April 2008. The taxation proceedings had thus not become final before the criminal proceedings started. Therefore, there were no impediments to examining the charge concerning aggravated tax fraud. This judgment became a published leading case KKO:2010:46.
Section 57, subsection 1, of the Tax Assessment Procedure Act (laki verotusmenettelystä, lagen om beskattningsförfarande, Act no. 1558/1995, as amended by Act no. 1079/2005) provides that if a person has failed to make the required tax returns or has given incomplete, misleading or false information to taxation authorities and tax has therefore been incompletely or partially levied, the taxpayer shall be ordered to pay unpaid taxes together with an additional tax and a tax surcharge.
According to section 64 of the same Act (as in force at the relevant time a taxpayer can seek rectification of a tax decision within five years counted from the beginning of the calendar year following the year when the initial taxation decision was made. The time-limit is always at least sixty days from the serving of the decision to the taxpayer. Appeal against a rectification decision lies to an administrative court within the same fiveyear time-limit or at least within sixty days from the serving of the rectification decision to the taxpayer.
According to Chapter 29, sections 1 and 2, of the Penal Code (rikoslaki, strafflagen; as amended by Acts no. 1228/1997 and no. 769/1990), a person who (1) gives a taxation authority false information on a fact that influences the assessment of tax, (2) files a tax return concealing a fact that influences the assessment of tax, (3) for the purpose of avoiding tax, fails to observe a duty pertaining to taxation, influencing the assessment of tax, or (4) acts otherwise fraudulently and thereby causes or attempts to cause a tax not to be assessed, or too low a tax to be assessed or a tax to be unduly refunded, shall be sentenced for tax fraud to a fine or to imprisonment for a period of up to two years.
If by the tax fraud (1) considerable financial benefit is sought or (2) the offence is committed in a particularly methodical manner and the tax fraud is aggravated when assessed as a whole, the offender shall be sentenced for aggravated tax fraud to imprisonment for a period between four months and four years.
On 20 September 2012 the Supreme Court issued another judgment (KKO:2012:79) concerning ne bis in idem. It stated that in some cases a tax surcharge decision could be considered final even before the time-limit for ordinary appeal against the decision had expired. However, it was required that an objective assessment of such a case permitted the conclusion that the taxpayer, by his or her own conduct, had intended to settle the tax surcharge matter with final effect. The assessment had to concern the situation as a whole, and it could give significance to such questions as to how logically the taxpayer had acted in order to settle the taxes and tax surcharges, to what extent he or she had paid taxes and tax surcharges, and at which stage of the criminal proceedings the payments had been made. In the case at issue taxes and tax surcharges had been imposed on A on account of actions related to disguised dividends, by decisions of 2 March 2009 for tax years 2005 and 2006, and 7 September 2009 for tax year 2007. In the charge, which became pending on 28 June 2011, the prosecutor demanded that A be sentenced to punishment for aggravated tax fraud on account of the same actions. A had paid the taxes and tax surcharges entirely before the charge became pending. The time-limit for seeking rectification in respect of tax year 2005 had expired on 31 December 2011 without A having sought rectification. A declared that he had no intention of appealing against the decisions concerning the other tax years, either. The Supreme Court held that the charge of aggravated fraud was inadmissible as A had paid the taxes and tax surcharges before the charge became pending.
In its newest case-law (KKO:2013:59 of 5 July 2013), the Supreme Court reversed its earlier line of interpretation, finding that charges for tax fraud could no longer be brought if there was already a decision to order or not to order tax surcharges in the same matter. If the taxation authorities had exercised their decision-making powers regarding tax surcharges, a criminal charge could no longer be brought for a tax fraud offence based on the same facts, or if such a charge was already pending, it could no longer be pursued. The court assessed whether the preventive effect of the first set of proceedings had to be attributed to the fact that 1) tax surcharge proceedings were pending, 2) a tax surcharge issue was decided, or 3) to the finality of such a tax surcharge decision, and found the second option the most justifiable.
In December 2012 the Government submitted to Parliament a proposal for an Act on Tax Surcharges and Customs Duty Surcharges Imposed by a Separate Decision and for certain related Acts (HE 191/2012 vp). After the entry into force of the Act, the tax authorities could, when making a tax decision, assess whether to impose a tax surcharge or to report the matter to the police. The tax authorities could decide not to impose a tax surcharge. If they had not reported the matter to the police, a tax surcharge could be imposed by a separate decision by the end of the calendar year following the actual tax decision. If the tax authorities had imposed tax surcharges, they could no longer report the same matter to the police unless, after imposing the tax surcharges, they had received evidence of new or recently revealed facts. If the tax authorities had reported the matter to the police, tax surcharges could, as a rule, no longer be imposed. The purpose of the proposed Act is thus to ensure that a tax or a customs duty matter is processed and possibly punished in only one set of proceedings.
The proposed Act on Tax Surcharges and Customs Duty Surcharges Imposed by a Separate Decision (laki erillisellä päätöksellä määrättävästä veron- tai tullinkorotuksesta, lagen om skatteförhöjning och tullhöjning som påförs genom ett särskilt beslut, Act no. 781/2013) has already been passed by Parliament and it entered into force on 1 December 2013. The Act does not contain, however, any transitional provisions extending its scope retroactively.
