In those cases applicants usually were afforded less than three square metres of personal space (see, for example, Lind v. , no.\u00a025664/05, \u00a7\u00a059, 6\u00a0December 2007; Kantyrev v. , no.\u00a037213/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050-51, 21\u00a0June 2007; Andrey Frolov v. , no. 205/02, \u00a7\u00a7 47-49, 29\u00a0March 2007; Labzov v.\u00a0, no.\u00a062208/00, \u00a7\u00a044, 16 June 2005; and Mayzit v. , no.\u00a063378/00, \u00a7\u00a040, 20 January 2005). By contrast, in other cases where the overcrowding was not so severe as to raise in itself an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court noted other aspects of the physical conditions of detention as being relevant for its assessment of compliance with that provision. Such elements included, in particular, the possibility of using the toilet in private, availability of ventilation, access to natural light or air, adequacy of heating arrangements, and compliance with basic sanitary requirements. Thus, even in cases where the prison cell was larger, the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Trepashkin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a094; and Peers v. , no.\u00a028524/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-72, ECHR 2001III).",

The Court does not lose sight of the fact that he was kept there for only a part of the day (compare Fedotov v. , no.\u00a05140/02, \u00a7\u00a068, 25\u00a0October 2005).

The Court is not convinced by the Government's unsupported assertion that he could eat breakfast and dinner at the remand centre on the relevant days. As can be seen from the reports submitted by the Government, on many occasions the applicant was taken to the assembly section before breakfast time and was brought back to the remand centre after dinner time. No evidence was submitted to the effect that the applicant had received any dry ration instead. In any event, the reports submitted by the Government concede that detainees could not use dry rations because the convoy premises at the courthouse had no facilities for heating or eating food and because no kitchenware had been available. Permission to take one's own food cannot be a substitute for appropriate catering arrangements because it remains the State's obligation to ensure the well-being of persons deprived of their liberty (see Stepuleac v. Moldova, no.\u00a08207/06, \u00a7\u00a055, 6\u00a0November 2007; Kadi\u0137is v.

However, where domestic law provides for a system of appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, in particular, as concerns the speediness of the review by the appellate body of a detention order imposed by the lower court (see Lebedev v. , no.\u00a04493/04, \u00a7\u00a096, 25\u00a0October 2007). At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right of judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 is primarily intended to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. However, if the detention is confirmed by a court it must be considered to be lawful and not arbitrary, even where appeal is available (see Tjin-a-Kwi and Van Den Heuvel v. the , no. 17297/90, Commission decision of 31 March 1993). Subsequent proceedings are less concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention (loc.\u00a0cit.). Therefore, the Court would be less concerned with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal, if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees.",
