All these factors can justify a relatively long period of detention. However, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure (see Osuch v. Poland, no.\u00a031246/02, \u00a7\u00a026, 14 November 2006; and Celejewski v. , no.\u00a017584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 4\u00a0May 2006). The fact that a person is charged with acting in a criminal conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of detention; his personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account. There is no indication in the present case that the domestic courts had in any way verified whether the applicant had indeed made any attempts to intimidate witnesses or to obstruct the course of the proceedings in any other way. In such circumstances the Court has difficulty accepting the argument that there was a risk of interference with the administration of justice. Furthermore, such a risk was bound to decrease gradually as the trial proceeded and the witnesses were interviewed (compare Miszkurka v. , no.\u00a039437/03, \u00a7\u00a051, 4 May 2006) The Court is not therefore persuaded that, throughout the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention, compelling reasons existed for a fear that he would interfere with witnesses or otherwise hamper the investigation of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh the applicant\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Panchenko, cited above, \u00a7 106, and Letellier, cited above, \u00a7\u00a043). In the present case the decisions of the domestic authorities gave no reasons why, notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the applicant in support of his applications for release, they considered the risk of his absconding to be decisive. The Government submitted that the applicant, being a member of an organised criminal gang, had the means to leave the country and seek refuge abroad. However, it is not the Court\u2019s task to take the place of the national authorities who ruled on the applicant\u2019s detention and to substitute its own analysis of facts arguing for or against detention (see Nikolov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a038884/97, \u00a7\u00a074, 30\u00a0January 2003, and Labita, cited above, \u00a7 152). That circumstance was referred to for the first time in the proceedings before the Court and the domestic courts never mentioned it in their decisions. The Court finds that the existence of a risk that the applicant might abscond was not established.",

The Court has already found that the practice of issuing collective detention orders without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention in respect of each detainee was incompatible, in itself, with Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention (see Dolgova v. , no.\u00a011886/05, \u00a7\u00a049, 2 March 2006; Korchuganova, cited above, \u00a7 76; and Shcheglyuk\u00a0v.

At no point in the proceedings did the domestic courts explain in their decisions why alternatives to the deprivation of liberty would not have ensured that the trial would follow its proper course. This failure is made all the more inexplicable by the fact that the new Code of Criminal Procedure expressly requires the domestic courts to consider less restrictive measures as an alternative to custody (see paragraph 30).",
