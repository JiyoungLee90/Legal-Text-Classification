Thus, the dominant position of State institutions requires the authorities to show restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings. A chilling effect on freedom of expression can arise not only from any sanction, disproportionate or not, but also the fear of sanction, even in the event of an eventual acquittal, considering the likelihood of such fear discouraging one from making similar statements in the future.",

The frivolous, vexatious or malicious use of the law and legal process, with the high legal costs required to fight such law suits, can become a means of pressure and harassment, especially in the context of multiple law suits. The harassment can prove particularly acute when it concerns journalists and other media actors who do not benefit from the same legal protection or financial and institutional backing as those offered by large media organisations. In this respect, it should be recalled that it is central to the concept of a fair trial, in civil as in criminal proceedings, that a litigant is not denied the opportunity to present his or her case effectively before the court and that he or she is able to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side. States are therefore required to take appropriate measures, which could include the institution of a legal aid scheme, in order to ensure that each side is afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case.",

For example, in the case of Vajnai v.

The Court also found that the fact of being threatened with criminal prosecution on account of complaints lodged under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code \u2013 which at the material time had penalised, inter alia, denigration of Turkishness, a vague concept \u2013 had conferred on the applicant (who had not been prosecuted, let alone finally convicted) the status of victim of interference with freedom of expression (see Altu\u011f Taner Ak\u00e7am v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a027520/07, \u00a7\u00a7 70\u201175, 25 October 2011).",
