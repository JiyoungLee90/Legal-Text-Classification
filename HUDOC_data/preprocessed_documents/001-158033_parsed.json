Where there is a choice of remedies open to an applicant, Article 35 must be applied to reflect the practical realities of the applicant\u2019s position in order to ensure the effective protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (see, inter alia, Hilal v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a045276/99, 8 February 2000; and Krumpel and Krumpelova v. Slovakia, no.\u00a056195/00, \u00a7 43, 5 July 2005). Indeed, where an applicant has a choice of remedies and their comparative effectiveness is not obvious, the Court tends to interpret the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies in the applicant\u2019s favour (see Budayeva and Others v.

Further factors to be taken into account include the purpose of the ill-treatment and the underlying intention or motivation (see, for example, El\u00a0Masri v. \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d [GC], no.\u00a039630/09, \u00a7\u00a0196, ECHR 2012). The Court has considered some types of treatment \u201cinhuman\u201d, particularly where it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also \u201cdegrading\u201d because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2000-IV).",

By the same token, in a case concerning harassment of a person suffering from physical and mental disabilities, the Court ruled that the feelings of fear and helplessness caused by the ill-treatment were sufficiently serious to attain the level of severity required to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention, even though the applicant had only suffered physical injuries on one occasion (see \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 41526/10, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2012).

Admittedly, proving racial motivation will often be extremely difficult in practice. The respondent State\u2019s obligation to investigate possible racist overtones to a violent act is an obligation to use best endeavours and not absolute. The authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumstances to collect and secure the evidence, explore all practical means of discovering the truth and deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of a racially induced violence (see, Bekos and Koutropoulos v. Greece, no.\u00a015250/02, \u00a7\u00a069, ECHR 2005XIII (extracts)).Treating racially induced violence and brutality on an equal footing with cases that have no racist overtones would be to turn a blind eye to the specific nature of acts which are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article\u00a014 of the Convention (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos.\u00a043577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 160, ECHR 2005VII). The Court also reiterates the particular requirement for an investigation into an attack with racial overtones to be pursued with vigour and impartiality, having regard to the need to continuously reassert society\u2019s condemnation of racism in order to maintain the confidence of minorities in the ability of the authorities to protect them from the threat of racist violence (see Amadayev v. Russia, no.\u00a018114/06, \u00a7 81, 3 July 2014).",

Their ensuing conclusion was that because the posts only revealed that Mr E.D. had insulted an unnamed and unidentifiable person of Roma origin the night before, it could not be established unequivocally and beyond doubt, either from the post or from the subsequent messages, that the insult had taken place because of the victim\u2019s Roma origin.

The prosecutor explained in the reasons given for his decision (paragraph 17 of the judgment) why it would not be possible to prove that the violence was inflicted \u201cbecause of\u201d the Roma origin of the applicant. In the assessment of the prosecutor, the offence \u201ccannot be proven sufficiently for establishing criminal responsibility\u201d and that the \u201cracist motive ... cannot be established beyond doubt ...\u201d I fail to see how the majority\u2019s reference to the sufficiency of \u201cmixed motives\u201d has any bearing on the assessment of the case. The prosecutor assessed that he could not prove the link between a racist motive and the violence. The prosecutor referred to the fact that the perpetrator \u201chad intended to leave the scene and only turned back because of the victim\u2019s reproach and that the only information about the start of the fight originates in the contradictory statements of the victim and [the perpetrator]\u201d. My colleagues may disagree with that assessment, but there is insufficient basis for characterising the assessment as \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d.",

However, my colleagues fail to recognize the difference between violence against a person who is of Roma origin, and violence against a person because of the persons Roma origin. In the first situation the ethnic origin of the victim is a statement of fact, in the other it is the cause of the violence. It transpires clearly from the reasoning of the decision that the prosecutor assessed that the posts were insufficient to prove that the incident took place \u201cbecause of the victim\u2019s Roma origin\u201d. Again, my colleagues may disagree with that assessment, but there is insufficient basis for characterising the assessment as \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d.",

However, the prosecutor clearly stated that it could not be proven \u201ceither from the post or from the subsequent messages\u201d that the incident took place \u201cbecause of the victim\u2019s Roma origin\u201d (see paragraph 17 of the judgment). My colleagues fail to recognize that the fact that a person has expressed views that may be interpreted as racist does not imply that everything the person does is racially motivated. Again, my colleagues may disagree with that assessment, but there is insufficient basis for characterising the assessment as \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d.",

Furthermore, as already mentioned, there is no basis for saying that the decision of the prosecutor to discontinue the investigation into \u201cviolence against a member of a group\u201d was arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable or that it was not \u201cbased on an adequate assessment of all the relevant factual elements in the case\u201d.",

The applicant has complained of the alleged ineffectiveness of the investigation conducted by the authorities rather than about the absence of prosecution as such (see paragraph 32 of the judgment). My colleagues do not criticize the domestic investigation for being ineffective in the sense of not having secured all the relevant evidence, but like the applicant they are in fact criticizing the prosecutor\u2019s assessment of the evidence. In this context it is important to notice that it was open to the applicant, if he was dissatisfied with the prosecutor\u2019s assessment of the evidence, to institute subsidiary private prosecution (Section 199(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure), had they wanted a court\u2019s assessment of the facts of the case. This was not done. Rather, the applicant turned to the European Court of Human Rights that has now told the domestic prosecutor, albeit indirectly, that he should have indicted the perpetrator and brought the case before criminal courts, irrespective of the fact that the evidence, in the assessment of the prosecutor, was insufficient to secure a conviction, as the decision of the prosecutor, according to the majority, results from \u201ca manifestly unreasonable assessment of the circumstances of the case\u201d.",
