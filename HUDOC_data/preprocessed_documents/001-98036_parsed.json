The case gives rise to the following observations: Article R 56 of the Code of State Property provides that any fee payable to the Treasury Department must take into account the advantages of any kind procured to the concessionaire. In the aforementioned case, there is no doubt that the concession of the dyke in question procures a not inconsiderable advantage to the applicant: in particular, it allows her to save on the capital that would otherwise be invested in the purchase of a building plot in the area in question... In these circumstances I find it fully acceptable to retain a sum corresponding to the amount of interest calculated at the very reduced rate of 5% of the value of the land conceded. ...\u201d",

However, having regard to the long period of occupation and the applicants' and their mother's sentimental attachment to the house in question, the Prefect said that he was willing to consider, exceptionally, granting limited authorisation restricting use of the property to strictly personal use and prohibiting any sale or transfer of the land and house, any work thereon other than maintenance, and reserving an option to the State, on expiry of the authorisation, to have the property restored to its original state or to reuse the buildings. He concluded by asking her to let him know quickly whether these conditions met with her approval so that \u201can illegal situation that had lasted two and a half years could be regularised\u201d.",

They concluded from this that the construction of a house, of which the authorities were aware and which they had accepted, had resulted in full title to the house passing to the occupants of the land. If this were not the case, it was for the Prefect to provide proof that the draining works undertaken at the beginning of the century had been illegal.

Colbert's Ordinance of the Marine of August 1681 codified the principle and up until recently was still the legal basis for the State's management of maritime public property. In addition to defining what constituted the \u201cseashore and foreshore\u201d, it laid down the applicable\u00a0rules: \u201cNo one shall build on the foreshore, set stakes in the ground or erect any construction that may interfere with navigation, on pain of demolition of the constructions, confiscation of the materials and discretionary fines\u201d. At the time of the Revolution, the idea developed that maritime public property was governed by the Government in the interest of the nation, and not merely as part of the heritage that used to belong to the Crown and now belongs to the State. The management of maritime public property is still largely guided by this principle today. Over and above the idea of State ownership of such property, the conservation and management of it are more a matter of implementation of a policy regarding its use than the exercise of the owner's \u201ccivil\u201d rights. The prefect has a major role in the protection of maritime public property. He is the authority who, generally, governs the use of the property at local level, decides whether or not to allow private occupancy and protects the integrity of the property by prosecuting offenders (source: , consulted on 3 February 2010).",

The basis of this principle is the designation of land for public use. As long as it remains thus designated, and no express decision has been taken reclassifying particular public land as private property, no transfer of land can be authorised. It is a means of preventing public land from being acquired by prescription or adverse possession under private law, hence the principle of imprescriptibility that is very often associated with the principle of inalienability. Accordingly, in its Cazeaux judgment, on the subject of plots of land situated close to the seashore in the Arcachon Basin the Conseil d'Etat found that \u201cwhilst the public authorities have authorised various building works on this land and on several occasions waived their right to apply the rules governing public land ..., neither the founders of the soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du\u00a0domaine des pr\u00e9s sal\u00e9s nor the company itself have been able to acquire any property right over the land, which, being part of public land, was inalienable and imprescriptible\u201d.",

It has not, however, recognised that the principle of inalienability has any constitutional status (CC, dec. no. 94-346 of 21 July 1994, Rights in rem over public property). The Conseil d'Etat has recently reiterated that \u201cwhere property belonging to a public authority has been incorporated into the category of public land by virtue of a decision classifying it thus, it shall remain public land unless a decision is given expressly reclassifying it as private property\u201d. Accordingly, it has held that the question whether or not short-stay factories fell into the category of public property was not affected by the fact \u201cthat these short-stay factories were intended to be rented or assigned to the occupants or that the occupancy leases granted were private-law contracts\u201d (CE 26\u00a0March 2008, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Lucofer).",

Moreover, the fact that public land is inalienable means \u2013 in theory \u2013 that no rights in rem can be established over it. However, the legislature has departed from this principle by passing two Acts, one of 5\u00a0January 1988 which creates long administrative leases, and the other of 25\u00a0July 1994 on the constitution of rights in rem over public land, thus making it possible to grant private rights in rem to occupants of maritime public property. The Act of 5 January 1988 concerns only public land belonging to local and regional authorities or groups thereof. The Act of 25 July 1994 relates to artificial maritime property and immovable constructions and installations built for the purposes of an authorised activity (Article L. 34-1 of the Code of State Property and Article L. 2122-6 of the CGPPP). In its above-mentioned decision of 21 July 1994, the Constitutional Council held that granting rights in rem in this way was compatible with the Constitution as public services were maintained and public property protected under the 1994 Act. However, it declared the provision allowing the renewal of authorisation beyond seventy years unconstitutional on the ground that it could potentially render ineffective the public authority's right to the automatic return, free of charge, of any constructions and therefore undermine the \u201cprotection due to public property\u201d.",

The latter are called concessions to occupy public land, which \u2013 on maritime public property \u2013 may be a beach concession or a concession to build a dyke. By means of this concession, the State authorises the concessionaire to carry out works on the foreshore by which land is removed from the action of the tide. In respect of natural maritime public property an arrangement was established in 1807, traditionally called a concession to build a dyke and by which ownership was transferred (former Article L.\u00a064 of the Code of State Property): the concessionaire was authorised to drain land, which, once removed from the action of the tide, no longer fell within the definition of natural maritime public property and could therefore be reclassified as private property and transferred by the State. That arrangement, which was originally used to build agricultural polders, has more recently been used for property developments in the form of marinas, reclaimed from the sea. Following a reaction to what was perceived as a privatisation of the shore, a circular was issued in 1973 prohibiting such arrangements \u2013 a prohibition later confirmed by the Coastal Areas Act, which imposes a broader prohibition on any interference with the natural state of the shore. It is now no longer possible to build marinas or polders by means of concessions to build dykes by which ownership is transferred. This arrangement can now apply only to past draining works and is the sole means of legalising these (source: ).",

Only four States (Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the United Kingdom and ) do not recognise the existence of maritime public property exclusive of any private ownership rights. In the other twelve States (Germany, Croatia, Spain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Slovenia and ), maritime public property belongs either to the State or to other public bodies and is inalienable on that basis. In all these States maritime public property can nevertheless be designated for private use on the basis of fixed-term concessions. And in all these States illegal use exposes the offender to administrative or even criminal penalties. In particular, the illegal construction of immovable property can result in the offender being ordered to demolish the building concerned at his or her own expense and without compensation. This type of measure also exists in , where the private right of ownership of land on the seashore is recognised by law but the land is subject to relatively strict easements which prohibit the construction of new buildings and guarantee public access to the sea.",

The house had been built a hundred years ago and they had not been told that it had been built illegally when it had been received as a gift, with the deed of 1945 referring to the authorisation given by the Prefect. Having been kept in the dark for a long time about the possible demolition of their house thus acquired, the applicants referred to the decades spent peacefully in a strong social and family environment.

A house could not change status according to whether the State refused to renew authorisation and ordered demolition or refused to renew authorisation with a view to benefiting from ownership of the property, which, in such a case, would be full ownership. By obliging persons who had been authorised to occupy land to demolish, at their own expense, a house in which the same family had been living for more than fifty years, regardless of the fact that it had been acquired as a gift from a donor who had herself acquired the property following a sale, the State failed to comply with the duty incumbent on it to respect \u201cpossessions\u201d.",

In 1909 authorisation had been granted in order to allow access to a neighbouring island belonging to the occupant on condition that the dyke was accessible to the public at all times.

It accepts that the domestic courts analysed the interference with the property in question only from the standpoint of its classification as public property. It observes, further, that by issuing successive decisions authorising occupancy, the State de facto weakened the protection of the property's designation as land for the benefit of the public. However, it is since the enactment of the Coastal Areas Act \u2013 section 1 of which provides that \u201cthe coast is a geographical entity that requires a specific development, conservation and enhancement policy\u201d \u2013 that authorisations have no longer been renewed, with the aim of protecting the seashore and more generally the environment. The Court reiterates that environmental conservation, which in today's society is an increasingly important consideration (see Fredin v.  (no.\u00a01), 18\u00a0February 1991, \u00a7\u00a048, Series A no.\u00a0192), has become a cause whose defence arouses the constant and sustained interest of the public, and consequently the public authorities. The Court has stressed this point a number of times with regard to the protection of the countryside and forests (see Turgut and Others, cited above, \u00a7 90; K\u00f6ktepe, cited above, \u00a7 87; and \u015eatir, cited above, \u00a7 33). The protection of coastal areas, and in particular beaches, which are \u201ca public area open to all\u201d, is another example (see N.A. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 40) of an area where an appropriate planning policy is required. The Court therefore considers that the interference pursued a legitimate aim that was in the general interest: to promote unrestricted access to the shore, the importance of which has been clearly established (see paragraphs 46 to 50 and 52 and 55 above).",

The search for this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole, and therefore also in the second paragraph thereof: there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others v.

Since then they have occupied and maintained the house, and paid the taxes and charges on it. The Court also observes that the house was apparently built over a century ago on public land drained for that purpose without any concession authorising the construction. In the Court's view, the question of whether the house was legally built should not be a matter for consideration in the present case. In any event the alleged illegality of the building should not be held against the applicants, particularly as it is not disputed that they acquired their \u201cpossession\u201d in good faith. Their situation is therefore clearly different from that of an individual who has knowingly erected a building without a permit (see, by contrast, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z; Saliba; and Hamer, cited above). The house in question is not therefore comparable with those that have recently been illegally built along the coast.",

Each prefectoral decision authorising occupancy specified the length of the authorisation and, in accordance with former Article A 26 of the Code of State Property, that the authorities could modify or withdraw the authorisation should they deem it necessary, on any ground whatsoever, without the permittee thereby acquiring a right to claim any compensation. Furthermore, it was specified that the permittee must, if required, restore the site to its original state by demolishing the constructions built on the public property, including those existing on the date on which the decision was signed. The Court concludes from this that the applicants had always known that the decisions authorising occupancy were precarious and revocable and considers that the authorities cannot therefore be deemed to have contributed to maintaining uncertainty regarding the legal status of the \u201cpossession\u201d (see, by contrast, Beyeler v.

Accordingly, there is no evidence to support the applicants' suggestion that the authorities' responsibility for the uncertainty regarding the status of the house increased with the passage of time (see paragraph 63 above). The exceptional length of the occupancy and certain hesitations on the part of the authorities (see paragraphs 18 and 31 above) should be viewed in the context at the relevant time, when development and environmental concerns had not yet reached the degree witnessed today. It was not until 1986 that the applicants' situation changed, following the enactment of the Coastal Areas Act which put an end to a policy of protecting coastal areas merely by applying the rules governing public property. In any event, the aforementioned tolerance could not result in a legalisation ex post facto of the status quo.",

Furthermore, prior to the Coastal Areas Act, the applicants did not request a concession to build a dyke at a time when they could perhaps still have done so. However, the State started reacting as early as 1973 to the risk of public property being used for private ends (see paragraph 44 above).",

I agree with the Government's submission that the impossibility of acquiring property by adverse possession invalidates the argument relating to the effect of the length of occupation of the site; accordingly, no legitimate expectation of being able to continue enjoying the \u201cpossession\u201d arose in favour of the applicants (see paragraph 64 of the judgment).",

Nevertheless, as the Court has consistently emphasised, the three \u201crules\u201d in Article 1 are not to be seen as watertight or unconnected rules, all three rules importing a requirement of proportionality and the necessity of striking a fair balance between the demands of the community as a whole and the protection of the rights and interests of the individual. Moreover, the fact that the measures of control applied in the present case would have particularly serious consequences for the applicants, in resulting in the loss of a valuable asset, is a factor which must be weighed in the balance even if the case is to be examined under the second paragraph of the Article.",

It is true that the applicants, or their predecessors in title, have always been aware that their continued possession and occupation of the house was precarious, the decisions authorising the occupation of the dyke or house, from at least 1951 onwards, expressly reserving to the authorities the right to modify or withdraw the authorisation should they deem it necessary on any ground, without the occupants acquiring a right to claim any compensation or damages in that regard. The decisions also made clear that, if required, the occupants would be obliged to restore the site to its original state by demolishing any buildings on the public property and that should they fail to comply with that obligation, the authorities would do so of their own motion and at the occupants' expense. However, it is also true that the authorisation had been consistently renewed by the authorities, after the applicants' mother had acquired the house by inheritance, in the years 1951, 1967, 1977, 1984 and 1986 without the applicants being given any reason to believe that the authorisation would not continue to be granted for a house which had been in existence since the beginning of the century. It is particularly significant that the authorisation of 1986 appears to have been issued after the coming into force of the Coastal Areas Act, the provisions of which were relied on by the authorities as preventing the further renewal of the authorisation in 1993.",

Both the dyke and the house were likewise constructed long before the Code of State Property 1957 and the Ministerial circular of 1973 which prohibited the grant of concessions to carry out works on the seashore and to occupy maritime public property, a prohibition which was later confirmed by the 1986 Act.",

The Government argue that the reason for allowing the house to remain standing after the authorities had discovered its existence in 1967 was that, at that time, it was still compatible with the designated use of the property. We find it difficult to accept that the authorities were unaware of the existence of the house until 1967. More importantly, even if it is correct, as stated in the judgment (\u00a7 89), that certain of the authorisations were issued at a time when \u201cdevelopment and environmental concerns had not reached the degree witnessed today\u201d and that \u201cit was not until 1986 that the applicants' situation changed\u201d, it is notable that three authorisations were granted after the Ministerial circular of 1973 had been issued and the last of these was granted after the coming into effect of the 1986 Act itself. The majority of the Court have found that this was not an example of negligence on the part of the authorities but rather of tolerance of the ongoing occupancy of the house. It is said that this offers no support to the applicants' suggestion that the authority's responsibility for the uncertainty regarding the status of the house increased with the passage of time. While we do not find it necessary to characterise the actions of the authorities as negligence, we attach weight to the lack of coherence of those actions which, to use the words of the Government Commissioner, allowed occupants of public property to nurture for almost a century the hope that they would not be brutally compelled to demolish their property. In this respect, we recall the Court's finding that, where an issue in the general interest is at stake, it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time, in an appropriate manner and with utmost consistency (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, judgment of 5\u00a0January 2000, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2000-I).",

On the contrary, the applicants' submission that the house had become perfectly integrated into the local landscape and was part of the national heritage is confirmed by the letter of 6 August 2002 from the Director of the Department of Culture and Legal and Political Affairs, in which it was noted that had an inventory been carried out in the Vannes-Ouest district at that time, the applicants' house and others in the same situation would have been listed as historical monuments and considered as part of the region's cultural heritage.",

Reliance is placed by the majority on the fact that the applicants' mother refused the compromise solution in the Prefect's proposal that she should continue in occupation of the house subject to certain conditions. We acknowledge that the Prefect's offer went some way towards redressing the balance and that, to use the words of the Government Commissioner, the offer was at least preferable to the \u201cdrastic solution\u201d of a straightforward demolition order. However, in the end we have concluded that the proposal was not such as to restore a fair balance, since it imposed substantially greater restrictions on the applicants' continued enjoyment of their property by not only confining the use of the house to strictly personal use and prohibiting any sale or transfer of it or any work other than maintenance work but by reserving to the State an option on the expiry of the authorisation to have the land restored to its original state or to reuse the building. In short, it appears that under the proposal the ownership and occupancy of the house would continue only during the lifetime of the applicants' mother herself and that family members would be deprived of their valuable possession which would pass to the authorities without any compensation being paid. We note, in this regard, that the very fact that under the proposal the State reserved the right to preserve and reuse the house on the expiry of any authorisation is itself difficult to reconcile with any compelling need to restore the natural state of the shoreline.",
