He found that H.C.Z. had suffered three gunshot wounds, one to the front of his chest, another to the right side of his stomach and the third to his left arm. The expert found that H.C.Z. had been shot in the stomach at a range of less than 10 cm; however, the gun barrel did not touch his body at the moment of impact. However, the bullets which had hit H.C.Z.\u2019s left arm and chest were fired from more than 50 cm away. Considering that two bullets and three cartridge cases were found at the crime scene, F.S. presumed that one shot hit the wall either directly or after causing a wound to H.C.Z.\u2019s left arm, and that the force of the impact caused the bullet to shatter. Another bullet was found in H.C.Z.\u2019s chest, while the bullet that had entered his stomach had exited his body under the shoulder blade. According to the expert, at the moment of the shooting H.C.Z. was entering the room, while the shooter was inside the room, firing all three shots while standing. Having regard to these considerations, F. was of the view that the account of the events given by E.M.L. was both possible and likelier than the account given by M.\u0160., which was not possible at all. No shot had been fired at the floor, and no shot had been fired while the shooter and H.C.Z. were in direct contact as described by M.\u0160.",

Therefore, although the applicant had not been present during E.M.L.\u2019s cross-examination, the Supreme Court was convinced that his rights of defence had not been violated.",

In a decision of 18\u00a0October 2007 (Up-849/05), the Constitutional Court considered that it was not possible to refer to a violation of the right to examine witnesses for the prosecution when the authorities had acted with due diligence in their efforts to ensure that the accused had the benefit of this right at the trial hearing (it is worth noting that in this case, according to the Constitutional Court, the statements of the victims were not the sole or key evidence against the accused).",

In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 84, 16\u00a0November 2010, with further references therein).

Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 175, ECHR\u00a02010) and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see, amongst many authorities, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26\u00a0March 1996, \u00a7 70, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II). It is also notable in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 162, and the references therein).",

The principles were recently further clarified in the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment in Schatschaschwili v. Germany ([GC], no. 9154/10, \u00a7\u00a7 100131, 15\u00a0December 2015), in which the relationship between them was scrutinised and each of the principles was developed in more detail. Essentially, the Court has found that in determining whether the admission of such evidence was compatible with the right to a fair trial it had first to be established that there was a good reason for the non-attendance of the witness. Secondly, the Court must examine whether the evidence of an absent witness was the sole or decisive basis for a conviction, and thirdly, whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards, which permitted a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. Moreover, the Court has pointed out that, as with all complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 3, the defendant\u2019s inability to examine a witness should be assessed in the light of the impact that it has had on the overall fairness of his trial.",

Nor is the present case akin to cases such as Doorson, (cited above) where the defendant\u2019s counsel was able to cross-examine anonymous witnesses without, however, being able to raise any issues which might lead to their identification (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 68-76). Thus, in those cases the defence faced considerable difficulties in challenging the reliability and credibility of the prosecution witnesses\u2019 testimonies, either because an individual witness was not available for questioning, or because the range of admissible questions was limited so as to exclude, for example, all issues related to a prior relationship with the accused. In the present case, however, the applicant was familiar with the identity of E.M.L., the only direct witness to the shooting at issue, who refused to attend and testify at the trial for fear of retribution. Further, while the applicant himself was not allowed to attend E.M.L.\u2019s questioning, his counsel was able to cross-examine E.M.L. on all relevant aspects of the case, including the shooter\u2019s identity (see paragraph 32 above).",

This restriction did not, however, apply to the applicant\u2019s counsel, who had the opportunity to question E.M.L. and challenge his credibility. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the statement of a witness does not always have to be made in court or in public if it is to be admitted as evidence; in particular, this may prove impossible in certain cases (see Asch v. Austria, 26 April 1991, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 203). Moreover, the Court has accepted that in exceptional circumstances there may be reasons for hearing evidence from a witness in the absence of the person against whom the statement is to be made on the condition that his lawyer was present (see Hilden v. Finland (dec.) no.\u00a032523/96, 14\u00a0September 1999, and the references cited therein); nevertheless, it has also emphasised that such exceptions should be subject to restrictive interpretation (see Melich and Beck v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a035450/04, \u00a7\u00a053, 24 July 2008).",

In cases where it was found that such a good reason existed, the Convention organs further examined whether the applicants had been substantially affected in the exercise of their defence on account of the lack of such confrontation (see X. v. Denmark, no. 8395/78, Commission decision of 16 December 1981, Decisions and Reports (DR) 27, p. 55; Kurup v.

According to the statement made by E.M.L. to the investigating judge of the Regional Court of The Hague, he was not willing to attend the trial hearing in Slovenia (see paragraph 29 above). In view of the fact that E.M.L. was a Dutch national and lived in his home country, it does not appear likely, or even possible, that the Slovenian authorities were in a position to compel him to appear at the trial. Thus, the Court considers it reasonable for the district court to attempt to obtain his testimony by other means, namely by requesting the Dutch authorities to take his statement in the Netherlands in the applicant\u2019s presence (see paragraph 31 above).",

Indeed, in the light of the statements made by E.M.L., but also by A.B. to the investigating judge (see paragraph 30 above), E.M.L.\u2019s fear of the applicant does not appear to be unfounded. E.M.L. was the only direct witness to the shooting of H.C.Z. and, when fleeing from the scene of the crime, he was pursued by the applicant, A.S. and M.\u0160., the latter carrying a gun (see paragraph 10 above). Therefore, the Court considers that there was a good reason for the Dutch court\u2019s refusal to allow the applicant to be present at E.M.L.\u2019s hearing. Accordingly, the fact that E.M.L.\u2019s testimony was admitted into evidence by the Novo Mesto District Court did not constitute, in and of itself, a breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d).",

It is true that E.M.L.\u2019s account of how the events at issue unfolded was corroborated by the reports of the ballistic and forensic experts (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above) and, so far as the events prior to and after the shooting were concerned, also by M.S.\u2019s testimony (see paragraphs 11 and 28 above). Still, E.M.L. was the only uninvolved eyewitness to the shooting itself, and his statement was the only evidence directly incriminating the applicant of H.C.Z.\u2019s murder. Having regard to the fact that M.\u0160. confessed to that same crime, it is very questionable whether the applicant could have been convicted without E.M.L.\u2019s testimony. In this regard, it is evident that the Novo Mesto District Court considered that E.M.L.\u2019s testimony pointed persuasively to the applicant\u2019s guilt, and relied on it in the reasoning of its judgment (see paragraph 38 above). Thus, while the applicant\u2019s conviction was based on a considerable body of evidence, E.M.L.\u2019s testimony must be considered decisive in that respect.",

Indeed, the similarity between the applicant and his brother was also acknowledged by E.M.L. himself, who in his statements to both the Czech and Dutch authorities described M.\u0160. as looking very much like the applicant (see paragraphs 10, 29 and 32 above). However, E.M.L. had seen the applicant twice before the evening of the shooting and testified at all his hearings that it had been him, and not the similar-looking man who had pulled the gun and fired at H.C.Z. Furthermore, E.M.L.\u2019s accounts of the events at issue given at the hearings before the investigating judge of the Regional Court of The Hague on 28 March 2006 and 4 July 2006 (see paragraphs 29 and 32 above) were largely consistent with his statements given to the Czech police on 19 and 20 September 2001, in the two days following the shooting of H.C.Z. (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). Nevertheless, in his second interview before the investigating judge, E.M.L. switched the positions of the shooter and the witness on the floor plan of the bedroom where the shooting had taken place in relation to his statements given to the Czech police four and a half years earlier (see paragraph 32 above) and to the Dutch investigating judge some three months earlier.",

In this regard, the Court reiterates that E.M.L. was first questioned during the investigation in the Czech Republic, and again, approximately four and a half years later, during the applicant\u2019s trial for the murder of H.C.Z. E.M.L.\u2019s initial statement was read out at the applicant\u2019s first trial in 2003; thus there can be no doubt that the latter was well acquainted with its contents. It follows that, as also observed by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 42 above), the defence had the opportunity to compare E.M.L.\u2019s pre-trial and trial testimonies for any inconsistencies and to challenge their veracity, including the reliability of E.M.L.\u2019s identification of the applicant as the shooter. Furthermore, the second questioning of E.M.L. by the investigating judge of the Regional Court of The Hague was conducted in the presence of the applicant\u2019s counsel, who had the opportunity to cross-examine E.M.L. In this connection, the Court considers it relevant that, since the applicant was aware of E.M.L.\u2019s initial statement, he was able to prepare his defence against E.M.L.\u2019s submissions and to give his counsel instructions as to what questions should be put to E.M.L.",

However, it is noted that, having been informed that he could not attend E.M.L.\u2019s examination in person (see paragraph 31 above), the applicant made no request with the Slovenian or Dutch authorities for E.M.L. to identify him by means of a video link, not even after the latter had switched the positions of himself and his brother during the shooting (see paragraph 33 above). The applicant instead insisted throughout the first-instance proceedings to be personally confronted with E.M.L., and only raised the possibility of identification by video link as a complaint in his appeal against the first-instance judgment (see paragraph 40 above). In this connection, the Court observes that the Slovenian legislation (sections 242 and 242a of the Criminal Procedure Act) provides for an identification procedure whereby the witness is shown the defendant together with other persons unknown to him, and is required to identify the perpetrator of the offence from among the group. Moreover, if there is a serious risk that the witness might lose his life or suffer physical harm as a result of identification, the procedure is conducted in such a way that he cannot be seen by the persons in the identification parade (see paragraph 44 above). The Court moreover considers that such an identification procedure where the perpetrator of the offence is picked out of a group of similar individuals is more reliable than the in-court identification where the witness does not see any other individual than the defendant, and is thus more likely to identify him as the perpetrator. Yet, as already stated, despite having a statutory basis for requesting identification, the applicant made no such request. Given that the applicant\u2019s defence counsel put several questions to E.M.L. with regard to the shooter\u2019s identity and drew special attention to the similarity between the applicant and M.\u0160. (see paragraph 32 above), the Court would consider it reasonable to expect that, if his doubts as to E.M.L.\u2019s identification of the applicant had not been removed, he would have requested that the issue be further clarified.",

Also, while the applicant\u2019s and M.\u0160.\u2019s version of the events was not found to be consistent with other evidence, especially forensic evidence presented at the trial (see paragraph 39 above), E.M.L.\u2019s statement was corroborated by those same submissions (see paragraph 38 above). Assessing the available body of evidence in its entirety, the Novo Mesto District Court considered E.M.L.\u2019s version of events and his identification of the applicant credible, despite his contradictory accounts as regards the position of the applicant and his brother during the shooting. In this connection, the Court notes that the District Court explicitly addressed the issue of E.M.L.\u2019s divergent accounts of the shooter\u2019s position, but decided to give more weight to E.M.L.\u2019s prior acquaintance with the applicant and his firm conviction as to the shooter\u2019s identity than to the applicant\u2019s version of how the events at issue had unfolded.",
