Amirkhan Alikhanov had been stopped by traffic police officers at the stationary traffic police checkpoint and his car had been taken away by the police after the abduction. It was impossible that any regular criminals could have committed the abduction so openly, given that the abductors had taken Mr Alikhanov at the police checkpoint, where a number of the police officers had seen them (see paragraphs 18-20, 22, 24, 37, 42, 47 and 48 above).

Applying the above-mentioned principles, it has concluded that it would be sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case for the abduction of the missing persons by State agents, thus falling within the control of the authorities, and that it would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof, either by disclosing documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, for example, concerning abductions in Dagestan, Umarovy v. Russia, no. 2546/08, 12 June 2012; Alpatu Israilova v. Russia, no. 15438/05, 14 March 2013; Abdurakhmanova and Abdulgamidova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 41437/10, 22 September 2015; and Aliyev and Gadzhiyeva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 11059/12, 12 July 2016). If the Government failed to rebut this presumption, this would entail a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its substantive part. Conversely, if the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Shafiyeva v. Russia, no. 49379/09, \u00a7 71, 3\u00a0May 2012).",

The abductors, who arrived at the police checkpoint in special police vehicles, acted as an organised group and did not hesitate to abduct Amirkhan Alikhanov in the presence of the on-duty traffic police officers (see paragraphs 18-20, 25, 37, 42, 47 and 48 above). Moreover, they were carrying special service documents of members of the Dagestan Organised Crime Unit, and at least two of them were wearing the traffic police uniform (see paragraph 61 above and, in respect of a similar situation, Kushtova and Others v. Russia (no. 2), no. 60806/08, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 29, 21 February 2017). Subsequently, in spite of the applicants\u2019 urgent and consistent allegations that the abductors must have been police officers from the Dagestan Organised Crime Unit, it took the authorities almost six months to start taking some steps to verify this information (see paragraphs 18 and 3132 above). No steps were taken to verify whether the perpetrators could have been persons other than State agents (see, by contrast, Zubayrayev v. Russia, no. 67797/01, \u00a7 81, 10 January 2008). Furthermore, upon the discovery of the six corpses near Zamay-Yurt, given the lack of material with which to conduct a more detailed DNA examination of the presumed body of Amirkhan Alikhanov (see paragraph 33 above), its exhumation (as requested by the applicants \u2013 see paragraph 59 above) would have helped to finalise its identification. However, the investigation failed to take the requested step, which was necessary not only for identification purposes but also for establishing the possible cause of death in respect of the six persons whose corpses had been found. This procrastination on the part of the investigators \u2013 along with the applicants\u2019 consistent allegations of the lawenforcement officers\u2019 direct involvement in the abduction \u2013 provide the Court with grounds for concluding that the applicants have made a prima facie case that their relative, Amirkhan Alikhanov, was abducted by State agents. The Government\u2019s statement that the investigators found no evidence proving the involvement of law-enforcement officers in the abduction of the applicants\u2019 relative and his presumed death is insufficient to discharge them of the above-mentioned burden of proof. Having examined the documents submitted by the parties, and drawing inferences from the Government\u2019s failure to provide another plausible explanation for the events in question, the Court finds that State agents abducted Amirkhan Alikhanov from the traffic police checkpoint on 23 December 2004.",

The lack of information concerning the fate of Amirkhan Alikhanov for a number of years after the abduction and the official establishment of the death by the domestic authorities confirming his death (see paragraph 14 above) support this assumption.",

In the case at hand, even though the abduction of Amirkhan Alikhanov took place in Dagestan in 2004, the Court finds a number of similar defects rendering the criminal proceedings ineffective. The investigation has been ongoing for a number of years without attaining any tangible results, such as confirming the identity of the body found in Zamay-Yurt and questioning those police officers who \u2013 according to the witnesses \u2013 could have been implicated in the incident (see paragraph 34 above). The contents of that part of the investigation file that was submitted to the Court show that the investigators intended to take such steps as staging an identification line-up of those police officers who could have been implicated in the abduction (see paragraph 42 above) and that they even issued an arrest warrant against one of the possible perpetrators (see paragraph 48 above), but that they failed to carry out those steps, in spite of the crucial role they would have played in elucidating the circumstances of the crime. Furthermore, from the documents submitted it can be seen that the superior officers of the Dagestan Organised Crime Unit obstructed the investigators\u2019 attempts to question the suspect (see paragraph 48 above), which raises an issue as to the practical independence of the investigators, who were as a result of that obstruction precluded from taking those important steps. In this connection, the Court notes that discord within the lawenforcement agencies should not have precluded the domestic authorities from discharging their obligation to demonstrate diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious matter (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2004-XII) and notes that their reluctance to do so led to the loss of precious time and could not but have had a negative impact on the overall conduct of the criminal proceedings (see, for example, Askhabova v. Russia, no. 54765/09, \u00a7 153, 18 April 2013). It is also noteworthy that the investigation into the abduction and the discovery of the six corpses was conducted by several law-enforcement bodies without any apparent coordination of the steps they took to have the crime resolved (see paragraphs 47, 52, 58, 60 and 61 above). Given the circumstances, the Court does not find it necessary to examine whether the investigation was sufficiently independent.",

Therefore, it is highly doubtful that any appeals by the applicants against the investigators\u2019 decisions would have had any prospects of spurring the progress of the investigation or effectively influencing its conduct. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government (see paragraph 66 above) was ineffective in the circumstances of the present case, and dismisses their objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
