Although they referred to two cases in which the domestic courts granted detainees non-pecuniary damage for inadequate conditions of detention, the Court notes that in those cases compensation was awarded for a detainee\u2019s infection with scabies or a failure to provide a detainee with food. Neither of those cases concerned detention in overcrowded cells. Moreover, the\u00a0Government did not produce copies of the judgments to which they referred. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Government\u2019s objection as to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

The continuous nature of his detention, his identical descriptions of the general conditions of detention in all the cells in the detention facility and the allegation of severe overcrowding as the main characteristic of his detention conditions in all these cells warrant the examination of the applicant\u2019s detention from 25\u00a0July 2003 to date as a whole, without dividing it into separate periods (see, for similar reasoning, Guliyev v.

The Court does not lose sight of the Government\u2019s argument that certain aspects of the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention varied in different cells.

The courts assumed that the gravity of the charges carried such a preponderant weight that no other circumstances could have obtained the applicant\u2019s release. The Court has repeatedly held that, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of an accused absconding or reoffending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v. , 26 June 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 207; also see Panchenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a045100/98, \u00a7 102, 8\u00a0February 2005; Goral v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a038654/97, \u00a7 68, 30 October 2003; and Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081).",

The Court accepts that in cases concerning organised crime the risk that a detainee if released might put pressure on witnesses or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings is often particularly high. These factors can justify a relatively longer period of detention. However, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure (see Osuch v. Poland, no.\u00a031246/02, \u00a7\u00a026, 14 November 2006; and Celejewski v. Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 4\u00a0May 2006). Taking into account that the applicant was suspected of being an active member of an organised criminal group, the Court accepts that the authorities could justifiably consider that the risk of pressure on witnesses and jurors was initially present. However, the Court is not persuaded that that ground could in itself justify the entire five-year period of the applicant\u2019s detention. Indeed, the domestic courts referred to the risk of hampering the proceedings in a summary fashion without pointing to any aspect of the applicant\u2019s character or behaviour in support of their conclusion that he was likely to resort to intimidation. In the Court\u2019s view such a generally formulated risk may not serve as a justification for the applicant\u2019s detention for a period of more than five years. The domestic courts omitted to consider the fact that that ground inevitably became less and less relevant with the passage of time. The courts\u2019 reasoning did not evolve to reflect the developing situation and to verify whether at the advanced stage of the proceedings that ground retained its sufficiency. The Court is not therefore convinced that, throughout the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention, compelling reasons existed for a fear that he would interfere with witnesses or jurors or otherwise hamper the examination of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh the applicant\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

Indeed, that factor was relevant in assessing the danger of reoffending. Such a danger, if convincingly established, may lead the judicial authorities to place and leave a suspect in detention in order to prevent any attempts to commit further offences. It is however necessary, among other conditions, that the danger be a plausible one and the measure appropriate, in the light of the circumstances of the case and in particular the past history and the personality of the person concerned (see Clooth v. Belgium, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7\u00a040, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0225). In the present case the domestic courts did not specify the offence for which the applicant had been previously convicted, nor did they examine its nature and degree of seriousness. Such a brief and unelaborated reference to previous criminal record cannot be regarded as sufficient to establish the risk of reoffending, especially in the absence of any assessment of the defendant\u2019s personality. In any event, even assuming that the authorities could justifiably consider that such a risk was initially present, the Court is not persuaded that that ground could in itself justify the entire five-year period of the applicant\u2019s detention (compare Pihlak v. Estonia, no.\u00a073270/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a044 and 45, 21 June 2005).",

The Court reiterates that it is not its task to assume the place of the national authorities who ruled on the applicant\u2019s detention or to supply its own analysis of facts arguing for or against detention (see Nikolov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a038884/97, \u00a7\u00a074, 30\u00a0January 2003, and Labita, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0152).
