France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999-V, and Mifsud v. France (dec.), no. 57220/00, \u00a7 15, ECHR 2002VIII). In the present case the Government omitted to comment on the efficiency of the remedy they suggested. They did not explain how the lodging of a complaint against the Ministry of Finance could have put an end to the continued non-enforcement of the judgment or what kind of redress the applicant could have been provided with as a result of the action. Even if the applicant had obtained a judicial decision confirming that the non-enforcement was unlawful in domestic terms, the outcome of such a claim would only have produced repetitive results, namely a writ of execution requiring the Ministry of Finance to proceed with the enforcement of the original judgment (compare, among many others, Yavorivskaya v. Russia (dec.), no. 34687/02, 13 May 2004). The Court dismisses the Government\u2019s objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",
