The purpose of Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body before they have had the opportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems (see Remli v. France, judgment of 23 April 1996, Reports 1996-II, p.\u00a0571, \u00a7 33, and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR\u00a01999-V).",

Furthermore, the Court notes that the application of the rule of exhaustion must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to establish. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Cardot v. France, judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 18, \u00a7\u00a034). The rule is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically. In reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each case. This means, amongst other things, that the Court must take realistic account of the general legal and political context in which the remedies operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant (see Mente\u015f and Others v.

The Contracting States are left a choice between two categories of authorities. It is implicit in such a choice that these categories are not identical. However, the Convention mentions them in the same phrase and presupposes that these authorities fulfil similar functions (see Schiesser v.

The Court has found before (see Svipsta, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a086 and 87) that the wording of this provision was so vague that is raised doubts as to its precise implications and was open to more than one interpretation. It did not clearly state that there was a requirement to keep the defendant in detention, still less that it was possible to do so without a warrant. In this respect the Court considers that in reality the automatic extension of the applicant's pre-trial detention during this period of time was the result of a generalised practice on the part of the Latvian authorities which had no precise basis in legislation and had clearly been designed to compensate for the deficiencies in the Criminal Procedure Code (see Svipsta, cited above, \u00a7\u00a087).",

A child born out of such a relationship is ipso jure part of that \u201cfamily\u201d unit from the moment and by the very fact of his birth (see Keegan\u00a0v. Ireland, judgment of 26 May 1994, Series A no.\u00a0290, pp.18-19, \u00a7\u00a044).

Secondly, the law must be accessible and, thirdly, the law must be formulated in such way that a person can foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action will entail (see Silver, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a087 and 88).",
