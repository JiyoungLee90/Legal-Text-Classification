It also recalls that lack of medical treatment in prison may raise an issue under Article 3. In such cases, the factors to be considered are the seriousness of the applicant\u2019s condition, the quality of medical care he receives and whether his state of health is compatible with detention. Also, there remains the State\u2019s obligation to maintain a continuous review of the detention arrangements employed with a view to ensuring the health and well-being of all prisoners, having due regard to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment. However, it cannot be said that the execution of detention on remand in itself raises an issue under Article 3 of the Convention.

Thus, the period of examination of an appeal against this decision will not necessarily entail a breach of this provision, even though the same period of time might not be considered reasonable with regard to proceedings before a first-instance authority. It should also be borne in mind that the applicant retained the right to submit a further application at any time (see, mutatis mutandis, Letellier v.
