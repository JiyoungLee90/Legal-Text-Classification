Whereas the Centre examined the long-term effects which the separation from her father might have on M.M. (see paragraph 20 above), the legitimate interest of the applicants in developing and sustaining a bond with M.M. were not considered. In this connection the Court reiterates that the likelihood of family reunification will be progressively diminished and eventually destroyed if the biological father and the child are not allowed to see each other at all, or only so rarely that no natural bonding between them is likely to occur (see, mutatis mutandis, G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc v. Germany, no.\u00a074969/01, \u00a7 46, 26\u00a0February 2004). Similar considerations apply to the second and third applicants, who had the right, as established by the domestic authorities, to maintain a normal grandparent-grandchild relationship through contacts between them.",

However, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see De Souza Ribeiro v.

This was so because both the Centre and the Ministry of Justice declined jurisdiction in this respect. Accordingly, the system of administrative enforcement of administrative decisions specified under the Administrative Proceedings Act (see paragraphs 40-44 above) could not have been set in motion. In this connection the Court underlines that the Government did not bring to the Court\u2019s attention any special piece of legislation or domestic practice regarding which body had competence for the administrative enforcement of the Centre\u2019s contact orders. This issue remained open in the applicants\u2019 case notwithstanding the mechanism for resolution of conflicts of jurisdiction between administrative bodies provided for by the domestic law (see paragraphs 36 and 37 above). In so far it concerns enforcement by bailiffs, the Court is not convinced, and the Government did not provide any comments to the contrary, that the enforcement machinery provided for in the Enforcement Act (see paragraph 46 above) applied to the Centre\u2019s access orders. It is so since that machinery concerns enforcement of court judgments or administrative decisions that provide for a pecuniary obligation, which was not the case with the Centre\u2019s contact orders. In such circumstances the Court cannot but note that there was no effective remedy under domestic law for the applicants\u2019 complaint about the non-enforcement of the Centre\u2019s contact orders in respect of M.M.",
