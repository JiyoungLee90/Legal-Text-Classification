VIII Ips 3/2006 of 7 November 2006 the Supreme Court noted that the opinions of the disability commissions had the nature of expert opinions (izveden\u0161kih mnenj) only in pre-judicial proceedings within the Institute itself but not in judicial proceedings, where an expert opinion should be impartial; this meant that it could not be given by a party to the proceedings. In the case under consideration by the Supreme Court, the lower courts had treated the disability commission\u2019s opinion as decisive evidence in determining the appellant\u2019s ability to work and thereby upheld the decision of the opposing party (that is to say the Institute). The Supreme Court found that in respect of the nature of such opinions it had been inappropriate for the first-instance court to order an additional opinion from the disability commission and to dismiss the appellant\u2019s application for the appointment of an independent expert. It further found it unacceptable that the lower courts had relied, in determining the relevant facts, on an opinion of the expert body of one of the parties to the proceedings. Since the claimant had explicitly opposed this and had requested the appointment of an independent expert, the first-instance court should have allowed her request. The Supreme Court also observed that there had been discrepancies in the medical documentation and that the question of what had been the category of the appellant\u2019s disability had remained open. In its view, this question had not been properly addressed by the lower courts, which had instead relied on the additional opinion of the disability commission. In view of the foregoing, the Supreme Court found a violation of the appellant\u2019s right to be heard and to participate in the proceedings.",

Referring to, inter alia, the principles set out in the case of Koro\u0161ec, cited above, it found a violation of Article 22 of the Constitution (equal protection of rights). In particular, it considered arbitrary the lower courts\u2019 finding that the disability commissions\u2019 opinions constituted public certificates (javne listine) and that their accuracy was therefore to be presumed until disproved. It also found a violation of Article 22 on account of the lower courts\u2019 conclusion that the complainant\u2019s statements at the hearing and the opinions of the disability commissions had sufficed to establish that there had been no physical impairment. It noted in this connection that the Institute\u2019s disability commissions were expert bodies of the Institute, which acted as one of the parties to the proceedings, and could not therefore be considered impartial (nepristranski). The Constitutional Court further noted that in the circumstances of the case the medical assessment had played a decisive role and that the lower courts had not had sufficient medical expertise to establish whether a physical impairment existed. Thus, by refusing the complainant\u2019s request for the appointment of an independent medical expert the lower courts had divested the applicant of any possibility of an effective defence against the finding of the expert bodies of the opposing parties, which were decisive for the administrative decisions challenged in the domestic proceedings.",

These bodies were not appointed as experts by the court, but had provided the expert opinions for the purpose of the administrative decisions which had subsequently been challenged in the judicial proceedings. The opinions concurred that the applicant did not suffer from a physical impairment within the meaning of the List and was therefore not entitled to a disability allowance (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above).",

It is true that in its decision the court made certain references to its own observations regarding the applicant\u2019s condition (see paragraph 13 above).

On the contrary, in the instant case no procedural shortcomings were alleged to have occurred either before the first-instance disability commission or the second-instance disability commission (the administrative or \u201cpre-judicial\u201d proceedings), nor before the Ljubljana Labour and Social Court or the Higher Labour and Social Court (the judicial, or \u201cjudicial-review\u201d, proceedings).

The possibility of renewal of the experts\u2019 appointment leaves them even more susceptible to the interests of the Institute (see paragraph\u00a029). Furthermore, these experts are embedded in the organisational structure of the Institute and are bound by, inter alia, its acts, recommendations and practice (see paragraph 30 of the judgment). Their neutrality can be seriously called into question for these reasons even in the absence of any concrete evidence of actual bias on their part. The majority simply disregarded these facts.

The applicant did not raise an issue regarding the subjective impartiality of the individual experts, but clearly raised an issue about the lack of objective impartiality of the disability commissions or, to put it differently, about the lack of institutional impartiality of the experts working in these commissions, which had impacted on their assessment of her physical disability. Throughout the domestic proceedings the applicant disputed the findings of the disability commissions and alleged that her condition amounted to a physical impairment, an assertion which she intended to prove by way of the appointment of an independent expert (see paragraphs\u00a0 9, 12, 15 and 18 of the judgment). Her request that the domestic court appoint an independent expert was therefore not frivolous. The Labour and Social Court\u2019s refusal on the grounds that the appointment of an independent expert would be unnecessary (see paragraph 14 of the judgment) meant that the applicant, herself lacking the necessary medical knowledge, was left with no opportunity to substantiate her application for a disability allowance. The Higher Labour and Social Court\u2019s confirmation of that refusal on the grounds that the decision on disability would have been the same had an expert been appointed (see paragraph 16 of the judgment) assumed, to the detriment of the applicant, what had to be demonstrated. This is precisely the type of presumption in favour of the disability commissions\u2019 opinions that the Constitutional Court criticised (see paragraph 33 of the judgment).",

The practice of distinguishing is a rather subtle technique which does not allow for boundless judicial discretion. In law, to distinguish a case means that a rule or principle set out in a similar precedent case will not apply due to significantly different facts between the two cases.",

Hence, the fact that the applicant had or had not submitted a medical opinion or any other evidence was irrelevant for the decision of the Court. Let me put this even more clearly. In Koro\u0161ec, the Court was crystal-clear about the unacceptable role of the experts of the disability commissions, and in particular the decisive nature of their opinions. On this basis alone the Court found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention. The fact that in Koro\u0161ec the applicant had submitted an opinion by a general practitioner was not a decisive, important, significant fact. It was not even mentioned, let alone evaluated, in the reasoning of the \u201cCourt\u2019s assessment\u201d part of the judgment (see Koro\u0161ec, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 49-57).",

That is exactly what the majority failed to do, and by failing to do so they delivered a serious blow to the consistency and coherence of the Court\u2019s case-law. Worse still, they overruled valid case-law delivered by this Court against the respondent State and later confirmed against another State (see Letincic, cited above, and Krunoslava Zovko, cited above), without any regard for Article 30 of the Convention. This blunt inconsistency in the case-law warrants the intervention of the Grand Chamber. If this case is not referred to the Grand Chamber and accepted by its panel under Article 43 (3) of the Convention, the domestic authorities will find themselves lost in the middle of confusing and contradictory case-law of the Court, and even worse, the authority of the Grand Chamber and ultimately of the Court will be seriously damaged (on the respect due to the precedential force of the Court\u2019s judgments see my separate opinion in Herrmann v. Germany [GC], no. 9300/07, 26 June 2012).",

The argument as to the lack of impartiality of in-house experts working in these commissions is even more compelling when the extra-judicial evidence they produce is accorded decisive weight by the courts. In the present case the majority conceded that the expert opinions provided by the disability commissions had had a decisive role in the domestic courts\u2019 assessment of the merits of the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraph 50 of the judgment). Having no medical qualifications, the domestic judges were bound to attach significant weight to the disability commissions\u2019 opinions on a medical issue decisive for the outcome of a case (see Koro\u0161ec, cited above, \u00a7 56).",

Given the lack of any explanation as to the judge\u2019s medical expertise regarding the disability issue at stake, it is rather odd that the domestic court was ready to replace the opinion of an independent expert with the judge\u2019s own observations (see paragraph 13 of the judgment; see also the Constitutional Court\u2019s opinion in the similar case referred to in paragraph 33 of the judgment). The Ljubljana Labour and Social Court furthermore referred to certain findings in proceedings that had taken place more than five years prior to the applicant\u2019s request for a disability allowance. However, as the applicant highlighted in her appeal, those proceedings concerned a different issue. Unfortunately, this point remained unaddressed by the Higher Labour and Social Court.",

What is more, the fairness of the judicial proceedings was itself compromised by the domestic courts\u2019 reliance on the disability commissions\u2019 opinions as decisive evidence in the case, given the Institute\u2019s role in the judicial proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Sara Lind Eggertsd\u00f3ttir v.

If referred to the Grand Chamber under Article 43 of the Convention, this case should indeed be accepted by the Grand Chamber panel in order to reinstate the relevant precedent of Koro\u0161ec.
