The official investigation into the incident was initiated only on 19 May 2007, nine days after the receipt of the applicants\u2019 complaint. From the very beginning the applicants alleged that their relative had been arrested on 28\u00a0April 2007 in  with two other men and then taken to the premises of either the UBOP or the Sovietskiy ROVD. Despite the fact that they received this information immediately, the investigators neither examined the crime scene at the place of the arrest, nor checked the registration logs of arrestees in the law-enforcement agencies where he had been allegedly taken but merely interviewed the applicants and two security guards (see paragraphs 29-33 above). It is noteworthy that even at a later date, in July 2007, when they had obtained the information that Ramazan Umarov\u2019s detention was recorded in the registration log of the Sovietskiy ROVD for 28 April 2007, the investigators failed to take all possible measures to follow up on this information, limiting themselves merely to sending a request for information (see paragraph 61 above). Moreover, from the documents submitted it follows that in spite of numerous witness statements given by Mr S.S., Mr M.R., several local residents and the policemen who had participated in the special operation on 28 April 2007, the investigators failed to take any steps to conduct an identification parade including the officers who arrested Mr S.S. and Mr\u00a0M.R. in order to find out where the policemen could have taken Ramazan Umarov from the flat in Salavatova Street. The Court also notes that in addition to the number of witnesses directly pointing out that the applicants\u2019 relative was arrested with the two other men, the investigators, once they had obtained statements from the car park security staff and the phone numbers of the people who had contacted the applicants after the abduction, had failed to take any measures at all to follow up on these leads; nor did they follow up on the information relating to the perpetrators\u2019 identities which was provided to the investigators by the second applicant (see paragraph 82 above).",

In the absence of any explanations for the above shortcomings, the Court concludes that the authorities failed to demonstrate diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious matter (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",
