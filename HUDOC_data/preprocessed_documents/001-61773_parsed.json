However, as transpires from the file, during these periods the domestic court took some action and waited for expert opinions to be prepared. While the Court notes that the expert\u2019s work in the context of judicial proceedings was supervised by a judge, who remained responsible for the preparation and speedy conduct of proceedings (see, the Proszak v.\u00a0Poland judgment of 16\u00a0December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII, \u00a7 44), it does not find that the delays in question were unreasonably long. The overall unacceptable length of the proceedings resulted rather from the conduct of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, which had been examining the applicant\u2019s appeal and cassation appeal for fourteen and thirty months respectively. The Court agrees that\u00a0some delays in the procedure before the Supreme Court could be explained by the fact that, during the material time the Supreme Court had to deal with an increased workload and that subsequently the authorities had taken remedial actions (see, Kepa v. Poland (dec), no.\u00a043978/98, 30\u00a0September 2003). Nevertheless, in the present case, the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal lay dormant in the Supreme Court for thirty months which constitutes an unreasonable delay.",
