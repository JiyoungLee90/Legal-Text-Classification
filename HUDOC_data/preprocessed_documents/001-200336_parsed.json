The child care authority noted that the girl had lived in Germany until being taken to Lithuania and that I.R. had kept the child in Lithuania unlawfully. The child care specialists had talked to I.R., but could not persuade her to return the child to Germany and had concluded that the child had not yet reached an age at which it would be reasonable to hear her opinion. The child care specialists noted, on the one hand, that the child had been examined, on I.R.\u2019s initiative, by child development specialists at Vilnius University Hospital, and those specialists had considered that separation of the child from her mother and brother at that moment would negatively affect the girl\u2019s emotional health and potentially cause problems for her development. On the other hand, there was no proof that the first applicant would not be capable of taking care of his daughter or that any other kind of harm might be caused to her upon her return to Germany. The child care specialists also pointed out that, pursuant to Article 11 \u00a7 4 of Regulation (EC) No.\u00a02201/2003, \u201ca court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of Article 13 (b) of the 1980 Hague Convention if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return\u201d (see paragraph 150 below). Accordingly, even if the court were to establish that there was a substantial risk that the girl would sustain psychological harm if returned to Germany, it should in addition verify whether German institutions would take appropriate measures to protect the girl\u2019s interests after her return. It also transpires from the documents in the case that the representatives of the State Child Rights and Adoption Service reiterated that view during the court hearing.",

As to E.M., he had a psychological ailment and refused to return to Germany, and I.R. could not leave him alone in Lithuania.

The Court of Appeal noted that although I.R., who at that stage was represented by a lawyer K.L., had taken her daughter to Lithuania lawfully \u2212 because she had the father\u2019s agreement \u2212 her choice not to return the child to Germany and instead to keep her in Lithuania was unlawful both under Article 3 of the Hague Convention and under Article\u00a02 \u00a7\u00a011 of Regulation (EC) No.\u00a02201/2003. Such unlawful retention of the child in a place which was not her habitual place of residence breached the custody rights of the first applicant, who had taken care of the second applicant before she was taken to Lithuania and who intended to continue taking care of her in future. The first applicant noted that on 2 January 2007 the criminal proceedings against I.R. had been discontinued in Germany and that, since those proceedings had been brought on the basis of a private prosecution, they could not be repeatedly reopened.",

In order to bring this about, the Hague Convention placed at the head of its objectives the restoration of the status quo, by means of \u201cthe prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State\u201d (paragraph\u00a015 of the View). A principle which underpinned Regulation (EC)\u00a0No.\u00a02201/2003 as a whole was that of cooperation and mutual confidence between the courts and authorities of the Member States, which implied that decisions of the courts of the Member State of the child\u2019s habitual residence should in principle be recognised and enforced automatically (paragraph 18 of the View). The Advocate General also noted that \u201cthe fundamental significance of this principle was brought into focus at the hearing when counsel for [I.R.] suggested that the Lithuanian courts might consider that the objectivity of the German courts was not guaranteed in a dispute between a German father and a Lithuanian mother\u201d. For the Advocate General, \u201cit was clear that to allow recognition to be refused on the basis of such doubts (whether they were or were not in fact felt by the Lithuanian courts) would negate the whole system which the Regulation seeks to establish\u201d (paragraph 19 of the View).",

It is clear that the Convention and the Regulation are based on the principle that, in the event of a child\u2019s wrongful removal or retention, his or her superior interests do indeed always require that return, except only in certain clearly-defined situations set out in Articles 13 and 20 of the Convention (read, in so far as Article 13(b) is concerned, in conjunction with Article\u00a011(4) of the Regulation). That, it seems to me, is perfectly coherent, and even necessary. A child can have no interest in being dragged from one Member State to another by a parent in quest of the court which he or she supposes will be the most sympathetic to his or her cause. I would add that a return to the Member State of habitual residence does not necessarily imply the child\u2019s return to the home of the parent left behind, or separation from the abducting parent. Those are separate questions, to be decided by the competent court, which must take account of all the emotional, psychological and material aspects of the situation and which must, in deciding, accord paramount importance to the child\u2019s superior interests.\u201d",

Next, it appeared to be common ground that the child had indeed been wrongfully retained for the purposes of the Hague Convention (Article\u00a03) and Regulation (EC)\u00a0No\u00a02201/2003 (Article 2(11)). At the time when the mother had announced her intention not to return to Germany with the child, custody rights had actually been exercised by both parents jointly, by virtue of German law, and the father had consented only to a two-week trip to Lithuania (paragraphs 27 and 28 of the View). In the Advocate General\u2019s view, once seised, the Lithuanian court had in principle been required to order the child\u2019s return. It should also have issued its judgment no later than six weeks after the application was lodged. The only grounds on which it could have refused to order the child\u2019s return were those set out in Article 13 of the Hague Convention (paragraph 33 of the View). The Advocate General thus stated:",

The ECJ noted that the Regulation complements the provisions of the 1980 Hague Convention, which nevertheless remains applicable (paragraph\u00a053 of the ECJ\u2019s judgment). It then held, inter alia, that procedural steps which had been taken in the Member State of enforcement after a non-return decision had been given were not decisive and could be regarded as irrelevant for the purposes of implementing the Community regulation in question (paragraph\u00a080 of the ECJ\u2019s judgment). If the position were otherwise, there would be a risk that the Regulation would be deprived of its useful effect, since the objective of the child\u2019s immediate return would remain subject to the condition that the redress procedures allowed under the domestic law of the Member State in which the child was being wrongfully retained had been exhausted. That risk should be particularly balanced because, where young children were concerned, biological time could not be measured according to general criteria, given the intellectual and psychological structure of such children and the speed with which that structure develops (paragraph 81 of the ECJ\u2019s judgment). Since no doubt had been expressed as regards the authenticity of the certificate issued by the German court and since it had been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Regulation, opposition to the recognition of the decision ordering return was not permitted and it was for the Lithuanian court merely to declare the enforceability of the certified decision and to allow the immediate return of the child (paragraphs 89 and 109 of the ECJ\u2019s judgment).",

The first applicant also underlined that the conclusion which the Supreme Court had ordered the State Child Rights and Adoption Service to produce was related to the factual circumstances of the case and their evaluation. The first applicant pointed out that, under Article\u00a0353 \u00a71 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Supreme Court was bound by the facts as they had been established by the first-instance and appellate courts (see paragraph 136 below). Accordingly, it was not the Supreme Court\u2019s function to examine the factual circumstances of the case even if they were mentioned in an appeal on points of law or a response to it.

The first applicant also emphasised that none of the parties to the civil proceedings (namely himself, the Prosecutor General, and I.R.) had asked the Supreme Court to order such a fresh conclusion by the State Child Rights and Adoption Service.

The State Child Rights and Adoption Service was party concerned in those proceedings. Relying on the ECJ\u2019s preliminary ruling, the Supreme Court pointed out that once a court of the child\u2019s country of origin had taken a decision for that child\u2019s return and issued a certificate as set out in Article\u00a042 of Regulation (EC) No.\u00a02201/2003, a court in the State in which execution of that decision had been requested could only pronounce (tik paskelbti) that other court\u2019s decision and grant the request to return the child without delay. In the light of the ECJ\u2019s preliminary ruling, the Supreme Court also held that the Lithuanian courts did not have jurisdiction to review the German courts\u2019 decisions on the basis of which a certificate for the child\u2019s return had been issued. Moreover, as explained by the ECJ, once a certificate under Article\u00a042 of Regulation (EC) No.\u00a02201/2003 had been issued in the child\u2019s state of origin [Germany], [any] court decisions taken in the State where the child was residing [Lithuania], would have no effect on its validity or its enforcement.

In that context the Supreme Court also pointed out that in their request to reopen the civil proceedings in the case which had been terminated by the 15 March 2007 Court of Appeal ruling, I.R. and the Prosecutor General had relied on Article 366 \u00a7 1 (2 and 9) of the Code of Civil Procedure, that is, that new circumstances had come to light which could not have been known when the case was heard initially and that there had been a clear error when applying the law. Regarding the first ground, the Supreme Court held that the fact that the child would be in unfamiliar linguistic environment if she were to be returned to Germany did not correspond to any of the cases mentioned in Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention. Because of her young age she would have the capacity to learn another language, and mere immersion in another linguistic environment could not be seen as causing the child physical or mental harm within the meaning of Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention. As to I.R.\u2019s argument that her son\u2019s health would deteriorate upon the second applicant\u2019s return to Germany, that contention was not related to any potential harm to the child who was to be returned \u2013 the second applicant. Moreover, the circumstances regarding I.R.\u2019s son\u2019s ailment had been known from the very beginning of the court proceedings for the second applicant\u2019s return.

The Supreme Court however pointed out that the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court and the Court of Appeal \u2212 both during the proceedings for the second applicant\u2019s return (see paragraphs 17 and 19-21 above), and when adopting decisions refusing the reopening of court proceedings in the already terminated case (see paragraphs 66, 68 and 77 above) \u2212 had not established any exceptions which would permit the non-return of the child on the basis of those two international Conventions.

According to I.R.\u2019s own testimony, she had not been preparing the child for her return to Germany, nor had she visited psychologists so that the girl could be prepared for going to live with her father. The prosecutor also noted I.R.\u2019s statement to journalists when asked what she planned to do when the time came for her daughter to go to Germany, namely \u201cThere are various ways. We will be together with Luisa. I will fight until the end\u201d. For the prosecutor, this showed that I.R. had no intention of executing the court decision and returning the child to her lawful custodian. That being so, it had to be concluded that the first applicant had not caused major damage to I.R., who had no custody rights.",

In fact, it had been the actions of I.R. that had been obstructive and provocative, since she had prevented the first applicant from properly taking care of his child. The prosecutor also concluded that the first applicant\u2019s actions on 20\u00a0October 2008 were to be considered as spontaneous, taken so as to avoid calamity and physical violence which would only have harmed the child\u2019s interests or prevented the execution of the court decision. Even if the child had been taken away suddenly and might have been stressed during the journey, the psychological report ruled out any negative and lasting consequences of the action, and currently her situation was deemed very good.

A request for return of a child who had been brought to Lithuania or held there unlawfully had to be examined within the timelimits set out in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No.\u00a02201/2003 [that is, within six weeks] (Article 2 \u00a7 5 of the aforementioned Law). When examining such a request, a regional court with jurisdiction for the child\u2019s last known place of residence was to act as the court of first instance (Article\u00a02\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02).

Its function was to provide a conclusion (i\u0161vada) regarding the child\u2019s return when such a dispute was heard by a court (Article\u00a02 \u00a7\u00a03). The Law also read that certificates issued in accordance with Articles\u00a041 and 42 of the Regulation in a Member State were considered as valid enforcement orders (Article\u00a03 \u00a7\u00a01).",

Latvia ([GC], no.\u00a027853/09, \u00a7\u00a035, ECHR 2013), the Explanatory Report on the 1980 Hague Child Abduction Convention \u2012 prepared by Elisa P\u00e9rez-Vera and published by The Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH) in 1982 \n(hereinafter\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u201cthe P\u00e9rez-Vera Report\u201d) \u2012 seeks to throw into relief the principles which form the basis of the 1980 Convention and to supply to those who must apply it a detailed commentary on its provisions. It appears from this report that, in order to discourage the possibility for the abducting parent to have his or her action recognised as lawful in the State to which the child has been taken, the 1980 Convention enshrines, in addition to its preventive aspect, the restoration of the status quo, by an order for immediate return of the child, which would make it possible to restore the situation that had been unilaterally and wrongfully changed. Compliance with custody rights is almost entirely absent from the scope of the 1980 Convention, as this matter is to be discussed before the relevant courts in the State of the child\u2019s habitual residence prior to removal. The philosophy of the Hague Convention is to fight against the multiplication of international abductions, based always on a wish to protect children by acting as interpreter of their real interests. Accordingly, the objective of prevention and immediate return corresponds to a specific concept of \u201cthe child\u2019s best interests\u201d.",

Naturally, a refusal to restore a child to its own environment after a stay abroad to which the person exercising the right of custody had consented must be put in the same category. In both cases, the outcome is in fact the same: the child is taken out of the family and social environment in which its life has developed. What is more, in this context the type of the legal title which underlies the exercise of custody rights over the child matters little, since whether or not a decision on custody exists in no way alters the sociological realities of the problem.",

Although primarily intended for the new Contracting States and without binding effect \u2012 especially in respect of the judicial authorities \u2012 this document seeks to facilitate the Convention\u2019s implementation by proposing numerous recommendations and clarifications. The Guide repeatedly emphasises the importance of the Explanatory Report to the 1980 Convention (the P\u00e9rez-Vera Report), in helping to interpret coherently and understand the 1980 Convention (see, for example, points 3.3.2 \u201cImplications of the transformation approach\u201d and 8.1 \u201cExplanatory Report on the Convention: the P\u00e9rez-Vera Report\u201d). In particular, it emphasises that the judicial and administrative authorities are under an obligation, inter alia, to process return applications expeditiously, including on appeal (point\u00a01.5 \u201cExpeditious procedures\u201d). Expeditious procedures should be viewed as procedures which are both fast and efficient: prompt decision-making under the Convention serves the best interests of children (point 6.4 \u201cCase management\u201d). The Guide to Good Practice specifies that delays in the enforcement of return orders, or their non-enforcement, in certain Contracting States are matters of serious concern, and recommends that States Parties ensure that there are simple and effective mechanisms to enforce orders for the return of children within their domestic systems, noting that the return must actually be effected and not just ordered (point\u00a06.7 \u201cEnforcement\u201d) (see X v.

By 2016 though, the mother had unlimited interaction with the child, who spent every alternate weekend and half of the German school holidays with I.R. This was possible because, in spite of all previous allegations and statements before the Lithuanian courts, the child\u2019s mother had in fact moved back to Germany in 2010, had married there for the third time and was now living in the same town as the first applicant. The son, whom I.R. had asserted that she could not take with her to Germany and could not leave in Lithuania, had been left in Lithuania in 2010.

The case, involving such complex questions of law and a sensitive factual situation, posed many questions even for professional judges. Needless to say that somewhat wider repercussions in the media and by politicians had been inevitable. However, professional judges were both required and perfectly able to dissociate themselves from that kind of material and from all external influences of whatsoever nature. Even so, they could not ignore I.R.\u2019s arguments, since she was one of the parties in the civil case, and to do so would have risked possibly undermining her interests. The Government also considered that the materials of the case did not substantiate the applicants\u2019 allegations about the possible politicisation of the case or undue influence on the courts, or those courts being biased against the first applicant. In fact, given the seriousness of the case, the courts had given careful scrutiny to both parties\u2019 complaints and had employed every possible measure, including referral to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling, in order to arrive at lawful and wellfounded decisions. During the court proceedings in Lithuania the first applicant had been represented by a professional lawyer of his choice and had also been fully involved in those proceedings, taking part in the court hearings, and submitting claims and appeals. Moreover, most of the bailiff\u2019s decisions had been in the first applicant\u2019s favour, rather than in favour of I.R. The applicant\u2019s allegation that the decision-making in his case had been unfair was therefore merely his subjective perception. The Government thus were of the view that the fact that the case was of great interest to society, the media and politicians did not necessarily mean that it had been politicised, or that the courts which heard the case had been anything other than impartial and independent.

Moreover, the child\u2019s best interests, also in the light of Article 13 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Hague Convention, had been the principle guiding the Lithuanian courts, which, in the Government\u2019s view, had acted promptly in adopting their final decisions. In fact, as early as November 2006 the State Child Rights and Adoption Service had submitted to the Klaip\u0117da District Court the conclusion that the return of the second applicant would not breach her interests, and it had maintained that position throughout the court proceedings \u2212 a position that favoured the first applicant\u2019s interests rather than those of I.R. However, the mother had shown \u201chostility and resistance\u201d and made \u201cextraordinary efforts\u201d, having recourse to each and every legal remedy available to her, submitting convincing arguments which the courts found themselves obliged to verify.

Contrary to the first applicant\u2019s beliefs, I.R. had concluded a contract for her representation with a private lawyer (see paragraph 25 above) in\u00a0May 2007, whereas her meetings with the Minister of Justice had taken place only later (see paragraphs 52, 56 and 62 above). For the Government, and in any event, the State guaranteed legal aid so that individuals would not be prevented from seeking justice even if they had no financial means. Moreover, under Article\u00a050 of Regulation (EC) No.\u00a02201/2003 the first applicant would have been eligible for free legal aid in Lithuania, but he had chosen to hire a private lawyer instead (see paragraph 150 above).",

However, if a serious and substantiated complaint is raised before them to the effect that the protection of a Convention right has been manifestly deficient and that this situation cannot be remedied by EU law, they cannot refrain from examining that complaint on the sole ground that they are applying EU law (see Avoti\u0146\u0161, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116).",

Those experts in fact stated that the second applicant\u2019s return to Germany would not place her in an intolerable situation, provided that her interests were protected upon her return to Germany, whilst also pointing out the absence of any proof that the first applicant would be incapable of taking care of his daughter (see paragraph\u00a015 above). In this context the Court also reiterates its position that the exceptions to return under the Hague Convention must be interpreted strictly. Thus the harm referred to in Article\u00a013\u00a0(b) of the Hague Convention cannot arise solely from separation from the parent who was responsible for the wrongful removal or retention. This separation, however difficult for the child, would not automatically meet the grave risk test. Indeed, as the Court concluded in the case of X v. Latvia, the notion of \u201cgrave risk\u201d cannot be read, in the light of Article\u00a08 of the Convention, as including all the inconveniences linked to the experience of return: the exception provided for in Article 13 (b) concerns only the situations which go beyond what a child might reasonably bear (see X v. Latvia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116, see also G.S.\u00a0v.\u00a0Georgia, no.\u00a02361/13, \u00a7 56, 21 July 2015, with further references).",

The appellate court held that the retention of the child outside her habitual place of residence in Germany was wrongful within the meaning of Article\u00a03 of the Hague Convention. The court underlined that the criminal proceedings against I.R. had been discontinued in Germany, and that it had no reason to doubt that the German courts could properly evaluate the factual circumstances relating to the question of custody. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal also pointed out that questions relating to the child\u2019s custody were separate from those regarding the child\u2019s return (see paragraph 19 above). This is also supported by the Court\u2019s own case-law, which has consistently held that issues of custody and access are not to be intertwined in Hague Convention proceedings (see Maumousseau and Washington v.

On the other hand, they had a procedural obligation towards I.R. to effectively examine plausible allegations that returning the second applicant to Germany would expose her to psychological harm, particularly in the light of I.R.\u2019s claim that she could not follow the second applicant to Germany for fear of prosecution, as well as the need to procure and examine the evidence from the child care authority concerning the impact of the child\u2019s separation from her mother.

The first applicant arrived in Lithuania to take part in those proceedings. As long as those proceedings were not suspended, which was on 22\u00a0October 2007 (see paragraph 73 above), the bailiff proceeded with the enforcement of the writ. However, either I.R. could not be found or \u2013 for instance in September 2007 \u2212 refused to disclose the child\u2019s whereabouts, thus further aggravating the two applicants\u2019 situation by denying the first applicant any contact with his daughter (see paragraphs 28-31 above; also see point 6.8 in paragraph 149 above). The child\u2019s mother instead chose to put all her efforts into garnering public and institutional support for the idea that \u201cin Lithuania mother and child were sacred and inseparable\u201d, an idea which, in her view, had up to that point not been properly considered by the courts (see paragraphs 58 and\u00a061 above).",

The Court particularly notes the statements made by child care professionals, firstly the Ombudsman for Children\u2019s Rights, R.\u0160., revealing that \u201cfrom the very beginning the position of the Ombudsman\u2019s Office was that the child should be with the mother\u201d, and that \u201cwe should search for ways and possibilities to let [the children] remain in Lithuania\u201d (see paragraph 49 above). In similar vein, the director of the Klaip\u0117da child care authority, whose position as regards the applicants\u2019 reunion apparently remained unchanged, confessed to the press that she had tried to persuade the first applicant to renounce his custody rights, but had been unsuccessful (see paragraph 60 above; about her earlier statements see paragraph\u00a036 above). This, for the Court, appears to have been particularly inappropriate, given the maxim that the personnel dealing with the Hague Convention questions should be professional, objective and not be influenced by issues of nationalism, gender or any other prejudice (see point\u00a02.4.5 of the Guide to Good Practice under the Hague Convention in paragraph 149 above).",

It points to the statements by certain members of the Seimas who openly questioned the lawfulness of the court judgments, considering that they lacked \u201celementary logic\u201d and were \u201cnot humane\u201d, and also asked the Minister of Justice to respond (see paragraph\u00a051 above). Likewise, the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Human Rights expressed the hope that the courts would have the \u201cdecency to reopen the case\u201d for the second applicant\u2019s return should the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office request such reopening (see paragraph 48 above). The Committee and its Chairman also asked the Ministry of Justice to help I.R. in a way that would see the case moved from the German courts to Lithuania (see paragraphs 47 and 48 above). It is also clear that these questions had been discussed by I.R. and the Minister of Justice (see paragraph 56 above). It further transpires that the Minister of Justice encouraged such doubts and kept hope alive in I.R.\u2019s mind for some time, because even after meeting her in summer 2008 he stated that it was important to endorse the Supreme Court\u2019s hesitation as to whether German courts had jurisdiction in her case (see paragraph 62 above). The Court finds that such statements can only be seen as calls to establish \u201cartificial jurisdictional links\u201d to legalise the unlawful factual situation brought about by I.R. (see points 11-14 of the P\u00e9rez-Vera report, cited in paragraph 147 above).",

The Court is mindful that the members of the Seimas exercised their right to challenge, in the procedure of abstract review of constitutionality, the compliance of Lithuanian legislation with the Constitution granted to them under domestic law. However, it is plain that the Seimas members\u2019 request for such a Constitutional review was tailored to the specific situation of the second applicant, since they openly stated that the reason for it was \u201cthe German courts\u2019 decisions\u201d which led to \u201cour Lithuanian children ... [being] taken away to foreign countries\u201d (see paragraph 42 above). It is true that the initiative by the Seimas members did not come to fruition. However, the Constitutional Court discontinued the legal proceedings regarding the constitutionality of that act on the grounds that a new Law on Implementation of the EU Regulation had been passed (see paragraphs 43 and 134 in fine above).",

As correctly noted by the Government (see paragraph\u00a0180 above), at the very beginning of the Lithuanian court proceedings under the Hague Convention for the second applicant\u2019s return, the State Child Rights and Adoption Service had submitted to the Klaip\u0117da District Court the conclusion that it would be in the child\u2019s best interests to return to Germany. The child care experts supported this view at the Klaip\u0117da District Court hearing (see paragraph 15 above), and the Court of Appeal was of the same view in its final decision of 15\u00a0March 2007 (see paragraph 19 above). However, according to the documents in the Court\u2019s possession, that institution and its employees were later severely criticised by politicians who not only interrogated them in person, but also publicly rebuked them for having been \u201cambivalent\u201d, \u201cunpatriotic\u201d, \u201clacking simple humanity\u201d, and being \u201cstubborn\u201d for not having \u201cdefended a Lithuanian citizen\u201d (see paragraph 46 above). On this last point the Court points out that at the time it was only I.R. who had Lithuanian citizenship, which allows it to conclude that the politicians\u2019 remarks implied that the State Child Rights and Adoption Service\u2019s employees should defend her, notwithstanding the principle that it was the best interests of the child which should prevail.",

It is also plain that the politicians\u2019 statements were not without purpose, since they clearly pointed out that the State Child Rights and Adoption Service\u2019s conclusions \u201caffected court decisions\u201d, and that it was therefore paramount for those conclusions to be \u201cjust\u201d and accurately reflect the \u201csocial situation\u201d of the second applicant as perceived by those politicians (see paragraphs 38 and 45 above). The Seimas Committee on Human Rights as a body, as well as parliamentarians acting by themselves, went as far as to urge the State Child Rights and Adoption Service\u2019s employees to \u201cwash off [their] tainted tunic\u201d (see paragraph 46 above), also suggesting that their superiors at the Ministry of Social Security and Labour should examine whether those employees were fit for their duties (see paragraph 38 above) and should also order those employees to produce another conclusion, which would be objective in those politicians\u2019 view (see paragraph 45 above). The Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Human Rights also expressed the hope that those employees would \u201cobey\u201d the instructions from the Ministry (see paragraph 48 above).

Indeed, the politicians had not shied away from making statements suggesting that the second applicant\u2019s return to Germany and her separation from her mother and brother would put her in an intolerable situation and possibly cause her irreparable damage (see paragraphs 38 and 45 above), whereas it is the immediate return of the abducted child that prima facie corresponds to the specific concept of \u201cthe child\u2019s best interests\u201d (see paragraph 146 in fine above; see also point 1.5.3 of the Guide to Good Practice under the Hague Convention in paragraph\u00a0149 above). In this context, the Court particularly notes the inappropriate stance of the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Human Rights, who, notwithstanding the domestic and international courts\u2019 decisions long in force, suggested that the first applicant should move to Lithuania on the grounds that I.R. had been \u201ca mother beyond reproach\u201d and the second applicant would not then be separated from her mother and her brother (see paragraph\u00a063 above). The Court observes that those statements by the said politician were made already after and notwithstanding the ECJ\u2019s preliminary ruling, and also after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, pursuant to which I.R. should have executed the German courts\u2019 decisions and returned the second applicant to Germany (see paragraphs 106 and 107 above).",

Although the Government pointed out that both the first applicant and I.R. had private lawyers during the court proceedings in Lithuania, which for the Government showed that they were on an equal footing, the Court cannot entirely agree with this. Firstly, it points to the public statements made by the Minister of Justice that the Stateguaranteed legal aid office should guarantee I.R. free legal assistance, as far as possible (see paragraph 52 above). Taken in the context of other public remarks made by the Minister of Justice (see paragraph 62 above) as well as declarations by other politicians that the Court has already considered, such statements could not have instilled in the first applicant much confidence in the Lithuanian legal system.",

It is apparent from I.R.\u2019s lawyer\u2019s statements to the press that his position was one of support for I.R.\u2019s argument that the second applicant should stay with her in Lithuania (see paragraph 101 above). This fact is also confirmed by the Advocate General in her View (see paragraph 98 above). I.R. had also declared that the ECJ was her last hope (see paragraph 96 above). Neither can the Government argue before this Court that granting money to pay for I.R.\u2019s lawyer\u2019s services in the Luxembourg Court was beneficial for the Lithuanian legal system, in the light of their argument that the applicants\u2019 case set a precedent regarding how such cases were to be handled in Lithuania in future (see paragraph 178 above). It is sufficient to note that the Lithuanian Government\u2019s interests in Luxembourg in fact were represented by the European Law Department (see paragraph 101 above), whatever its position may have been. That being so, the Court cannot but conclude that, notwithstanding the principle that the rights of the spouses in the family are equal (see paragraph 130 above), by having financially supported one of the spouses the State of Lithuania thus acted on her behalf.",

The Court\u2019s role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to issues of evidence and proof. The Court adopts those conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts in their entirety and from the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. It has been the Court\u2019s practice to allow flexibility in this respect, taking into consideration the nature of the substantive right at stake and any evidentiary difficulties involved. In certain instances, only the respondent Government have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting the applicant\u2019s allegations; consequently, a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti, non neganti, incumbit probatio is impossible (see, mutatis mutandis, Baka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0143, with further references, and, mutatis, mutandis, Merabishvili v.\u00a0Georgia [GC], no.\u00a072508/13, \u00a7\u00a0311, 28\u00a0November 2017, and the case-law cited therein; in this context also see paragraph\u00a0196 above).",

In the Court\u2019s view, having regard to the sequence of events in their entirety, rather than as separate and distinct incidents, there is prima facie evidence of politics being involved in the applicants\u2019 case (see, mutatis mutandis, Baka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0148). This is corroborated not only by I.R.\u2019s own admission (see paragraphs 61 and 110 above), but also by the numerous documents submitted by the applicants which refer to a widespread political onslaught against the first applicant so that he would \u201cdesist\u201d (see paragraph 171 above) from his efforts to be reunited with his daughter in Germany.

It goes without saying that their efforts, aimed at creating a negative atmosphere around the legal actions of the first applicant and constituting direct attempts to interfere in those proceedings, were unacceptable in a system based on the rule of law. The Court also finds that those activities undoubtedly alerted the judges and other officials that their steps in the applicants\u2019 proceedings were being closely monitored, which it finds particularly worrying (see, mutatis mutandis, Kinsk\u00fd v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a042856/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a095 and 98, 9\u00a0February 2012).

On this last point the Court notes that, as stated by the applicants, after the second applicant\u2019s return to Germany and over a period of time, normal communication between the child and both of her parents had been restored with the help of the German authorities (see paragraph 177 above).

In the circumstances of this case, and taking into account the actions of the bailiff who attempted to execute the Court of Appeal decision for the second applicant\u2019s return, the Court is also prepared to accept that, until he was prevented by the President of the Supreme Court on 22\u00a0October 2007 (who unilaterally adopted a ruling suspending the execution of the Court of Appeal decision of 15\u00a0March 2007; see paragraphs\u00a034 and 73 above), the bailiff acted in the two applicants\u2019 interests with the requisite diligence (see paragraphs 28-31 above). The Court also notes that when attempting to execute the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision for the second applicant\u2019s return, the bailiff did not give up in the face of I.R.\u2019s failure to cooperate but instead took the procedural measures which were available to him, announcing a search for I.R., and thus circumventing her avoidance of the return order (see paragraph 29 above; also see point 6.8 of the Guide to Good Practice under the Hague Convention, cited in paragraph 149 above).

In this connection the Court is mindful of the P\u00e9rez-Vera Report which highlighted the fact that, in situations such as the one at hand, it is the hope of the person who is responsible for the child\u2019s unlawful removal from or non-return to his or her habitual residence to obtain a right of custody from the authorities of the country to which the child has been taken. It also frequently happens that the person retaining the child tries to obtain a judicial or administrative decision from the State of refuge which would legalise the factual situation which he or she has brought about (see points 11 and 14 of the report, cited in paragraph 147 above). Likewise, as stated by the Advocate General, \u201ca child can have no interest in being dragged from one Member State to another by a parent in the quest for a court which he or she supposes will be the most sympathetic to his or her cause\u201d (see point 88 of the Advocate General\u2019s View, cited in paragraph 99 above).

The Court notes the applicants\u2019 position that the President of the Supreme Court misused his powers in order to help I.R. (see paragraphs 74 and 75 above). In this context the Court observes that in July 2008 the Supreme Court asked the child care authority to provide a fresh report on the second applicant\u2019s situation (see paragraph 104 above). However, this was a matter concerning questions of fact and not those related to the points of law, only the latter falling within the Supreme Court\u2019s competence under domestic law (see paragraphs 136-138 above). Most of this had already been pointed out by the first applicant, who also underscored that the suspension of the court decision for transfer would further aggravate the applicants\u2019 situation, since it meant that they would not see each other, a development which, taking into account the second applicant\u2019s young age, was detrimental to their relationship and placed the child in an intolerable situation (see paragraph 74 above). However, the first applicant\u2019s attempts to challenge the ruling of the President of the Supreme Court, also drawing his attention to the harm that the two applicants\u2019 separation from each other might cause, were futile (see paragraphs 74 and 75 above).",

In the circumstances, the Court cannot but agree with the applicants\u2019 view that by using an interlocutory decision to undermine the validity of the main court decision (see paragraphs 19-21 above) the President of the Supreme Court used the reopening procedure as a disguised appeal in order to undermine the res judicata principle (contrast Vilenchik, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055), thereby halting the execution of that main court decision.",

The Court observes, however, that the first applicant, who by that time had sole rights of custody over the second applicant (see paragraph\u00a092 above), had in fact arrived in Lithuania as early as 24\u00a0September 2008. He had not only liaised with the bailiff over the transfer (see paragraph 112 above) but had also been in contact with the child care authorities and psychologists, and had sought to communicate with the child, in order to avoid having the court decision executed by force (see paragraphs 120 in limine, 121, 122 and 127 above).",

Given the background as to how the case had been handled in Lithuania up to that point, the Court understands the first applicant\u2019s statement that he thought he would have had to wait a number of years to be reunited with his daughter if he had not acted as he did (see paragraph 114 above).",

She had also asserted not having \u201claid down [her] weapons\u201d (see paragraph 110 above), notwithstanding that 20\u00a0October 2008 was the date set for the child\u2019s transfer by the bailiff (see paragraph 127 above). The Court also notes that the first applicant\u2019s fears that the court decisions \u2012 even those reached in Lithuania by the Supreme Court on 25\u00a0August 2008 \u2012 did not provide a sufficiently sound basis for him to be reunited with his daughter in Germany, which could be illustrated, inter alia, by the fact that the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Human Rights suggested that I.R. had been \u201ca mother beyond reproach\u201d and that the first applicant should move to Lithuania (see paragraphs 63 and 205 above), and this despite the fact that he had already been vilified and demonized there (see paragraph 80 above). The Court observes that it was in these circumstances that the first applicant had acted in an extemporaneous fashion and taken the second applicant away with him (see paragraphs 112 and 113 above). The Court notes that, although the first applicant had sole custody rights in respect of the second applicant, after taking her with him to Germany he was pursued by Lithuanian police officers and I.R. (see paragraph 114 above), and also had to face criminal proceedings in Lithuania, during which certain coercive measures \u2013 such as the European Arrest Warrant \u2013 were ordered against him by the Lithuanian authorities (see paragraph\u00a0116 above). All this was on the basis of the Lithuanian prosecutor\u2019s understanding that by taking the second applicant with him to Germany the first applicant had breached I.R.\u2019s rights, even though she had no custody rights in respect of her daughter at that time (see paragraph\u00a092 above). A month later the decision to detain the first applicant was quashed by the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court (see paragraph 117 above) and one year later the Lithuanian prosecutor discontinued the proceedings by observing the German and Lithuanian courts\u2019 decisions regarding the applicants\u2019 right to be reunited and stating that the first applicant\u2019s actions did not amount to a crime (see paragraphs 125-129 above). Even so, the Court does not need to take a position on the first applicant\u2019s actions on 20\u00a0October 2008 and related subsequent developments (see paragraphs\u00a0112 and 113 above).",

As noted by the applicants in their observations to the Court, the second applicant led a fulfilling life in Germany and because of her \u201cself-moderation\u201d, I.R. was also able to move to Germany and to share in her daughter\u2019s life, having left her son, who by that time was a grown-up, in Klaip\u0117da, with whom she has regular contact (see paragraph\u00a0177 above). It is not for the Court to speculate on whether this fact alone refutes the arguments employed by I.R. during the court proceedings held in Lithuania between 2006 and 2008, as the two applicants have suggested. Even so, the Court gives certain weight to the applicants\u2019 submission that this \u201cselfmoderation\u201d on the part of I.R. would hardly have been possible during the years when the Lithuanian authorities, both political and legal, demonstrated persistent support to her and even misled her about the possibility of retaining the second applicant in Lithuania, and regardless of the German and Lithuanian court decisions and Lithuania\u2019s international obligations (see paragraphs\u00a0197-208 above, also see Avoti\u0146\u0161, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046-49).",

Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7\u00a056, ECHR 2000XI, with further references). The Court cannot neglect the particularly complex nature of this case, the exceptional nature of which was also acknowledged by the Government (see paragraph\u00a0179 above), and it therefore accepts that it was necessary for the first applicant to engage the services of all those lawyers specialising in private international, European Union and Lithuanian civil and criminal law who represented the first applicant before the Lithuanian civil courts and the European Court of Justice, and who also assisted him with regard to the criminal proceedings opened against him in Lithuania. The Court does not regard the sum of EUR 10,925 for the services of the applicant\u2019s German lawyer with regard to the proceedings before the Court as excessive (see, for example, Koch v. Germany, no. 497/09, \u00a7\u00a7 92-94, 19 July 2012). That being so, and in the light of the documents in its possession, the Court grants the applicants jointly a sum of EUR\u00a076,089 and EUR\u00a010,925 for the legal costs in the domestic and Court proceedings. The Court also awards the applicants EUR\u00a06,216 in respect of the remaining costs and expenses.",
