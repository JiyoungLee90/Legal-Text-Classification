Turkey, 30\u00a0January 1998, \u00a7 33, Reports 1998-I; Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, \u00a7 100, ECHR 1999-III; and Lykourezos v. Greece, no. 33554/03, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2006-VIII). The right to stand as a candidate in an election, which is guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a01 and is inherent in the concept of a truly democratic regime, would be illusory if one could be arbitrarily deprived of it at any moment. Consequently, while it is true that States have a wide margin of appreciation when establishing eligibility conditions in the abstract, the principle that rights must be effective requires that the eligibility procedure contain sufficient safeguards to prevent arbitrary decisions (see\u00a0Podkolzina\u00a0v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a046726/99, \u00a7\u00a035, ECHR 2002-II). Although originally stated in connection with the conditions on eligibility to stand for election, the principle requiring prevention of arbitrariness is equally relevant in other situations where the effectiveness of individual electoral rights is at stake, and the Court has consistently stressed the need to avoid arbitrary decisions and abuse of power in various electoral contexts and has emphasised that the relevant procedures for such decisions must be characterised by procedural fairness and legal certainty (see, mutatis mutandis, Kovach v. Ukraine, no. 39424/02, \u00a7 55, ECHR\u00a02008-...; Namat Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, no. 18705/06, \u00a7 72, 8 April 2010; and Petkov and Others v.

In particular, he had obtained statements from the local housing authority that two of the authors of the original statements to the police ( and T.T.) had not been residents of the area in question and could not be identified. Based on this, he argued that the evidence against him had been \u201cfabricated\u201d and that the Court of Appeal had inexplicably failed to seek the attendance of these persons or to seek an explanation from the police as to who they were. Furthermore, he submitted notarised affidavits by three of the other authors of the original statements to the police, in which they retracted their original statements and described the circumstances in which they claimed they had been tricked by the police into making them. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the above information discloses the appearance of an incomprehensive review of evidence by the lower court and supports the applicant\u2019s argument that, in so far as he was unable to procure and present the above information at the Court of Appeal hearing because of the unreasonable time-constraints created by that court, he was not afforded sufficient safeguards against arbitrariness. Accordingly, these submissions concerned not only the allegedly wrong assessment of the facts by the lower court, but also, quite importantly, the procedural shortcomings having led to such wrong assessment. Nevertheless, despite having competence to review procedural defects committed by lower courts, the Supreme Court refused to take these submissions into account, relying irrelevantly and formalistically on its lack of competence to deal with questions of fact. In essence, the Supreme Court ignored all of the applicant\u2019s points of appeal and failed to detect and put right any of the procedural defects committed by the lower court.",
