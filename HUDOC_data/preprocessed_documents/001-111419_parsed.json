However, the Court is of the opinion that the main obstacle to the enforcement was the criticism in the registrar\u2019s letter of the impugned court decision on grounds that it was deficient in terms of its substance as it neither indicated the size of plot no. 604 nor specified its category: agricultural or non-agricultural. The Court shares the applicants\u2019 opinion that the registrar thus de facto imposed on them an obligation to initiate new proceedings for rectification of the impugned judgment. Hence, the issue here is whether the obligation to produce a rectified judgment unduly prevented the applicants from having the final binding judgment in their favour enforced.",

It therefore considers that the Government must secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the domestic court\u2019s final judgment (see among other authorities Apostol, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 72-73, and Teteriny v. , no. 11931/03, \u00a7 56, 30 June 2005).",

However, the Court has no doubt that the applicants must have been caused a certain amount of stress and frustration as a result of the non-enforcement of the judgment. The resulting non-pecuniary damage would not be adequately compensated by the mere finding of a violation. The Court thus awards each applicant EUR 2,000 for non-pecuniary damage.",
