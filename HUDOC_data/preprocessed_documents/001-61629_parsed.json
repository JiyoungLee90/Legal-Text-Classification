The primacy of a decision in a criminal case is not prescribed by law in the strict sense but derives from case-law. It is an absolute rule, binding not only on the parties to the criminal trial but also on third parties. As application of the rule is not mandatory on public policy grounds, this rule cannot be relied on by the prosecution or by the judge of his own motion. Decisions by investigating judges are not binding on the civil courts. Accordingly, the only criminal decisions which are binding are the final and irrevocable decisions of the trial courts. Moreover a civil court is bound only by \u201cfindings of a criminal nature\u201d: a civil court hearing a civil case will be bound by an acquittal, but not by that part of the criminal court's decision which deals with a claim for damages. Such \u201cfindings\u201d, namely the reasons and the operative part, must be \u201ccertain\u201d (which excludes findings expressed in doubtful or uncertain terms, except for acquittals \u201cfor lack of evidence\u201d which are binding on a civil court) and \u201cnecessary\u201d (what the judge must find to justify his decision \u2013 the elements of the offence, its classification, the aggravating circumstances which determine such classification, and the finding of guilt or not as the case may be).

Moreover, contrary to the Government's assertion, French law does not necessarily create a dichotomy between \u201ccivil-party proceedings\u201d and a \u201ccivil claim\u201d; the former is in reality only a type of the latter which is commenced by instigation or intervention.",

This consequence, though significant, constitutes only one aspect of civil-party proceedings by way of instigation, which are not thereby deprived of their \u201ccivil\u201d character. In this respect the Court notes that, in an earlier case against France, it agreed with the Government in finding that a civil party could not be regarded as the opponent of the prosecution, nor necessarily as its ally, given that their respective roles and purposes were clearly distinct (see Berger v. France, no.\u00a048221/99, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2002-X). In addition to what has been noted above, the Court also observes that the withdrawal of the victim's complaint does not bring the prosecution to an end, save in exceptional cases. Lastly, the Court notes that, in its Recommendation Rec(2000)19 on the role of public prosecution in the criminal justice system, adopted on 6 October 2000, the Committee of Ministers expressed the view that victims should be able to challenge decisions of public prosecutors not to prosecute by, inter alia, authorising parties to engage private prosecution (see paragraph 29 above).",

Thus, the right to have third parties prosecuted or sentenced for a criminal offence cannot be asserted independently: it must be indissociable from the victim's exercise of a right to bring civil proceedings in domestic law, even if only to secure symbolic reparation or to protect a civil right such as the right to a \u201cgood reputation\u201d (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, p. 13, \u00a7 27; Helmers, cited above, p.\u00a014, \u00a7 27; and Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 13\u00a0July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, p. 78, \u00a7 58).

Simply because the requirements inherent in the concept of a \u201cfair trial\u201d are not necessarily the same in disputes about civil rights and obligations as they are in cases involving criminal trials, as evidenced by the fact that for civil disputes there are no detailed provisions similar to those in Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 (see Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1993, Series A no. 274, p. 19, \u00a7 32) does not mean that the Court can ignore the plight of victims and downgrade their rights. In any event, the Code of Criminal Procedure, in a preliminary Article introduced by law no. 2000-516 of 15 June 2000, expressly sets out certain principles fundamental to criminal trials, including \u201ca balance between the rights of the parties\u201d and that the \u201crights [of victims shall be] safeguarded\u201d (see paragraph 19 above). Lastly, the Court draws attention for information to the text of Recommendations Nos. R (83) 7, R (85) 11 and R (87) 21 of the Committee of Ministers (see paragraphs 26-28 above), which clearly specify the rights which victims may assert in the context of criminal law and procedure.",
