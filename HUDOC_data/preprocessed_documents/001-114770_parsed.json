The guards caught them with alcohol very rarely and, as far as R.J.\u2019s recalled, the applicant had been sober at the time of the fight. R.J. also said that after the evening check-up, the guards carried out the first night-time check at around 11-12 p.m., and the second at a later time.",

The court also emphasised that the prison administration had properly executed its duties as concerns the placement of inmates. Both the applicant and R.J. had been serving a prison sentence for the first time, so they could be held in the same wing and section. As to the suggestion by the applicant\u2019s lawyer that the applicant had been moved from one part to another of the prison without a valid reason, the court held that \u201cthe applicant could have challenged those actions [but had failed to do so]\u201d. Moreover, the applicant himself had not been an exemplary prisoner and had been punished a number of times for breaching internal rules (ranging from alcohol consumption to leaving his living quarters). The court found weighty the prison administration\u2019s argument that the applicant had never approached them claiming, either verbally or in writing, that he was unsafe in prison in general or that he had had any conflicts with a particular inmate. Consequently, there were no grounds for finding the prison administration liable for not preventing the incident. According to the case-file, the fight was spontaneous and took place after the evening check-up, when all the inmates, including the applicant and R.J., should have been sleeping or at least in bed. Overall, there was no legal basis for granting the applicant\u2019s civil claims.",

The prisoners were allowed to move freely within the prison premises during the day; it was only at night that they had to stay within their living quarters. As concerned the alleged failure to guarantee that prisoners were \u201cproperly supervised\u201d, as had been suggested by the applicant, the requirement could not be understood as an obligation on the guards to ensure ceaseless supervision of every inmate. On the contrary, the term required that proper and adequate supervision should be put in place in general, which, in fact, had been done in the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s facility. Thus, supervision consisted of a number of measures, all aimed at ensuring the continuous supervision of inmates\u2019 behaviour, their isolation where necessary and the implementation of the prison regime requirements as well as preventing possible breaches of discipline and crimes, as provided for under the domestic legislation (paragraphs 29-31 above). The effectiveness and vigour of supervision in Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison was further illustrated by the fact that the applicant had been punished a number of times for different breaches of discipline. The guards\u2019 immediate reaction to the fight between the applicant and R.J. also confirmed that supervision had been organised properly and had enabled them to react to disorder.",

On this point they noted that the applicant had never informed the prison administration that he was in danger, even though in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Correctional Works, he had been entitled to lodge a complaint about the conditions of his detention, ask to be placed in isolation or even request a transfer to another correctional institution. Furthermore, contrary to the facts in Premininy v.\u00a0Russia (no. 44973/04, \u00a7 89, 10 February 2011), the circumstances of the instant case did not show that the applicant had been the subject of systematic attacks; the applicant\u2019s medical file contained no record of suspicious injuries at the relevant time.",

In the case of prisoners, the Court has stressed that States must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kova\u013ckovs v. Latvia (dec.), no. 35021/05, \u00a7 47, 31\u00a0January 2012).

In particular, it has held that to successfully argue a violation of his Article 3 right, it would be sufficient for an applicant to demonstrate that the authorities had not taken all steps which could have been reasonably expected of them to prevent real and immediate risks to the applicant\u2019s physical integrity, of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge. The answer to the question whether the authorities fulfilled their positive obligation under Article 3 will depend on all the circumstances of the case under examination (see Premininy, cited above, \u00a7 84). The Court therefore has to establish whether, in the circumstances of the present case, the authorities knew or ought to have known that the applicant was at risk of being subjected to illtreatment at the hands of his cellmate R.J., and if so, whether the administration of the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison, within the limits of their official powers, took reasonably available measures to eliminate that risk and to protect the applicant from abuse. In this context the Court also refers to the Recommendation Rec(2003)23 by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to the effect that the prison administration has an obligation to make careful appraisal to determine whether individual prisoners pose risk to themselves or others (see paragraph 34 above).",

In this connection, the Court recalls that by the time the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison authorities transferred the applicant to Wing 2, Section 2 of that institution on 22\u00a0November 2001, he had already been serving a custodial sentence in that prison for some five and half years. Accordingly, it could be reasonably assumed that by that time the applicant was well aware of the way of life in that prison. Even more critical for the Court is the fact that the applicant had been staying in Wing\u00a02, Section 2 for more than ten months before the fight between him and R.J. broke out (see paragraphs 7\u20139 above). Neither the applicant nor his lawyer have provided the Court with any material showing that, during those ten months in that section of the prison, the applicant had sustained any physical injuries.

The Court cannot subscribe to this thesis. It observes, firstly, that except for the testimony of R.J. during the civil proceedings, the documents submitted by the parties do not corroborate such a conclusion. Whilst it is not prepared to dispute the veracity of R.J.\u2019s statement, the Court likewise is reluctant to take it for the truth either. Accordingly, the Court is not ready to find that there were any solid reasons why the applicant\u2019s placement in that particular part of the prison inherently entailed a serious risk to his physical well-being (see, by contrast, Rodi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 70).",

Namely, the applicant had been convicted for a murder of a prostitute committed in a particularly cruel way, as well as for soliciting for prostitution. Consequently, it can very well be said that both the applicant and R.J. were of similar danger to others and to society. On this point the Court also notes that in the domestic proceedings the applicant\u2019s lawyer relied on the prosecutor\u2019s letter of 19\u00a0December 1994, which recommended that R.J. be held in isolation. For the lawyer, that was proof of R.J.\u2019s dangerous character. The applicant has not provided a copy of that letter to the Court, despite being specifically requested to do so, but has simply requested that the Government\u2019s arguments as to the content of the letter (see paragraph 44 above) be considered as unfounded. Although the content of the prosecutor\u2019s letter was not disclosed in the domestic court proceedings for damages, the Court considers that this was an opportunity for the applicant to prove his claim before the Court.

Taking into account the submissions by the Government and the testimony of the guards who appeared at the scene of the fight (see paragraphs 13 and 46 above), the Court lends a certain weight to the first part of the applicant\u2019s argument and cannot but condemn the situation. However, the Court considers that the question of alcohol abuse in prison is relevant, but not decisive, in that it is not for the Court to speculate whether alcohol consumption made one or another prisoner \u2013 R.J. in this particular case \u2013 more aggressive and prone to violence. More importantly, the Court observes that when convicting R.J., the trial court made no conclusive finding that he had been intoxicated when the fight broke out (see paragraph\u00a015 above). On this point the Court also reiterates that, in principle, and without prejudice to its power to examine the compatibility of national decisions with the Convention, it is not the Court\u2019s role to assess the facts which have led a national court to adopt one decision rather than another; otherwise, it would be acting as a court of fourth instance and would disregard the limits imposed on its action (see, mutatis mutandis, Kemmache v.  (no. 3), 24 November 1994, \u00a7 44, Series A no.\u00a0296C); G.N. and Others v. , no. 43134/05, \u00a7 89, 1 December 2009; and Papapetrou and Others v. , no. 17380/09, \u00a7 63, 12 July 2011). It follows that the applicant\u2019s argument that the prison administration must be held liable for inadequate supervision of inmates whose access to alcohol put at risk the physical well-being of other prisoners, cannot be upheld.",

It notes, firstly, that the dispute took place in the evening, after the evening check-up. The Court lends particular weight to the fact that, as R.J. testified during criminal proceedings, \u201cthe quarrel between [him] and the applicant had been spontaneous\u201d, \u201cthe fight had been short\u201d, and \u201cafterwards the guards had run in and it had all been over\u201d. The brief duration of the fight was also confirmed by another inmate, \u017d.K., who stated that \u201cthe conflict had happened very fast\u201d (see paragraph 14 above). That being the case, and taking into account the absence of any prior reported incidents that the applicant had encountered in Wing 2, Section 2, of the prison, the Court cannot hold the facility\u2019s administration responsible for not having prevented the outcome of the fight, which was clearly spontaneous (see, by converse implication, Premininy, cited above, \u00a7 89). While reiterating that it is the State\u2019s utmost responsibility to prevent and address violence among inmates in prisons (ibid., \u00a7 85), in the circumstances of the instant case the Court finds that the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison authorities had carried out regular risk assessment of the applicant and R.J. (see paragraph 10 above). It further notes that the fight took place immediately after the evening check-up and before the night-time check-up (see paragraphs 13 and 23 in fine above), the time-difference between the two being between one and two hours. Accordingly, the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison administration may not be reproached for making too few check-ups on inmates. Moreover, the applicant has not complained that after the fight broke out the guards\u2019 had failed to intervene promptly. On this issue the Court also reiterates its prior finding that the applicant had been residing in that unit of the prison for more than ten months before the incident took place without having raised any issues with the administration regarding his security.",

After he received disciplinary punishments, his behaviour improved a little. He is friendly with the other convicts. Does not take part in communal activities.

That position is shared by the Committee against Torture, the United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. As one of the most important practical aspects of the positive obligation of States Parties to protect the physical and psychological wellbeing of inmates under the Convention, the obligation to provide an individual sentence plan is an obligation of result which is imposed on States Parties, independent of the inmate\u2019s wishes. The inmate\u2019s adherence to and cooperation with the sentence plan should be promoted, but his or her rejection of or indifference to it does not release the State from the duty to prepare, implement and review the individual sentence plan.

When a person dies or is injured in State custody, there is a rebuttable presumption of State responsibility. The respondent State must, of its own motion, provide unequivocal evidence that it lacks responsibility in order to rebut that presumption, which it did not do in the instant case. On the contrary, the facts and omissions mentioned above, compounded by the respondent State\u2019s contradictions, confirm the said presumption. The highly explosive cocktail of circumstances present in Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Prison in 2002 \u2013 such as the lack of any meaningful sentence plan, the wrongful allocation decision in respect of the applicant, the unsafe custodial environment and the delayed reaction to a serious internal incident \u2013 lays the basis for imputing responsibility to the respondent State. Against this background, the national authorities knew, or ought to have known, that their conduct could have tragic consequences. Therefore, the causal relationship between the prison authorities\u2019 conduct and the extremely serious consequences of the incident of inter-prisoner violence is undeniable and, accordingly, I conclude that the respondent State breached the applicant\u2019s right to physical integrity guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention.",
