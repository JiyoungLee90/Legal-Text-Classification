The procedure in the cases in question consisted of the following. The public-interest immunity material was made available to the trial judge in the ex parte procedure, and the judge would decide whether any of the confidential material would assist the defence, in particular to argue the point of entrapment, in which case it would be obliged to order its disclosure. The Court found, in particular, that the issue of entrapment, if determined by the trial judge who also decided upon the guilt or innocence of the accused, was too closely related to the essence of criminal charges to exclude the defence from full knowledge of all material to which the prosecution had access (ibid.). Subsequently, the Court examined (in the context primarily of Article 5 \u00a7 4, but also of Article 6) the possibility of using special advocates to counterbalance the procedural unfairness caused by lack of full disclosure in national-security cases but also found such an approach to be capable of upsetting equality of arms, depending on the importance of the undisclosed material to the outcome of the trial (see A. and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 205 et seq.).",

Until 28 January 2005 the applicant was preparing the sale, acting as an intermediary between S., the supplier, and . According to the applicant\u2019s own testimonies in court, her first encounter with the FSB undercover agent B. took place on 29 January 2005, immediately before the test purchase. By that stage the FSB already possessed recordings of her conversations with S., which had taken place between 23 and 27 January 2005, concerning the ongoing drug sale. It follows from that account that the FSB agent B. stepped into the transaction when it was already under way. Therefore, as far as B.\u2019s role is concerned, it is beyond doubt that he merely \u201cjoined in\u201d the criminal acts rather than instigated them.",

It should accordingly have verified, by assessing the information in the case file and, if necessary, reviewing the relevant materials concerning the undercover operation and examining the officials and other individuals involved, whether Vladimir had been primed by the FSB to approach the applicant and ask her to sell drugs.",

No such link \u2013 or indeed the existence of any such person \u2013 was established as a result. The Court does not consider that questioning T., another FSB agent, would have provided the applicant with additional means of arguing her point. It likewise considers legitimate the court\u2019s refusal to allow access to the recordings of the test purchase on the ground that this was superfluous since the fact that the applicant had sold the drugs was not in dispute. Finally, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, the Court accepts that no recordings existed of the applicant\u2019s conversations with the FSB agents.",
