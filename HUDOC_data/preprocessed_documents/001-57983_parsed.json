At all events, on the 13th the defence had other means available to them for clearing up the difficulty, namely asking the presiding judge to exercise his discretion to order that Mrs M. should be heard, or else applying for evidence to be taken. If even those applications had been refused, the defence could have acted on those refusals accordingly, but for tactical reasons they decided otherwise. The Chamber (see paragraph 48) criticises the  for not having made any check. In so doing, it runs the risk of substituting it own assessment of the facts for that of the national court, especially as the nature and bearing of the \"hypothetical\" remark have not been made explicit in the judgment.

Every Contracting State has to be given all possible opportunities \"of preventing or putting right the violations alleged\" as stated in Cardot v. France judgment of 19 March 1991 (Series A no. 200, p. 19, para. 36), which was preceded by the dictum in De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium (judgment of 18 November 1970, Series A no. 12, p. 29, para. 50) \"to put matters right through their own legal system\".  Given the rigidity of the rules of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, I am of the opinion that the application of Article 26 (art. 26) was more impellent than ever, in a matter such as the one under consideration, which, potentially, can be taken to be of not infrequent occurrence in criminal trials before assize courts in . My view of the matter is strengthened by the further consideration that the Assize Court could have easily replaced one juror by a supplementary one unless it felt that it could not do this within the ambit of the Code of Criminal Procedure unless directly or indirectly, by implication, it had a direction by, or through, a decision of the Court of Cassation.",

The circumstance, in my opinion, when considered against the background of the proceedings taken as a whole (see Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v.
