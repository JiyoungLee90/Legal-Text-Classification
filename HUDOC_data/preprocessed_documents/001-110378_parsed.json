The rule is based on the assumption that the domestic system provides an effective remedy in respect of the alleged breach. The burden of proof is on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that an effective remedy was available in theory and in practice at the relevant time; that is to say, that the remedy was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Mirazovi\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 13628/03, 6 May 2006).",

It did so on the basis of the Opinion of the Ministry for Social Affairs of 7 March 2003, which Opinion was itself reaffirmed by the subsequent Opinion of the Ministry for Labour, Employment and Social Policy of 18 June 2004 (see paragraphs 13 and 29 above). Both of these Opinions stated, inter alia, that the pension system in Serbia was based on the concept of \u201congoing financing\u201d. This meant that since the Serbian authorities have been unable to collect any pension insurance contributions in Kosovo as of 1999, persons who had already been granted SPDIF pensions in Kosovo also could not continue receiving them. The Court therefore considers that no administrative remedy within the competence of the SPDIF at various levels, be it an appeal or a request for the re-opening of proceedings, or, indeed, any other remedy addressed to the said ministries, could be deemed effective in the specific circumstances of the present case. It is irrelevant, in this context, that a number of persons in the applicants\u2019 situation would appear to have continued receiving their SPDIF pensions, given that this seems to have occurred on a non-transparent basis.",

Under the Convention system, it is thus for those authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. Moreover, the notion of \u201cpublic interest\u201d is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws concerning pensions or welfare benefits involves consideration of various economic and social issues. The Court accepts that in the area of social legislation including in the area of pensions States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation, which in the interests of social justice and economic well-being may legitimately lead them to adjust, cap or even reduce the amount of pensions normally payable to the qualifying population. However, any such measures must be implemented in a non-discriminatory manner and comply with the requirements of proportionality. Therefore, the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in the choice of policies should be a wide one, and its judgment as to what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d should be respected unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see, for example, Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], cited above, \u00a7 61; Andrejeva v.
