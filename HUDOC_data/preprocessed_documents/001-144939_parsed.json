The Government were of the view that the allegations submitted by the applicant were of a general nature and did not call for a hearing. Moreover, according to them the Local Court assessed the police officer\u2019s statement as credible and trustworthy. In this regard, the applicant failed to submit any evidence that might have shown that she had not committed the minor offence. In the proceedings involving requests for judicial review the reversed burden of proof applies. Thus, the applicant should have indicated specifically what evidence was to be produced and what she sought to prove through the production of such evidence.

In that case, the applicant did not request an oral hearing; however, he challenged certain factual aspects of the case which called for direct assessment of the evidence at an oral hearing. In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant requested judicial review alleging that she was not the person that verbally assaulted police officer S. Thus she contested the facts established by S. The Local Court, however, heard only S. Therefore, regardless of the fact that the applicant did not request a hearing the Court is of the view that the Local Court could not, as a matter of fair trial, have properly determined the facts or the applicant\u2019s guilt without a direct assessment of the evidence at an oral hearing.",
