In Rustavi no. 1 Prison, an open-type prison, the applicant was allowed six hours\u2019 outdoor exercise on a daily basis, whilst in Rustavi no. 6 Prison, a closed institution, he had been allowed at least a one-hour walk per day. On the basis of the relevant service provider contracts, the Government further argued that the food available to the applicant in both establishments was prepared in accordance with the legally approved norms, and that the applicant was regularly provided with the basic items of hygiene. In sum, the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention were compatible with Article 3.",
