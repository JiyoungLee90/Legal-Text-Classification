This involved public authorities entering into contracts for the provision of over-priced services so that the provider of the services could transfer a portion of the sums paid to third parties in order to cover the costs of the activities in question. The practices concerned consisted in negotiating and signing contracts for various opinion polls or surveys to be conducted mainly by \u201cI\u201d for the \u201cbenefit\u201d of government ministries. The prices stipulated in these contracts were too high in relation to the real cost of the surveys carried out and their likely benefits.

Any judicial authority had to be subject to procedures intended to guarantee the integrity of its decisions to the persons within its jurisdiction and to safeguard the right to due process, a principle which the House of Representatives had fully understood in 1865. The fact that there was no statute governing procedure had in the present case led the Court of Cassation to establish an ad hoc procedure, making up for Parliament's failure to legislate. By laying down the applicable procedural rules itself, even by analogy, the Court of Cassation had manifestly disregarded the principle of the separation of powers as regards enactment and application of the criminal law. Even though, by a process of elimination, the procedure followed by the Court of Cassation could not be anything other than the procedure laid down for the criminal courts, this was not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of an accessible and foreseeable procedure.",

However, assisted by his counsel and his lawyers, Mr Co\u00ebme was not in total ignorance of the procedural rules which would be applied during the trial. He could not have been unaware that the procedure of the ordinary criminal courts would probably be followed, as this could have been inferred from legal theory and case-law, although this was limited to the Court of Cassation's judgment of 12\u00a0July 1865 (see paragraph 79 above). He could also have deduced this from Article 7 of the Law of 19 June 1865, even though that law had been enacted only to deal with a specific set of circumstances. The Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation apparently reached that conclusion himself and advised the representatives of some of the applicants accordingly at the interview on 3 November 1995. When the trial opened on 5 February 1996 (see paragraph 41 above) the President of the Court of Cassation himself confirmed that the procedure of the ordinary criminal courts would be followed, announcing that the case would be tried in accordance with the provisions of Article 190 of the Code of Criminal Investigation.",

The express purpose of that obligation was to preserve the Administrative Jurisdiction and 's monopoly over interpretation of the Constitution and to avoid any risk of arbitrary assessment in this respect by the court dealing with the case concerned. The arbitrariness of the refusal to submit the preliminary questions was also evident from the flagrant contradictions in the judgments of the Court of Cassation and the submissions of its Principal Public Prosecutor, on which the Court of Cassation had based its decision. Further, their applications had manifestly constituted exercise of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention, since their purpose was precisely to submit to a relevant authority the question of violations of rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention (Articles 6 and 14) and the Belgian Constitution.",

In the Belgian system, courts were required in particular to verify whether the alleged violation of Articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution was indeed the result of a legal rule which could be submitted to the scrutiny of the Administrative Jurisdiction and  in accordance with the Special Law of 6 January 1989. The applicants' complaints concerned the way Article 26 \u00a7 2 of the Special Law on the Administrative Jurisdiction and  should be interpreted. In raising that issue, they were asking the Court to re-examine a point that was a matter for domestic law only, and was therefore not within its jurisdiction. Even though it had been challenged, the Court of Cassation's decision not to refer the preliminary questions proposed was reasonable and not in any way arbitrary, so that it could not be in breach of Article 6 of the Convention.

It further refers to its case-law to the effect that the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access is one aspect, is not absolute; it is subject to limitations permitted by implication, in particular where the conditions of admissibility of an appeal are concerned, since by its very nature it calls for regulation by the State, which enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in this regard (see, among other authorities, the Brualla G\u00f3mez de la Torre v. Spain judgment of 19\u00a0December 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, p. 2955, \u00a7 33). The right to have a preliminary question referred to a court cannot be absolute either, even where a particular field of law may be interpreted only by a court designated by statute and where the legislation concerned requires other courts to refer to that court, without reservation, all questions relating to that field. As the Government submitted, it is in accordance with the functioning of such a mechanism for the court to verify whether it is empowered or required to refer a preliminary question, first satisfying itself that the question must be answered before it can determine the case before it. However, it is not completely impossible that, in certain circumstances, refusal by a domestic court trying a case at final instance might infringe the principle of fair trial, as set forth in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, in particular where such refusal appears arbitrary (see Dotta v. Italy (dec.), no. 38399/97, 7\u00a0September 1999, unreported, and Predil Anstalt S.A. v. Italy (dec.), no.\u00a031993/96, 8 June 1999, unreported).",

They observed, firstly, that on 3 November 1995 the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had held a meeting at which he informed the participants that the proceedings would be conducted according to the ordinary rules of the Code of Criminal Investigation; this was confirmed at the first hearing held by the Court of Cassation. That meant that he had previously been at least informed of the Court of Cassation's decision as to the procedure to be followed. Secondly, referring to the role traditionally played by the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, which the Court had had occasion to assess when dealing with the Delcourt, Borgers, Vermeulen and Van Orshoven cases (see the judgments in the cases of Delcourt v.\u00a0Belgium, 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11; Borgers v. Belgium, 30\u00a0October 1991, Series A no. 214-B; Vermeulen v. Belgium, 20 February 1996, Reports 1996-I; and Van Orshoven v. Belgium, 25 June 1997, Reports 1997-III), and particularly the traditional practice whereby the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office participated in drafting the court's judgments, they observed that the confusion between the respective roles of the Court of Cassation and the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office there was particularly striking. The Government would find it hard to prove that any measures whatsoever had been taken to establish the necessary distance between the Court of Cassation and the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office there \u2013 the prosecution in the present case. They noted on the contrary that during the trial the representatives of the Principal Public Prosecutor had taken their places in the raised part of the courtroom on the same level as the judges and used to enter and leave the hearing room in the company of the judges of the Court of Cassation. They likewise considered it symptomatic that the names of the persons composing the Court of Cassation and the representatives of its Principal Public Prosecutor were listed in the same paragraph in the hearing records (see paragraph 52 above) and that the Court's judgment reproduced the prosecution pleadings practically word for word.",

That practice had ceased on the very day of the Borgers judgment (in criminal cases) and the Vermeulen judgment (in civil cases). The Government noted, firstly, that the Court of Cassation had not yet been constituted on 3 November 1995; the nineteen judges (fifteen ordinary members and four substitutes) had not been appointed until a few weeks before the first hearing on 5 February 1996. It had therefore been materially impossible for the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office to be informed of the procedure chosen by a court not yet constituted. It was, however, obvious that the procedure mentioned by the Principal Public Prosecutor was the only one possible and foreseeable. The Government also observed that the two members of the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office had not sat on the same bench as the Court of Cassation itself but had a separate seat facing the seat of the two registrars and closer to the bar of the court than to the judges' bench. Moreover, throughout the trial and the judges' deliberations, these two officers of the court had avoided all contact with the court when not in hearings. Lastly, the Court of Cassation had on several occasions given a clear sign of its independence vis-\u00e0-vis the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office. In particular, on 12 February 1996, according to Mr\u00a0Javeau and Mr Stalport themselves, it had asked the Principal Advocate-General to confine his remarks to the facts of the case and not make submissions for the prosecution (see paragraph 50 above) and it had not accepted the prosecution's suggestion that the defence case should be heard before the prosecution's (see paragraph 51 above). The similarities between the judgment and the prosecution's submissions did not justify a legitimate doubt about the Court of Cassation's impartiality.",

France judgment of 20 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, pp. 1030-31, \u00a7 58). Only the second test is relevant in the instant case. In this respect, however, even appearances may be of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public and above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused (see, among other authorities, the Hauschildt v.

In deciding whether there is a legitimate reason to fear that a court lacks independence or impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see, mutatis mutandis, the Hauschildt judgment cited above, p. 21, \u00a7 48, and the Gautrin and Others judgment cited above, pp. 1030-31, \u00a7 58).",

It would appear in fact that this information was supplied at a time when the judges who would try the case had not yet been designated and had not yet had the opportunity to consider the question which arose in that respect on account of Parliament's failure to legislate. Moreover, there is no justification for the concerns about the existence of certain relations of subjection or dependency between the Court of Cassation and its Principal Public Prosecutor's Office, caused, in the applicants' submission, by the other facts they mentioned. In the Court's opinion, the two circumstances referred to by the Government in support of their argument that the Court of Cassation was independent of the Principal Public Prosecutor's Office, and in particular the assertion made by Mr Javeau and Mr Stalport about the President's intervention when the Principal Advocate-General was presenting the facts of the case, remove all legitimate foundation from the doubts the applicants may have felt in this respect.",

Yet the Court of Cassation, sitting as the court of first and last instance, had not given judgment until six and a half years later. The applicant pointed out that the offences he stood accused of, which were known to the investigating judge from the outset, were so simple and lacking in complexity that the judgment of 5 April 1996 devoted only half a page to them. In addition, few of the documents in the investigation file concerned him. This applied in particular to the court expert's report, most of which related to facts which were not included in the charges against him. The alleged complexity of the prosecution was merely the result of the authorities' determination to establish the existence of a \u201csystem\u201d in which all the defendants were involved. Application of the connection rule was justified by the requirements of the administration of justice only where the rights of the defence were respected. Yet he could have been tried separately on the charges against him as early as 1994, if not before, and this would not have prevented the prosecution from arguing that the offences he stood accused of formed part of a system.",

It reiterates that in criminal matters the \u201creasonable time\u201d referred to in Article 6 \u00a7 1 begins to run as soon as a person is \u201ccharged\u201d: this may occur on a date prior to the case coming before the trial court, such as the date of arrest, the date when the person concerned was officially notified that he was to be prosecuted or the date when the preliminary investigations were opened.

But in its judgment of 5 April 1996 the Court of Cassation had ruled that time had begun to run again and extended a limitation period which had already lapsed, this being illegal given that an initial five-year period had begun to run on 30 November 1989 in Mr\u00a0Co\u00ebme's case and on 29 February 1988 in Mr Hermanus's case. In addition, it had restarted the limitation period a second time, although this was not permissible under Article 22 of the Code of Criminal Investigation, taking into consideration the date of 10 June 1992. The applicants argued on that basis that the Court of Cassation had effectively applied Article 25 of the Law of 24 December 1993 retrospectively. That had breached Article 7 of the Convention, in that determination of the period during which an offence could be punished was certainly as much a part of the concept of \u201cpenalty\u201d as the measure imposed pursuant to the law as a punishment.

Following the applicants' interpretation would create a serious obstacle making it difficult for States to introduce the necessary changes to criminal procedures and to take account of the courts' excessive caseloads. In the alternative, the Government submitted that, even if Article 7 had to be considered to apply also to limitation of criminal proceedings, its only scope would be to prevent limitation becoming an issue again once prosecution had become time-barred. It was only in such a case that there would be retrospectiveness, in that the new law would have to \u201cgo back in time\u201d from the date of its entry into force in order to be able to annul a time-bar. But nothing like that had taken place in the present case. On 31 December 1993, when the new law had come into force, the proceedings had not yet become time-barred according to the rules formerly applicable and the Court of Cassation had applied from the time of the offences in issue the new limitation period laid down by the Law of 24 December 1993.

France judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, p. 1627, \u00a7 29; and the S.W. and C.R. v. the United Kingdom judgments of 22 November 1995, Series A nos. 335-B and 335-C, pp. 41-42, \u00a7 35, and pp. 68-69, \u00a7 33, respectively). The Court must therefore verify that at the time when an accused person performed the act which led to his being prosecuted and convicted there was in force a legal provision which made that act punishable, and that the punishment imposed did not exceed the limits fixed by that provision (see Murphy v. the United Kingdom, application no. 4681/70, Commission decision of 3 and 4 October 1972, Collection 43, p. 1). Since the term \u201cpenalty\u201d is autonomous in scope, to render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of this provision (see the Welch v. the United Kingdom judgment of 9 February 1995, Series A no. 307-A, p. 13, \u00a7 27).

Limitation periods, which are a common feature of the domestic legal systems of the Contracting States, serve several purposes, which include ensuring legal certainty and finality and preventing infringements of the rights of defendants, which might be impaired if courts were required to decide on the basis of evidence which might have become incomplete because of the passage of time (see the Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1996, Reports 1996-IV, pp.\u00a01502-03, \u00a7 51).",

However, by accepting that there were extenuating circumstances it treated these acts, like the other offences it found to have been made out, as less serious indictable offences (d\u00e9lits). In Belgian law the classification of an offence is determined not according to the penalty applicable but according to the penalty actually applied. The date of the judgment must therefore be the standpoint for determining what period must elapse before prosecution becomes time-barred. That being so, the Court of Cassation had regard to the limitation period for less serious indictable offences. Subsequently, applying the provisions of the Law of 24 December 1993 immediately, and after noting that the offences found to have been made out were not time-barred on the date of its entry into force, it held that the correct limitation period was five years from the time of the offences, which period could be extended, where the case arose, by a new five-year period counting from a measure causing time to begin to run again lawfully taken before expiry of the first five-year period (see paragraph 57 above).
