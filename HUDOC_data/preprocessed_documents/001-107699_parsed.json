According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the phrase \u201cestablished by law\u201d covers not only the legal basis for the very existence of a \u201ctribunal\u201d, but also compliance by the tribunal with the particular rules that govern it (see Sokurenko and Strygun, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 22-24, with further references).",

Instead, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the court of appeal, without giving any reasons for exceeding its jurisdiction, when no such course of action was provided for in the Code of Commercial Procedure. The Court concluded that the Supreme Court had acted contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, not as a \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d, as it overstepped the limits of its jurisdiction, which were clearly laid down in the Code of Commercial Procedure (see Sokurenko and Strygun, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 26-28).",
