Such a solution, to which the defence did not object, could be found reasonable. However, in the circumstances of the case it led to the situation in which the applicant found himself convicted of a very serious crime mainly on the basis of evidence given by witnesses none of whom were present during\u00a0his trial in . The domestic courts did not hear the direct evidence of these witnesses and the applicant had no opportunity to cross-examine them. The Court is not persuaded that the materials of pre-trial investigation, in which the applicant partly participated, and the video of the questioning could compensate such complete lack of possibility for the courts and the applicant to examine the witnesses directly. Furthermore, being aware of difficulties in securing the right of the applicant to examine the witnesses in the present case, the Court considers that the available modern technologies could offer more interactive type of questioning of witnesses abroad, like a video link.",
