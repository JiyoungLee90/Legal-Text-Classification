Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 158, ECHR-XI). The impugned ruling concerned only the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial. Therefore, an appeal directed against that ruling would have been limited to matters of detention. By contrast, the thrust of the applicant\u2019s complaint before the court of appeal in  and before the Court was quite different: he attacked the judgment as a whole, claiming that the outcome of the trial had been predetermined. The ruling of 30 November 2001, therefore, was not a separate object of appeal but a proof of the bias of the trial court. The Court concludes that the avenue indicated by the Government was not capable of \u201cproviding adequate redress\u201d for the applicant\u2019s grievance under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. The Government did not claim that the issue of the alleged partiality should have been raised by the applicant earlier, at the trial stage.

Personal impartiality is presumed unless there is evidence to the contrary\u201d (see Padovani v. Italy, 26 February 1993, \u00a7 26, Series A no.\u00a0257\u00a0B, and Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, \u00a7 30, ECHR 2000 X). The Court may also employ an objective approach, that is, determine whether the judge offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of his impartiality (see Piersack v. Belgium, 1 October 1982, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 53, and Grieves v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a057067/00, \u00a7\u00a069, ECHR 2003-XII). The Court is mindful that there is no watertight division between the two notions, and that the same act or statement by a judge may be analysed through the prism of a \u201csubjective\u201d or \u201cobjective\u201d test (see Oluji\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 22330/05, \u00a7\u00a7 57 et seq., 5\u00a0February 2009). The Court further reiterates that \u201cin maintaining confidence in the ... impartiality of a tribunal, appearances may be important\u201d (Brudnicka and Others v. Poland, no. 54723/00, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2005 II). Finally, the Court has always stressed the importance of \u201cnational procedures for ensuring impartiality\u201d which are directed, inter alia, \u201cat removing any appearance of partiality and so serve to promote the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public\u201d (see Me\u017enari\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 71615/01, \u00a7 27, 15 July 2005, and Huseyn and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 35485/05, 45553/05, 35680/05 and\u00a036085/05, \u00a7 162, 26 July 2011).",

It is perfectly normal that a judge may consider and dismiss an application for release lodged by a detained defendant. In doing so the judge is required, under both the Convention and the domestic law, to establish the existence of a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d against the defendant. The mere fact that a trial judge has already taken pre-trial decisions in the case, including decisions relating to detention, cannot in itself justify fears as to his impartiality; only special circumstances may warrant a different conclusion (see Hauschildt v.\u00a0Denmark, 24 May 1989, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 154, and Sainte-Marie v.\u00a0France, no. 12981/87, \u00a7 32, 16 December 1992). That being said, while deciding on an application for release lodged by a defendant, the court must not assess whether or not the defendant is guilty (see Gultyayeva v. Russia, no. 67413/01, \u00a7 197, 1 April 2010). The court\u2019s role is limited to establishing the state of suspicion, which may be insufficient to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond reasonable doubt, but which connects the defendant, his actions, whereabouts, and so on, to the actus reus of the case. \u201cSuspicion and formal finding of guilt are not to be treated as being the same\u201d (Jasi\u0144ski v. Poland, no. 30865/96, \u00a7 55, 20 December 2005).",
