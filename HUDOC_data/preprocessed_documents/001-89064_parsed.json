The imposition of moral responsibility had been a value judgment, not verifiable by facts. His statement that thirty-nine individuals had died from drug abuse had been factually true and corroborated by a certificate from the regional health protection authority. Some of his statements had been taken out of context and distorted: in particular, he had never claimed that the unit\u2019s officers had unlawfully retained all drugs seized from drug-addicts in order to pay their informers.

In assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation.

The Court\u2019s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, most recently, Karman, \u00a7\u00a032, and Grinberg, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27, both cited above, with further references).",

The District Court devoted a considerable part of its judgment to statements by the plaintiffs and their relatives who had felt hurt by the publication and claimed to be affected by it. The Court reiterates, however, that mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a publication as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant or that he was targeted by the criticism (see Dyuldin and Kislov\u00a0v. , no.\u00a025968/02, \u00a7\u00a044, 31\u00a0July 2007). The District Court\u2019s judgment was founded solely on the subjective perception of the publication by the plaintiffs and their relatives, without discussion of whether the decision to accept the standing of non-identified individuals to sue in defamation was objectively and reasonably justified. Furthermore, the District Court failed to operate a distinction between the situation of the officers against whom criminal charges had been levelled and that of those officers who were not subject to any criminal proceedings. The issue of standing was explicitly raised in the statement of appeal. Nevertheless, the  considered the District Court\u2019s failure to verify the plaintiffs\u2019 standing to sue in defamation to have been a formal defect which did not invalidate the otherwise correct judgment (see paragraph 18 above). The Court finds that, in the circumstances of the case, the issue of standing was of primordial importance and that the domestic courts did not identify a pressing social need for putting the protection of the plaintiffs\u2019 personality rights above the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression.",

Parts of the interview were found to have been defamatory by the domestic courts. In so finding, they did not give heed to the fact that the statements did not emanate from the applicant but were clearly identified as those proffered by another person. In this regard, the Court reiterates that an indiscriminate approach to the author\u2019s own speech and statements made by others is incompatible with the standards elaborated in the Court\u2019s case-law under Article 10 of the Convention. In a number of cases the Court has held that a distinction needs to be made according to whether the statements emanate from the journalist or are a quotation of others, since punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard\u00a0v.\u00a0  [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7\u00a077, ECHR 2004XI, Thorgeir Thorgeirson, \u00a7\u00a065, and Jersild, \u00a7 35, both cited above). The domestic courts did not advance any such reasons.",

It has been the Court\u2019s constant view that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article\u00a010 (see Lingens\u00a0v. Austria, judgment of 8\u00a0July 1986, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0103, p. 28, \u00a7\u00a046; and Oberschlick\u00a0v.  (no.\u00a01), judgment of 23 May 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0204, \u00a7 63). In the present case the domestic courts considered all the contested extracts to have been statements of fact, without examining whether they could be considered to be value judgments. Their failure to embark on that analysis was accounted for by the position of the Russian law on defamation at the material time. As the Court has already found, it made no distinction between value judgments and statements of fact, referring uniformly to \u201cstatements\u201d (\u201csvedeniya\u201d), and proceeded from the assumption that any such \u201cstatement\u201d was amenable to proof in civil proceedings (see Grinberg, cited above, \u00a7 29; Karman, cited above, \u00a7 38; Zakharov\u00a0v. , no.\u00a014881/03, \u00a7\u00a029, 5 October 2006, and the domestic law cited in paragraphs 21 and 22 above). Furthermore, as regards the Regional Court\u2019s holding that it would have been legitimate for the applicant to make his comments public only after the judgment in the criminal case had been made, the Court recalls that the standard of proof for establishing the well-foundedness of a criminal charge by a competent court can hardly be compared to that which ought to be observed by a journalist when expressing his opinion on a matter of public concern, since the standards applied when assessing someone\u2019s actions in terms of morality are quite different from those required for establishing an offence under criminal law (see Karman, cited above, \u00a7 42; Unabh\u00e4ngige Initiative Informationsvielfalt v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a028525/95, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2002I; and Wirtschafts-Trend Zeitschriften-Verlags GmbH v.\u00a0, no.\u00a058547/00, \u00a7\u00a039, 27 October 2005).",

According to its constant approach, the difference between a value judgment and a statement of fact ultimately lies in the degree of factual proof which has to be established and therefore a value judgment must be based on sufficient facts in order to constitute a fair comment under Article 10 (see Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft\u00a0v.\u00a0, no.\u00a039394/98, \u00a7\u00a040, ECHR 2003XI). The applicant expressed the view that the regional police force\u2019s anti-narcotics unit bore responsibility vis-\u00e0-vis society for a failure to stamp out drug dealing in the region, which had resulted in multiple deaths from overdoses. He also warned against the dangers of using prohibited substances as a means of paying for or obtaining information from informants, since that might lead to criminalisation of the police. Against this background, it appears that the thrust of the impugned article was not primarily to accuse certain individuals of committing offences but rather promote an ongoing debate of evident concern to the local public (compare Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.  [GC], no.\u00a021980/93, \u00a7\u00a063, ECHR 1999III). As regards the evidentiary basis underlying the applicant\u2019s discourse, the Court notes that he relied on publicly available materials from an investigation into the actions of officers from the anti-narcotics unit and on an official medical certificate showing the number of deaths by overdose. It therefore finds that the applicant\u2019s publication was a fair comment on a matter of public concern rather than a gratuitous attack on the reputation of named police officers.",

That the proceedings were civil rather than criminal in nature does not detract from the fact that the standards applied by the Russian courts were not compatible with the principles embodied in Article 10, since they did not adduce \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d reasons justifying the interference at issue. The Court therefore considers that the domestic courts overstepped the narrow margin of appreciation afforded to them with regard to restrictions on debates of public interest and that the interference was not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",
