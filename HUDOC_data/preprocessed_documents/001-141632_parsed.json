The prison train carriages had compartments designed for four to six passengers, which were occupied by eleven or more detainees and their belongings. The overcrowded compartments were not ventilated and in the summer heat (above 30\u00a0degrees Celsius) the metal carriages overheated, making it hard to breathe. Reaching a destination took very long time, as upon arrival at an intermediate stop the cars often waited for hours for additional prisoners to be brought to the station or for a new locomotive to be connected to the train. A distance that would be covered in four hours in a regular train could take twenty-four hours or more. The guards escorted the detainees to the bathroom only once every four hours and there was no opportunity to go otherwise. The conditions of transport in the vans were also very uncomfortable. The vans had no windows and largely no ventilation. On many occasions they also took long stops and became overheated in the summer sun, aggravating the symptoms of the applicant\u2019s heart and vascular problems and causing him to suffer intolerably.",

Guards also often made detainees assume a squat or other unnatural positions when moving somewhere, shouted, insulted, pushed and beat the prisoners, and performed unnecessary and degrading searches.

In particular, as is clear from the figures provided by the Government (see paragraphs 37 and 49 above) and assuming that, contrary to the applicant\u2019s submissions, the cells were not overpopulated, in both facilities the cells afforded some two square metres of floor space per inmate. This space is far below than the minimum standard of four square metres per inmate recommended by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment for multiple occupancy cells (see paragraph 70 above).",

The Court next notes that the applicant was detained in such conditions for a considerable period of time, in particular, from March 2003 until November 2005 (some two-and-a-half years in Odessa SIZO and one-and-a-half months in Kyiv SIZO). In the light of its jurisprudence (see for example Melnik v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0103 and Iglin v.

The Court is therefore prepared to conclude that the applicant\u2019s suffering on account of lack of personal space was, at least to a certain extent, aggravated by the other factors at issue.

The Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in managing their proceedings, but to consider whether the method chosen by them has led in a given case to results which are compatible with the Convention (see for established authority Hadjianastassiou v. Greece, 16\u00a0December 1992, \u00a7\u00a033, Series A no. 252).",

Moreover, the applicant\u2019s submissions before the Regional Court in this respect were not the same as his submissions before the Supreme Court and different yet again from his factual allegations made in the Convention proceedings. For instance, the applicant submitted before the Court that he had routinely been taken to the transit box at around 6\u00a0a.m. (see paragraph\u00a035 above).

Furthermore, throughout the proceedings the applicant\u2019s requests to have a privately-funded lawyer admitted or a legal-aid lawyer appointed had always been promptly accommodated. The applicant had been legally represented throughout the trial.

Moreover, no incriminating evidence had ever been obtained during these periods. His defence strategy had remained the same regardless of whether or not he had been legally represented during a particular stage of the proceedings. As the applicant\u2019s father was not a lawyer, the Regional Court\u2019s refusal to appoint him as the applicant\u2019s lay defender had not fallen within the ambit of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 (c).

In any event, his waiver of the right to legal assistance given before the first interrogation had neither been genuine nor unequivocal, as it had resulted from ill-treatment and coercion. Moreover, there had not been a transparent procedure in place for the selection and appointment of legal-aid lawyers by the investigative authority, so he had reasonably feared that any lawyer appointed to represent him at that stage would act contrary to his interests. The applicant also argued that refusal of the Regional Court to appoint his father as his lay defender had been arbitrary and unfair, particularly as O.K., his legal counsel, had performed poorly and had missed some hearings. As the applicant\u2019s family had encountered financial difficulties and had not been able to afford an expensive lawyer, the appointment of the applicant\u2019s father as his representative would have helped redress the deficiencies in his legal representation.

France, no.\u00a029731/96, \u00a7\u00a089, ECHR 2001II). As a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided from the first questioning of a suspect by the investigative authority, unless it can be demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there were compelling reasons to restrict this right (see Salduz\u00a0v. Turkey\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a036391/02, \u00a7\u00a055, 27 November 2008). The very fact of unjustified restriction of access of a detained suspect to a lawyer may prejudice the rights of the defence, even where no incriminating statements were obtained as a result (see for example Dayanan v. Turkey, no.\u00a07377/03, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, 13 October 2009). At the same time, neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 of the Convention prevents a person from waiving of his own free will, either expressly or tacitly, the entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial, as long as a waiver of the right is given in an unequivocal manner and was attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see Salduz v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 59, and Paskal v. Ukraine, no. 24652/04, \u00a7\u00a076, 15 September 2011).",

Germany, 25 September 1992, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 237-B, and Mayzit v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066). The mere appointment of a legal-aid lawyer does not in itself settle the issue of compliance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c), and the competent national authorities may be required under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 3 (c) to intervene if a failure by a legal-aid lawyer to provide effective representation is manifest or sufficiently brought to their attention in some other way (see Kamasinski v.

In other situations, regard being had to the independence of the legal profession from the State, the conduct of the defence is essentially a matter between the defendant and his counsel, whether that lawyer is appointed under a legal-aid scheme or privately financed (see Cuscani v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a032771/96, \u00a7\u00a039, 24\u00a0September 2002, and Iglin v.

It is true that during certain questioning sessions and confrontations at the pre-trial investigation stage, including the first questioning of 16 December 2002, the applicant was not legally represented. In examining whether the absence of legal representation during these activities was compatible with Article 6, the Court notes that before each such questioning session or confrontation the applicant was notified in writing of his right to legal assistance, he waived this right and expressed his consent to take part in the activity in question. There is nothing in the case file to suggest that the applicant\u2019s waivers of legal assistance at these times were misinformed or obtained as a result of ill-treatment or coercion. On the contrary, as is evident from the record of the applicant\u2019s interrogation on 25 December 2002, the applicant, questioned in the presence of A.A., his privately-funded lawyer, expressly denied that he had been ill-treated upon his arrest.
