The District Court further found that the use of handcuffs had also been lawful and justified. In so finding, it took statements from witnesses: another detainee, Mr Z., and two on-duty officers, Po. and Mr Pu. They stated that the applicant had been verbally abusive and had shouted, banged at the door, incited to mass disorder and threatened to slit his veins with a razor blade. He had been handcuffed to prevent mass disorder and self-harm. While handcuffed, he had been given food and drink and a mattress to sleep on during the night, and had also been allowed to use the toilet. The District Court found that the use of handcuffs from 8 p.m. on 7 November to 1 p.m. on 8 November 2001 had been compatible with the requirements of section 45 of the Custody Act for the prevention of mass disorder or attempts to inflict self-harm (see paragraph 41 below). In the District Court's view, the application of handcuffs had not impaired the applicant's rights, inflicted physical suffering or diminished his honour or dignity.",

Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092-94, ECHR 2000-XI). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention. The assessment of this level is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Kud\u0142a [GC], cited above, \u00a7 91, and Peers v.

Hence, the only valid reason for using handcuffs could have been the need to prevent self-harm (see paragraph 41 above). Indeed, after the applicant had swallowed a safety pin and uttered threats of further self-mutilation, the prison staff could legitimately have considered measures to secure his health and well-being. The Court reiterates in that connection that the authorities are under a duty to protect persons in custody and that it is incumbent on the State to account for any injuries suffered during such periods (see, among other authorities, Tarariyeva v. Russia, no. 4353/03, \u00a7\u00a073, ECHR 2006XV).",
