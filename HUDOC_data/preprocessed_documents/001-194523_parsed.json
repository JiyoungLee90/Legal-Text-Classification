This does not preclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, \u00a7 53, and A and B v.\u00a0Norway, cited above, \u00a7 105; see also Escoubet v.\u00a0Belgium [GC], no. 26780/95, \u00a7\u00a032, ECHR 1999VII).",

Even though the public prosecutor\u2019s office did not consider that the acts in issue constituted an offence for the purposes of criminal law, it was required by law to impose a penalty where the legal basis for discontinuing the proceedings was Article 181 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 33 above). The applicant was fined 1,000 Romanian lei (RON \u2013 approximately 250 euros (EUR) at the time) for the acts of which he was accused. That sum corresponded to the maximum fine that could be imposed under Article 91 of the Criminal Code. Although the Criminal Code designates this penalty as \u201cadministrative\u201d, the purpose of the fine was not to repair the damage caused by the applicant but to punish him and deter him from committing further criminal acts (compare Ioan Pop v. Romania (dec.), no. 40301/04, \u00a7\u00a025, 28\u00a0June 2011, where the Court found that an administrative fine of approximately EUR 50 imposed on the applicant under Ordinance no.\u00a0195/2002 for failing to stop and give way to an official vehicle was \u201ccriminal\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention; and Sancakl\u0131 v.

Accordingly, although domestic law classifies the fine imposed on the applicant as \u201cadministrative\u201d, it has a punitive and deterrent purpose and is therefore akin to a criminal penalty.",

Referring to judgments delivered by the CJEU (for example, those delivered on 29 June 2016 and 22 December 2008 respectively in the cases of Kossowski v. Generalstaatwaltschaft Hamburg (C-486/14, EU:C:2016:483), and Vladimir Turansk\u00fd (C-491/07, EU:C:2008:768)), they explained that for a person to be regarded as someone whose trial had been \u201cfinally disposed of\u201d, it was necessary, in the first place, that further prosecution had been \u201cdefinitively barred\u201d, a question which had to be assessed on the basis of the law of the Contracting State in which the criminal-law decision in issue had been taken. Next, referring to the judgments delivered by the CJEU in Filomeno Mario Miraglia (10 March 2005, C-469/03, EU:C:2005:156); M. (5 June 2014, C-398/12, EU:C:2014:1057); and Kossowski (cited above), the Government noted that the CJEU had ruled that even where, under domestic law, further prosecution had been definitively barred by a decision, that decision only qualified as \u201cfinal\u201d if it was given after a determination had been made as to the merits of the case. In the present case, the possibility for the public prosecutor\u2019s office to issue an order under Article 10 (b1) of the CCP without determining all the aspects of the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 33 above) argued in favour of regarding the prosecutor\u2019s order of 7\u00a0August 2008 as \u201cnot final\u201d. Furthermore, Article 273 \u00a7 1 of the CCP had not restricted the reopening of proceedings to exceptional circumstances or made it subject to the discovery of new evidence: reopening could be ordered wherever the higher-ranking prosecutor found that the proceedings had been discontinued on non-existent factual or legal grounds.",

The reopening had been justified by a fundamental defect in the order previously issued. With reference to the Prosecutor General\u2019s memorandum of 17\u00a0January 2013 (see paragraph 27 above), they explained that the higher-ranking prosecutor\u2019s oversight of decisions taken by public prosecutors under his or her authority pursued the aim, inter alia, of standardising the practice of public prosecutors\u2019 offices, particularly as regards the assessment of the degree of danger to society posed by a road traffic offence. Even though the memorandum in question had been issued after the facts of the present case, it proved that the standardisation of judicial practice had been a constant concern of the judicial authorities. Furthermore, for offences of this kind there was generally no other party with an interest in challenging the prosecutor\u2019s decision to discontinue the proceedings.

Under domestic law, both the courts and the public prosecutors\u2019 offices had had jurisdiction to apply Articles 181 and 91 of the Criminal Code as in force at the material time. In order to apply those provisions, and above all to impose one of the penalties laid down in Article 91 of the Criminal Code, the authority with jurisdiction had been required to carry out a thorough investigation of the facts of the case and to assess the behaviour of the person concerned. Referring to the judgment delivered by the CJEU in Kossowski v.\u00a0Generalstaatwaltschaft Hamburg (cited above), the applicant stated that in the present case, in issuing the order of 7 August 2008, the public prosecutor\u2019s office had conducted an in-depth investigation: it had interviewed the suspect and a witness and had made its own assessment of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the acts, before deciding on the most appropriate penalty to be imposed in this case.

The French version thus indicates that the acquittal or conviction must stem from a \u201cjugement\u201d, whereas the English version does not specify what form the acquittal or conviction should take. Thus confronted with versions of a law-making treaty which are equally authentic but not exactly the same, the Court must interpret them in a way that reconciles them as far as possible and is most appropriate in order to realise the aim and achieve the object of the treaty (see The Sunday Times v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, \u00a7\u00a048, Series A no.\u00a030, and Article 33 \u00a7 4 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties).",

What matters in any given case is that the decision in question has been given by an authority participating in the administration of justice in the national legal system concerned, and that that authority is competent under domestic law to establish and, as appropriate, punish the unlawful behaviour of which the person has been accused. The fact that the decision does not take the form of a judgment cannot call into question the person\u2019s acquittal or conviction, since such a procedural and formal aspect cannot have a bearing on the effects of the decision. Indeed, the English version of Article\u00a04 of Protocol No. 7 supports this broad interpretation of the concept. Moreover, the Court has consistently adopted a similar approach in determining the effects of a legal situation, for example in ascertaining whether proceedings defined as administrative under domestic law produced effects requiring them to be classified as \u201ccriminal\u201d within the autonomous Convention meaning of the term (see, among many other authorities, A and B v.\u00a0Norway, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0139 and 148, and Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 54-57; see also Tsonyo Tsonev v.\u00a0Bulgaria (no.\u00a02), no.\u00a02376/03, \u00a7\u00a054, 14\u00a0January 2010, where the Court proceeded from the finding that the mayor\u2019s decision to impose an administrative fine on the applicant, which had not been challenged in the courts and was enforceable, had constituted a final decision for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7).",

In order for such an assessment to take place, it is vital that the authority giving the decision is vested by domestic law with decision-making power enabling it to examine the merits of a case. The authority must then study or evaluate the evidence in the case file and assess the applicant\u2019s involvement in one or all of the events prompting the intervention of the investigative bodies, for the purposes of determining whether \u201ccriminal\u201d responsibility has been established (see, mutatis mutandis, Allen v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a025424/09, \u00a7 127, ECHR 2013, a case concerning the scope of the presumption of innocence under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, in which the content, and not the form, of the decision, was the decisive factor for the Court).",

On the basis of the evidence produced, the prosecutor carried out his own assessment of all the circumstances of the case, relating both to the applicant individually and to the specific factual situation. After carrying out that assessment, again in accordance with the powers conferred on him under domestic law, the prosecutor decided to discontinue the prosecution, while imposing a penalty on the applicant that had a punitive and deterrent purpose (see paragraphs 11 to 15 above).

In making that distinction, having regard to the specific circumstances of the individual case, the Court has considered such factors as the accessibility of a remedy to parties or the discretion afforded to authorised officials under domestic law as regards the use of a remedy (see, for example, Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a039). Reaffirming the need to ensure observance of the principle of legal certainty, and referring to the difficulties which might arise under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 where a judicial decision was set aside as a result of an \u201cextraordinary\u201d remedy, the Court has only taken into account \u201cordinary remedies\u201d in determining the \u201cfinal\u201d nature of a decision for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (see Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7 39), in the autonomous Convention meaning of the term (see Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0109).",

In establishing the \u201cordinary\u201d remedies in a particular case, the Court will take domestic law and procedure as its starting-point. Domestic law \u2013 both substantive and procedural \u2013 must satisfy the principle of legal certainty, which requires both that the scope of a remedy for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 be clearly circumscribed in time and that the procedure for its use be clear for those parties that are permitted to avail themselves of the remedy in question. In other words, for the principle of legal certainty to be satisfied, a principle which is inherent in the right not to be tried or punished twice for the same offence (see Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7 39), a remedy must operate in a manner bringing clarity to the point in time when a decision becomes final. In particular, the Court observes in this context that the requirement of a time-limit in order for a remedy to be regarded as \u201cordinary\u201d is implicit in the wording of the explanatory report itself, which states that a decision is irrevocable where the parties have permitted the \u201ctime-limit\u201d to expire without availing themselves of such a remedy. A law conferring an unlimited discretion on one of the parties to make use of a specific remedy or subjecting such a remedy to conditions disclosing a major imbalance between the parties in their ability to avail themselves of it would run counter to the principle of legal certainty (see, mutatis mutandis, Gacon v.\u00a0France, no. 1092/04, \u00a7 34 in fine, 22\u00a0May 2008).",

Nevertheless, if the Contracting States could determine as they saw fit when a decision was \u201cfinal\u201d for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, without scrutiny by the Court, the application of that Article would be left to their discretion. A latitude extending so far might lead to results incompatible with the purpose and object of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Engel and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081; \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v.

The Court observes that this remedy had a legal basis in domestic law. As regards the quality of the law governing the remedy in question, it should be noted that the text of Article 2491 was accessible to the applicant, given that it was part of the CCP, which was itself published in the Official Gazette. Article 2491 clearly stated that where an order discontinuing the proceedings was based on Article 10 (b1) of the CCP, the individual concerned could challenge it by means of an appeal, which had to be lodged within a time-limit established by law.

The Court acknowledges that on account of its powers and role in the proper administration of criminal justice, the prosecutor\u2019s office may have been entitled to different conditions in performing its review. Nevertheless, the fact remains that on account of the lack of a time-limit, Romanian law did not regulate with sufficient clarity the manner in which that remedy was to be used, thus creating genuine uncertainty as to the applicant\u2019s legal situation (see paragraph 112 above), and that this discrepancy resulted in a major imbalance between the parties in their ability to make use of the remedies in question, of such a nature as to place the applicant in a situation of legal uncertainty (see paragraph 115 in fine above).",

Even so, such a duplication of proceedings may be compatible with Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 if the second set of proceedings involves the reopening of a case where this satisfies the requirements linked to the exception provided for in Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No.\u00a07.",

Article 4 \u00a7\u00a02 of Protocol No. 7 expressly envisages the possibility that an individual may have to accept prosecution on the same charges, in accordance with domestic law, where a case is reopened following the emergence of new evidence or the discovery of a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings (see Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7 45, and Kadu\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a084). The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has also considered that the possibility of re-examining or reopening a case provides a guarantee of redress, particularly in the context of the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments. In its Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, it urged member States to ensure that their national legal systems provided for appropriate procedures for re-examining or reopening cases (see Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056).",

In the case of Fadin v. Russia (no. 58079/00, \u00a7\u00a032, 27\u00a0July 2006), for example, it held that the reopening of proceedings on the grounds that the lower-level court had not followed the instructions given to it by the Supreme Court as regards the investigative measures to be carried out had been justified by a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings and was therefore compatible with Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7 (see also Bratyakin v.

The concept of \u201cfundamental\u00a0defect\u201d within the meaning of Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7 suggests that only a serious violation of a procedural rule severely undermining the integrity of the previous proceedings can serve as the basis for reopening the latter to the detriment of the accused, where he or she has been acquitted of an offence or punished for an offence less serious than that provided for by the applicable law. Consequently, in such cases, a mere reassessment of the evidence on file by the public prosecutor or the higher-level court would not fulfil that criterion. However, as regards situations where an accused has been found guilty and a reopening of proceedings might work to his advantage, the Court points out that paragraph 31 of the explanatory report to Protocol No. 7 (see paragraph 37 above) emphasises that \u201cthis article does not prevent a reopening of the proceedings in favour of the convicted person and any other changing of the judgment to the benefit of the convicted person\u201d. In such situations, therefore, the nature of the defect must be assessed primarily in order to ascertain whether there has been a violation of the defence rights and therefore an impediment to the proper administration of justice. Lastly, in all cases, the grounds justifying the reopening of proceedings must, according to Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7 in fine, be such as to \u201caffect the outcome of the case\u201d either in favour of the person or to his or her detriment (see, to that effect, paragraph 30 of the explanatory report to Protocol No.\u00a07, cited in paragraph 37 above).",

The higher-ranking prosecutor\u2019s order of 7 January 2009 had the effect of entirely setting aside the previous order of 7 August 2008. This was necessary to enable the case file to be returned to the same prosecutor\u2019s office, which could then continue the investigation in compliance with the orders issued, that is to say instituting criminal proceedings against the applicant and committing him for trial. Following the institution of fresh proceedings, the applicant stood trial, in the course of which the criminal charges against him were determined in a new, single decision. The present case therefore involves a system permitting the resumption of proceedings, which may be regarded as a special form of reopening for the purposes of Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No.\u00a07 (see Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7 46, and Fadin, cited above, \u00a7 31).",

In any event, the reason put forward by the Government \u2013 the need to harmonise practice in this area \u2013 is not covered by the exceptional circumstances referred to in Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7, that is to say, the emergence of new or newly discovered facts or the discovery of a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings.",

I regret that the Court missed the opportunity to define the concepts of \u201cacquittal\u201d and \u201cconviction\u201d for the purposes of Protocol No. 7 in order to determine the scope of the ne bis in idem principle when applied to decisions to discontinue criminal proceedings and to set the limits of the power of public prosecutors to reopen discontinued criminal proceedings. That omission is particularly critical in the context of the contemporary criminal policy choices in favour of alternatives to prosecution (e.g. a compromise settlement, mediation, a caution or warning or the imposition of conditions), like the one that led to the present case.

Having regard to the intrinsic logic of EU law, the two Courts used different lines of reasoning in the past. Unlike the Strasbourg Court, the CJEU relied, in its reasoning, on the objective of free movement of persons, mutual trust and the principles of legal certainty and legitimate confidence, even though it also mentions, in its more recent judgments \u2013 especially those delivered in the framework of Article 50 of the Charter \u2013 the protection of the fundamental rights of the person in question. In accordance with the principle of freedom of movement, European citizens must not have to fear prosecution for the same offence after a final decision if they move around within the Schengen area. To attain that purpose, the CJEU sought to maintain a balance between the necessity to guarantee free movement of people and the need to promote the prevention and combat of crime within the area of freedom, security and justice, that is to say the prevention of impunity. Article 54 CISA must therefore not have the effect of \u201cmaking it more difficult, indeed impossible, actually to penalise in the Member States concerned the unlawful conduct with which the defendant is charged\u201d  (Miraglia and Van Straaten judgments, cited above).",

While performing the allegedly decisive proportionality test, the Court considered that the Supreme Court had sentenced the applicants to a suspended sentence of respectively 12 and 18 months and ordered them to pay fines and that, in fixing the fines, the Supreme Court had had regard to the excessive length of proceedings and tax surcharges that had already been imposed on the applicants, albeit without providing any details on the calculation in this respect.

An approach that would downgrade the guarantee of ne bis in idem to a casuistic, easy-to-manipulate concept, dependent on thoroughness of the investigation, would afford no legal certainty.

All of these, which may appear as rules of interpretation, are interconnected and integrated with each other under the broader umbrella of the principle, which has a harmonising and controlling effect on them.

The first act of this case at the domestic level could be understood as an example (perhaps not the most representative one) of such a consensual model, where, on one hand, the prosecutor decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant and imposed an administrative sanction instead, while, on the other hand, the applicant renounced challenging this discontinuance decision and paid the fine and the fees imposed (see paragraphs 13-15 of the judgment). There is nowadays an abundance of such \u201calternative dispute resolutions\u201d in modern criminal proceedings. Their primary function is to finally close a criminal case. The effect of such closure must, by its very nature, be equated with the effect of an adjudication on a criminal charge by a court. It would be illogical to allow a criminal case previously terminated on the basis of a transaction/settlement between the prosecutor and the suspect or on the basis of victim-offender mediation to be \u201creopened\u201d at the unilateral discretion of the prosecutor, having decided that the content of the initial resolution was inadequate for any reason.",

Belgium, 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35). The Court has acknowledged the undeniable advantages of such resolutions for the individual concerned as well as for the administration of justice. Consequently, it has ruled that they do not in principle run counter to the Convention. If a party is considered to be entitled to waive the right of access to a court by resorting to a settlement or to another form of alternative dispute resolution of a criminal case, I believe the time has come to afford \u201cne bis in idem\u201d effect to such de facto settlements.",

Cyprus and Russia, no.\u00a025965/04, ECHR 2010 (extracts)), and has therefore adopted an autonomous interpretation of specific provisions.

Therefore, I find it necessary to point out that the second sentence of paragraph 99 of the judgment (stating that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 of the Convention is not applicable to simple discontinuance orders) should be interpreted without prejudice to alternative dispute resolutions in criminal proceedings. While these resolutions often result in discontinuance orders, such prosecutorial decisions are regularly made conditional upon a specific action to be undertaken by the suspect/accused (for example, repaying or compensating for damage caused by the offence, performing community service, effecting payments of various types, or undergoing treatment or training). Consequently, such discontinuance orders may not be considered as \u201csimple discontinuance orders\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a099 of the judgment in the present case. In other words, the Court has yet to decide whether alternative dispute resolutions in criminal cases have any bearing on the interpretation of the \u201cfinal acquittal or conviction\u201d concept and the consequent applicability of Article 4 of Protocol No.\u00a07 of the Convention.",

This does not seem to be the case here. The party to the initial proceedings, namely the prosecution, unilaterally set aside its own discontinuance order. This setting aside did not have the nature of a challenge to the initial order before the court or before any other third authority. Nor did the fact that the prosecutor subsequently brought charges in court against the applicant on the same facts constitute a challenge to the initial order. Contrary to paragraphs\u00a0124 and 134 of the judgment, the applicant\u2019s trial in Foc\u015fani District Court was geared not to reviewing whether the initial discontinuance order was well-founded but to adjudicating whether the charges as subsequently filed against the applicant were well-founded.",

The analysis as to whether the subsequent setting aside by the higher-ranking prosecutor is to be considered as an \u201cordinary\u201d or \u201cextraordinary\u201d legal remedy seems to me rather redundant, as does the discussion of its foreseeability, time-limits and any inequality between the parties.",
