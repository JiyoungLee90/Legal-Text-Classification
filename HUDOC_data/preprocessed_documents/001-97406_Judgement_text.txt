In 1989 the applicant started working at a privately owned factory in the city of . On 4 February 1993 he had an accident in the factory and seriously injured his leg. Subsequently, on 13 August 1993 the applicant's employment at the factory was terminated on the ground that he had failed to report to work between 2 and 13 August 1993 without a reason.
On 4 June 1996, the applicant brought a legal action against the factory before the Ordu Civil Court of General Jurisdiction (“the ”) and claimed pecuniary compensation in respect of the accident. In the meantime, in 1997 the applicant's leg had to be amputated following the diagnosis of a malignant tumour in his injured leg.

On 5 February 1999, at the applicant's request, the  decided to adjourn its examination of the compensation claim pending the outcome of the proceedings before the .
On 17 December 1999 the , relying on two expert reports, decided that the accident had been occupational.

Proceedings recommenced before the , which found on 17 October 2000 that the applicant had introduced the same claim in 1994, and dismissed the case.
On 26 March 2001 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the  and pointed to the fact that the case which had been brought in 1994 had had different parties and its subject matter had also been different to that of the present one.
On 12 October 2001, after a further review of the case, the  gave a decision and held that the accident had been occupational.
On 1 February 2002 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment once more and held that the  should have considered whether a causal link existed between the tumour in the applicant's leg and the accident. The Court of Cassation considered that this could be done by obtaining a report from the Forensic Medicine Institution (“the Institution”).
On 26 April 2002, after re-examining the case, the  confirmed its judgment of 12 October 2001. In its decision, the  maintained that any causal link between the tumour and the accident was irrelevant to the case at hand. It considered that this was a matter for the  to consider in its examination of the applicant's compensation claim.

In its report the Institution also noted that the applicant, although warned by the doctors about the gravity of his condition, had failed to have medical examinations between 1994 and 1997. It concluded that this could also have caused the tumour in the applicant's leg.
On 1 September 2004 the applicant submitted to the  written objections to the Institution's report. He argued, in particular, that the report was irrelevant to the examination of his claim and in any event was based on insufficient data. The applicant further argued that the Forensic Institution had prepared a negative report as he had lodged a complaint against the experts regarding the delay in the submission of their report.
Based on the report of the Institution, the  decided on 10 September 2004 that there was no causal link between the accident and the tumour in the applicant's leg, and dismissed the case.
