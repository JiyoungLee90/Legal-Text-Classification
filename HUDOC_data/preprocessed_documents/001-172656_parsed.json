However, on 5 December 2008 the Klaip\u0117da District Court overruled the prosecutor\u2019s decision and reopened the pre-trial investigation. The court noted that the prosecutor had not addressed the State Labour Inspectorate\u2019s conclusion of 15 July 2007 (see paragraph 10 above), and that other witnesses had only stated that they had not seen how the applicant had fallen from the scaffolding but had not disputed his account. The court also considered that the prosecutor\u2019s conclusion that the applicant had fallen because of his own recklessness or a medical condition had been \u201cspeculative and not based on any objective facts\u201d. However, the court rejected the applicant\u2019s request to appoint a different prosecutor as unfounded and did not examine his request to carry out a forensic examination, noting that the choice of investigative measures was the prerogative of investigators and prosecutors.",

The court observed that the absence of previous accidents on the scaffolding could not be interpreted as evidence that the scaffolding was safe. It also held that the applicant\u2019s right to refuse to carry out tasks in unsafe conditions did not excuse the employer from a duty to ensure that unsafe conditions did not exist at the workplace. The court further noted that attaching the platform to the reservoir tank had clearly been part of the construction work, so the employer had a duty to properly supervise the workers and to instruct them how to carry out that task safely \u2013 and by failing to do so, the applicant\u2019s employer had acted contrary to the law.",

In its judgment the court noted that although more than two years had passed since the accident, the prosecutor had still not determined the precise way in which the accident had happened, and that without doing that it was not possible to determine who had been responsible for it. The court also considered it unlikely that the workers would have decided to attach the platform without receiving an order from their supervisor or at least informing him, so it was necessary to examine whether the construction manager V.J.S. had been present at the construction site at any time that day. Lastly, the court drew attention to the fact that \u201csome witnesses\u201d had admitted to giving false testimony under pressure from the employer and so it was necessary to investigate those claims further.",

The report noted that there was insufficient information in the case file concerning the technical characteristics of the metal platform and the scaffolding, so the way the accident had happened could be established only in part. On the basis of the available material, the report found that the weight of the platform had exceeded the weight limit of the scaffolding and had thus caused it to collapse. Accordingly, it concluded that the scaffolding had not been suitable for the work for which it was used, and that the workers had not been adequately informed about how to carry out their work safely.

In their preliminary objection, the Government did not argue that the appellate court could have interpreted the domestic law differently so as to overturn that conclusion and return the case for examination on the merits, as sought by the applicant. The Court also notes that the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court examined an appeal submitted by the accused, in which the latter also requested that the court examine the merits of the case, and dismissed it (see paragraph 55 above). Furthermore, the Court observes that, in line with domestic law, the discontinuation of the criminal case as time-barred precluded the courts in the criminal proceedings from examining the applicant\u2019s civil claim (see paragraphs\u00a06263 above). The Court therefore considers that in the specific circumstances of the present case, an appeal against the judgment of 14\u00a0May\u00a02012 would not have offered the applicant any reasonable prospect of success in respect of his complaint and thus was not a remedy which he had to exhaust (see, mutatis mutandis, P.M. v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 49669/07, \u00a7 59, 24\u00a0January 2012).",

The procedural obligation under Article 3 of the Convention requires that any investigation should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible for an offence. This is not an obligation as to result, but as to means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, such as taking witness statements and gathering forensic evidence (see N.D. v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 16605/09, \u00a7 57, 15 January 2015, and the cases cited therein).",

In such cases, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must meet the requirements of Article 3. In that respect, the Court reiterates that, regardless of the final outcome of the proceedings, the protection mechanisms available under domestic law should operate in practice in a manner allowing for the examination of the merits of a particular case within a reasonable time (ibid., \u00a7 58, and the cases cited therein).",

Nonetheless, the Court is of the view that complexity alone cannot justify the duration of the proceedings \u2013 three years and seven months in the hands of the prosecutor, and one year and one month awaiting examination by the first-instance court, before the case was terminated as time-barred. While there do not appear to have been any significant periods of inactivity on the part of the authorities, the Court observes that some of the essential investigative measures were taken inexplicably late. The applicant told the investigator during his first interview on 13\u00a0November\u00a02007 that the scaffolding had collapsed because of the weight of the metal platform. However, the authorities did not attempt to clarify whether the platform had been carried at the employer\u2019s instruction until April 2009 (one year and seven months after the start of the investigation), and did not request that a forensic expert determine the precise course of events of the accident until January 2010 (two years and four months after the start of the investigation) (see paragraphs 20, 28 and 31 above). In this context the Court notes that on several occasions senior prosecutors acknowledged that the investigation was not being carried out with sufficient promptness (see paragraphs 24 and 30 above), yet it does not appear that effective measures were taken to speed up the investigation.",

The Court reiterates that the repetition of such decisions may disclose a serious deficiency in the proceedings (see Wierciszewska v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7\u00a046, 25\u00a0November 2003; Drozd v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a012174/03, \u00a7\u00a066, 30\u00a0July\u00a02009; and Kapustyak v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a026230/11, \u00a7 78, 3\u00a0March\u00a02016), and in the present case there are no weighty reasons to hold otherwise. In particular, the Court observes that although the applicant consistently claimed that he had fallen from the scaffolding because of its collapse (see paragraphs 7 and 13 above), in the initial decisions to discontinue the investigation the prosecutor did not examine the reasons for that collapse, instead focusing on the alleged recklessness of the applicant himself (see paragraphs 17 and 26 above). The Court also shares the concern of the domestic courts that even though the State Labour Inspectorate and a forensic expert had concluded that the accident had been caused by the employer\u2019s failure to comply with work safety requirements, the prosecutor\u2019s decisions to discontinue the investigation did not address the findings of those specialist bodies and did not provide any reasons for rejecting them (see paragraphs 18 and\u00a034 above). Furthermore, while there were suspicions that some witnesses had been pressured by the applicant\u2019s employer to give false testimony, it does not appear that the authorities examined those suspicions (see paragraphs\u00a023, 28 and 33 above). In such circumstances, the Court is of the view that the pre-trial investigation could not be considered thorough.",

In those circumstances the Court considers that the domestic courts should have acted diligently and at a reasonable pace in order to examine the merits of the case and adopt a judgment before the prosecution became time-barred (see, mutatis mutandis, Velev v. Bulgaria, no. 43531/08, \u00a7\u00a058, 16\u00a0April\u00a02013). However, the case had to be repeatedly adjourned, first because of the absence of witnesses, and later because of the illness of the accused. As noted by the domestic court, the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the accident required the application of the statute of limitations \u201cunconditionally\u201d and did not permit its suspension during adjournments (see paragraphs 53 and 59 above). The Court notes that that legal framework was changed in June\u00a02010 and currently the Criminal Code of Lithuania provides, inter alia, that during the examination of a case by a court, the running of the limitation period is suspended when a trial is adjourned because of the absence of the accused (see paragraph 60 above). While it is not the role of this Court to determine what domestic legal framework is the most appropriate for ensuring the rights guaranteed by the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Hristozov\u00a0and\u00a0Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 47039/11 and 358/12, \u00a7\u00a0105, ECHR\u00a02012\u00a0(extracts), and the cases cited therein), it reiterates that the manner in which the limitation period is applied must be compatible with the requirements of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Mocanu\u00a0and\u00a0Others v.\u00a0Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09, 45886/07 and\u00a032431/08, \u00a7 326, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). In the present case, while the Court accepts that the case was adjourned for important reasons, it cannot help but notice that the lack of any possibility to suspend the statute of limitations during the adjournment of the case deprived the applicant of the opportunity to have the question of responsibility for his injury examined by a court.",

Together with other colleagues, we expressed our reservations in Kraulaidis v.\u00a0Lithuania\u00a0(no.\u00a076805/11, 8\u00a0November\u00a02016) and we cannot agree with the present judgment to the extent that its finding of a violation of Article 3 is based on the assumption that O\u2019Keeffe v. Ireland ([GC], no.\u00a035810/09, ECHR 2014 (extracts)) requires the same standard to apply irrespective of whether the inhuman or degrading treatment by private individuals was inflicted voluntarily or not. Moreover, we are of the view that where a more effective remedy exists than the criminal one, applicants must avail themselves of that remedy, although in the circumstances of the case no such remedy was available and therefore the application is admissible.",

Moreover, in 2009 a court had already found that \u201csome witnesses\u201d had admitted to giving false testimony under pressure from the employer (see paragraph\u00a028). In view of the above, there must have been grounds for treating this case with all the care that is due when an investigation is conducted into a substantiated allegation of at least serious recklessness. However, the domestic courts did not exercise proper diligence, even though they should have been aware of the fact that the prosecution would soon become timebarred.",

In the course of the ensuing criminal proceedings, the applicant lodged a claim for civil damages. On 8\u00a0May 2012 the Klaipeda District Court terminated the case against V.J.S. on the ground that the prosecution had become time-barred. The court decided that the applicant\u2019s civil claim should not be examined and that the applicant should instead institute civil proceedings. Such a decision was in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Lithuanian Code of Criminal Procedure and the case-law of the Supreme Court of Lithuania. This legal framework is not unique to Lithuania \u2013 indeed, it can be encountered in several other High Contracting Parties to the Convention. Its logic is clear: while there may exist procedural or/and substantive obstacles to finding a defendant criminally responsible, there may still be grounds to grant the related civil claim, but these are to be determined in separate civil proceedings. The Government have provided the Court with examples of successful civil actions brought by plaintiffs subsequent to criminal proceedings in which the defendants were not convicted. It appears from those examples that the applicant in the present case could possibly have been successful with his claim had he continued to pursue it in civil proceedings, as instructed by the Klaipeda District Court. For reasons unknown to our Court, he failed to act accordingly and thereby discontinued his action against V.J.S.",

However, if a criminal-law action against a defendant does not lead to a conviction and consequently, in view of the provisions of the particular legal system, no decision on the merits of the civil claim is taken, this claim will remain to be decided in civil proceedings. Although burdensome for the victim, this path is to be considered legally coherent and acceptable. Since the applicant in the present case did not use it, his civil claim remained undecided on the merits by the courts of the respondent State. In my opinion, this should lead to a conclusion that the applicant failed to exhaust the available domestic legal remedies. Consequently, the application should have been declared inadmissible.",

While it is true that under the case-law of this Court (see, for example, O\u2019Keefe v.\u00a0Ireland, [GC], no.\u00a035810/09, ECHR 2014), Article 3 of the Convention requires that the authorities conduct an effective official investigation into alleged ill-treatment even where such treatment has been inflicted by private individuals, one must first discern the conduct that can possibly fall within the ambit of Article 3. The case-law of the Court, adjudicating on the positive obligation of the High Contracting Parties under the procedural limb of Article 3 of the Convention, has dealt with cases of rape, sexual abuse or violence (see O\u2019Keeffe v. Ireland, cited above; C.A.S. and C.S. v.\u00a0Romania, no. 26692/05, 20\u00a0March 2012; M.C. v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 59297/12, 25\u00a0March 2014; Y. v. Slovenia, no. 41107/10, 28 May 2015), in certain instances coupled with illegal confinement (see S.Z. and others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a029263/12, 3 March 2015). Some of the cases examined have concerned family violence (see M. and M. v. Croatia, no.\u00a010161/13, 3\u00a0September 2015) or violent beating and injuries in a fight (see Sakir v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a048475/09, 24\u00a0March 2016; Dimitar Shopov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a017253/07, 16 April 2014; Biser Kostov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a032662/06, 10\u00a0January 2012; and Beganovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a046423/06, 25\u00a0June 2009). What these cases have in common is conduct containing elements of violence, inducing feelings of humiliation and degradation in the victim. In each case, this conduct was directed against a specific victim (who later became an applicant before the Court), more specifically against his or her life or limb and/or personal integrity. It was committed intentionally, with the possible exception of the case of Muta v. Ukraine (no. 37246/06, 31 July 2012), where it remained open whether the perpetrator had acted intentionally or with negligence \u2013 in all other aspects, that case did not differ from the above-mentioned cases of ill-treatment by private individuals. Apparently, there exist important similarities between the conduct qualified as illtreatment in those cases and the brutality inflicted by police and other State agents that was at the heart of the Article 3 case-law as it was developed over the decades.",

It found a violation of the procedural limb of Article 3 in a case concerning a traffic accident. This judgment is inconsistent with the existing wellestablished case-law. Previously, any deficiencies in judicial proceedings concerning traffic and other accidents were analysed under Article 6 of the Convention (see, for example, Dragomir v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a043045/08, 14 June 2016; Atanasova v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a072001/01, 2\u00a0October 2008; and Buonfardieci v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a039933/03, 18\u00a0December 2007). The judgment in Kraulaidis v. Lithuania created considerable unease among four judges of the composition, who decided to write a concurring opinion. They explicitly highlighted the absence of the ill-treatment aspect in a car accident caused by negligence (see \u00a7 12 of the concurring opinion) and called upon the Grand Chamber to stop the drift into trivialisation of Article 3 rights (see \u00a7\u00a07 of the concurring opinion). Nevertheless, this majority within the Chamber chose not to vote against the finding of a violation of the procedural limb of Article 3 of the Convention.",

                        "content": "6.\u00a0\u00a0The judgment in the present case goes a step further. It is inconsistent with the case-law cited in \u00a7 4 of this dissenting opinion. The specific conduct resulting in the applicant\u2019s accident has never been established, but it is allegedly related to the deficient organisation of the construction site. In contrast to the acts qualified as ill-treatment in the above-mentioned cases, such failure to ensure deficient organisation was not a violent act and did not on the face of it include any element of humiliation and debasement of the victim, that is, of the applicant. What is more, it was not directed against the applicant, let alone against his life, limb or personal integrity. Instead it appears from the provisions of Article\u00a0176 of the Lithuanian Criminal Code (hereinafter referred to as the LCC) that the criminalisation of acts under this provision is targeted at the protection of safety and health at work, which are legal goods only remotely and indirectly connected with the physical and personal inviolability of an individual. The alleged perpetrator, V.J.S., was initially accused of intentional and subsequently of negligent disregard of workplace safety rules. However, this mental element of the offence did not relate to the serious bodily injury sustained by the applicant. According to the wording of Article 176 of the LCC, a violation of the requirements of safety protection at work is considered a criminal offence when it results in an accident involving people or causing other serious consequences. The offender\u2019s intent (or negligence, if \u00a7 3 of Article 176 of the LCC is applicable) relates to the violation of safety or health requirements and not to the consequence, which in the present case was the serious bodily harm suffered by the applicant. The result is the so-called objective condition of criminalisation (in German, die Objektive Bedingung der Strafbarkeit). In other words, according to Article 176 of the LCC, neither intent nor negligence is required in relation to the bodily harm suffered by the victim (the applicant in our case). This illustrates an additional trivialisation of the Court\u2019s case-law with regard to Article\u00a03.",

He never asserted that he had been tortured or treated in an inhuman or degrading manner. Instead, he relied upon Articles\u00a06\u00a0and\u00a013 of the Convention. Nevertheless, the Chamber decided to examine the case under Article 3 of the Convention, relying upon the Court\u2019s role as the master of legal characterisation. It is my belief that this role should be exercised with the utmost caution. To be specific, there exists an imminent danger of reading into an application facts and circumstances that are not contained within it, and in consequence, examining it under an angle that was never envisaged by the person who lodged it. In such cases, the Court decides ultra petitum, which is incompatible with its role as a court. It is likely that in the present case the Chamber decided to rule in favour of the applicant due to a feeling of sympathy for the injustice arguably experienced by the applicant. In order to pave the way for this outcome, the Chamber identified Article 3 of the Convention as the provision best suited to that purpose and interpreted it in the manner described above.",

For this reason, I decided to vote against finding a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.",
