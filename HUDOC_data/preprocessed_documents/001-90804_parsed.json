Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a0157, ECHR 2000-XI). Moreover, there is a close affinity between the requirements of Article 13 of the Convention and the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The latter\u2019s purpose is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, among other authorities, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999-V). The rule in Article 35 \u00a7\u00a01 is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13, that there is an effective domestic remedy available in respect of the alleged breach of an individual\u2019s Convention rights (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 152). Nevertheless, the only remedies which Article 35 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Scordino v.  (no.\u00a01) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a0142, ECHR 2006...).",

It is also observed that under Russian law (see paragraph 20 above) he was entitled to be served ex officio with a copy of the decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings against him (see also Nakhmanovich v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a055669/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088-94, 2 March 2006).

Indeed, by a judgment of 15\u00a0September 2003 the Sovetskiy District Court of Ulan-Ude rejected the applicant\u2019s arguments to the effect that his property rights over the bus had been breached by the continuing application of the charging order.

In a recent case against Russia, the Court found a violation of Article 13 with reference to the fact that the domestic courts had examined a complaint concerning a search and seizure in the applicant\u2019s flat, while declaring inadmissible a complaint about a failure to return his computer on the ground that the retention decision was not amenable to judicial review (see Smirnov v.

The Court considers that, having exhausted all the possibilities of appeal available to him in the framework of the 2003 proceedings (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above), the applicant should not be required to embark on another attempt to obtain redress by bringing a civil action for damages (see, mutatis mutandis, Assenov and Others v.

The Court reiterates that the seizure of property for legal proceedings normally relates to the control of the use of property, which falls within the ambit of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention (see, among others, Raimondo v.

It has also found that the applicant was not afforded an effective remedy for his complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see paragraph 56 above). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that while any seizure or confiscation entails damage, the actual damage sustained should not be more extensive than that which is inevitable, if it is to be compatible with Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see Raimondo, cited above, \u00a7 33, and Jucys v. Lithuania, no. 5457/03, \u00a7\u00a036, 8\u00a0January 2008). It was not in dispute between the parties that the bus had a considerable commercial value for the applicant. However, following amendment of the Criminal Code in December 2003, removing confiscation as a penalty for criminal offences, and in the absence of any civil claims against the applicant, it was incumbent on the national authorities to re-assess the lawfulness and necessity of the continued application of the order. Indeed, it was the investigator\u2019s duty under the CCrP to lift the charging order if it was no longer necessary (see paragraph 25 above). Nevertheless, the case remained dormant and no investigative measures were taken between 2000 and early 2006. The domestic authorities did not consider whether it would be possible to leave the bus with the applicant, while restraining him from disposing of it. Although the availability of alternative solutions does not in itself render the interference with the applicant\u2019s right unjustified, it constitutes a relevant factor when determining whether the means chosen may be regarded as reasonable and suited to achieving the legitimate aim being pursued (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7\u00a051, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a098; and Wiesinger v.
