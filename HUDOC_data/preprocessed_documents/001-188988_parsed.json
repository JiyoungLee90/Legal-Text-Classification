The term of such an arrest had to be calculated from the time a person was taken to a police station and could not exceed forty-eight hours, in accordance with Article 27.5 of the Code. The applicant had spent less than twenty-four hours at the police station, which had not exceeded the statutory limit.

Furthermore, the list of exceptions to the right to liberty secured in Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is an exhaustive one, and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty (see Giulia Manzoni v.

This remedy was provided for by domestic law at the material time (see paragraphs 24-25 above). The Government did not elaborate on their comment why civil proceedings under Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure constituted an inappropriate remedy for the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 11. They merely referred to the domestic judicial decisions, according to which the contested acts of the police had been the matter of the administrative proceedings and could not therefore be subject to a separate review. At the same time, the Court notes that the justice of the peace did not examine the adequacy of the security measures applied at the venue of the demonstration or the reasons why it was terminated and the participants dispersed, and instead focused on the question of the applicant\u2019s disobedience to the police. The issue of the broader lawfulness of the police acts interrupting the assembly were not part of the administrative proceedings, and the Government did not allege that the justice of the peace could have made an assessment of them.",

It does not appear from any of the submissions that the applicant was among those responsible for the initial acts of aggression which contributed to the deterioration of the protest\u2019s initially peaceful nature. As regards the breaking through of the police cordon imputed to the applicant, she denied pushing through it and, even if she had found herself beyond the cordon, there is no evidence that this was the result of her deliberate efforts. According to the material in the case file, the cordon rupture had resulted from the pressure of the crowd which had built up because of the unexpected and unannounced change by the authorities of the venue layout (see Frumkin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 113-16 and\u00a0132). Apart from that, the applicant\u2019s behaviour remained strictly peaceful. The Court therefore considers that she enjoyed the protection of Article\u00a011 in the present case.",

It follows that no domestic balancing exercise was carried out, which would have allowed the Russian courts to weigh considerations of \u201cprevention of disorder\u201d or \u201cprotection of the rights and freedoms of others\u201d against the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of peaceful assembly. Accordingly, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s situation was not substantially different from that of Mr Frumkin, and that the dispersal of the demonstration involving the applicant\u2019s arrest had a similar chilling effect, that is, of discouraging her and others from attending protest rallies. It concludes that the security measures implemented at the site of the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square, its early termination and the dispersal amounted to a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of peaceful assembly.",
