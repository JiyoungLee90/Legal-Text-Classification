However, it finds no convincing explanation for the time taken \u2013 about three years \u2013 before the Court of Appeal. As remarked by the applicant, there was a period of inactivity of one year and ten months before the appellate court had even assigned a court official (referendaire) to examine his case. The Government explained that at the turn of the century the Helsinki Court of Appeal had suffered from a heavy case load. By the end of 2000 the number of pending cases had increased by approximately 12 %, which was considered alarming. The present case had to wait its turn. The Court recalls that this is not a sufficient excuse for the delay as domestic courts are under an obligation to organise themselves in such a way as to meet the requirements of Article 6 including the reasonable time requirement (P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, cited above, \u00a7\u00a074, Molander v. , no. 10615/03, \u00a7\u00a028, 7 November 2006). Given the importance of what was at stake for the applicant and the fact that there was no oral hearing before the Court of Appeal, the Court considers that the time taken by that court to examine the case was exceptionally lengthy.",
