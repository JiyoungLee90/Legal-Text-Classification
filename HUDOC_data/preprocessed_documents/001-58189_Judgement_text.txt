The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) on 11 March 1996, within the threemonth period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 25586/94) against the Italian Republic lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by an Italian national, Mrs Maria Rosaria Lapalorcia, on 12 May 1994.
The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby Italy recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

2.  In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 35 § 3 (d) of Rules of Court B, the applicant stated that she wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 31). The lawyer was given leave by the President of the Chamber to use the Italian language (Rule 28 § 3). 
On 30 March 1996 the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, decided, under Rule 21 § 7 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to consider the instant case and the cases of Spurio, De Santa, Gallo, Abenavoli, Zilaghe, Laghi, Viero, Orlandini, Ryllo, Soldani, Fusco, Di Luca and Saluzzi, Nicodemo, Pizzi, Scarfò, Argento and Trombetta v. Italy. The Chamber to be constituted for that purpose included ex officio Mr C. Russo, the elected judge of Italian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 § 4 (b)). On the same day, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr N. Valticos, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr A.B. Baka, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha, Mr G. Mifsud Bonnici, Mr P. Kūris and Mr E. Levits (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5).
As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Italian Government (“the Government”), the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 39 § 1 and 40). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 17 July 1996 and the Government’s memorial on 25 July. On 25 June 1996 the Secretary to the Commission had informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.
On 21 October 1996 the Commission produced the file on the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the President’s instructions.
In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 November 1996. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.

There appeared before the Court:
The Court heard addresses by Mr Perenič, Mr Manzo, Mr Raimondi and Mr Romano, and the latter’s reply to a question asked by one judge.
Mrs Maria Rosaria Lapalorcia, who is employed as a children’s welfare officer by the province of Benevento (Campania), lives in Benevento.
On 20 October 1980 Benevento Provincial Council (Giunta Provinciale) authorised its president to request the secondment of the applicant, who was at that time a civil servant working in a clinic (Ente Antitracomatoso) belonging to Foggia Provincial Council (Apulia). On 25 February 1981 the clinic agreed to the applicant’s secondment.
On 31 March 1981 Benevento Provincial Council took formal note that Mrs Lapalorcia had commenced her new duties on 4 March 1981 and undertook to reimburse to the clinic the salary it would continue to pay the applicant during the whole period of her secondment.
On 1 June 1981 the Foggia local health unit (“the USL”) took over the work of the clinic, which had continued to pay the applicant’s salary until 31 May.
On 16 June 1982 Mrs Lapalorcia, who was on maternity leave, asked Benevento Provincial Council to pay her salary, which she had not received for a year.
On 27 September 1982 the Council informed the Foggia USL of its decision to pay the sum owed and requested the information it needed to enable it to proceed. On 22 October 1983 it ordered payment of the salary owed for the period from 1 June 1981 to 31 July 1982 and salary falling due thereafter. However, the applicant received only part of the amount she was entitled to (12,817,232 Italian lire).
On 22 November 1988 Mrs Lapalorcia instituted proceedings in the Campania Regional Administrative Court (“the RAC”) seeking an order requiring Benevento Provincial Council to pay her the amount owed in full, after adjustment for inflation and the addition of interest at the statutory rate.
On 7 December 1988 she filed an application with the registry of the RAC asking for a date to be fixed for the hearing. On 28 April 1994 she applied for the case to be set down for an urgent hearing.
In a judgment of 8 November 1994, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 24 November 1994, and which became final on 19 January 1995, the RAC gave judgment in the applicant’s favour.
Mrs Lapalorcia applied to the Commission on 12 May 1994. She complained of the length of proceedings in the Campania Regional Administrative Court and relied on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
On 6 July 1995 the Commission declared the application (no. 25586/94) admissible. In its report of 28 November 1995 (Article 31) it expressed the opinion by twenty-four votes to five that there had been a breach of Article 6. The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.
The Government asked the Court to hold that there had been no breach of Article 6 § 1.
