The County Court gave the applicant a thirty-day time-limit to pay the remaining part of the fee. It also gave the applicant the same time-limit to find out where O. currently lived. The court noted that in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure (Tsiviilkohtumenetluse seadustik), in filiation cases parties had to appear in court in person and they also had to be summoned personally. Accordingly, the court could not proceed with the claim without having information about the defendant\u2019s address. The court noted that in view of the fact that the defendant was a Nigerian national probably living in Denmark, it was likely that the defendant had to be heard in a court in the place of his residence in line with the provisions of EU Council Regulation no. 1206/2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters. However, for that it was necessary to ascertain where O. was residing. The court noted that it was the plaintiff\u2019s obligation to find out where O. actually lived; it considered that the applicant\u2019s efforts in this respect had not been sufficient. It referred to the fact that O. was the applicant\u2019s husband and that divorce proceedings were pending before a Danish court, and concluded that the applicant had better chances of ascertaining O.\u2019s whereabouts, for example through his acquaintances, relatives and colleagues.",

The Court notes that Estonian law recognised a mother\u2019s right to challenge an entry in the birth register (section 44 of the Family Law Act, see paragraph 21 above) and to seek the establishment of the filiation of her child from the father to whom she was not married (section 42 of the Family Law Act, see paragraph 20 above). The Court does not share the Government\u2019s opinion that failure to comply with procedural requirements by an applicant excludes the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to disputes in respect of which it would otherwise apply. The right of access to courts by its very nature calls for regulation by the State (see, for example, Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v. Germany [GC], no. 42527/98, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2001VIII); procedural requirements or pre-conditions to recourse to the courts or to the use of these rights are, in the Court\u2019s view, in substance restrictions to the access to a court and do not, as such, impair the existence of the rights concerned in the domestic legal system or exclude the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (compare Mizzi, cited above, \u00a7 74, and also Al-Adsani v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35763/97, \u00a7\u00a7 46-47, ECHR 2001XI). The Court also notes that actions concerning the contestation of filiation or establishment of paternity are matters of family law and on that account alone they are \u201ccivil\u201d in character (compare Mizzi, cited above, \u00a7 76, and Rasmussen v. Denmark, 28 November 1984, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 87). It follows that Article 6 \u00a7 1 applies to the facts of the present case.",

Although it could not be appealed against as the applicant correctly pointed out, that decision did not terminate the proceedings in question. Indeed, by the same decision the applicant was given an additional time-limit for eliminating deficiencies related to her action (payment of the State fee and provision of information about the defendant\u2019s whereabouts). Moreover, the applicant\u2019s arguments concerning the alleged unconstitutionality of certain provisions could have been reiterated in an appeal against the County Court\u2019s decision of 16 April 2010 (see below).",

The Court also notes that the County Court\u2019s decision was taken on 16 April 2010, that is, more than six months before the application was lodged with the Court (22 October 2010). It follows that the applicant\u2019s complaint about lack of access to a court, in so far as it relates to the first set of civil proceedings taken separately, must be rejected under Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and\u00a04 of the Convention.

They further argued that the applicant had not been prevented in any practical manner from bringing her claim before the domestic courts and that her actions could have been examined on the merits had she complied with the formal procedural requirements. In particular, the Government submitted that the requirement to pay a State fee was a justified restriction on the right of access to a court. The amount of the fee had not been disproportionate and it had been open to the applicant to apply for procedural assistance (full or partial exemption from the payment of the fee or its payment in instalments). Furthermore, the requirement to produce the defendant\u2019s address or other contact information could not be considered a disproportionate restriction on access to a court. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to provide the County Court with any evidence as to whether she had contacted the Danish authorities or the relatives, friends or colleagues of her husband. The Government also noted that the applicant could have searched for the relevant information on the Internet on international social networking sites. If serious efforts to ascertain the defendant\u2019s whereabouts had been made, it would have been possible to summon the defendant by a public notice under Article 317 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Lastly, the Government considered that the requirement under the domestic law that an entry in the birth register had to be contested before a filiation action could be filed did not constitute a disproportionate restriction on access to a court. They argued that a court could not decide on the rights and duties of a man entered in the birth register without the person himself being aware of the proceedings concerning his rights and without him being heard in the proceedings. A claim contesting the paternity of a man entered in the birth register and a claim for establishing the paternity of another man were different by type and directed against different defendants. In the present case, the applicant had not contested the County Court\u2019s refusal to hear her action concerning the entry in the birth register and therefore her second claim had been inadmissible under the Estonian legislation and case-law.",

It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. The Court\u2019s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Mizzi, cited above, \u00a7 86, and Cordova, cited above, \u00a7 57).",

It was open to her to challenge the entry concerning the child\u2019s father in the birth register and thereafter to seek the establishment of the child\u2019s filiation. The mere fact that under the domestic law these proceedings had to be pursued consecutively rather than at the same time, and that it was not possible to pursue the second proceedings without the first proceedings having been successfully completed, did not, in the Court\u2019s view, render the applicant\u2019s access to a court ineffective or restrict it to such an extent that the very essence of the right was impaired. The Court notes that it is not called upon to assess whether the domestic legal system was designed to operate in the manner which was most convenient for the applicant. Rather, the Court\u2019s role is to determine whether the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court was restricted in a disproportionate manner. However, even if the regulation in question may seem somewhat formalistic, the Court is unable to conclude that this has been the case in the present instance.",

Nor did she inform the County Court of the outcome, if any, of the information request she undertook to make to the Danish police. Therefore, the County Court refused to proceed with the examination of the claim. The Court is of the view that if the applicant had used the remedy at her disposal and appealed against the first-instance court\u2019s decision, the Court would be able to assess whether indeed in those proceedings the requirements related to the payment of the State fee and the applicant\u2019s obligation to provide information about the defendant\u2019s residence were excessive and effectively prevented her access to a court also in the second set of proceedings. However, since the applicant failed to challenge the County Court\u2019s decision before a higher jurisdiction, she failed to use an available remedy against the County Court\u2019s refusal (see, in this connection, in paragraph 27 above, the domestic case-law of appeal courts where first-instance courts\u2019 decisions have been quashed in similar circumstances). Therefore the Court does not need to assess whether the applicant did what could have been reasonably expected of her in finding out about the defendant\u2019s residence, whether she took reasonable steps related to the State fee and whether the County Court\u2019s interpretation of the relevant requirements was excessively rigid. The Court is of the view that lodging an appeal against the County Court\u2019s decision was the least that could have been expected of the applicant and it cannot overlook the fact that the higher jurisdictions were given no possibility of assessing the situation and putting things right, if needed, in the domestic proceedings. The Court observes that the outcome of the first set of proceedings prevented the applicant\u2019s access to a court in the second set of proceedings. However, since she did not use the remedies available to her in the first set of proceedings, the Court considers that her access to a court in the second set of proceedings was not restricted in a disproportionate manner.",
