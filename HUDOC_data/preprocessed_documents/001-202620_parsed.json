Furthermore, it has held that the involuntary examination of a person by a psychiatrist from a State-run clinic or a hospital amounted to an interference with his right to respect for his private life (see Matter v.

The Court reiterates that the expressions \u201cprescribed by law\u201d and \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d in Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention not only require that the impugned measure should have a legal basis in domestic law, but also refer to the quality of the law in question, which should be accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to its effects (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, \u00a7 108, ECHR 2015, and the cases cited therein). In that respect, the Court notes that on 6\u00a0November 2012 the Municipal Court terminated the non-contentious proceedings, holding that upon that decision becoming final the procedure would be continued under the rules of criminal proceedings. The applicant appealed against that decision on 21\u00a0February 2013 (that is to say within the statutory deadline). It furthermore notes that, under section 19 of the 1998 Non-contentious Proceedings Act, an appeal has suspensive effect (see paragraph 49\u00a0above). Nevertheless, the criminal proceedings were continued on 21\u00a0December 2012 (that is to say while the non-contentious proceedings were still ongoing) and the Municipal Court repeatedly ordered the applicant\u2019s psychiatric and psychological examinations and his forceful escort to those examinations, in accordance with Articles 124 and 139 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The orders therefore had a basis in domestic law. However, in the particular circumstances of the present case, it cannot be said that the domestic authorities have complied with the law as the continuation of the criminal proceedings was unlawful. The Court notes that the Cantonal Court had ruled that the Municipal Court could not have lawfully continued the adjourned criminal proceedings of its own motion, and by extension could not have lawfully issued any orders for the applicant\u2019s forcible examination within the context of those continued proceedings, as that would have run contrary to the applicable rules on criminal procedure (see paragraph 38 above). The interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life was therefore not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, within the meaning of Article\u00a08 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention.",

In this regard, it is of importance, for instance, whether there is reason to believe that the person concerned would resist arrest or try to abscond or cause injury or damage or suppress evidence (see Svinarenko and Slyadnev v.\u00a0Russia [GC], nos. 32541/08 and 43441/08, \u00a7 117, ECHR 2014 (extracts), and the cases cited therein).

Any interference with human dignity strikes at the very essence of the Convention. For that reason any conduct by law-enforcement officers vis-\u00e0-vis an individual which diminishes human dignity constitutes a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.

The applicant\u2019s handcuffing thus diminished his human dignity and was in itself degrading (see, mutatis mutandis, Radkov and Sabev, cited above, \u00a7 34, and Ilievska v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a020136/11, \u00a7 63, 7 May 2015).
