In this connection the Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged.

In this connection, the Court reiterates the applicant\u2019s assertion (see paragraph 18 above) and the Government\u2019s further submission that on 24\u00a0March 2000 a higher-ranking prosecutor quashed the decision of 14\u00a0March 2000 and reopened the investigation (see paragraph 19 above).",

The Court notes the Government\u2019s submission that the Koptevo District Court refused to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint precisely on the ground that the decision of 14 March 2000 had already been quashed. In such circumstances, the Court does not consider that the applicant\u2019s decision to pursue the possibility of a complaint to a higher-ranking prosecutor was unreasonable or incapable of furnishing him with a remedy. The Court is also mindful of the fact that the Government did not argue that an appeal against the District Court\u2019s decision of 18 April 2000 would have been any more successful or would have been decided on the basis of any other issues.",

Bulgaria, no. 24760/94, 27 June 1996, DR 86-B, p. 71). Indeed, as a general rule, the State should be given an opportunity to investigate the case and give answer to the allegations of ill-treatment. At the same time an applicant does not need to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing the alleged breach (see Yoyler v.

However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.

Nevertheless, at no point in the proceedings before the Court did the Government challenge the applicant\u2019s factual submissions. The Court notes that the Government did not provide any explanation as to how the applicant had acquired the injuries at the police station, merely citing the impossibility of drawing any conclusions due to the ongoing investigation into the applicant\u2019s illtreatment complaints. The Court further notes that in order to be able to assess the merits of the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment complaint and in view of the nature of the allegations, it asked the respondent Government to submit a copy of the complete investigation file relating to the criminal proceedings against the police officers. The Government, without giving any reasons, failed to provide the Court with the materials sought, limiting themselves to submitting copies of the investigators\u2019 and prosecutors\u2019 decisions. In these circumstances, bearing in mind the authorities\u2019 obligation to account for injuries caused to persons within their control in custody, and in the absence of a convincing and plausible explanation by the Government in the instant case, the Court considers that it can draw inferences from the Government\u2019s conduct and finds it established to the standard of proof required in the Convention proceedings that the injuries sustained by the applicant were the result of the treatment of which he complained and for which the Government bore responsibility (see Selmouni v.

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. An obligation to investigate \u201cis not an obligation of result, but of means\u201d: not every investigation should necessarily be successful or come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimant\u2019s account of events; however, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Thus, the investigation of serious allegations of illtreatment must be thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0107 et seq., and Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998VIII, \u00a7 102 et seq.). Finally, the investigation must be expedient. In cases under Articles 2 and\u00a03 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation was at issue, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a0133 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV). Consideration was given to the starting of investigations, delays in taking statements (see Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no.\u00a023531/94, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2000-VI, and Tekin v. Turkey, judgment of 9\u00a0June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, \u00a7 67) and to the length of time taken for the initial investigation (see Indelicato v. Italy, no. 31143/96, \u00a7 37, 18 October 2001).",

His role was critical not only to the pursuit of criminal proceedings against the perpetrators of the offence but also to the pursuit by the applicant of other remedies to redress the harm he had suffered (see paragraph 26 above). The Court notes that the prosecution authorities who were made aware of the applicant\u2019s alleged beating initiated an investigation which has not yet resulted in criminal prosecutions against the perpetrators of the beating. The investigation was closed and reopened a number of times and is currently pending. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the issue is consequently not so much whether there has been an investigation, since the parties do not dispute that there has been one, as whether it has been conducted diligently, whether the authorities have been determined to identify and prosecute those responsible and, accordingly, whether the investigation has been \u201ceffective\u201d.",

In the present case the applicant\u2019s mother brought the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment to the attention of the authorities by filing a complaint with the Koptevo district prosecutor (see paragraph 15 above). It appears that the Koptevo district prosecutor\u2019s office promptly launched an investigation after being notified of the alleged beatings. Within a short period of time the investigation had identified the police officers who had participated in or witnessed the events of 5\u00a0December 1999, and questioned them. However, the Court is mindful of the fact that in the period immediately following the events in question no attempts were made to conduct a medical expert examination of the applicant. The Court reiterates in this connection that proper medical examinations are an essential safeguard against ill-treatment. The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and been allocated a mandate which is broad in scope (see Akko\u00e7 v. , nos.\u00a022947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7\u00a055 and \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000X).

Since being reopened in March 2006 the investigation has remained pending and the police officers have not yet been brought to trial. The Government failed to provide any explanation for the protraction of the criminal proceedings.

Firstly, no evaluation was carried out with respect to the quantity and nature of the applicant\u2019s injuries in view of the different versions of what had occurred during the relevant incident. In delivering their decisions the investigators limited themselves to a restatement of the hospital report which listed the injuries sustained by the applicant, and to a selective reiteration of the expert findings. The Court considers it extraordinary that the investigator for the first time cited a possible cause of the applicant\u2019s injuries in his decision of 29 October 2006, although that finding was based on the expert report issued in 2000 (see paragraph 24 above).",

It is apparent from the decisions submitted to the Court that the investigators based their conclusions mainly on the testimonies given by the police officers involved in the incident. Although excerpts from the applicant\u2019s and his brother\u2019s testimonies were included in the decisions on discontinuation of the criminal proceedings, the investigators did not consider those testimonies to be credible, apparently because they reflected personal opinions and constituted an accusatory tactic by the applicant and his brother. However, the investigators did accept the police officers\u2019 testimonies as credible, despite the fact that their statements could have constituted defence tactics and have been aimed at damaging the applicant\u2019s credibility. In the Court\u2019s view, the prosecution inquiry applied different standards when assessing the testimonies, as those given by the applicant and his brother were deemed to be subjective but not those given by the police officers. The credibility of the latter testimonies should also have been questioned, as the prosecution investigation was supposed to establish whether the officers were liable on the basis of disciplinary or criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v. , no.\u00a046317/99, \u00a7\u00a099, 23\u00a0February 2006).",

Those individuals did not witness the beatings and merely attested to the applicant\u2019s allegedly \u201cprovocative\u201d behaviour (see paragraphs 17 and 20 above). The Court finds that in the light of the applicant\u2019s testimony that he had been beaten up first in the lobby and subsequently in the duty room of the police station, the investigators should not have limited themselves to questioning individuals who had been detained together with the applicant in a cell for administrative arrestees and had, therefore, been unable to see the alleged ill-treatment. While the investigating authorities may not have been provided with the names of individuals who could have seen the applicant at the police station or might have witnessed his alleged beatings, they were expected to take steps of their own initiative to identify possible eyewitnesses. In this connection the Court also notes that, due to the protraction of the investigation, the authorities could no longer identify other persons who had been at Koptevo police station on 5 December 1999 and who might have witnessed the incident, the registration logs of the Koptevo police station had already been destroyed (see paragraph 24 above). Furthermore, it appears that the investigators took no meaningful steps to search the premises where the applicant had allegedly been ill-treated. The Court therefore finds that the investigating authorities\u2019 failure to look for corroborating evidence and their deferential attitude to the police officers must be considered to be a particularly serious shortcoming in the investigation (see Ayd\u0131n v. Turkey, judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports 1997VI, \u00a7\u00a0106).",

Furthermore the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant lodged his application before the Court on 24 July 2000, that is after the authorities had closed the investigation into his ill-treatment complaints.

It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7\u00a096, ECHR 1999V). The Court has previously had before it cases in which it has found that there has been treatment which could only be described as torture (see Aksoy v.

It has never been argued that the applicant resisted arrest, attempted to escape or did not comply with lawful orders from the police officers. Furthermore, there is no indication that at any point during his arrest or subsequent detention at the police station he threatened the police officers, for example by openly carrying a weapon or by attacking them (see, by contrast, Necdet Bulut v.

The Court is mindful of the investigators\u2019 findings that the applicant allegedly acted provocatively in the police station, using offensive language against the police officers. However, the Court cannot accept that in these circumstances the officers may have needed to resort to physical force. It appears that the use of force was intentional, retaliatory in nature and aimed at debasing the applicant and forcing him into submission.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the treatment to which the applicant was subjected must have caused him mental and physical suffering. Moreover, it resulted in longterm damage to his health (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). In these circumstances the Court finds that the applicant was subjected to treatment which can be characterised as torture.",

Firstly, they submitted that the police officers had rightfully arrested the applicant because he had refused to disclose his identity. The officers had acted in response to phone message no. 12316, which contained information on wanted criminals who looked similar to the applicant and his brother. Relying on section 11 of the Police Act, the Government stressed that police officers were entitled to check persons\u2019 identity documents if there were sufficient grounds to suspect them of having committed a criminal or administrative offence. In their second line of argument, the Government stated that the applicant had been arrested because, by using offensive language in public, he had committed a minor disorderly act, that is to say, an administrative offence. Hence, by virtue of section 242 of the Administrative Code, he could be detained until his case was to be examined by a judge or a high-ranking police officer.

Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that the Government suggested that the applicant should have applied to a court with his complaint about unlawful arrest. They did not make reference to any legal norm providing for the possibility of bringing such a complaint before a court. Nor did the Government supply any example from domestic practice showing that it was possible for the applicant to bring such a complaint. In this connection the Court considers it necessary to point out that section 246 of the Russian Administrative Code prescribed another avenue of appeal. It required the applicant to lodge such a complaint with a prosecutor or a high-ranking police officer (see paragraph 28 above).

The Court further observes that it has found a combination of torture with a particularly grievous violation of the right to liberty in the present case. The Court accepts that the applicant suffered humiliation and distress on account of his unlawful detention and the ill-treatment inflicted on him. In addition, he did not benefit from an adequate and effective investigation of his complaints about the ill-treatment. In these circumstances, it considers that the applicant\u2019s suffering and frustration cannot be compensated for by a mere finding of a violation. Nevertheless, the particular amount claimed appears excessive. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, and taking into account in particular the lasting consequences of ill-treatment on the applicant\u2019s health, it awards the applicant EUR 30,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
