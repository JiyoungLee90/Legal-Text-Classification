Moreover, as regards the villa in Portugal, it was open to him under the relevant provisions of the DTOA to apply to the High Court for a variation of the restraint order to enable him to let the property if he so desired. Since rental and upkeep of the property were also in the interests of the national authorities who were seeking the confiscation order there is no reason to suppose that they would have objected to any such application designed to maintain the value of the asset.
