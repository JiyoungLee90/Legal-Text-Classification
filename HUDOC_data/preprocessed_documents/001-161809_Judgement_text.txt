The case originated in an application (no. 33839/11), against the Republic of Albania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by 9 Albanian nationals. Details of the applicants are set out in Appendix No. 1 attached to the judgment.
The applicants were represented by Mr S. Puto, a lawyer practising in Tirana. The Albanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms A. Hicka of the State Advocate’s Office.
On 20 December 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
On 30 May 1995 the Vlora Commission recognised the applicants’ inherited property rights over a plot of land measuring 10,000 sq. m. Since the plot of land was occupied, the applicants would be compensated in one of the ways provided by law.
To date, no compensation has been paid.
The relevant domestic law and practice has been described in detail in, inter alia, the judgment of Ramadhi v. Albania (no. 38222/02, 13 November 2007); Manushaqe Puto and Others v. Albania (nos. 604/07, 43628/07, 46684/07 and 34770/09, §§ 23-53, 31 July 2012) and, more recently, Sharra and Others v.
