Assessing the reasonableness of the length, the Court takes into account the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no.\u00a030979/96, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 2000-VII). The dispute at issue was somewhat complex. The applicant repeatedly defaulted in attendance (see paragraph\u00a015). No significant delays can be attributed solely to the State. The applicant's right to a plot of land was at stake. Regard being had to all the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement has been complied with.",
