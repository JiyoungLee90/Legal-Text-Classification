As regards the claimant\u2019s consent to the transfer of the obligations to the State, they noted that Information letter no.\u00a0136 of the Supreme Commercial Court of Russia clarifying the matter (see paragraph 35 above) had not been issued at the time of the events. However, according to the established practice at the material time the consent of an individual to the assignment of the claims to the Russian Federation had had to be expressed by way of lodging an application with the commercial court dealing with the case. The transfer of the obligation had been considered completed when the person\u2019s name in the register of creditors\u2019 claims had been replaced by the Russian Federation. According to the Government, the applicant made no such application. However, he claimed that the transfer had taken place in the proceedings before the court of general jurisdiction. They accordingly argued that the District Court had established the transfer of the obligations from the ZAO to the State by the decision of 23\u00a0May 2008, in so far as the previous judicial decisions in the applicant\u2019s favour against the ZAO of 3\u00a0August 2004, 21\u00a0July 2005 and 13\u00a0October 2006 had been concerned. The Government submitted that the lump sum set out in the decision of 23 May 2008 had been paid to the applicant within less than eight months, and the applicant had been receiving the regular monthly payments in good time. Similarly, they argued that the judgment of 17\u00a0August 2011 had been enforced within four months, that is to say within a reasonable time.",

Therefore he had failed to exhaust the available domestic remedies. In any event, they argued that in accordance with the Insolvency Act the amounts under a friendly settlement between a creditor and an insolvency officer \u2013 such as the decision in question \u2013 were not to be aggregated. Therefore, the obligations under the decision of 26\u00a0September 2005 could not be transferred to the State in the way the obligations to make the regular payments had been transferred.",

He also submitted that under domestic law, there had been no procedure in place to apply for the transfer of the obligations of an insolvent debtor to the State. Thus, he argued that the obligations under all judicial decisions in his favour issued initially against the ZAO had been transferred to the State irrespective of whether he had applied for such a transfer. In respect of the monthly payments under the judgment of 23\u00a0May 2008, the applicant submitted that they had been either paid to him irregularly or had not been index-linked. He argued furthermore that in 2011 the courts had dismissed his application under the Compensation Act on purely formal grounds. Lastly, he submitted that the judgment of 17\u00a0August 2011 had not been enforced until June 2012.",
