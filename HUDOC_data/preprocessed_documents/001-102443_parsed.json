He had not been in a position to establish contact with his children and to bear actual responsibility for them as Mr and Mrs B. had refused him access. By doing so, Mr and Mrs B. also wanted to prevent him from residing in Germany. He rejected allegations that he only wanted to profit from the children\u2019s existence in order to obtain a residence permit and underlined that these allegations had already been examined and rejected by the Baden-Baden District Court and by the psychological expert consulted by that court which alone, as has been stressed in the Court\u2019s case-law many times, has \u2013 and had here \u2013 the benefit of contact with all the persons concerned.

As was illustrated by the present case, it depended on the legal parents\u2019 free will whether or not the biological father could build up a social and family relationship with his children. \nIf the legal parents arbitrarily prevented him from doing so, the biological father could not be granted access under Article 1685 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code even if an independent expert confirmed that this would be in the children\u2019s best interest. The question of access therefore had to be determined in each individual case in accordance with the best interest of the child concerned \n\u2013 which alone was decisive under Article 8 for the question whether a biological father should be granted access \u2013 and could not be predetermined by a legal presumption of when contacts would under no circumstances be in a child\u2019s best interest.

In the present case, the applicant did not yet have any contact with his biological children because their mother and their legal father, who were entitled to decide on the twins\u2019 contacts with other persons (Article\u00a01632 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code, see paragraph 25 above), refused his requests to allow contact with them. Moreover, under the provisions of German law (Article 1594 \u00a7 2 and Article 1600 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code, see paragraphs 16, 29 and 30 above), the applicant could neither acknowledge paternity nor contest Mr B.\u2019s paternity so as to become the twins\u2019 legal father.

It notes that the applicant expressed his wish to have contacts with his children even before their birth and repeatedly asked Mr and Mrs B. to be allowed access afterwards. He further pursued his attempt to have contacts with the twins by bringing access proceedings in the domestic courts speedily after their birth. In the circumstances of the case, in which the applicant was prevented from taking any further steps to assume responsibility for the twins, the Court considers that this conduct was sufficient to demonstrate the applicant\u2019s interest in his children. As a result, the Court, in particular, does not consider it established that the applicant lacked genuine interest in his offspring and wanted to have contact with the twins exclusively in order to obtain a residence permit. Furthermore, as to the nature of the relationship between the twins\u2019 natural parents, the Court notes that, even though the applicant and Mrs B. never cohabited, the children emanated from a relationship which lasted some two years and was, therefore, not merely haphazard.",

It follows from these considerations that the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities regarding access issues, but rather to review, in the light of the Convention, the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see, inter alia, Hokkanen v. , 23 September 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 299A; G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc, cited above, \u00a7 41; and Sommerfeld, cited above, \u00a7 62). However, restrictions placed by the domestic authorities on parental rights of access call for a strict scrutiny as they entail the danger that the family relations between a young child and a parent would be effectively curtailed (see, inter alia, Elsholz v.

Applying the relevant provisions of the Civil Code (Articles 1684 and 1685), that court argued that the applicant did not fall within the group of persons entitled to claim access as he was not the children\u2019s legal father and had not borne any responsibility for them (see paragraphs 17-18 above). German law, as interpreted by the Court of Appeal, therefore did not provide for a judicial examination of the question whether contacts between a biological father and his children would be in the children\u2019s best interest if another man was the children\u2019s legal father and if the biological father had not yet borne any responsibility for the children (\u201csocial and family relationship\u201d). Such a \u201csocial and family relationship\u201d will notably be assumed if that father lived with the children in domestic community for a lengthy period of time (see, mutatis mutandis, for a further case in which parental rights of a father were, without a further examination on the merits, prima facie not considered to be in the child\u2019s best interest, Zaunegger v.\u00a0Germany, no. 22028/04, \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 46, 3 December 2009, concerning the general exclusion of judicial review of the attribution of sole custody to the mother of a child born out of wedlock). The reasons why the biological father had not previously established a \u201csocial and family relationship\u201d with his children were irrelevant (compare paragraph 19 above); the provisions thus also covered cases in which the fact that such a relationship has not yet been established was not attributable to the biological father.",

However, in a considerable number of European States the domestic courts would be in a position to examine on the merits whether contact of a biological father in the applicant\u2019s situation with his child would be in the latter\u2019s interest and could grant that father access if that was the case (see paragraphs 32-40 above).",

It notes that the approach taken by the Court of Appeal and its interpretation of the domestic legislation led to the applicant being denied any contact with his children, irrespective of the question whether such contact was beneficial for the children\u2019s well-being.

Under the applicable provisions of the Civil Code (Articles 1592 no. 1, 1594 \u00a7 2 and 1600 \u00a7 2), he could not become the legal father of the twins. Likewise, he could not obtain a right of access for having borne responsibility for the children because the legal parents, Mr and Mrs B., had the right to decide what contact the twins should have with third persons (Article 1632 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code, see paragraph 25 above) and were therefore in a position to prevent the applicant from assuming any responsibility for them.

It further notes that the twins in the present case were living with their legal father and their mother and accepts that the existing family ties between the spouses and the children they actually cared for equally warranted protection. In fact, the case before it differs from many previous applications before the Court concerning questions of access to children in that a fair balance has to be struck by the domestic authorities between the competing rights under Article 8 not only of two parents and a child, but of several individuals concerned \u2013 the mother, the legal father, the biological father, the married couples\u2019 biological children and the children which emanated from the relationship of the mother and the biological father.",
