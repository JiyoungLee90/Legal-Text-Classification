The just satisfaction awarded by the Court of Appeal amounts to approximately 6.9% of what the Court would be likely to have awarded the applicant at that time in accordance with its practice, taking into account the particular circumstances of the proceedings. It is further to be noted that the court awarded the applicant only 30% of the maximum amount of compensation available under section 12 of the 2004 Act (see paragraphs 19\u00a0and 20 above, the latter as regards references to domestic law and practice).",
