His detention or questioning were not recorded. No one has seen Sayd-Salekh since that date; there is no information about his fate or whereabouts.

Despite a large number of \u201cdisappearances\u201d occurring in Chechnya in the past years, the authorities had failed to create a system which could prevent such incidents and respond quickly to them when they occurred. Thus, the applicant emphasised that the responsibility for special operations during which persons could be detained was not clear, especially vis-\u00e0-vis the local law-enforcement authorities. The list of personnel who took part in such operations was not available, and was sought by the investigation months after the operation had taken place. The investigating authorities were unable to ensure the cooperation of the commanding officers, as illustrated by the documents relating to Mr\u00a0Delimkhanov. No disciplinary or other measures were taken against senior law-enforcement personnel in charge of operations which resulted in disappearances, nor in respect of the senior prosecutors and investigators for failing to take timely steps to combat and investigate them. This resulted in impunity for both perpetrators and officials from the investigating agencies. Finally, the applicant considered that if a fast and comprehensive investigation had been carried out upon her application, her son might have been saved from \u201cdisappearing\u201d.",

Two of his relatives, Adnan I. and , were also taken to the regiment\u2019s headquarters and saw him there. Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov\u2019s detention was based on the suspicion that he had committed a criminal offence, namely that of aiding an alleged member of a criminal group, although no formal charges were laid against him. During his detention he was questioned by police officers, presumably about his suspected criminal activity. However, no formal records were drawn up in relation to his detention or questioning. His uncle and cousin witnessed Sayd-Salekh Ibragimov bearing clear signs of ill-treatment, frightened and totally controlled by his captors. They were given to understand that his life depended on the extent of his \u201ccooperation\u201d with the officers, who considered him responsible for the death and injuries of their colleagues. Although some officers of the oil regiment alleged that he had been released, together with his two relatives, he has not been seen since, and his family have had no news of him. Adnan I and  firmly denied that he was released with them, both to the Court and to the domestic investigation (see paragraphs 16, 17, 24 and 36 above). The investigation did not acquire any evidence of his alleged release. There is no plausible explanation as to what happened to him after his detention.",

In the context of the disappearances in the Northern Caucasus the Court has made presumptions of death in the absence of any reliable news of disappeared persons for periods ranging from four and a half years (see Imakayeva v.

In fact, as it appears from the information summarised above (see paragraphs 65-74 above), the Russian authorities were sufficiently aware of it, and had lately taken a number of specific actions to render investigations of this type of crime more efficient, inter alia, by creating a special unit within the Investigating Committee of the Chechen Republic.
