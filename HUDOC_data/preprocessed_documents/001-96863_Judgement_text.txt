The case originated in an application (no. 19438/05) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Romanian nationals, Mr Nicolae Veniamin and Mr Lascăr Veniamin (“the applicants”), on 28 April 2005.
The applicants were represented by Mr A. Vasiliu, a lawyer practising in . The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Răzvan-Horaţiu Radu.
On 1 September 2006, the President of the Third Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The French Government, to whom a copy of the application was transmitted under Rule 44 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court, did not exercise their right to intervene in the proceedings.
Both applicants, who are brothers, were born in 1946: Mr Nicolae Veniamin lives in Boulogne and Mr Lascăr Veniamin in .
On an unspecified date, the State seized possession of an apartment belonging to the mother of the applicants, on the 4th floor of no.43, , in .
By a final decision of 19 June 1998, the Bucharest District Court allowed the action brought by the applicants against the State for recovery of possession (acţiune în revendicare). The applicants were granted possession of the apartment on 19 January 1999.
Within less than one month from the final decision favourable to the applicants, on 6 July 1998, the State sold the apartment to the tenants under Law no. 112/1996. Subsequently, on 11 February 1999 the Mayor of Bucharest issued a decision for the restitution of the apartment to the tenants who had bought it.
The applicants lodged an action against the tenants, seeking to have the contract of sale concluded by them with the State set aside and the restitution of ownership of the apartment. By a final decision of 2 November 2004, the High Court of Cassation and Justice dismissed the action on the ground that the buyers had concluded the contract in good faith.
The relevant legal provisions and jurisprudence are described in the judgments Brumărescu v. Romania ([GC], no. 28342/95, §§ 31-33, ECHR 1999VII); Străin and Others v. Romania (no. 57001/00, §§ 19-26, ECHR 2005VII); Păduraru v. Romania (no. 63252/00, §§ 38-53, 1 December 2005); and Tudor v. Romania (no. 29035/05, §§ 15-20, 17 January 2008).
In particular, section 46 § 2 of Law no. 10/2001 provides that the sale or donation of immovable property unlawfully seized by the State shall be declared null and void, save where the transactions have been concluded in good faith.
