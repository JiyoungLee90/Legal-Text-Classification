The Supreme Court did not share the High Court\u2019s view that the evidentiary value of the video recording was diminished by certain misgivings concerning the lack of synchronisation of sound and picture when shown to the High Court. Those shortcomings had been remedied before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court also had regard to evidence taken by it from this person, which deviated slightly from the judicial examination before the High Court. It further had regard to the statements of an expert witness and the statements of a therapist who had treated the alleged victim. Considering the evidence as a whole, Justice Gj\u00f8lstad found that the evidence satisfied the standard of proof, establishing that sexual abuse had occurred and that, on the balance of probabilities, it was clear that the applicant was the abuser. Accordingly, there was a basis for awarding the victim compensation under section 3-5(1)(b) of the Damage Compensation Act. However, Justice Gj\u00f8lstad emphasised that this decision was taken independently of the decision in the criminal case and that it did not undermine the acquittal. Finally, as regards the amount of compensation, she observed, inter alia, that she based her assessment on her finding that several infringements had occurred and that, even though their extent was not possible to ascertain with precision, there had been serious violations involving a certain use of force or threats, as a result of which G. had sustained damage.

The compensation proceedings had only involved counsel for the victim and for the applicant \u2013 two private civil parties. Moreover, there had been no link between the outcome of the criminal proceedings and the compensation case, the right of the victim to claim compensation being entirely independent of the criminal case. On essential points the legal basis and the legal issues in the civil compensation proceedings had differed from those in the criminal case. Thus, the criteria for civil and criminal liability had differed, as had the applicable evidentiary standards. Above all, the compensation case had not involved an assessment of the applicant\u2019s criminal guilt. What was more, the appeal before the Supreme Court had been limited to the compensation case, had been governed by the Code of Civil Procedure and had comprised extensive new evidence not previously adduced at the criminal trial.

A fine \u2013 but absolutely essential \u2013 line had to be drawn between criminal and civil responsibility. The Convention principle of the presumption of innocence could not bar judicial or other authorities acting in civil matters from addressing the question whether the acquitted person had perpetrated the act that had formed the basis for the criminal charge against him. It would be unacceptable if an acquittal in a criminal case were binding upon any authority that was subsequently called upon to decide civil-law matters arising from the same set of facts. While a court would of course be bound by a finding that criminal responsibility had not been established, it should be free to establish the civil consequences flowing from the same set of facts. An acquittal could not have as a consequence a requirement that subsequent decisions in civil matters presume that the acquitted person had not perpetrated the act, if it was shown on the balance of probabilities that he or she nevertheless was the perpetrator. Such a view would indeed give rise to serious questions under the Convention itself, namely the right under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of access to a court for, inter alia, a victim claiming compensation under the civil law of tort.",

According to its established case-law, there are three criteria to be taken into account when deciding whether a person was \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d for the purposes of Article 6, namely the classification of the proceedings under national law, their essential nature and the type and severity of the penalty that the applicant risked incurring (see Phillips v. the United Kingdom, no. 41087/98, \u00a7 31, ECHR 2001-VII, and A.P., M.P. and T.P. v.

France, judgment of 10\u00a0February 1995, Series A no. 308, p. 16, \u00a7 35). In certain instances, the Court has also found the provision applicable to judicial decisions taken after the discontinuation of such proceedings (see in particular the following judgments: Minelli v.

Germany, 25 August 1987, Series A no. 123), or following an acquittal (see Sekanina, Rushiti and Lamanna, cited above). Those judgments concerned proceedings relating to such matters as an accused\u2019s obligation to bear court costs and prosecution expenses, a claim for reimbursement of his (or his heirs\u2019) necessary costs, or compensation for detention on remand, matters which were found to constitute a consequence and the concomitant of the criminal proceedings.",

However, this concerned only the initial criminal charges on which he was acquitted; it was of no relevance to the compensation claim. The Court notes that the latter had its legal basis in Chapter 3 of the Damage Compensation Act 1969, which sets out the general principles of the national law on torts applicable to personal injuries. It is clear from both the wording of section 3-5 and Norwegian case-law that criminal liability is not a prerequisite for liability to pay compensation. The compensation proceedings before the Supreme Court were governed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and the claim was described in its judgment as being \u201ccivil\u201d. Thus, the Court finds that the compensation claim in issue was not viewed as a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d under the relevant national law.",

The outcome of the criminal proceedings was not decisive for the compensation case. The victim had a right to claim compensation regardless of whether the defendant was convicted or, as here, acquitted, and the compensation issue was to be the subject of a separate legal assessment based on criteria and evidentiary standards which in several important respects differed from those that applied to criminal liability. This is indeed borne out by the circumstances of the present case, where the compensation matter was the sole issue in the appeal before the Supreme Court, involving private parties only, which was heard in proceedings governed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, with extensive new evidence being taken on that issue alone.",

Nor can the fact that evidence from the criminal trial is used to determine the civil-law consequences of the act warrant such a characterisation. Otherwise, as rightly pointed out by the Government, Article 6 \u00a7 2 would give a criminal acquittal the undesirable effect of pre-empting the victim\u2019s possibilities of claiming compensation under the civil law of tort, entailing an arbitrary and disproportionate limitation on his or her right of access to a court under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. This again could give a person who was acquitted of a criminal offence but would be considered liable according to the civil burden of proof the undue advantage of avoiding any responsibility for his or her actions. Such an extensive interpretation would not be supported either by the wording of Article 6 \u00a7 2 or any common ground in the national legal systems within the Convention community.

In other words, under that provision an acquittal does not prevent a court from considering whether the same act, divested of all the circumstances which gave it a criminal character, does not at least constitute prejudice such that the accused incurs civil liability if fault is established. It is, of course, important that the court in which the action for damages is brought should specify the wrongful act on which its decision is based, as distinct from the criminal offence in respect of which a final judgment has been given. In thus accepting the argument that criminal and civil wrongs are separate, I agree with the position expounded by the Court, namely: \u201c[W]hile the exoneration from criminal liability ought to stand in the compensation proceedings, it should not preclude the establishment of civil liability to pay compensation arising out of the same facts on the basis of a less strict burden of proof ...

Accordingly, Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention will be applicable if the judicial authorities\u2019 assessment of the conduct of an applicant or a defendant in a civil action for damages undermines the fact that he has been finally acquitted on all the charges against him.

It is difficult, however, to assert one thing and then the opposite: it cannot simultaneously be maintained that a man has been lawfully declared innocent of an offence (in this case, sexual abuse of a minor) and that he nonetheless probably did commit the offence (even if the probability is only 51%!) and should pay for it.",
