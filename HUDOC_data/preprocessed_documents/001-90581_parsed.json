The decision concerned specifically the course of events in the present case. According to the decision of the Supreme Court, the documents seized from the applicant, related to the commission relationship between himself and his Spanish legal counsel, did not contain information entrusted by the applicant to his legal counsel for the pursuit of a case as referred to in Chapter 17, Article 23, subsections 1 and 4, of the Code of Judicial Procedure. Therefore, there was no obstacle to seizing the documents from the applicant. The Supreme Court ruled on the case by nine votes to two, sitting as an enlarged chamber presided by the President of the Court.",

He argued that a separate storage facility, where one deposited goods of a private nature, could be regarded as private premises and that he had had a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding the correspondence which had been stored in that facility. He referred to the Court\u2019s recent judgment in the case of van Vondel v. the  (no.\u00a038258/03, \u00a7\u00a048, 25\u00a0October 2007) in which the Court found that there was no reason of principle to justify excluding activities of a professional or business nature from the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d and that there was therefore a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which might fall within the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d. In any event, the applicant claimed that there had been an interference with his right to respect for his correspondence.",
