The issue then arises as to whether, and in what form, the procedural obligation to investigate is revived. To that end, the Court considered in its judgment in the case of Brecknell v. the United Kingdom (no. 32457/04, \u00a7 71, 27 November 2007) that, where there is a plausible, or credible, allegation, piece of evidence or item of information relevant to the identification and eventual prosecution or punishment of the perpetrator of an unlawful killing, the authorities are under an obligation to take further measures. Such an investigation may in some cases reasonably be restricted to verifying the credibility of the source, or of the purported new evidence. The steps which it would be reasonable to take will vary considerably according to the facts of the situation. The lapse of time will, inevitably, be an obstacle as regards, for example, the location of witnesses and the ability of witnesses to recall events reliably (for a recent application of this principle, see Cerf v. Turkey, no. 12938/07, \u00a7\u00a7 65-67, 3\u00a0May 2016). New developments, occurring after a lull of several years, and which amount to no more than a mere formality, or do not produce any noticeable developments in the investigation, will not be accepted as providing a new starting point for the purposes of calculating the six-month time-limit (see Finozhenok v. Russia (dec.), no. 3025/06, 31 May 2011; Nasirkhayeva v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a01721/07, 31 May 2011; Dzhamaldayev v.

The inefficiency of the investigation was publically deplored by the victims and human rights organisations from 2000 onwards, and it appears unlikely that such a thought had not occurred to the applicants in the present case at an earlier date. The Court notes that they found themselves in the same situation as other victims, with very little or no information about the progress of the investigation from about the middle of 2000 onwards. It reiterates its conclusions in the Musayev and Others judgment about the obvious inefficiency of the criminal procedure.
