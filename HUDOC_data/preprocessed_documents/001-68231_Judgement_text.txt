The case originated in an application (no. 51545/99) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovakian national, Mr Jozef Švolík (“the applicant”), on 10 September 1999.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Benedik, a lawyer practising in . The Slovakian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Kresák.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that his right to a hearing within a reasonable time had been violated and that he had no effective remedy at his disposal in that respect.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
By a decision of 18 May 2004 the Court declared the application admissible.
The Government, but not the applicant, filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1933 and lives in .
On 5 January 1994 the applicant lodged an action for damages relating to the defendant's failure to comply with a lease contract. On 25 January 1994 he paid the court fees. On 21 March 1994 the defendant co-operative submitted its memorial to which the applicant replied on 9 May 1994.
On 21 October 1996 the applicant complained to the president of the Bratislava City Court that there was no progress in his case.
On 31 October 1996 the Bratislava City Court informed the applicant that it had transferred the case to the Bratislava II District Court. The latter received the file on 5 November 1996. As the Bratislava II District Court considered that it lacked jurisdiction to deal with the case, it requested the Supreme Court to determine the issue. On 24 February 1997 the Supreme Court found that the case fell within the jurisdiction of the  which had taken over the case files of the former Bratislava City Court. The  received the Supreme Court's decision on 2 May 1997.
On 4 March 1998 the  held a hearing and decided to adjourn the case. On 18 March 1998 the applicant submitted further information. Between 8 and 27 October 1998 the file was submitted to the Ministry of Justice.
A further hearing before the  was held on 22 February 1999. On 28 May 1999 the  heard two witnesses. Another hearing before the  scheduled for 24 August 1999 had to be cancelled as a witness failed to appear. The  therefore requested the Poprad District Court to hear the witness.
On 15 March 2001 the  ordered the defendant to pay 3,400 Slovakian korunas (SKK) to the applicant and rejected the remainder of the latter' action. On 12 April 2001 the applicant appealed.
By two decisions dated 2 July 2001 the  dismissed the applicant' request for waiver of fees of the appellate proceedings and instructed the applicant to pay those fees. On 31 August 2001 the Supreme Court upheld the 's decision to dismiss the applicant's request for waiver of court fees. On 9 October 2001 the applicant filed an appeal on points of law against the Supreme Court's decision of 31 August 2001.
On 18 January 2004 the applicant informed the Court that the proceedings concerning his action were still pending.
On 16 June 1998 the  found that the applicant's constitutional right to a hearing without undue delays had been violated in the above proceedings concerning his claim for damages. The  noted, in particular, that the Bratislava City Court had taken more than two years to transfer the case, for reasons of jurisdiction, to the Bratislava II District Court and that the  had remained inactive for ten months after it had received the Supreme Court's decision of 24 February 1997.
On 13 March 2002 the applicant filed a complaint with the  alleging a violation of his constitutional rights to a hearing without undue delays and to compensation for damage. On 2 May 2002 the  declared admissible the complaint concerning the alleged delays in the proceedings brought on 5 January 1994. In its decision the  noted that the relevant part of the complaint followed its finding of 16 June 1998. It further rejected the remainder of the applicant's complaint noting, in particular, that it lacked jurisdiction to decide on claims for damages relating to unlawful decisions of public authorities or their erroneous official conduct.
In its finding of 12 November 2003 the  concluded that the  had violated the applicant's constitutional right to a hearing without unjustified delay in proceedings concerning the applicant's above claim for damages. The  examined the period after the delivery of its finding of 16 June 1998 and held, in particular, that the  had remained inactive for two years between September 2001 and November 2003. The  ordered the  to proceed with the case without further delay. Finally, the  granted SKK 20,000 to the applicant as just satisfaction. The decision states that it had thereby regard to the overall length of the proceedings before the  and to the particular circumstances of the case.
Since at the relevant time the Constitutional Court lacked jurisdiction to order that the applicant be compensated for the violation of his right to a hearing without undue delay which it had found on 16 June 1998, he claimed compensation for delays in the proceedings under the State Liability Act of 1969 with reference to the Constitutional Court's finding on 16 June 1998. On 17 November 1998 the Ministry of Justice dismissed the request and informed the applicant that he could seek redress before a court.
The applicant filed an action against the Ministry of Justice claiming (i) protection of his personal rights under Article 11 et seq. of the Civil Code and (ii) compensation for non-pecuniary damage under the State Liability Act of 1969. He referred to the 's finding of 16 June 1998.
On 26 May 1999 the Bratislava I District Court dismissed the applicant's action. It found that the defendant Ministry had not interfered with the applicant's personal rights when determining his claim for compensation. As to the claim for non-pecuniary damages under the State Liability Act of 1969, the court held that the damages claimed corresponded to lost income and related to the subject matter of the compensation proceedings which the applicant had brought on 5 January 1994 and which were still pending. The applicant had therefore to claim compensation from persons who were liable for such damage.
The applicant appealed and claimed that the above 's finding was a valid ground for compensating him for delays in the proceedings brought on 5 January 1994.
On 16 November 1999 the  upheld the District Court's judgment of 26 May 1999. The appellate court found that the applicant had not shown that, as a result of the courts' dealing with his case, he had suffered material damage which could be expressed in terms of money and which could be redressed by means of the payment of a sum of money to him. As regards the applicant's argument that he had suffered damage of a non-pecuniary nature as a result of delays in the proceedings in question the  held:
“Cases in which the State is liable for damage caused by unlawful decisions delivered by a court in the context of judicial proceedings are specified in Act No. 58/1969 on liability for damage caused by the decision of a State authority or by its erroneous official conduct, and the present case does not fall within one of the classes of case in which compensation can be granted.”
Article 48(2) provides, inter alia, that every person has the right to have his or her case tried without unjustified delay.
Pursuant to Article 130(3), as in force until 30 June 2001, the  could commence proceedings upon the petition (“podnet”) presented by any individual or a corporation claiming that their rights had been violated.
According to its case-law under the former Article 130(3), the  lacked jurisdiction to draw legal consequences from a violation of a petitioner's rights under Article 48(2) of the Constitution. It could neither grant damages to the person concerned nor impose a sanction on the public authority liable for the violation found. In the 's view, it was therefore for the authority concerned to provide redress to the person whose rights were violated.
As from 1 January 2002, the Constitution has been amended in that, inter alia, individuals and legal persons can complain about a violation of their fundamental rights and freedoms pursuant to Article 127. Under this provision the  has the power, in case that it finds a violation of Article 48(2), to order the authority concerned to proceed with the case without delay. It may also grant adequate financial satisfaction to a person whose constitutional right has been violated as a result of excessive length of proceedings (for further details see, e.g., Andrášik and Others v. Slovakia (dec.), nos. 57984/00, 60237/00, 60242/00, 60679/00, 60680/00, 68563/01, 60226/00, 22 October 2002).
It has been the 's practice, in cases where it earlier found a violation of Article 48(2) of the Constitution, to formally entertain further complaints about delays in the same proceedings only to the extent that they relate to the period after the delivery of the first finding of the . In dealing with such cases the  can, where it considers it appropriate, to take into account that the ordinary courts have failed to proceed with the case without undue delays following its finding of a violation of Article 48(2).
Article 144(1) provides that judges are independent and bound only by law. Under paragraph 2 of Article 144, judges are bound also by international instruments where the Constitution or law so provide.
Section 18(1) of Act No. 58/1969 on the liability of the State for damage caused by a State organ's decision or by its erroneous official action (Zákon o zodpovednosti za škodu spôsobenú rozhodnutím orgánu štátu alebo jeho nesprávnym úradným postupom – “the State Liability Act”) renders the State liable for damage caused in the context of carrying out functions vested in public authorities which results from erroneous official actions of persons entrusted with the exercise of these functions. A claim for compensation under this provision can only be granted when the plaintiff shows that he or she suffered damage as a result of an erroneous action of a public authority, quantifies its amount, and shows that there is a causal link between the damage and the erroneous action in question.
Regulation No. 32/1965 governs compensation for damage caused to a person's health. Section 2 provides for compensation for pain resulting from damage to a person's health, subsequent medical treatment and the elimination of the effects of damage to health. The amount of the compensation is to be determined in accordance with the principles and rates attached to the regulation.
Under paragraph 2 of Section 2, compensation for pain is not payable in cases of simple psychic reactions affecting a person's health which are of a passing character or of short-term changes in a person's health which do not require medical treatment or which cannot be established in an objective manner.
