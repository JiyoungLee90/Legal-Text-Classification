That is, the applicant must have paid them, or be bound to pay them, pursuant to a legal or contractual obligation, and they must have been unavoidable in order to prevent the violation found or to obtain redress. The Court requires itemised bills and invoices that are sufficiently detailed to enable it to determine to what extent the above requirements have been met (see Maktouf and Damjanovi\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos.\u00a02312/08 and 34179/08, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).
