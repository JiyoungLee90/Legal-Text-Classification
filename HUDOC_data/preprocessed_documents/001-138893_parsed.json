Considering this, the defendant should be considered as having diminished criminal responsibility (verminderd toerekeningsvatbaar), but nevertheless should mainly be held criminally liable for his actions. It is noted in particular that the defendant cannot be considered as mentally insane before, during or after the commission of the crime... Even though the defendant is capable of committing a similar offence in the future, it is not necessary to commit him to a regular mental hospital (krankzinnigengesticht), instead he should be placed in a custodial clinic for psychopaths (psychopatenasiel) to undergo a rather lengthy treatment under very strict surveillance. In Cura\u00e7ao there is only the choice between prison and the national (regular) mental hospital (Landspsychiatrisch Ziekenhuis). Taking into consideration that the risk of recidivism is for the time being very high also when a treatment would possibly start immediately and that, consequently, intensive surveillance is of primordial importance (which surveillance is impossible in the national mental hospital) and the fact that the defendant is not to be considered as criminally insane within the meaning of the law, admission to the national mental hospital is wholly contra-indicated. The sole option remaining is that he must undergo his punishment in prison (transfer to a custodial clinic in the Netherlands is impossible on account of the defendant\u2019s limited intelligence and insufficient ability to express himself verbally). It is strongly advised that, where possible in the prison setting, an attempt should be made to attain a stronger personality structure in the defendant in order to avoid recidivism in the future.\u201d",

This is because States have a duty under the Convention to take measures for the protection of the public from violent crime and the Convention does not prohibit States from subjecting a person convicted of a serious crime to an indeterminate sentence allowing for the offender\u2019s continued detention where necessary for the protection of the public (see, mutatis mutandis, V. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a098). Indeed, preventing a criminal from re-offending is one of the \u201cessential functions\u201d of a prison sentence (see Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2002VIII; Maiorano and Others v. Italy, no.\u00a028634/06, \u00a7 108, 15 December 2009; and, mutatis mutandis, Choreftakis and Choreftaki v. Greece, no. 46846/08, \u00a7 45, 17 January 2012). This is particularly so for those convicted of murder or other serious offences against the person. The mere fact that such prisoners may have already served a long period of imprisonment does not weaken the State\u2019s positive obligation to protect the public; States may fulfil that obligation by continuing to detain such life sentenced prisoners for as long as they remain dangerous (see, for instance, Maiorano and Others, cited above).",

Belgium, 24 June 1982, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 50). In addition, any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see, among many other authorities, Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a039 and 45, Series A no. 33, and Amuur, cited above, \u00a7 50).",

The Court rejected that complaint as manifestly ill-founded finding that the court which had imposed the life sentence had made it quite plain that the applicant had been sentenced to life imprisonment for the remainder of his life. It was clear, therefore, that the determination of the need for the sentence imposed on the applicant did not depend on any elements that were likely to change in time (unlike in Stafford, cited above, \u00a7 87). The \u201cnew issues\u201d relied upon by the applicant in the Kafkaris case could not be regarded as elements which rendered the reasons initially warranting detention obsolete or as new factors capable of affecting the lawfulness of his detention. Nor could it be said that the latter applicant\u2019s sentence was divided into a punitive period and a security period as he claimed. Accordingly, the Court considered that the review of the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention required under Article 5 \u00a7 4 had been incorporated in the conviction pronounced by the courts, no further review therefore being required.",

However, contrary to the applicant\u2019s submissions, it does not follow that his detention requires to be reviewed regularly in order for it to comply with the provisions of Article 5. Moreover, it is clear from the reasoning from the Joint Court of Justice that the life imprisonment has been imposed on the applicant in order to meet the requirements of punishment and protection of public safety (see paragraph 16 above). Consequently, as in Kafkaris (no. 2), the Court is satisfied that the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention required under Article 5 \u00a7 4 was incorporated in the life sentence imposed by the domestic court in his case, and no further review would be required by Article 5 \u00a7 4.",
