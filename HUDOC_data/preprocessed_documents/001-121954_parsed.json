The use of force, however, must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of any of the purposes set out in subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c). In this respect the use of the term \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d in Article 2 \u00a7 2 indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraph 2 of Articles 8-11 of the Convention. In particular, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the aims set out in the subparagraphs of the Article (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 148-149, Series A no. 324).",
