The court quashed the judgment of the Bender Court of Appeal, upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction by the first-instance court and ordered a fresh examination of the case in respect of B. It did not examine directly any evidence and based its findings on the case file as established by the lower courts.

However, it appears that there was a procedural confusion resulting from the above judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice. In particular, the judgment appears to have upheld the firstinstance conviction in respect of the applicant but ordered a fresh examination in respect of the co-accused. The order was not expressed sufficiently clearly because the Court of Appeal reheard the case in respect of both the co-accused and the applicant. The applicant appealed against the judgment of the Court of Appeal and only a new judgment by the Supreme Court of Justice on 28 April 2009 clarified that the Court of Appeal had not been entitled to rehear the case in regard to the applicant and that his conviction had become final with the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 1\u00a0April 2008.
