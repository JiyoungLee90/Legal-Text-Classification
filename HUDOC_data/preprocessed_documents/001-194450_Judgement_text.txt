The case originated in an application (no. 65808/10) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Zülküf Murat Kahraman (“the applicant”), on 13 October 2010.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Ms G. Battal Özmen, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 12 September 2013 the applicant’s complaint concerning the alleged violation of his right to freedom of expression was communicated to the Government, and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
On 1 June 2018 further observations were requested from the parties pursuant Rule 54 § 2 (c) of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Ankara.
On 26 October 2008 a press conference and a demonstration were held in Gaziantep to protest about the conditions of detention and alleged ill-treatment of Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the PKK, an illegal armed organisation.
According to two police reports dated 31 December 2008 and 20 January 2009, on 26 October 2008 clashes occurred between demonstrators and the police in three neighbourhoods in Gaziantep, as a result of which eleven police officers were injured and police vehicles and public buildings were damaged by some demonstrators who threw stones. In the police reports in question, it was noted that four photographs of a crowd had been taken by DIHA (Dicle News Agency) correspondents and published in the local media and media controlled by the PKK. A person who had covered his head with a hood and his face with a puşi was seen in the photographs. The police officers who had prepared the reports had found out that person was the applicant, and that he had been active in the Patriotic Democratic Youth Assembly (Yurtsever Demokratik Gençlik Meclisi), a youth organisation which was, according to the police reports, linked to the PKK.
On 18 February 2009 the Adana public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the applicant and one other person with the Adana Assize Court. The Adana public prosecutor noted that the applicant had participated in the gathering which had started in front of one of the offices of the Party for a Democratic Society (Demokratik Toplum Partisi – DTP) in Gaziantep, and that he had covered his face and chanted slogans. The public prosecutor relied on the photographs referred to by the police in the above-mentioned reports. The applicant was charged with membership of an illegal organisation under Article 220 § 6 and Article 314 of the Criminal Code, and disseminating propaganda in favour of the PKK, under section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713).
On 12 March 2009 the applicant was arrested and subsequently detained on remand in relation to the charges brought against him in the bill of indictment of 18 February 2009.
On 20 March 2009 the Adana Assize Court held the first hearing in the case, during which the applicant made his defence statements. He contended that he had never participated in meetings or demonstrations organised by the DTP. Hence, he had not participated in the gathering in front of the DTP office on 26 October 2008. When shown the photographs in the case file, he denied the allegation that the person in the photographs was him. At the end of the hearing the court ordered his release pending trial.
At the second hearing held on 3 April 2009 the Adana public prosecutor submitted his observations on the merits of the case and asked the assize court to convict the applicant as charged.
At the fourth hearing held on 9 June 2009 the applicant and his coaccused made their final defence submissions. The applicant once again denied that he had participated in the gathering in question.
On the same day the Adana Assize Court convicted the applicant of membership of an illegal organisation, the PKK, under Article 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of Article 220 § 6 and Article 314 § 3 of the same Code, and sentenced him to six years and three months’ imprisonment. The applicant was also convicted of disseminating propaganda in support of the PKK under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713, for which he received a sentence of ten months’ imprisonment.
As regards the applicant, the assize court first noted that the following evidence was available: photographs of him among demonstrators with his face partially covered with a puşi, and the police report of 20 January 2009, according to which he was one of the people who had participated in the illegal demonstration at around 1 p.m. on 26 October 2008 and chanted slogans and thrown stones at the police.
In the light of the evidence in the case file, the Adana Assize Court found it established that a press conference had been held in front of the DTP building on 26 October 2008 and that a press statement had been made. The court further noted that during the press conference demonstrators had chanted slogans in support of the PKK and its leader. The assize court also noted that the security forces had intervened after having heard the slogans, and that subsequently clashes had occurred between the police and the demonstrators, which had resulted in the wounding of some police officers and damage to private and public vehicles.
The Adana Assize Court further found it established that the applicant had participated in the demonstration of 26 October 2008, covered his face during that illegal demonstration, and disseminated propaganda in favour of the PKK by chanting slogans supporting the PKK and its leader. The court considered it established that the person in the photographs was the applicant, although he had his face partially covered. As a result, the court decided to convict him of disseminating propaganda in support of the PKK under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713. It further noted that the applicant had participated in the demonstration in question as a result of the call put out by the PKK. According to the court, although there was insufficient evidence to show that he was a member of the PKK, his participation in the demonstration showed that he had committed criminal offences on behalf of it, and therefore he should be convicted of membership of the PKK under Article 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of Article 220 § 6 and Article 314 § 3 of the same Code. Lastly, the first-instance court noted that there was no evidence showing that the applicant had been involved in acts of violence during the demonstration of 26 October 2008, and considered that he should be acquitted of any charges relating to causing injury or damage.
On 10 June 2009 the applicant appealed.
On 18 August 2009 the applicant started to serve his prison sentence.
On 8 July 2010 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the judgment of 9 June 2009.
On 5 July 2012 Law no. 6352, amending various laws with a view to suspending proceedings and sentences given in cases concerning crimes committed through the press and media and similar expressions of opinions, entered into force.
On 12 July 2012 the Adana Assize Court decided to defer the execution of the sentences the applicant had been given in the judgment of 9 June 2009, pending its examination of the applicant’s application for revision, reduction or suspension of the sentences in the light of the provisions of Law no. 6352 of 5 July 2012. The applicant was released from prison on the same day.
On 20 December 2012 the Adana Assize Court rejected the applicant’s application for revision, reduction or suspension of the sentences which he had been given in the judgment of 9 June 2009 – those imposed under Article 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of Article 220 § 6 and Article 314 § 3 of the same Code and section 7(2) of Law no. 3713.
On 11 April 2013 Law no. 6459 amending Article 220 § 6 of the Criminal Code entered into force.
On 20 June 2013, in the light of the amendment made to Article 220 § 6 of the Criminal Code by Law no. 6459, the Adana Assize Court decided to suspend the execution of the prison sentence given to the applicant under Article 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of Article 220 § 6 and Article 314 § 3 of the same Code.
On 5 November 2013 the Adana Assize Court quashed the applicant’s criminal conviction under Article 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of Article 220 § 6 and Article 314 § 3 of the same Code. As to his conviction under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713, the assize court rejected his application for the conviction to be quashed, in the light of its considerations in its judgment of 9 June 2009 and, in particular, in the light of the fact that he had participated in the demonstration of 26 October 2008 while he had his face partially covered.
In 2009 the applicant was also charged with obstructing the security forces in the execution of their duties during the demonstration of 26 October 2008, under sections 32 and 33 of the Meetings and Demonstration Marches Act (Law no. 2911).
On 13 December 2012 the Gaziantep Criminal Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment.
On 30 December 2013 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of 13 December 2012, holding that there was no evidence in the case file in support of the allegation that the applicant had obstructed the security forces in the execution of their duties during the demonstration of 26 October 2008.
On 15 May 2014 the Gaziantep Criminal Court acquitted the applicant of the charges brought against him under sections 32 and 33 of Law no. 2911.
The applicant submitted four photographs to the Court which served as the basis for his convictions. All photographs show a group of people consisting of men, women and children, standing in front of a building. In the photographs, a man is seen with a loudhailer, and women and children hold banners. A young man who has his head covered with the hood of his jacket and his face covered with a puşi is seen standing in all the photographs.
