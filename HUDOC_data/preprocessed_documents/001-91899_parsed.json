The Government noted that the Bankruptcy Court had a supervisory duty and could set aside decisions made, or give the trustee directions, or do whatever else was necessary if the debtor\u2019s rights were infringed, (see section 128 of the Bankruptcy Act then applicable). Thus, the Bankruptcy Court could have given the trustee directions about the administration of the estate, ordered the trustee to complete the accounts, or removed the trustee pursuant to section 113(3) of the Bankruptcy Act then applicable, inter alia, due to slow or otherwise incompetent administration of the estate. It could also have fixed an ultimate date for the final meeting of creditors in the estate or decided to apply section 144 of the Bankruptcy Act at an earlier stage of the proceedings, even if all the parties to the case, including the applicant, objected.

The interference with his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions thus took the form of a control of the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. ... Consequently, the Court finds that there was no justification for restricting the applicant\u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions for the full duration of the proceedings since, while in principle it will be necessary to deprive the bankrupt of the right to administer and deal with his or her possessions in order to achieve the aim pursued, the necessity will diminish with the passage of time. In the Court\u2019s view, the length of the proceedings [fourteen years and eight months] thus upset the balance that had to be struck between the general interest in securing the payment of the bankrupt\u2019s creditors and the applicant\u2019s personal interest in securing the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. The interference with the applicant\u2019s right was accordingly disproportionate to the aim pursued.\u201d",
