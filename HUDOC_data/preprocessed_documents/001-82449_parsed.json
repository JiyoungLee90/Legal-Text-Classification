The court noted that, in accordance with its jurisprudence, \u201cdamage\u201d in this context should be a direct result of the contested act and not of another cause. Accordingly, the court concluded that no issue of \u201cdamage\u201d arose and thus no further examination of the validity of the revoked compulsory acquisition order was justified. The court also pointed out that timely notification of the revocation, which had been the Government's responsibility, would have rendered further consideration of the recourse unnecessary and further, took into account the fact that the compulsory acquisition order had been revoked on the ground that the acquisition of the applicant's property was not necessary for the public benefit purposes stated in the initial notice of compulsory acquisition.

In this respect it noted that under Article 23 (3) of the Constitution limitations to property, by law, were permissible on certain grounds. In the event of a lawful limitation on property, the above Article provided for just compensation which was determined, in the case of disagreement, by the civil courts. The right therefore of the applicant to compensation for the expropriated property was safeguarded. Furthermore the court considered that, in the event the Supreme Court upheld an appeal lodged by the applicant and annulled the compulsory acquisition order, she would be able to claim compensation for any damage suffered as a result of the administrative act under Article 146\u00a0(6) of the Constitution.",

They then filed a recourse against that order and also applied for an interim order to suspend the execution of the order until the recourse was decided. The authorities had submitted that a notice of compulsory acquisition was going to be issued in the Official Gazette of the Republic. At first instance the Supreme Court found that the requisition order was unlawful and granted the application for the interim order. On appeal the Supreme Court set aside the first instance judgment and annulled the interim order. The Supreme Court, held, inter alia, that in accordance with the domestic jurisprudence the authority to issue a requisition order was independent of the authority to issue a compulsory acquisition order and, that the latter, was not a prerequisite for a requisition order, even if the nature of the works to be executed during the period of requisition for attaining its aim were of a permanent nature. In such a case an acquisition order would be issued to provide a legal basis for the works. The fact that a requisition order could only remain in force for a maximum period of three years did not exclude the carrying out of works within that period for the achievement of the purpose to the public benefit of a much longer or permanent duration.",
