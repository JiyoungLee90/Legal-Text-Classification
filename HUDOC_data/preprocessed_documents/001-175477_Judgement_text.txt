The case originated in an application (no. 31956/13) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Ms Éva Lakics (“the applicant”), on 9 May 2013.
The applicant was represented by Ms M. Palásti, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Justice.
On 30 June 2016 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Budapest.

On 19 November 2012 the Sátoraljaújhely District Court delivered its judgment. The first-instance court’s judgment became final and binding on 18 December 2012.
