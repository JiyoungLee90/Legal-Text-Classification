The case originated in an application (no. 60805/00) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mrs Elena Todorova Miteva (“the applicant”), on 4 February 2000.
The applicant was represented by Mr D. Petrov, a lawyer practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. Dimova.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that they had been deprived of their property in violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
On 9 October 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the alleged deprivation of property to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
Judge Kalaydjieva, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 of the Rules of Court). On 1 October 2008, the Government, pursuant to Rule 29 § 1 (a), informed the Court that they had appointed in her stead another elected judge, namely Judge Lazarova Trajkovska.
The applicant was born in 1925 and lives in .
In 1968 the applicant and her husband purchased from the State a three-room flat of approximately 76 sq. m in . The flat had become State-owned by virtue of the nationalisations carried out by the communist regime in  in 1947 and the following years.
In 1993, shortly after the Restitution Law (ЗВСОНИ) was passed, the former pre-nationalisation owners brought proceedings under section 7 of that law against the applicant and her husband, seeking the nullification of their title and the restoration of the property.
The applicant’s husband passed away in June 1996. She was his sole heir and the proceedings continued against her.
On 29 June 1996 the Varna District Court found that the 1968 transaction had been null and void and allowed the claim. On appeal, on 25 July 1997 the  upheld the lower court’s judgment. The courts found that the 1968 contract had been signed by a deputy to the mayor instead of the mayor (председател на изпълнителния комитет на районния народен съвет) and that the file did not contain the requisite approval by the Minister of Architecture and Building Planning. The courts also found that the price of the flat, 5,352 levs, had not been determined correctly by the administration (the judicial expert ordered by the court in the 1996 proceedings estimated the price in 1968 at 5,725 levs).
In 1999 the applicant requested the reopening of the proceedings, stating that she had not been duly summoned for the ’s hearing held on 2 July 1997. In a judgment of 22 July 1999 the Supreme Court of Cassation rejected the request for reopening.
In 2000 it became possible for persons in the applicant’s situation to obtain compensation from the State, in the form of bonds which could be used in privatisation tenders or sold to brokers. The applicant did not avail herself of that opportunity within the relevant three-month time-limit. She applied for bonds in June 2007 but was informed by a letter of 5 July 2007 from the Varna Regional Governor that she was not entitled to compensation in the form of bonds.
The applicant did not leave the property voluntarily. In 1998 the restored owners instituted enforcement proceedings. The applicant was evicted on 16 August 2006.
On 15 November 2006 the applicant was granted the tenancy of a two-room municipal flat in .
The relevant background facts and domestic law and practice have been summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Velikovi and Others v. Bulgaria (nos. 43278/98, 45437/99, 48014/99, 48380/99, 51362/99, 53367/99, 60036/00, 73465/01, and 194/02, 15 March 2007).
After January 2000, section 9 of the Compensation Law (ЗОСОИ) provided that persons who had lost their dwellings pursuant to section 7 of the Restitution Law, as well as pre-nationalisation owners whose claims under that provision were dismissed after 22 November 1998, could apply for compensation bonds within three months of January 2000 or within two months of the final judgment in their case. In June 2006 an amendment of section 7(3) of the Restitution Law enabled persons currently in possession of compensation bonds to obtain payment at face value from the Ministry of Finance. On 8 May 2007 the Government published regulations implementing that provision.
