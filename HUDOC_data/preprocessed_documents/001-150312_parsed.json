The prison establishments were provided with the medicines required for the applicant\u2019s treatment.

The Government pointed out that cataract surgery had been recommended to the applicant in 2001, that is, several years before his imprisonment. However, he had chosen not to undergo it for unspecified reasons. His condition, a diabetes complication in the form of cataracts, continued to deteriorate irrespective of the adequate treatment that he received in the prison facilities.

In the Government\u2019s view, it was the applicant\u2019s fault that he had not undergone surgery in due time, which led to serious complications of his condition.",

The failure to carry out the surgery earlier had considerably complicated the treatment of retinopathy and led to his blindness. The applicant emphasised that he had refused to be transferred to St Petersburg for surgery in December 2008 because, being virtually blind, he had been afraid to make a long journey by train without an accompanying person. However, no special arrangements for his transfer in view of his condition had been proposed by the authorities.

It also notes that the prison authorities found the applicant\u2019s refusal groundless (see paragraph 52 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the applicant, whose eyesight at that time was limited to an ability to detect hand movement near his face with his right eye and who was completely blind in his left eye (see paragraph 17 above), had reasons to be wary of undertaking a long train journey on his own, without an accompanying person provided by the authorities. His refusal makes more sense given that the surgery was eventually proposed to him when only slightly over two months remained until his release. In such circumstances a surgery near his place of residence without the stress of long-distance transportation could have been a possibility. Most importantly, however, the applicant\u2019s eventual refusal did not in any way mitigate the fact that the authorities had handled arrangements for his surgery with undue delay, despite the consequences for his health.",

Thus, in November-December 2006 the visual acuity of the applicant\u2019s right eye was 0.02, and he could count the fingers on a hand from a distance of half a metre, while the visual acuity of his left eye was 0.004, and he could see with it hand movement near his face. However, in December 2008 he could only detect hand movement near his face with his right eye and he was blind in his left eye (see paragraphs 15-17 above). In so far as it may be argued that the deterioration in the applicant\u2019s eyesight constituted a natural process due to the progression of the cataracts caused by his main illness, that is diabetes, the Court notes that an ophthalmologist specifically stated that bad eyesight caused by cataracts could not be considered irreversible as such patients could benefit from surgical treatment to improve their eyesight (see paragraph 35 above).",

The Diabetes Algorithms indicate that diabetic cataracts prevent certain types of treatment of diabetic retinopathy (see paragraph 64 above). Accordingly, the failure to operate on the cataracts might have affected the possibilities of treatment of diabetic retinopathy as well. Although the applicant eventually underwent the surgery after his release, it was performed after an initial refusal on the part of the local hospital to operate on his cataracts at such an advanced stage (see paragraph 19 above), and within several months he was diagnosed with a complete retinal detachment in his right eye, which made further surgery devoid of any prospect of success (see paragraph 22 above). The applicant thus completely lost his eyesight.",
