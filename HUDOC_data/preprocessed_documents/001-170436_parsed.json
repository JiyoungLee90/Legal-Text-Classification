It noted that detailed information on exemptions was set out in point 34 of the School Regulations (Schulordnung) of the Canton of Basle Urban, and that the arrangements for dealing with religious issues in schools were included in a Recommendation (Handreichung) that had been issued by the Education Department of the Canton of Basle Urban in September 2007.

It also indicated that from the sixth year of school (that is, generally when pupils had reached the age of twelve), girls and boys attended physical education and swimming lessons separately (point 5.3 of the recommendation).",

It held that the school\u2019s function of social integration, valid in respect of all pupils, required that exemptions for swimming classes be granted only sparingly. The refusal to grant an exemption in the present case thus corresponded to its new practice, according to which educational obligations were, in principle, to be recognised as prevailing over compliance with the religious precepts (religi\u00f6se Gebote) of one part of the population.

It held that, in the light of the principle of proportionality, providing children with education that was in line with their parents\u2019 religious beliefs prevailed in the relevant case over the compulsory nature of the swimming lessons. The pupil\u2019s interests were to prevail in relation to his or her parents\u2019 religious interests only where the child\u2019s best interests were tangibly and seriously compromised by strict adherence to the religious rules, for example if the child\u2019s health was in danger or if equality of opportunity \u2013 including that between men and women \u2013 was at stake. According to the Federal Supreme Court, however, such values were not called into question in the case under consideration, since the swimming lessons represented only a small part of the sports education and, accordingly, the school\u2019s educational task was not seriously jeopardised by an individual exemption from swimming classes. In other words, the court held that even if the applicant did not learn to swim, her chances of completing her school career or succeeding in her professional life were not seriously threatened.",

One of the relevant cases (Federal Supreme Court judgment of 7 March 2012, 2C_666/2011) concerned the decision which is the subject-matter of the present application before the Court. In another case (judgment of 11\u00a0April 2013, 2C_1079/2012), the Federal Supreme Court was required to examine, for the first time, a request for exemption from compulsory swimming lessons in respect of a pupil, aged 14, who had reached puberty. The Federal Supreme Court dismissed the application. The girl, a Shiite, argued, inter alia, that, firstly, the lessons in question were conducted by a male teacher and, secondly, men could see her through the windows of the swimming pool. The Federal Supreme Court held that the girl\u2019s private interest had to yield to the public interest in an all-round education for all pupils, whatever their religion. Furthermore, the interference with her freedom of religion struck the Federal Supreme Court as less significant in that case, given that girls and boys attended separate swimming lessons and the girl in question was able to change and take a shower separately from other pupils, and was allowed to wear a burkini.",

The Constitutional Court drew a distinction between the case and, in particular, the leading judgment delivered by the Federal Supreme Court on 24 October 2008 (see paragraph\u00a029 above), in that, since the exemption in question had not been requested by Muslim parents, the public interest in ensuring integration of foreign pupils in Swiss society was absent. The Constitutional Court further held that the threat of excommunication by the Palmarian Church \u2013 an argument put forward by the applicants \u2013 was serious and had to be taken into consideration. Bearing in mind the specific features of the case and in the light of the children\u2019s best interests, it upheld the parents\u2019 complaint and remitted the case to the lower court.",

The Federal Administrative Court concluded that the plaintiff had not shown how the dress codes of her religion would be called into question by the wearing of a burkini, which had been authorised by the school authorities. It set aside the plaintiff\u2019s objection that the burkini did not hide the outline of her body. It also held that the school was not obliged to exclude from its curriculum practices which were encountered and tolerated in society outside the school, for the sole reason that they were unacceptable to certain individuals in the light of their personal religious views. With regard to the plaintiff\u2019s argument that there was a risk that she would be accidentally touched by boys during the swimming lessons, the Federal Administrative Court considered that this risk could be significantly reduced through careful planning of lessons by the teacher and through precautions taken by the plaintiff herself. It further emphasised that one of the central tasks of schools was their role in facilitating integration, including, in the Federal Administrative Court\u2019s view, a duty to encourage children to encounter and accept the religious and cultural mores, opinions and ideas held by others, which did not necessarily correspond to their own beliefs. According to the information available to the Court, this case was pending before the German Constitutional Court at the time of adoption of the present judgment (6\u00a0December 2016).",

The choice of the extent and form such regulations should take must inevitably be left up to a point to the State concerned, as it would depend on the specific domestic context (ibid.).

Parents are primarily responsible for the education and teaching of their children; it is in the discharge of this duty that parents may require the State to respect their religious and philosophical convictions (see Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v. Denmark, 7\u00a0December 1976, \u00a7 52, Series A no. 23). The second sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 aims at safeguarding the possibility of pluralism in education, which possibility is essential for the preservation of the \u201cdemocratic society\u201d as conceived by the Convention. It implies that the State must take care that information included in the curriculum is conveyed in an objective, critical and pluralistic manner. The State is forbidden to pursue an aim of indoctrination that might be considered as not respecting parents\u2019 religious and philosophical convictions (see Folger\u00f8 and Others, \u00a7\u00a084, and Lautsi and Others, cited above, \u00a7 62).",

In so doing, the Court will bear in mind that the States enjoy a considerable margin of appreciation concerning matters relating to the relationship between the State and religions and the significance to be attached to religion in society, particularly where these matters arise in the sphere of teaching and State education. While the States must ensure that information or knowledge included in the curriculum is conveyed in an objective, critical and pluralistic manner, and must refrain from pursuing any aim of indoctrination, they are nonetheless free to devise their school curricula according to their needs and traditions. Admittedly, it is parents who are primarily responsible for the education of their children, but they cannot, relying on the Convention, require the State to provide a particular form of teaching or to organise lessons in a particular manner. These principles apply even more so in the present application, in that it has been lodged against Switzerland, which has not ratified Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention and is not therefore bound by Article 2 of that treaty, and where the federal structure grants wide powers to the cantons and municipalities as regards the organisation and planning of school curricula.",
