On 16 October 1995 the applicant filed an action with the Bratislava V District Court. She claimed compensation for her maintenance from the person responsible for the accident.
On 12 April 1996 the District Court judge instructed the court’s registry to obtain the criminal file relating to the death of the applicant’s husband and to notify the defendant of the action.
On 4 July 1996 the postal authority informed the District Court, in reply to its request, that the letter could not be served on the defendant.
On 6 February 1997 the District Court asked the applicant’s representative to submit further information. The representative complied with the request on 9 April 1997.
On 22 May 1997 the case was adjourned as the applicant’s lawyer failed to appear.
On 10 July 1997 the District Court heard the parties. Both parties were requested to submit further documentary evidence.
On 2 October 1997 the case was adjourned as the court needed further information from an authority administering the pensions system.
On 30 November 1998 and on 13 January 1999 the applicant requested the court to proceed with the case.
On 25 February 1999 the case was adjourned as an inquiry had to be made, to the General Prosecutor’s Office, concerning the relevant criminal file.
On 20 May 1999 the applicant informed the District Court that she had retired as from 1 April 1999 and that she had appealed against the determination of her pension which included both an old-age and a widow’s pension. The applicant therefore asked the court to adjourn the case as the outcome of the pension proceedings might have a bearing on her claim.
On 5 August 1999 the applicant submitted a decision on her pension. Her lawyer did not appear at the hearing.
On 18 November 1999 the applicant’s lawyer informed the court that he would submit his authority and also specify the applicant’s claims. The District Court asked the lawyer to submit the authority and to specify the claims on 22 January 2000, on 29 March 2000 and on 13 July 2000. On 25 July 2000 the lawyer informed the court that the applicant maintained her action and that he would submit further information shortly. On 13 September 2000 the court asked the lawyer to submit the information required within fifteen days.
The lawyer failed to appear at the hearing held on 12 December 2000.

On 12 April 2001 the defendant asked for the case to be adjourned as his lawyer had ceased representing him. For this reason the case was adjourned until 1 June 2001.
On 1 June 2001 the case was adjourned as an inquiry was to be made of the Slovak Insurance Company which could possibly become a third party to the proceedings. On 4 July 2001 the Slovak Insurance Company informed the court that it did not wish to join the proceedings as it had no involvement in the case.
The next hearing was held, in the absence of the defendant, on 30 November 2001. The court decided to obtain a list of employers of the defendant and of his wife and it adjourned the case until 21 February 2002.
On 3 December 2001 the Slovak Insurance Company withdrew its earlier statement and informed the court that it wished to join the proceedings as a third party.
On 21 February 2002 the representative of the Slovak Insurance Company submitted documentary evidence. The applicant submitted her comments on 15 April 2002.
Hearings before the District Court were held on 23 April 2002 and on 13 May 2002. On the latter date the applicant was requested to submit further information relating to her claim. The applicant replied on 30 May 2002.
The District Court adjourned the case on 22 August 2002 and on 17 September 2002. On the latter date the court informed the parties that it had concluded the taking of evidence and that a judgment would be delivered on 23 September 2002.
On 23 September 2002 the case was adjourned until 15 October 2002 and the Social Insurance Administration was asked to inform the court about an increase in the applicant’s pension.
The case was again adjourned on 15 and on 30 October 2002. On the latter date the court decided to hear a witness who was in charge of dealing with claims relating to road traffic accidents within the Slovak Insurance Company.
On 8 November 2002 the applicant’s lawyer ceased representing the applicant due to her retirement.
On 10 December 2002 the District Court again adjourned the case with a view to hearing the above witness. On 14 January 2003 the person who had been summoned informed the court that she no longer carried out the function in question. The case was adjourned until 6 March 2003 with a view to hearing the relevant person. That witness was heard on 6 March 2003.
On 25 March 2003 the District Court adjourned the case at the request of the applicant’s representative. The applicant was invited to amend her claims within sixty days.
Between 22 September 2003 and 30 October 2003 the file was examined by the  to which the applicant had complained about the length of the proceedings.
On 12 February 2004 the case was adjourned as the judge was absent. The next hearing was scheduled for 19 February 2004. The representatives of the parties were unable to attend that hearing.
Hearings were held on 1 and 7 April 2004. On 20 May 2004 the case was adjourned as the social security institution had failed to submit documents requested by the court.
On 7 September 2004 the Bratislava V District Court heard the parties. On 9 September 2004 it delivered a judgment in which it partially granted the applicant’s claim. The judgment was served on the applicant on 2 November 2004.
The parties appealed. The proceedings are pending.
On 21 January 2003 the applicant complained about the length of the proceedings to the . She claimed 100,000 Slovakian korunas (SKK) in just satisfaction.
In its finding of 29 October 2003 the  held that the Bratislava V District Court had violated the applicant’s right to a hearing without unjustified delay. The  ordered the District Court to proceed with the case without further delays and to compensate for the costs of the applicant’s representation in the constitutional proceedings. It further decided not to grant any pecuniary satisfaction to the applicant.
The decision stated that the case was not complex as the merits of the applicant’s claim had been determined in a different set of proceedings and the only outstanding question was the amount of compensation due to the applicant.
The  further found that the applicant or her lawyer had contributed to a considerable extent to the length of the proceedings in that the lawyer had not appeared at hearings on 22 May 1999 and on 12 December 2000. Furthermore, the lawyer undertook on 18 November 1999 to submit his authority and to further specify the applicant’s claims. The relevant documents were only submitted on 8 January 2001, that is after thirteen months. On 8 November 2002 the applicant’s lawyer informed the court that she had retired and the authority of a new lawyer representing the applicant had been submitted to the court on 21 March 2003, that is after more than three months. On 25 March 2003 the case was adjourned as the applicant informed the court that her claims might need to be amended. The applicant’s retirement and her appeal against the decision on her pension, the fact that the Slovak Insurance Company had joined the proceedings and changes in lawyers representing the applicant had also slowed down the proceedings.
As regards the conduct of the proceedings by the Bratislava V District Court, the Constitutional Court noted that the District Court had taken more than five months to notify the defendant of the action and that it had remained inactive for more than seven months before it asked the applicant’s lawyer, on 6 February 1997, to submit further information. Another period of inactivity lasting more than fifteen months occurred between 2 October 1997 and 25 February 1999. Finally, the  held that the District Court had not proceeded in an appropriate manner as it had concluded the taking of evidence on 17 September 2002 and had envisaged delivering a judgment on 23 September 2002 and that, despite this fact, it had held six other hearings subsequently in which further evidence had been taken.
As regards the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction, the  noted that the applicant or her representatives had contributed to the length of the proceedings to approximately the same extent as the District Court. In those circumstances, the finding of a violation of the applicant’s constitutional right and the order that the District Court should proceed with the case without further delay constituted sufficient redress for the applicant.
