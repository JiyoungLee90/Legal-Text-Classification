Referring to the rules governing the preparation of statutes, the judge expressed the opinion that if the legislature had wished to ascribe a specific meaning to this reference to \u201cordinary law\u201d, it ought to have done so explicitly. As an action for recovery of possession involved a comparison of the relevant property titles, the judge concluded that the Orthodox Church had no such title to the church building in question.",

It also appears to receive benefits that the other religions do not have, such as chapels in prisons and detention centres. This Church is also said to exert a lot of influence over government decisions on matters such as the award of status as a religious cult to religious associations. ECRI also notes that given the number and diversity of officially recognised and practised cults in Romania, the inter-religious dialogue between the Orthodox Church and other religious denominations could be improved. In particular, the dialogue between this Church and the Greek Catholic Church is apparently at a low ebb, mainly on account of the manner in which the authorities handle the issue of the restitution of property confiscated during the communist period.",

On the one hand, as is clear from paragraph 89 above, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in drawing up the rules concerning the right of access to a court. At the same time, in the exercise of this margin of appreciation in the present case, the criterion in dispute gave rise to heated debates when it was adopted by Parliament (see paragraph 39 in fine above) and when the amendments made to Legislative Decree no.\u00a0126/1990 by Law no.\u00a0182/2005 were adopted. Equally, both of the Churches concerned were consulted as part of the legislative process that resulted in adoption of the criterion in dispute (see paragraph 39 above). The Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law has been consistent with regard to the compatibility of this criterion with the Constitution, both in its application by the joint committees and when applied in the context of judicial proceedings based on the provisions of ordinary law (see paragraphs\u00a05557 above).",

However, the Court notes that in the S\u00e2mbata Bihor case it was examining the legislative framework which existed prior to the amendments made to the text of Article 3 of Legislative Decree no. 126/1990 by Ordinance no. 64/2004 and Law no.\u00a0182/2005, and thus before the possibility, clearly provided for by these amendments, of bringing legal proceedings based on the provisions of ordinary law became available. Its reasoning at that time was essentially based on the fact that, prior to the said amendments, some domestic courts had considered that they did not have jurisdiction to examine the merits of a decision taken by a joint committee, and had not therefore taken proper account of the protected interests and rights that were at stake. As a result, the judicial review carried out by these courts was held to be insufficient for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Court nevertheless noted the fact that the amendments to the Legislative Decree made it possible to bring actions before the domestic courts, which by that stage had jurisdiction to rule on disputes concerning places of worship, and welcomed the legislative changes in question, while pointing out that, for the most part, they had been enacted well after the events complained of in the case before it (see S\u00e2mbata Bihor Greek Catholic Parish, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 72-75).",

Thus, in examining an action for recovery of possession on the basis of Article 480 of the Civil Code, the domestic courts, including the High Court, had interpreted this concept in two ways: some courts had considered that they ought to examine the action for recovery of possession in the traditional manner, by comparing the title deeds; others, as in the present case, had ruled that they were required to determine the action for recovery of possession by applying the criterion laid down in Legislative Decree no. 126/1990.

Romania judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a040) it noted the existence of an appeal in the interests of the law, provided for at the relevant time by Article 329 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph\u00a046 above). Under that provision, both the prosecutor\u2019s office and the governing councils of the appeal courts could request that the High Court provide guidance on the interpretation of the relevant provisions of domestic law, and the High Court could harmonise the case-law by issuing a binding decision on how the legal provisions in issue were to be interpreted (see also Zelca and Others v. Romania (dec.), no.\u00a065161/10, \u00a7\u00a014, 6 September 2011, and Maria Atanasiu and Others v. Romania, nos.\u00a030767/05 and 33800/06, \u00a7\u00a073, 12 October 2010). In its judgment in the case of Albu and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a042), the Court concluded that there had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, given that an appeal in the interests of the law had been set in motion promptly and had led to a judgment by the High Court giving unequivocal guidelines on the correct interpretation of the legal text.",

It is even less appropriate to argue that if the domestic courts were simply to stop applying the impugned majority-of-worshippers\u2019 criterion and confine themselves to comparing, in the strict sense of the term, title deeds, the Court would incur the risk of seeing a series of claims brought by applicants from one religious denomination being replaced by a new series of claims, brought by applicants from the other denomination. It should not be a consideration of justice how many applications this Court receives. This is a self-centred, utilitarian consideration, which wrongly assumes that the domestic courts are not in a position to deliver justice, on the basis of the application of their own law.",

No legal or administrative provisions state if, when and how the State support would be provided. Hence, Article 4 would not have resulted in any independent judicial review, which would then have enabled the courts to \u201crule\u201d in depth on the legal question submitted to them.

The protection of minorities is almost always unpopular and the protection of religious minorities is even more so. Europe has a long history of religious majorities disregarding the rights of religious minorities. This is an area where present-day democratic standards oblige a majority to show restraint, for the sake of respecting minorities.

It effectively prevented the Grand Chamber from examining the applicants\u2019 complaint under the aforementioned Articles, because, under the Court\u2019s case-law, the \u201ccase\u201d referred to the Grand Chamber is the application as it was declared admissible by the Chamber (see paragraphs\u00a061-63 of the judgment). In the present case, the issues at stake are property issues, i.e. those directly dealt with by Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01. However, this precise aspect of the case has not been examined by the Grand Chamber.
