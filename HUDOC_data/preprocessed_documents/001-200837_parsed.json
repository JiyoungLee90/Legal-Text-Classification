The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85). The Court finds that this principle also applies in the present case, having regard to the violation found.

In general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention (see Shofman v.\u00a0Russia, no. 74826/01, \u00a7 53, 24 November 2005, with further references). By finding a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the present case, the Court has established the Government\u2019s obligation to take appropriate measures to remedy the applicants\u2019 individual situations, that is, to ensure compliance with the applicants\u2019 enforceable claims under the judgment of 20\u00a0August 2007 (compare with Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, \u00a7\u00a0142, ECHR 2005-IV). Whether this involves taking measures set out in the judgment, or, if this is not possible, granting them reasonable compensation, or a combination of these and other measures, is a decision that falls to the respondent State (see Tarverdiyev v. Azerbaijan, no. 33343/03, \u00a7 66, 26 July 2007, and Ursan v. , no. 35852/04, \u00a7 46, 6 April 2010). The Court, however, emphasises that any measures adopted must be compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 202, ECHR 2004-II, with further references).",
