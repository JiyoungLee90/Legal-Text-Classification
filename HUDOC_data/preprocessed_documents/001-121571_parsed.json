In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v.

As concluded by the UK Border Agency (M.Y.H. and Others, \u00a7 31) and the UK Upper Tribunal in the recent country guidance case of HM and others (M.Y.H. and Others, \u00a7 34), it is possible for an individual to obtain identity documents from a central register in Baghdad, which retains identity records on microfiche, whether he or she is applying from abroad or within Iraq. In regard to the need for a sponsor resident in the Kurdistan Region, the Upper Tribunal further concluded, in the case mentioned above, that no-one was required to have a sponsor, whether for their entry into or for their continued residence in the KRI.
