Thus, the period to be taken into consideration is eleven years, during which the domestic courts constantly extended the applicant\u2019s detention using identical, stereotyped terms, such as \u201chaving regard to the nature of the offence and the state of the evidence\u201d. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in cases raising similar issues to those in the present application (see, for example, At\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey, no. 19735/02, 10 May 2007; Solmaz v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a027561/02, ECHR 2007...; Dereci v. Turkey, no. 77845/01, 24\u00a0May 2005, and Taciro\u011flu v. Turkey, no. 25324/02, 2 February 2006). Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the length of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention contravened Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. There has accordingly been a violation of this provision.",
