However, where such courts do exist, the guarantees of Article 6 must be complied with, inter alia, by ensuring to litigants an effective access to the courts for the determination of their \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d (see, among many other authorities, Levages Prestations Services v. France, 23 October 1996, \u00a7 44, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V, and Poitrimol v. France, 23\u00a0November\u00a01993, \u00a7\u00a7 13-15, Series A no. 277A). The right of access to the courts is not absolute but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access by its very nature calls for regulation by the State, regulation which may vary in time and in place according to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals (see Stanev v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, \u00a7 230, ECHR 2012). In laying down such regulation, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. Whilst the final decision as to observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court, it is no part of the Court\u2019s function to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities any other assessment of what might be the best policy in this field. Nonetheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (ibid.; see also Cordova v.

On the other hand, Article 20 of the Constitution provides that everyone is entitled to a legal remedy against a decision on their rights or a legally based interest (see paragraph 12 above). It is further observed that section 33 of the Insolvency Act does not explicitly provide for a duty of an insolvency administrator to lodge an appeal, and the Government, for their part, failed to submit any domestic case-law whatsoever where an insolvency administrator had actually filed an appeal against the decision on opening the insolvency proceedings. Moreover, section 40 of the Insolvency Act provides that the insolvency administrator is entitled to remuneration only once the insolvency proceedings are concluded (see paragraph 16 above), thus indeed raising a question as to whether he or she has an interest in appealing against the opening of insolvency proceedings. Lastly, the right of access to a court as enshrined in Article 6 implies, among other things, the possibility for a person whose civil rights have been interfered with to bring proceedings directly and independently (see Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2005XII (extracts)) and not via third parties.
