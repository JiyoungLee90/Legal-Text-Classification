But the Court has also emphasised that in the context of prison discipline, regard must be had to the particular vulnerability of persons in custody, which means that the authorities must provide particularly solid justification when punishing prisoners for having made allegedly false accusations against the prison authorities (see Marin Kostov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044, with further references).",

But they were made by the applicants in the exercise of the possibility in a democratic society governed by the rule of law for a private person to report an alleged irregularity in the conduct of a public official to an authority competent to deal with such an issue. This possibility is one of the precepts of the rule of law (see Zakharov, \u00a7 26; Kazakov, \u00a7 28; and Siryk, \u00a7 42, all cited above), and serves to ensure that confidence in the public administration is maintained. Indeed, in Bulgaria the right of citizens to make complaints to the authorities has been enshrined as a fundamental right in Article 45 of the Constitution (see paragraph 22 above). It is then for the authority concerned to decide what procedural steps may be required in response to such complaints. However, the mere fact that the applicants\u2019 complaints led to inquiries cannot be seen as unduly impinging on the officers\u2019 reputation. It was precisely the purpose of those inquiries to confirm or lay to rest the applicants\u2019 allegations.",
