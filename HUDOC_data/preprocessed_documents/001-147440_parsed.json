Greece (Article 50), 31 October 1995, \u00a7\u00a034, Series A no. 330B). This obligation reflects the principles of international law whereby a State responsible for a wrongful act is under an obligation to make restitution, consisting in restoring the situation that existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided that restitution is not \u201cmaterially impossible\u201d and \u201cdoes not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation\u201d (Article 35 of the Articles of the International Law Commission on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts). In other words, while restitution is the rule, there may be circumstances in which the State responsible is exempted \u2013 fully or in part \u2013 from this obligation, provided that it can show that such circumstances obtain (see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v. Switzerland (no. 2) [GC], no. , \u00a7 86, ECHR 2009). The States should organise their legal systems and judicial procedures so that this result may be achieved (see ibid., \u00a7 97, and Recommendation No.\u00a0R (2000)\u00a02, cited above).",

The practice of the Convention organs has demonstrated that it is primarily in the field of criminal law that the re-examination of a case, including the reopening of proceedings, is of the greatest importance, given the seriousness of the consequences of the violation for the applicants. Thus, in certain judgments the Court has indicated that in principle, the most appropriate form of redress would be the reopening of proceedings, if requested (see, among other authorities, Malininas v. Lithuania, no. 10071/04, \u00a7 43, 1 July 2008, and Popov v. Russia, no. 26853/04, \u00a7 263, 13 July 2006).",

Accordingly, a number of countries have introduced a general provision allowing a claimant to request the reopening of proceedings also in civil cases. Thus the Court has refused to accept unilateral declarations if the right to apply for reopening was not guaranteed to an applicant, as it would be for an applicant in respect of whom the Court delivered a judgment (see paragraph\u00a017 above, and \u0160ari\u0107 and Others v.

The specific remedial measures, if any, required of a respondent State in order to discharge its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention must depend on the particular circumstances of the individual case and be determined in the light of the Court\u2019s judgment in that case, and with due regard to the Court\u2019s case-law (see \u00d6calan v.

It is even more so when the violation of the Convention results from a general problem generating repetitive applications (see point 14 of the Explanatory Report referred to in the paragraph 17 above). Therefore, the Court will not, as a rule, order any such measure in its judgment, leaving it to the authorities of the respondent State to adopt, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, the most appropriate measures to ensure the maximum possible reparation of the violations found by the Court (see Savriddin Dzhurayev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a071386/10, \u00a7\u00a0255, ECHR 2013 (extracts), and paragraph\u00a025 above).",

The recent Resolution of the Plenary Supreme Court of the Russian Federation (see paragraph 15 above), which refers to Recommendation No.\u00a0R (2000)\u00a02, cited above, did not clarify whether an acknowledgement of a violation of the Convention by the Government by means of a unilateral declaration constitutes a basis for reopening the proceedings. Thus, there is a substantial risk that a decision to strike out the present application might bar the applicant\u2019s request for re-examination of his case at the national level and thus formally prevent the Russian courts from considering the issue of the appropriateness of reopening the proceedings in his case. The Court cannot therefore accept that the applicant in the present case might be deprived of the possibility to re-submit his claims to the domestic courts. In the Court\u2019s view such a situation would not be consistent with respect for human rights as defined in the Convention (see also the Constitutional Court\u2019s position in paragraph\u00a013 above that a formal refusal to re-examine the case following a violation of the Convention would contravene the Russian Constitution as well as the Convention).",

The Court cannot restore the power of that judgment nor assume the role of the national authorities in awarding social benefits for the future (see Tarnopolskaya and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051; Dokolin v. Russia, no. 28488/04, \u00a7 18, 18\u00a0September\u00a02008; and Sirotin v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a038712/03, 14\u00a0September 2006). Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s claim in respect of future loss inevitably relies on highly speculative assumptions that veil it in a great deal of uncertainty (see Parolov v. Russia, no.\u00a044543/04, \u00a7 45, 14 June 2007). Given the many imponderables in evolving political and economic conditions that could affect future entitlements and calculations, it would be a largely hypothetical exercise to attempt to predict in the long term the amount of compensation which would have been paid, if any, if the final judgment had not been quashed. Consequently, no pecuniary award can be made for the period after the final judgment was quashed, and therefore the Court rejects claims A, B and C (see paragraph\u00a041 above) on this ground. It would be for the domestic authorities to reassess the issue of the applicant\u2019s entitlement to the benefits in accordance with the applicable Russian law and to account for the Court\u2019s findings in the present case.",
