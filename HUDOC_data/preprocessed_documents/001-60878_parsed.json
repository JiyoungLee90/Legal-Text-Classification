It observed, however, that the said Act only provided for the ratification of certain treaties, indicated in section 3(1). The applicant argued that the Vienna Convention fell under section 3(1)(c), which imposed the ratification of any treaty affecting or concerning the relationship of Malta with any multinational organisation, agency, association or similar body. The Magistrates' Court could not accept such an interpretation, on the ground that the Vienna Convention was binding for the States which signed it, but not for the United Nations. Therefore, it could not give rise to a relationship between Malta and the United Nations. The Magistrates' Court moreover observed that the Extradition Act authorised arrest with a view to extradition of any person accused of an offence in a \u201cdesignated foreign country\u201d. As Morocco had been designated foreign country by Legal Notice\u00a0120 of 1996, the applicant's deprivation of liberty could not be regarded as unlawful.",

During the extradition proceedings, the primary function of the Magistrates' Court is to decide whether there are legal obstacles to the requested extradition. It has also the competence to determine any collateral issue which may arise, such as the lawfulness of the arrest of the person brought before it. Its President is in fact a Magistrate who is bound by his duties to attend to any complaint of an unlawful arrest. If he fails to do so, he may be held criminally liable for the offence punished by Article 137 of the Criminal Code. Should the Magistrates' Court find that the arrest is unlawful, it is obliged to order the immediate release. The extradition proceedings will then continue with the person requested free from arrest. The Government refer, on this point, to the decision given on 27\u00a0February\u00a02001 in the case of The police v.

The Court considers that, as it transpires from its wording, this provision primarily aims at the punishment of officials who fail to attend to complaints about the lawfulness of detention. It is true that in some instances courts have relied on this provision as a basis for ordering the detainee's release. However, apart from the Anthony Price case which concerned the 48 hour time-limit for bringing arrested persons before a magistrate having been exceeded (see paragraph 30 above) and the Christopher Cremona case, which concerned the suspension of the execution of a judgment in a situation in which both the defence and the prosecution agreed that the arrest was illegal (see paragraph 31 above), the Government did not refer to any instances in which Article 137 was successfully invoked to challenge the lawfulness of arrest or detention of a person against whom action was being taken with a view to extradition. In the applicant's case the 48-hour time-limit had not been exceeded, he had not been convicted by a competent court and the prosecution did not support his claim of unlawfulness of his arrest. The Court therefore finds that the Government have not shown that the applicant could have obtained a review of the lawfulness of his detention by relying on Article 137 of the Criminal Code (see Sabeur Ben Ali v.

The Court notes that, according to the description given by the Government in the above-quoted Sabeur Ben Ali case, lodging a constitutional application involves a referral to the First Hall of the Civil Court and the possibility of an appeal to the Constitutional Court. This is a cumbersome procedure especially since practice shows that appeals to the Constitutional Court are lodged as a matter of course. Moreover, recent practice shows that the relevant proceedings are invariably longer than what would qualify as \u201cspeedy\u201d for Article 5 \u00a7 4 purposes (see the Sabeur Ben Ali judgment, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040).

In the present case, the applicant has failed to submit a detailed note of the expenses he had sustained. However, it should be taken into account that before introducing his application in Strasbourg the applicant, represented by a lawyer of his own choosing, had tried on many occasions to challenge the lawfulness of his arrest before the Maltese authorities. The Court therefore accepts that the applicant incurred some costs, both at the national and at the European level, in order to put right the violation of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Rojas Morales v. Italy, no. 39676/98, \u00a7 42, 16 November 2000, unreported). Having regard to the particular features of the present case, the Court considers it appropriate to award the applicant 1,000\u00a0EUR for the costs incurred before the domestic courts and 1,500\u00a0EUR for the proceedings before it, and therefore a total sum of 2,500\u00a0EUR.",
