He observed that there was no right to legal representation in adjudication hearings and that the governor's exercise of his discretion not to allow such representation was not irrational or perverse given the facts of the cases.

The sanction of the loss of early release was not only a necessary and effective incentive, but it was a common sanction of prison disciplinary regimes in many Council of Europe member States. Indeed, it was a sanction which did not appear on a prisoner's criminal record (as noted in Engel and Others, pp. 33-34, \u00a7 80).",

Adjournments before a governor delayed matters a number of days but those before an adjudicator involved delays of weeks, a factor compounded by the requirement for legal representation. Adjudicators had already complained to the Government that the system was unwieldy and that adjournments were frequently sought. Such delays undermined the faith in the system of victims of offending behaviour and weakened the deterrent value of the system. Delay also meant that in the days running up to early release a prisoner could regard him or herself as immune from an adjudicator's award of additional days, leading to a difference in treatment between those at the earlier and later stages of their sentences.",

In this connection, the Government argued that the Chamber's approach placed too much emphasis on how the State organised its disciplinary and remission systems, so that a State could avoid the application of Article 6 by cleverly reorganising those systems, a result which would be contrary to the autonomous requirements of Article 6, which are meant to have a uniform application throughout the States. The best approach would be to recognise that both discretionary and structured systems of remission and awards of additional days had the same effect in substance upon a prisoner and then to apply a common approach to all in assessing the width of the disciplinary sphere in a prison context.",

In this regard, the Government did not address how a sanction with immediate application would be less effective than an award of additional days, which is not served until a prisoner's early release date (set pursuant to section 33 of the 1991 Act) and which in many cases will be therefore served some time, even years, after the adjudication hearing. Further, the Court does not consider that the Government have convincingly demonstrated significant material differences between the disciplinary needs in Scottish prisons, where use of additional days was suspended almost two years ago, and those needs in prisons in  and .",

Accordingly, such an overlap was just one factor to be taken into account in the overall assessment of the nature of the charge, but such an overlap should not obscure the fact that the offences under a prison disciplinary code generally had a predominantly disciplinary character. The Chamber accorded, in the Government's opinion, far too much weight to this concurrent liability issue. In Engel itself, although the offences were considered \u201cmixed\u201d, the Court held that the State was in principle entitled to employ the disciplinary rather than the criminal law as the impugned acts were in contravention of \u201clegal rule[s] governing the operation of the armed forces\u201d (see Engel and Others, pp. 34-35, \u00a7 82).",

Maintaining a defined set of offences against discipline with the imposition (and, as appropriate, remitting) of sanctions was but an aspect of the successful operation of the early release system: the possibility of early release gave prisoners an incentive to behave well, but it was correspondingly necessary that a prisoner should lose early release for bad behaviour. The primary purpose of the prison disciplinary system was therefore \u201cpreventative\u201d. Indeed, the predominant significance of the applicants' conduct was that it had a tendency to undermine the good management of the prison and the authority of prison officers. There was \u201cno real prospect\u201d that the first applicant would have carried out the threat against the probation officer and the assault of which the second applicant was found guilty was minor.

It is also true that the extreme gravity of the offence may be indicative of its criminal nature, as indicated in Campbell and Fell (see paragraph 101 above). However, that does not conversely mean that the minor nature of an offence can, of itself, take it outside the ambit of Article\u00a06, as there is nothing in the Convention to suggest that the criminal nature of an offence, within the meaning of the second of the Engel criteria, necessarily requires a certain degree of seriousness (see \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, cited above, pp. 20-21, \u00a7 53).

Accordingly, no direct comparison was possible with the situation of a person at liberty or even that of military personnel (at issue in Engel and Others), the latter personnel being otherwise at liberty, albeit subject to a code of military discipline. In short, equating awards of additional days against prisoners with the detention of persons at liberty (including military personnel) was to ignore the prison context and, in particular, the fact that additional days were served during a sentence already lawfully imposed by a court.",

The courts considered that, if remission was not a legal \u201cright\u201d, prisoners had at least a legitimate expectation of release on the expiry of the relevant period (see paragraph 42 above). In Campbell and Fell (pp. 37-38, \u00a7 72), the Court accepted that the practice of granting remission, as it existed at that time, was such that it created in the prisoner a legitimate expectation that he or she would recover his or her liberty before the end of the term of imprisonment and that forfeiture of remission had the effect of causing the detention to continue beyond the period corresponding to that expectation.

The applicants' custody during the additional days awarded was thus clearly lawful under domestic law.

As recently demonstrated by the Court in Stafford v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 46295/99, \u00a7\u00a7 64 and 79, ECHR 2002-IV), the Court's case-law indicates that it may be necessary to look beyond the appearances and the language used and concentrate on the realities of the situation.

As the mandatory life sentence had, due to domestic legal developments, in reality ceased to mean imprisonment for life (save in the exceptional cases involving a whole life \u201ctariff\u201d), there was every reason to apply the requirement of the \u201ccausal connection\u201d, within the meaning of Weeks, to any deprivation of liberty going beyond the tariff period \u2013 whether by recall or otherwise \u2013 in the same way as it is applied to discretionary lifers.",

In the first place, in the light of the judgment of Lord Woolf I cannot find that the shift from the \u201closs of remission\u201d regime to \u201cadditional days\u201d (or from a \u201cprivilege\u201d to a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d \u2013 see paragraph 121 of the present judgment) did represent in domestic law a change which could be compared to the disappearance of the distinction between the different forms of life sentences, as evidenced by the developments referred to above. Secondly, I remain unpersuaded that the circumstances of the present case are sufficiently similar to the Weeks/Stafford situation as to make it possible to transfer from those cases the above-mentioned requirement of \u201cconnection\u201d to the situation in the present case involving persons serving fixed-term prison sentences after conviction of, for example, rape and attempted murder. Typically, a situation in which disciplinary measures would legitimately be needed is likely to arise in relation to behaviour not having any connection with the original conviction. The majority appears to imply, in the final sentence of paragraph 123, that there may be situations in which the disciplinary proceedings could be connected to the original conviction and sentence and that such a connection could be relevant to the classification of these proceedings. I confess that I find it difficult to envisage a situation where that might be the case. In my view, if one is to operate with the requirement of \u201cconnection\u201d at all, then the connection between the original sentence and the additional days lies simply in the fact that the original sentence also covers the period during which the additional days would have to be served and provides a legal basis, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1, for the detention during that period.",

To me, the difference is fundamental. This also leads me to conclude that the additional days awarded cannot be regarded as \u201cappreciably detrimental\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 82 of Engel and Others. I note that even the imposition of the maximum penalty of 42 days would not as such have prevented the applicants' release long \u2013 indeed, several years \u2013 before the expiry of their respective sentences.",

The frustration of this expectation by the imposition of additional days, although these days do not exceed the original sentence still forming the legal basis for the deprivation of liberty, can be said to raise new legal issues concerning the person's deprivation of liberty. In this respect, the case is comparable to other cases in which \u201cnew issues of lawfulness\u201d arise during a detention for which the original conviction or other decision does continue to provide a legal basis for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1. There is a line of precedent including, among others, cases concerning mental health patients, recidivists placed \u201cat the government's disposal\u201d and different categories of life prisoners in the United Kingdom, in which the applicants were found to be entitled by Article 5 \u00a7 4 to a review of the legality of the possible new issues concerning their detention despite the fact that the legal basis, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1, of that detention remained unchanged.",

In principle, the final criminal conviction and sentence are, at least in the theory of penal and penitentiary law, res judicata. Consequently, what happens within the context of this conviction and sentence (in the course of serving the sentence) is related to the original penal judgment.

Rights and duties lend themselves to legal remedies and regulation, whereas privileges do not.

Grosso modo and in advance, this regime promises to reward the prisoner's \u201cgood behaviour\u201d unless he breaches the prison rules.

Should he behave well and thus justify a benevolent expectation concerning his future civility, this cannot mean that the conditional release has become his right, his \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d, etc. A higher form of pragmatism tells us that the conditional release of a prisoner can only be a privilege authorised by the judge or the legislature and bestowed upon him by the executive branch of power (the prison authorities).",

If they are justified as an extrapolation from the original sentence, are they not so because they imply the prospective assessment we described above?
