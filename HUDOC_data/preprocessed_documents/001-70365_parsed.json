Furthermore, the period of time when the writ of execution was entrusted to the coal mine's liquidators must, in the Government's view, be exempted from the overall length of the enforcement for which the State can be held accountable.",

Moreover, the debtor companies operated in a highly regulated area of coal mining, where the State determines, inter alia, the amount and the terms of payment of the employees' salaries and benefits (see, mutatis mutandis, Dubenko v.

The Court, first, notes that in the instant case the period of non-execution of the court judgment was considerably longer. Moreover, the argument that \u201cthe enforcement of a judgment incorporating a ruling of a non-pecuniary nature may take more time than is the case for payment of money awarded under a court judgment\u201d, which the Court relied on in the Ganenko decision, cannot be applied to the present case, as it was precisely money (a monetary compensation for the car) which the applicant was awarded by the domestic court and subsequently deprived of due to the State's failure to execute the judgment.
