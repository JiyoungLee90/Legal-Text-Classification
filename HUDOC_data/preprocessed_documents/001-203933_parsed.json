Reiterating that the existence of exceptional circumstances which satisfy the substantive requirement of compelling reasons does not automatically provide adequate justification for limiting suspects\u2019 access to legal advice, the Court notes that a statutory restriction of the kind described in the above paragraph, which excludes any individual assessment, cannot stand up to scrutiny in relation to the procedural requirements of the concept of \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d (see Beuze, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0138). Hence, the Court considers that there were no compelling reasons to restrict the applicant\u2019s right to a lawyer while in police custody.",

The burden of proof thus falls on the Government, which must demonstrate convincingly that the applicant nevertheless had a fair trial as a whole. The Government\u2019s inability to establish compelling reasons weighs heavily in the balance, and the balance may thus be tipped towards finding a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and\u00a03\u00a0(c).",

As a result, the argument that the applicant\u2019s conviction under Article 125 of the then Criminal Code in so far as it concerned his committing an armed act rested on the statements he had made in the absence of a lawyer cannot stand up to scrutiny. Indeed, as can be seen from the trial court\u2019s reasoned judgment, its conclusion that the applicant had done so stemmed from the fact that he had been arrested in an injured state with a Kalashnikov rifle following an armed clash with the security forces. In other words, the trial court did not rely on the statements the applicant had made in the absence of a lawyer to establish his criminal responsibility for the armed clash (compare Mehmet Ali Eser v. Turkey, no. 1399/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a052-60, 15\u00a0October 2019, where the Court considered that the applicant\u2019s silence throughout the statements he had made during the preliminary investigation stage was not such as to prejudice the overall fairness of the proceedings against him).",

The fact that the trial court appears to have relied on the part of the applicant\u2019s statements relating to his involvement in the PKK in its general assessment of the applicant does not alter that finding in the light, in particular, of the fact that he had at no stage of the proceedings denied his involvement in the PKK (compare Mehmet Zeki \u00c7elebi v. Turkey, no. 27582/07, \u00a7\u00a7 57-73, 28 January 2020 where the applicant\u2019s change of position vis-\u00e0-vis his earlier statements concerning the accusations against him necessitated the effective operation of the procedural safeguards by the domestic courts with a view to remedying the prejudice stemming from the systemic restriction on the applicant\u2019s right to a lawyer).",
