With regard to the whereabouts requirement provided for in those Articles, they complained of a \u201cparticularly intrusive\u201d testing system which compelled athletes in the testing pool to provide the AFLD with information concerning their places of residence, training and competition so that they could be located at any time, and to undergo immediate tests ordered on a discretionary basis and without advance notice. They complained in particular of the fact that the tests could be carried out independently of sporting events and outside training periods, that is, during periods when athletes were no longer at the disposal of their employer but were on holiday, resting or on sick leave or leave following an occupational injury. They argued that Article 3 infringed their freedom of movement by requiring them to give notice of their whereabouts on an ongoing basis, including during non-professional activities, and also infringed their right to a normal family life and their individual freedom as athletes. In their view, the unconditional implementation of Article 3(I)(3)(d) of the Order, allowing tests to be carried out independently of sporting events and outside training periods, meant that between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. (the testing period laid down by Article L. 232-14 of the Sports Code, see paragraph 64 below) the athletes in the testing pool faced the permanent prospect of physically intrusive tests. This entailed systematically giving advance notice of their schedule, in breach of the right to establish relationships with their peers and the right to the peaceful enjoyment of their private lives. Lastly, the applicants complained of a breach of the principle of equality, as the whereabouts requirement for the purposes of anti-doping tests was confined to athletes included in the testing pool.",

They lay down strict rules for determining the locations where testing of athletes in the \u2018testing pool\u2019 may be carried out and the periods and hours during which these tests may be conducted, and preclude the testing of athletes at home without their consent. The computer processing provided for in Article L. 232-15 for the purposes of organising tests is subject to the Law of 6 January 1978 on data processing, files and freedoms. While the arrangements thus defined place restrictions on athletes, notably by requiring them to provide accurate and up-to-date information on their whereabouts, the legislative provisions at issue are justified by the demands of efforts to combat doping. These entail, in particular, the ability to carry out unannounced tests in order effectively to detect the use of certain performance-enhancing drugs which can be detected only for a short time after being taken despite having more lasting effects. Hence, these provisions interfere with the right of the athletes concerned to respect for their private and family life, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention, only to the extent that is necessary and proportionate to the general-interest aims pursued by efforts to combat doping, namely to protect athletes\u2019 health and to ensure fair and ethical sporting competitions. ...",

Article 4 stipulates that the provisions of the WADC are not an integral part of the Convention and do not have direct effect in national law. It states that \u201c[i]n order to coordinate the implementation, at the national and international levels, of the fight against doping in sport, States Parties commit themselves to the principles of the Code as the basis for the measures provided for in Article 5 of this Convention.\u201d Articles 3 and 5 provide that States undertake to \u201cadopt appropriate measures at the national and international levels which are consistent with the principles of the Code\u201d and that \u201csuch measures may include legislation, regulation, policies or administrative practices\u201d. According to Article 12, States are to encourage the implementation of doping controls in a manner consistent with the Code, including noadvance-notice and out-of-competition testing. Article 19 encourages States to implement education and training programmes on anti-doping, both for athletes and for the sporting community in general, who should be provided with information on \u201cthe harm of doping to the ethical values of sport\u201d and \u201cthe health consequences of doping\u201d.",

However, the statistics underestimate the scale of doping practices within sport, in particular because the development of detection methods always lags behind the emergence of new substances and the ingeniousness of doping protocols. More generally, the report criticises the culture of silence encountered by efforts to combat doping: the difficulty of obtaining evidence, attempts at intimidation, the lack of credibility of the sporting world\u2019s attempts at self-regulation, a general denial of the problem in society, and threats to information and educational activities.",

Today, improper use of medication and hormones co-exists with the development of particularly sophisticated doping protocols and even the emergence of molecules created specifically for doping purposes. The report states that \u201c[d]oping protocols are based in particular on the simultaneous use of minute doses of several substances with different chemical structures and on a subtle balancing act between the duration of the desired effects and the duration of the window for detection\u201d. One of the salient features of modern-day doping, according to the report, is the misuse of certain molecules that have not been placed on the market and the emergence of a specific doping-related industry.

The report quotes an article from the newspaper La Libre Belgique which was posted online in 2010 and which states that \u201calmost 8% of young people between the ages of 14 and 18 reportedly use growth hormones, which they order for home delivery on Belgian and foreign websites\u201d. The report adds that while the impact of doping on adults is less well known, \u201can older series of articles revealed that the prevalence of doping among adults was between 5% and 15%\u201d.",

Opponents of this approach advocate legalising doping and placing it under medical supervision. This position appears to ignore the reality. Sporting careers are continuous: elite athletes are not \u2018born\u2019, they evolve gradually through talent and hard work and after overcoming numerous selection hurdles. This lengthy process begins at a young age and may result in addictive behaviours.

In these circumstances it considers that only those applicants who were included in the testing pool on the date on which the application was lodged, that is, on 23 July 2011, can claim victim status under Article 34 of the Convention. This was not the case with the eight applicants in the IRB pool. Furthermore, and having regard to the evidence before it, it considers that only the applicants referred to in paragraphs 13 (c) and (d) and 16 (b) above may claim victim status under Article 34. Lastly, as regards the victim status of the five applicants referred to in paragraph 14 above, the Court notes that the persons in question were included in the testing pool on the date on which the application was lodged, and that it is not disputed that they were subject to the whereabouts requirement and to tests which resulted in warnings being issued. It therefore considers that their removal from the testing pool in 2014 is not apt to deprive them of their victim status, as inclusion in the pool is by definition limited in duration. The Court therefore rejects the second inadmissibility plea raised by the Government.",

The law did not define the nature and content of the unannounced tests. Hence, the AFLD was acting outside any legal framework and was conducting urine and blood tests and biological monitoring without warning and without seeking authorisation.",

Since the introduction of the testing pool, virtually no cases of doping had come to light as a result of unannounced testing. The creation of a testing pool was incompatible with the principles of fairness and equity because it stigmatised the athletes concerned, who were \u201cpresumed guilty\u201d, vis-\u00e0-vis their colleagues who had freedom of movement and action.

This meant that there was no provision for unforeseen events (a meal that lasted longer than expected, an unexpected meeting, a short bout of tiredness, family problems, and so on). The applicant complained in particular of the tests carried out in hotels, which were intrusive and humiliating because they were conducted in full public view. Family members were not spared either as they were confronted with the reality of the tests, like habitual offenders in their own home.

Russia, no. 58255/00, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2004XI). A home will usually be the place, the physically defined area, where private and family life develops. The individual has a right to respect for his home, meaning not just the right to the actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of that area (see Giacomelli v. Italy, no. 59909/00, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2006XII). It is protected, among other things, from concrete or physical breaches, such as unauthorised entry into a person\u2019s home (ibid.). The notion of \u201chome\u201d can be interpreted widely and may apply to a holiday home (see Demades v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 16219/90, \u00a7\u00a7 31 to 34, 31 July 2003, and F\u00e4gerski\u00f6ld v.\u00a0Sweden, no. 37664/04, 26 February 2008).

Lastly, the concept of home is not confined to places of residence where private life is conducted. It encompasses professional premises, because to interpret the words \u201cprivate life\u201d and \u201chome\u201d as including certain professional or business activities or premises is consonant with the essential object and purpose of Article 8, namely to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities (see Niemietz v.\u00a0Germany, 16 December 1992, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 251B).",

Lastly, the requirements in question limit athletes\u2019 life choices, as they are strictly obliged to be present and available for one hour each day at a precise location suitable for testing purposes.

Both texts also warn of the ongoing development of highly sophisticated doping protocols, made possible by the use of substances administered in very small doses and with complex chemical structures. These doping methods can be detected only for a very short period but have a lasting effect on performance. Furthermore, the reports point out that new agents are being developed by laboratories specifically devoted to such research, often operating illegally, and that the sophisticated doping protocols are established with \u201cthe active participation of scientists, doctors and pharmacists\u201d.

The abovementioned reports show that doping affects amateur sports to a worrying extent, in particular among young athletes. The document adopted by the Medical Academy highlights the significant incidence of doping among adolescents and points to the numerous disorders which may affect this category of individuals, who are still growing (see paragraphs 83 and 84 above). The Senate report warns of a phenomenon which it describes as mass doping (see paragraph 77 above). The Court also attaches weight to the impact which doping among professional athletes has on the amateur sporting world. It is widely recognised that young people identify with elite athletes, who act as role models for them. The UNESCO Convention clearly demonstrates the concerns surrounding the impact of doping on the sporting community in general, and in particular on the young. For that reason it stresses the importance of educational programmes on the subject (see paragraphs 53 and 54 above). According to the Medical Academy, prevention requires the involvement of top-level athletes (see paragraphs 85 to 87 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the fact that the conduct of elite athletes is liable to have a major influence on young people is further justification for the requirements imposed on them while they are registered in the testing pool.",

Nevertheless, the Court observes that the use of these locations is \u201cat [their] request and within a fixed time slot\u201d (see paragraph 73 above) and is required in order to ensure the effectiveness of doping controls.

The Court is mindful of the fact that the tests made possible by the whereabouts requirements for athletes are just one aspect of action to tackle doping, which has numerous other aspects. However, in its view, the applicants cannot rely on the complexity of the issue in order to claim exemption from the whereabouts requirements. As they are directly concerned by a scourge that is particularly prevalent in the world of toplevel sports in which they compete, they must accept their fair share of the constraints inherent in the measures needed to combat that scourge. Likewise, the allegedly endemic nature of doping in sports cannot call into question the legitimacy of efforts to tackle it; on the contrary, it justifies the desire of the authorities to succeed in so doing.",

It further observes, as did the Government, that special supervision measures accompanied by an order for compulsory residence\u00a0amount in principle to restrictions on freedom of movement falling to be examined under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, \u00a7\u00a7 83 et seq., 23 February 2017). Likewise, a requirement for applicants to report to the police each time they wish to change residence or visit family or friends constitutes interference with their freedom of movement (see Denizci and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 346-47 and \u00a7\u00a7 403-04, and Bolat v. Russia, no. 14139/03, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2006XI). The Court further refers to its judgment in Battista v. Italy (no. 43978/09, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2014) for an exhaustive review of restrictions on the freedom to leave a country.",

This means that they are obliged to remain in a specific place for one hour each day. However, it should be pointed out that this place is chosen by them and that it does not involve their home address unless they so request and subject to a limited time-frame. The Court concludes from this that the obligation in question precludes discreet comings and goings; this is more a matter of interference with privacy than a surveillance measure (see paragraphs 157 and 158 above). It takes note in that regard of the decisions of the domestic courts not to characterise the whereabouts requirement as a restriction on freedom of movement and to make a distinction between checks that come within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and those that do not (see paragraph 73 above). The measures complained of cannot therefore be equated, as the applicants contend, with electronic tagging ordered by way of adjustment of a sentence or in conjunction with a compulsory residence order as an alternative to detention. Lastly, the Court notes that the applicants are not prevented from leaving their country of residence but are merely obliged to indicate a location in the destination country where they will be available for the purposes of unannounced testing.",
