Accordingly, it must primarily have regard to the general situation prevailing in the region at the time of the alleged events. In this connection it observes that at the relevant time violent confrontations had taken place between the security forces and members of the PKK in the state-of-emergency region of . This twofold violence resulting from the acts of the two parties to the conflict forced many people to flee their homes. Moreover, the national authorities had evicted the inhabitants of a number of settlements to ensure the safety of the population in the region (Do\u011fan and Others v. , nos. 8803-8811/02, 8813/02 and 8815-8819/02, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2004...(extracts)).

Turkey (judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV; Sel\u00e7uk and Asker v. Turkey, judgment of 24 April 1998, Reports 1998II; Mente\u015f and Others v.

However, it considers that such an exercise would not yield sufficient evidence capable of establishing the true circumstances of the case, given that the passage of a substantial period of time, almost eleven years in the instant case, makes it more difficult to find witnesses to give testimony and takes a toll on a witness\u2019 capacity to recall events in detail and with accuracy (see \u0130pek, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116). Accordingly, the Court must reach its decision on the basis of the available evidence submitted by the parties (see Pardo v.

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Dula\u015f and Y\u00f6yler, both cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65 and 87 respectively).",

However, the investigation in question was limited to asking the Gendarmerie Headquarters to provide information about the applicants\u2019 allegations (see paragraph 15 above). It does not seem that any attempt was made to interview members of the security forces during the course of investigation, despite the fact that the applicants had clearly accused gendarmes as the perpetrators of the burning of their houses and possessions. Nor does it appear that the authorities considered visiting the scene of the alleged events in order to verify the applicants\u2019 allegations. Rather, they were content to rely on the information given by the security forces. It is noteworthy in this connection that the Court has consistently found a general reluctance on the part of the authorities to consider the possibility that members of the security forces could have perpetrated such acts (see the above-mentioned judgments of Sel\u00e7uk and Asker, \u00a7 68, \u0130pek, \u00a7 206; Y\u00f6yler, \u00a7 92). Indeed, the response given by the Ovac\u0131k District Governor in the instant case confirms the Court\u2019s previous findings (see paragraph 17 above).
