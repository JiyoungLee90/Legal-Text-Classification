It is probably true that the Ministry of the Interior indeed considered certain [officials] as \u2018official contacts\u2019. It can also be assumed that some of them occasionally cooperated with the State security as \u2018official contacts\u2019, that is, carried out State-security tasks, surveyed, reported \u2013 in other words, were active in the manner described by the author as \u2018unambiguously incarnating the activities of an agent\u2019. However, it is not possible to deduce from this potentiality the general conclusion that every single [official] acted as an \u2018official contact\u2019; consequently, in the absence of proven facts, it is not acceptable to qualify all potentially available personalities [i.e. Communist party secretaries] as \u2018official contacts\u2019 actually cooperating with the State security. Public opinion condemns those persons who cooperated with the State security, even if they do not fall within the actual category of \u2018agent\u2019 or \u2018informant\u2019. Therefore, if someone is characterised, without a proper ground, as actually having carried out such activities, this violates that person\u2019s reputation, according to public opinion. ...",

The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see, for example, Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 46, Series\u00a0A no. 103; Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), 23 May 1991, \u00a7 63, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0204). The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value-judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts (see Prager and Oberschlick, cited above, \u00a7 36). However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive (see Jerusalem v. Austria, no.\u00a026958/95, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2001-II). As the Court has noted in previous cases, the difference lies in the degree of factual proof which has to be established (see Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v.

Lithuania, no. 36919/02, \u00a7 39, 25\u00a0November 2008). In respect of the former, the pre-eminent role of the press in a democracy and its duty to act as a \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d are important considerations in favour of a narrow construction of any limitations on freedom of expression. However, different considerations apply to press reports concentrating on sensational and, at times, lurid news, intended to titillate and entertain, which are aimed at satisfying the curiosity of a particular readership regarding aspects of a person\u2019s strictly private life (see e.g. Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s (ICI PARIS) v.

Such reporting does not attract the robust protection of Article 10 afforded to the press.

Mr\u00a0K. was elected to one of the highest judicial positions by Parliament.

The very fact that a publisher may have published something written by a professional and/or may, a posteriori, have allowed the publication of a rectification or a denial of an accusation, cannot, per se, absolve the publisher of liability for disseminating a text or other message in which a person has been groundlessly accused or defamed by an ill-disposed value-judgment. Such a rider would have been in line with the principles, set out in paragraph 43 of the judgment, that journalistic freedom \u201ccovers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation\u201d, but that \u201coffence may fall outside the protection of freedom of expression if it amounts to wanton denigration\u201d.

In principle, such a finding could be as plausible as that of the majority.

Mr Ungv\u00e1ry published the article in which Mr K., a local Communist party official in the mid-1980s (deputy secretary in a university under the one-party rule), was reported to have ordered the removal of a poster of a students\u2019 movement, to have reported this to his party hierarchy and, at the secret service\u2019s instigation, to have reproached a candidate in a Communist youth organisation for having been supported by that movement.

He called Mr K. \u201can official contact ... busy as an informant and demanding hard-line policies\u201d. According to the Supreme Court, such an assessment, if the author appeared unable to prove its veracity, amounted to qualifying Mr K. as a \u201cquasi-agent\u201d of the former undemocratic regime, and it found against Mr Ungv\u00e1ry.",

Both the notion of an agent and that of a quasi-agent of a secret service suggest that the person\u2019s actions contribute to the ends of that agency and, in the broader sense, of the corresponding regime. Such actions are typically covert, as others are not supposed to know about the agent\u2019s or quasi-agent\u2019s relationship with that agency. Both notions, at least for the purposes of this case, are limited to outsiders to the agency, that is to volunteer helpers, informants and other \u201coutside\u201d collaborators whose services are made use of by the agency, and exclude \u201cnormal\u201d employees thereof. The relation between these notions, as they are perceived by the public at large, must also be considered. When one is called an agent of a secret service, it means that one is presumed to receive orders from that agency, to carry them out and (more often than not) to receive payment or other benefits for doing so; one is also presumed to be listed as an agent in a corresponding register not accessible to outsiders to the agency concerned (as a rule, a nomenclature of agents comprises more than one category, and the exact titles of collaborators vary). On the other hand, the label of a quasi-agent of a secret service designates a person who has volunteered or has been otherwise drawn into collaborating with that agency without entering into a formal relationship with it: he or she does not receive orders from the agency but acts on his or her own discretion along the policy lines sustained by the regime, does not (save in exceptional cases) receive financial or other incentives from the agency, and is not listed in its register. The distinction between an agent and a quasi-agent of a secret service is a formal one, as they both report actions the regime discourages, or help to prevent such actions. Irrespective of this difference, in the eyes of the public at large, both agents and quasi-agents of a secret service of an undemocratic regime deserve condemnation (see paragraph 11 below).",

In a one-party totalitarian system, all institutions and offices (including those nominally far removed from politics) are \u201cofficial\u201d in the sense that all institutions function, and offices are held, as long as they accept the possible interference with their activities by officials from the regime (including the secret service), that is to say, the possibility of a contact approaching them (whether officially or otherwise, as was often the case), whenever the regime decides to bring pressure to bear on an institution or an office-holder. Contrary to stereotype, it is a regime not of only all-penetrating downward surveillance and repression but also of wide-scale bottom-up collaboration (whatever its motives may be); people have little choice but to more or less toe the line. Also, under one-party totalitarianism, by definition, formal orders or informal requests are often given to people by institutions and officials far more \u201cinnocent\u201d than secret services. As to the secret services prompting \u201cofficial contacts\u201d in a totalitarian regime, anyone who has been \u201cofficially\u201d (in the aforementioned sense) approached by a secret service officer with a request and did not refuse to comply (which would have been risky not only for the person concerned) but did what was required of him or her can be thought of, in a formal sense and if one is so inclined, as having collaborated with that agency and, thus, having been \u201can official contact\u201d thereof, albeit grudgingly. This holds also for those who, either guided by their affection for a totalitarian regime or merely simulating loyalty thereto, have on their own initiative, \u201cofficially\u201d entered into contact with its agents or otherwise attempted to contribute, or actually contributed, to the policies upheld by the regime. Does this automatically, in all cases, amount to one\u2019s being a quasi-agent of a regime or its secret service? In my opinion, the answer is no.

True, the facts related to Mr K.\u2019s position (not a top one) in the party hierarchy and to his ordering of the removal of the poster and his writing of the report were not contested by Mr\u00a0K. himself. However, the Supreme Court\u2019s argument (quoted in paragraph 19 of the judgment) must not be ignored: \u201cit is not possible to deduce from this potentiality [the possibility that the Ministry of the Interior indeed considered certain officials as \u2018official contacts\u2019 and that some of the so-called \u2018official contacts\u2019 occasionally cooperated with the State security and were active in the manner described by Mr Ungv\u00e1ry as \u2018unambiguously incarnating the activities of an agent\u2019] the general conclusion that every single [official] acted as an \u2018official contact\u2019; consequently, in the absence of proven facts, it is not acceptable to qualify all potentially available personalities ... as \u2018official contacts\u2019 actually cooperating with the State security.

The Supreme Court also took into consideration the fact that, in the television interview, Mr Ungv\u00e1ry called Mr K. (who by then had already denied the allegations) \u201ctrash\u201d, obviously not a scholarly term but an open insult, and apologised for having done so only in the course of the ensuing criminal proceedings.",

If it had done so, that would indeed have been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.

Relying on freedom of expression as a fundamental value protected by the Convention, inter alia, is not convincing enough to allow an author to evade responsibility for inviting a reasonable reader (not necessarily most of them) to form the opinion that a certain characteristic attributed to a person is actually an impartial statement of fact. The majority have concluded that a broad connotation should be given to a whole set of terms: not only \u201cofficial contact\u201d but also \u201ccooperation\u201d, \u201creporting\u201d, \u201cinformant\u201d and \u201ccollegial contact\u201d (see paragraphs 59, 60 of the judgment). The frequency with which the terms thus collectively exculpated are used attests to precisely the opposite conclusion: that they were used in respect of Mr K. in a restrictive sense. Clemency towards the expanded connotation of the disputed terms (justified from the linguistic or semantic perspective but not from the legal one) has allowed them to be interpreted in this case as \u201copinions with sufficient factual basis\u201d. I object to this interpretation because it conceals the fact that a reasonable reader will naturally grasp their restrictive meaning, and, thus, perceive them not as value-judgments but as statements of fact. As to the meaning of the terms in issue preferred by the author himself, and his prejudice against Mr K., they are revealed and corroborated by the fact that the author did not bother to change them in a publication which followed the court-ordered rectification of the statement of fact, as well as by his vocabulary in the television interview (see paragraph 11 above). Therefore, I cannot join the majority in reproaching the Supreme Court for failing to follow the broader rather than the restrictive connotation of the terms \u201ccooperation\u201d, \u201cofficial contact\u201d, \u201creporting\u201d, \u201cinformant\u201d, \u201ccollegial contact\u201d and so on.",

For him, in the mid-1980s Mr K. anticipated and exceeded the expectations of the State security, being an informant of the regime and a hard-line Communist policy supporter. A historian, like anyone else, has the right to be critical of any activity that compromised with the totalitarian regime instead of resisting it, and the right to maintain that every single person who held a position (however low) in the party hierarchy was a pillar on which that regime rested. The right to hold such an opinion is protected by the Convention. A historian can also categorise, in his own academic taxonomy, those who collaborated or at least compromised with the totalitarian regime as \u201cofficial contacts\u201d or \u201cinformants\u201d, or \u201cquasi-agents\u201d, or \u201cagents\u201d, for example. It is not for a court to decide whether such extra-legal categorisation is appropriate. Still, in this Court\u2019s jurisprudence, an essential distinction is drawn between the right to hold an opinion and the right to express it openly and publicly. An analyst has to accept the condition that if and when any of the aforementioned labels is publicly attached to a person and this can result in public condemnation of the person concerned (especially if the category was coined in an academic discourse and was not actually used to classify people at the material time), the burden of proof of the accuracy of the categorisation lies upon the analyst. If the latter fails to prove it, then one has to accept that a sanction provided for in law can be imposed on him or her. Mr Ungv\u00e1ry failed, in the domestic court proceedings, to prove the veracity of his categorisation of Mr K. as an \u201cofficial contact\u201d, an \u201cinformant\u201d or a \u201cquasi-agent\u201d of the former regime. Therefore, in my opinion, the Supreme Court, in deciding that Mr Ungv\u00e1ry infringed Mr K.\u2019s personality rights, did not deviate from the standards set forth in the Court\u2019s case-law.",

The majority have not contradicted his interpretation, but nor have they endorsed it. Alternative interpretations may be as plausible as the one discussed here, especially if an analyst makes an effort to pronounce judgement on an individual\u2019s past conduct not only from today\u2019s perspective but also having regard to the reality of the situation at the material time (see paragraph 10 above; although this may not be an easy thing for a person born in 1969 to do in respect of one born in 1951), and with a deeper understanding that the motives behind a person\u2019s politically relevant conduct, especially under totalitarianism, do not fit into an oversimplified \u201cblack or white\u201d scheme, of \u201ccooperation or non-cooperation\u201d, but are often much more complicated. For instance, one could take into account that in the former Communist totalitarian regimes in Europe many reports were written along official hierarchy lines not only because people were eager or happy to write them but also because they were an important element of \u201cofficial\u201d discipline. Account could also be taken of the fact that such reports might be written not in order to inform the regime of activities it discouraged and persecuted, but because people were well aware of the likelihood that they themselves would be reported on by someone else. One might also imagine that Mr K.\u2019s conduct in the students\u2019 movement case in ordering the removal of a poster by a university party official was meant as a message to the State security that it need not interfere because the matter had been settled. Such speculations are every bit as plausible as Mr\u00a0Ungv\u00e1ry\u2019s. None of them is advocated here; they illustrate that writing a report within an official hierarchy does not necessarily stamp the writer as a hard-liner working for the secret service, anticipating its orders and so on. Post-Communist countries\u2019 history is full of examples of individuals who, having been loyal to the regime and even having held important positions under it, later turned out to be among those who effectively brought about its downfall, not to mention those who put on a show of co-operating with the regime but only out of wariness, precaution, prudence, or fear, and not because they sympathised with the ruling party\u2019s policy.",

The Supreme Court did not grant it legal protection, and I support this view because there was no evidence that such arbitrary categorisation of Mr K. contributed to any progressive development in a democratic society. Now the Court has found in favour of Mr Ungv\u00e1ry, thereby lending his statements at least some legal credence, notwithstanding the failure of their author to substantiate them. Such a finding cannot but encourage the publication, as opinions, of abusive statements wittingly expressed in polysemous terms, even if the authors cannot prove their veracity, when in fact the reader perceives them as statements of fact not distorted by prejudice. Thus, this finding may have an undesirable cascade effect.",

In the \u201cgeneral principles\u201d part of the judgment, it is stated that \u201cthe limits of acceptable criticism may in some circumstances be wider with regard to civil servants exercising their powers than in relation to private individuals. However, the courts \u2013 the guarantors of justice, whose role is fundamental in a State based on the rule of law \u2013 must enjoy public confidence; and it may therefore prove necessary to protect judges from offensive and abusive verbal attacks\u201d (paragraph 44).
