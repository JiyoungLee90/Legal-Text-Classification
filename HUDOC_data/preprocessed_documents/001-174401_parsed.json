No causal link between the absence of HIV therapy and the deaths of Mr B. and Mr P. was established. The investigative authorities stressed that Mr B. had managed to live in detention without the antiretroviral therapy for almost three years and that Mr P. had died more than seven months after his release. The conduct of the prison and medical authorities, in the investigators\u2019 opinion, did not reveal any signs of a criminal offence.",
