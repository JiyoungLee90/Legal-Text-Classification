The court also referred to case-law according to which the suspicion was only dissipated if either the claimant's innocence had been proven, or if all arguments supporting the suspicion against him had been refuted.

It found that section 2 (1) (b) as such did not violate Article\u00a06 \u00a7 2 of the Convention which, under Austrian law, has the force of constitutional law. In the light of the Sekanina v. Austria case (judgment of 25 August 1993, Series A no.\u00a0266-A), it held that it was not the refusal of a claim for compensation which was contrary to the Convention, but the re-examination of the question of guilt after a final acquittal. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view only the separate re-assessment of evidence on the basis of the contents of the whole court file was likely to infringe the presumption of innocence.

They argued that what was decisive in the Sekanina case, was the fact that the courts examined the question whether the suspicion against the accused had been dissipated on the basis of the file, thereby replacing the jury\u2019s evaluation of the evidence. Thus, Article 6 \u00a7 2 only prohibited a court deciding on a compensation claim for detention on remand from undertaking a new assessment of the claimant\u2019s guilt on the basis of the file, while it was permissible to rely on the verdict of the jury and the reasons contained in the record of the jury\u2019s deliberations. In conclusion the Government submitted that, in the present case, the Graz Court of Appeal no more than repeated the reasons given in the record of the jury\u2019s deliberations. They finally pointed out that the above view was also shared by the Austrian Constitutional Court in its judgment of 29\u00a0September 1994 on the constitutionality of section 2 (1) (b) of the 1969 Act.

In these cases the criminal proceedings were discontinued without a formal acquittal. In the subsequent Sekanina case, the Court found that \u201cthe voicing of suspicions regarding an accused\u2019s innocence is conceivable as long as the conclusion of criminal proceedings has not resulted in a decision on the merits of the accusation. However, it is no longer admissible to rely on such suspicions once an acquittal has become final\u201d (see the Sekanina judgment, cited above, p. 15-16, \u00a7 30).

The Court finds that this is an artificial interpretation of the Sekanina judgment, which would moreover not be in line with the general aim of the presumption of innocence which is to protect the accused against any judicial decision or other statements by State officials amounting to an assessment of the applicant\u2019s guilt without him having previously been proved guilty according to law (see the Allenet de Ribemont v. France judgment of 10\u00a0February 1995, Series A no. 308, p. 16, \u00a7 35, with further references). The Court cannot but affirm the general rule stated in the Sekanina judgment that, following a final acquittal, even the voicing of suspicions regarding an accused\u2019s innocence is no longer admissible. The Court, thus, considers that once an acquittal has become final - be it an acquittal giving the accused the benefit of the doubt in accordance with Article 6 \u00a7 2 - the voicing of any suspicions of guilt, including those expressed in the reasons for the acquittal, is incompatible with the presumption of innocence.",
