Indeed, the quashing of final and legally binding decisions occurred twice, namely on 20 March 2012 and on 31 July 2017. The applicant company admitted in this respect that no constitutional complaint was filed against the first of those decisions. It noted however that the violation persisted and that its right to a fair trial was ultimately breached by the decision of 31 July 2017, which was duly challenged before the Constitutional Court.",

Only the legal issues of statutory limitation and qualification of the claim remained controversial and the courts duly reasoned their conclusions in this respect. Although the State as the defendant had lodged two appeals on points of law, those were not successful since the Supreme Court did not identify any fundamental procedural error which would allow it to declare that remedy admissible. Given that the legal assessment of the case could not be challenged through the appeal on points of law, the State turned to the Prosecutor General and eventually convinced him to lodge an extraordinary appeal (see paragraphs\u00a013-14 above). In the applicant\u2019s company view, it was clear and undisputed that the defendant\u2019s appeal on points of law and the Prosecutor General\u2019s extraordinary appeal were based on the same objections, which had already been raised before and dealt with by the lower courts. In its quashing decision of 31 July 2017, the Supreme Court thus clearly acted as a third instance, putting forward its own legal assessment of the case without remedying any substantial procedural defects.",

Moreover, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office could have at any moment intervened in the proceedings before the lower courts (see paragraph 20 above). The fact that the Prosecutor General waited until a final decision was delivered and used its discretionary power upon a petition filed by a high representative of the State amounted to a serious breach of the principle of equality of arms.",

Conversely, in the present case, the issues which were at the origin of the quashing decisions, namely the very existence of the damage, the title to compensation, its holders and statutory limitation, had already been raised by the State in its appeal and appeal on points of law but were either assessed wrongly or left unanswered.

In this respect, it shared the opinion of the Supreme Court according to which the errors committed in the instant case by the lower courts in the application of the substantive law were so serious that it was justified to grant the extraordinary appeal and to remit the matter back for a fresh examination.

Departures from the principle of legal certainty are thus justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character, the existence of which has to be examined case by case (see, e.g., Tishkevich v.
