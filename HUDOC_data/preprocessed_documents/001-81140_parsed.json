The applicant had ample opportunity to try to discredit any adverse conclusions which might have been drawn from their statements. In the event, the trial court chose not to attach any particular weight to their testimony since it was coloured by emotion (see paragraph 26 above). On the other hand, the trial court was of the view that the testimony of E.K. was of decisive importance (see paragraph 23 above) and that her findings based on her sessions with the child, one of which was conducted in the presence of the applicant's wife, conclusively showed that not only had the child suffered sexual abuse but that the applicant was guilty of the offence. It is true that the trial court had been at pains to have the soundness of the methodology used by E.K. confirmed (see paragraphs 18 and 24 above) However, it remains the case that the trial court was at no stage presented with any direct evidence of the applicant's guilt.

It notes that at no stage was any consideration given to the possibility of videorecording the sessions which E.K. had had with X. It is to be observed in this connection that the complaint was made to the prosecutor on 14 April 1994 and that E.K. was able to conduct a first interview with the child on the same date. A further interview took place on 9 January 1995.

The Court is also fully aware that in the present case there were particular difficulties in establishing the facts of the case, if only because of the victim's very young age. It notes the efforts made by the prosecuting authorities to assess whether questioning her would have been detrimental to her development. However, the Court observes that it has not been shown or argued that the authorities envisaged or made attempts, either at the investigation stage, or later, before the court, to test the reliability of the victim in a less invasive manner than direct questioning. This could have been done, for example, by more sophisticated methods, such as having the child interviewed in the presence of a psychologist and, possibly, also her mother, with questions put in writing by the defence, or in a studio enabling the applicant or his lawyer to be present indirectly at such an interview, via a videolink or oneway mirror (Accardi and Others v.\u00a0Italy (dec.), cited above; S.N. v.\u00a0Sweden cited above, \u00a7\u00a013). Had the authorities in the present case taken measures which would have allowed the court to have at its disposal, for instance, a recording of the interview which the psychologists had with the victim, the applicant's defence rights would have been better safeguarded.",

In this connection, the Court observes that under domestic law as it stood at the relevant time the appellate court was empowered to consider questions of both fact and law. Further, it was open to that court to quash the judgment under appeal and to remit the case for re-consideration to the firstinstance court, with a view to taking additional evidence (see paragraph\u00a037 above).

Likewise, the applicant never had an opportunity of observing the demeanour of X. under direct questioning (see P.S. v.\u00a0, cited above, \u00a7 29). Hence, no procedures were introduced by the authorities to counterbalance the difficulties faced by the defence and the applicant was not given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question this witness against him (compare and contrast S.N. v.\u00a0Sweden, where the applicant failed to avail himself of the opportunity at the pretrial stage to have questions put to the child complainant).

X. was at most four years old at the time the criminal investigation commenced against the applicant and no more than seven years old at the time of the applicant's trial. Even if, on the latter occasion, X. could be said to be old enough to be examined by the applicant or his lawyer, either directly or through the trial judge, I do not consider that, in the particular circumstances of the present case, the failure of the trial court to require such examination gave rise to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d).",

That testimony was based on two psychological examinations of X. which had been carried out by E. K. - the first on 14 April 1994, which took place in the presence of the mother and maternal grandmother of X. on the day that the former had requested the Pabianice District Prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant on charges of sexual abuse of their daughter, and the second, some nine months later, on 9 January 1995. Neither examination was attended by a representative of the prosecutor's office or by representative of the applicant or by a psychologist appointed by him. Moreover, as noted in the Court's judgment, neither examination was recorded on video so as to enable the trial court, with the assistance of other expert evidence, to assess the validity of the opinion of E.K. founded on such examinations that X. had not only been sexually abused but that the applicant was the abuser. It is true that the applicant had an opportunity to challenge this opinion and to question the adequacy and soundness of the methods used by E.K. when examining X. However, in my view, the rights of the defence were not thereby sufficiently safeguarded. Where, as here, the examination of X. by E.K. alone played a crucial role in the conviction of the applicant, I consider that fairness required that the applicant should have had the opportunity of testing E.K.'s evidence with the benefit of a recording of the examination itself.",

The regional court decided against hearing evidence from the child, firstly because it considered it to be unnecessary and secondly in order to avoid causing her serious harm in view of her extreme youth. The appellate court upheld the reasoning of the regional court and found that, even in the absence of oral testimony from the victim, the first-instance court's assessment of the evidence had not been unreasonable or arbitrary.",

He relied on Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3(d) of the Convention. With regard to the second complaint, there is no need to reiterate that the admissibility of evidence is governed primarily by the rules of domestic law and that it is in principle for the national courts to assess the evidence before them, the Court's role being confined to ascertaining whether the proceedings considered as a whole were fair. As regards the first and main complaint, the two questions which arise, as we see it, are as follows: (i) first, whether a four-year-old girl can or should be questioned or give evidence, especially in relation to serious sexual abuse issues and (ii) second, whether the same child, who was never questioned, can be regarded as a witness against the accused within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 3(d) of the Convention and the autonomous concept of \u201cwitness\u201d established by the Court.",

As age is an important factor in assessing this issue, it should be pointed out that in the case of S.N. v. Sweden the child concerned was ten years old, in P.S. v. Germany the girl was eight years old and in Bocos-Cuesta v.\u00a0the Netherlands, where the circumstances were serious but less traumatic, the victims were aged ten, six, nine and eleven.

The victims therefore acted as witnesses for the prosecution. In the present case, the child was examined by a psychologist and by doctors but was never questioned by anyone else; the evidence against the accused consisted of expert reports rather than statements, the latter not having been taken. That being the case, we consider that the victim herself cannot be considered as a witness against the accused, either for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 3(d) of the Convention or within the autonomous meaning of the Court's case-law (see, conversely, among other authorities, S.N.\u00a0v.\u00a0Sweden, no.\u00a034209/96, \u00a7\u00a045, ECHR 2002V).",

However, the fact that this was not available does not in any sense mean that the victim should be regarded as a prosecution witness. As the criminal case file was made up in particular of psychologists' and doctors' reports and opinions, the prosecution and the defence had the same evidence available to them and the same resources for performing their respective tasks; hence, no issue arises with regard to the principle of equality of arms. The applicant had every opportunity to challenge the psychologists' and doctors' reports and opinions, to question the authors and, if appropriate, to request a second opinion. Hence, all the evidence was produced at a public hearing, in the presence of the accused, enabling adversarial argument to take place as required by our Court's case-law.",
