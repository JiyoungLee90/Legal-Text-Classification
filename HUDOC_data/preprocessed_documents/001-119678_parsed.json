It was the result of an erroneous legal qualification of the applicant\u2019s condition on the basis of correctly established facts. The sentencing court had qualified the applicant\u2019s offence as being the result of a serious personality disorder and had ordered the applicant\u2019s detention in a psychiatric hospital without taking into account that a disorder for the purposes of Article 63 of the Criminal Code had to be a persisting condition. However, this erroneous legal assessment was to be corrected in proceedings following an appeal on points of law. It could no longer be corrected in the proceedings dealing with the execution of a sentence as doing so would violate the constitutional principle of the finality of legal decisions.",

In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the conviction and the deprivation of liberty at issue (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2\u00a0March 1987, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 114; Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, \u00a7 64, ECHR 2002IV; Waite v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a053236/99, \u00a7 65, 10 December 2002; and Kafkaris v.

The causal link required by subparagraph (a) might eventually be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release or to re-detain was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the initial decision (by a sentencing court) or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives. In those circumstances, a detention that was lawful at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with Article 5 (compare Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, \u00a7 40; Eriksen, cited above, \u00a7 78; Weeks, cited above, \u00a7 49; and M. v.\u00a0Germany, cited above, \u00a7 88).",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof (see, among many other authorities, Erkalo, cited above, \u00a7 52; Brand, cited above, \u00a7 60; Saadi v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 67; and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 116). This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Stafford, cited above, \u00a7 63; Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 116; and De Schepper v. , no. 27428/07, \u00a7 36, 13\u00a0October 2009). \u201cQuality of the law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 50, Reports\u00a01996III; Nasrulloyev v. Russia, no. 656/06, \u00a7 71, 11 October 2007; and Mooren v.  [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7 76, 9 July 2009).

It was only his then current condition that was decisive for the question of whether his detention therein should continue. Those review courts diverged, fundamentally, from the sentencing court in terms of the classification, in law, of the applicant\u2019s mental health. Whilst, clearly, he posed a risk, if released, the aim pursued by the review courts in detaining him in hospital differed, substantially, from the one which the sentencing court had pursued when it had made its original order pursuant to Article 63 of the Criminal Code. The aim of detention was no longer psychiatric treatment for a mental illness which diminished criminal responsibility and which thereby gave rise to a risk to the public but rather it was respect for the finality of an earlier judgment that had, erroneously, placed the applicant in a psychiatric institution because of a flawed legal classification of his condition.",

Consequently, there was no longer a sufficient causal connection between the applicant\u2019s conviction in 1995 and his continued detention in a psychiatric institution after 28 April 2006. Therefore, we consider that the applicant\u2019s continuous confinement in a psychiatric hospital cannot be justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) as being detention \u201cafter conviction\u201d.",

The Court has not developed in its case-law a precise definition of the term \u2018persons of unsound mind\u2019. The term has an autonomous meaning and the Court is not bound interpretations given in domestic legal orders. What is clear, however, is that three fundamental minimum conditions must be satisfied before the detention of a person on such a ground can be considered to be lawful: (i) the individual in question must be reliably shown to be of unsound mind, that is, a true mental disorder must have been established before a competent authority on the basis of objective medical expertise; (ii) the mental disorder must be of a degree warranting compulsory confinement; and (iii) the disorder must persist in order for the continued confinement to be valid.",

He was responsible for his behaviour and the risk which he posed flowed not from any mental illness but from a personality disorder characterised by emotional instability and a propensity for violence when confronted with a crisis in a relationship.

United Kingdom, no. 50272/99, \u00a7\u00a7 19 ss., 53). Indeed, there is nothing to indicate that the domestic courts ever considered that the applicant was \u2018of unsound mind\u2019 for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) of the Convention.

In other words, if deprivation of liberty is to fall within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) of the Convention, the individual\u2019s dangerousness must be the result of and causally connected to a true mental disorder. It is not sufficient for it to be solely the consequence of certain personality characteristics. We cannot but observe, once again, that the domestic courts were unanimous in their finding that the applicant\u2019s disorder was not so serious as to be pathological and that, from a psychiatric point of view, it did not necessitate medical treatment in a psychiatric hospital.",

As noted above, the continuation of his confinement in a psychiatric institution was ordered despite the fact that the domestic courts did not consider him to be a person whose dangerousness, as a matter of fact, flowed from a pathological mental disorder as defined in domestic law or from a mental disorder for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 (e) of the Convention.",
