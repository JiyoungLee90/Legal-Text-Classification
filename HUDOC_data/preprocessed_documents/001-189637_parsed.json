He alleged that most of the kicks had hit his head and that there had even been a footprint on his head. His wrist had allegedly been fractured when a kick had hit the handcuff on a hand that he had raised to protect his head. Although the medical examination revealed abrasions of different sizes on various parts of his head, none of those had exceeded 2.5 cm in length and there had been no lesions that had matched a shoe print. In the forensic expert\u2019s opinion, the medically documented injuries of the fourth applicant \u2013 epithelial abrasions of the forehead, the left eyebrow, the area anterior to the left ear and both knees (see paragraph 24 below) \u2013 could have been caused when he had been handcuffed, a measure that he had resisted; the injuries had not been typical of a beating and had only indicated a weak impact. Redness of the wrist had also been observed but had likely been caused by the handcuffing; whereas the left scaphoid bone fracture had been a residual condition of a former fracture that could have occurred years earlier (see paragraph 28 below).",

It notes, on the other hand, the Government\u2019s assertion that the coercion applied by the police was necessitated by the applicants\u2019 alleged resistance to a lawful measure. However, it takes the view that the Government have not furnished any convincing or credible arguments which would provide a basis to explain or justify the degree of force used during the operation. In particular, the Court takes cognisance of the Independent Police Complaints Board\u2019s reports, according to which the applicants\u2019 handcuffing \u2013 around which the Government\u2019s explanation revolves \u2013 had been unjustified and contrary to human dignity (see paragraphs 26, 27 and 29 above). The use of coercive force in order to apply a measure which has been found to be in breach of the applicants\u2019 fundamental rights to liberty and to human dignity cannot, in the Court\u2019s opinion, provide valid justification for the injuries sustained by the applicants. The Court would also note that apparently the police officers did not sustain any injuries or recount physically violent behaviour on the applicants\u2019 side; rather, it was only verbal aggression that was reproached to them. For the Court, however, such conduct cannot provide justification for use of force entailing injuries such as in the present case (see, mutatis mutandis, Bouyid v.
