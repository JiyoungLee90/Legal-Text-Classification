In adopting a \u201cmultiplier\u201d to reflect the deduction to be made to allow for the early receipt of the pension benefits and for mortality rates, the reports applied two alternative \u201crates of return\u201d (the net real rate of interest that would accrue upon the investment of any award made) of 2%, which the expert recommended, (\u201crecommended basis\u201d) and 4%, which the expert regarded as a reasonable alternative (\u201calternative basis\u201d). The reports acknowledged that the House of Lords had held in a personal injury case that the rate of return to be used should be 3% (Wells v. Wells [1999] 1 AC 345). The amounts claimed for loss of pension benefits were presented as round figures, the reports stating that they were based upon a number of assumptions about the future and that it was therefore important not to impute a false sense of accuracy to the eventual results.

For the purposes of assessing just satisfaction, having regard to the career assessments provided by both parties, the Court regards it as equitable to assume that the second applicant would have been promoted to Corporal in 1984 and remained in that rank until he left the armed forces. The Court further regards it as reasonable to assume that, subject to contingencies which can only be a matter of speculation, it is likely that the second applicant would, but for his discharge, have remained in the armed forces for a substantial period. In coming to that conclusion, the Court notes that the dispute between the Government and the second applicant related to whether he would have left after 12 or 22 years. It has further taken into account that, notwithstanding their primary submission on the point, the career forecast provided by the Government was based upon the second applicant having served for 22\u00a0years, which was described in that forecast as \u201clikely\u201d.",

The Court accepts the rates of pay provided by the Government, ranging from GBP 30,304 to GBP 42,007.85 per annum from 1995 to 2001, as an accurate statement of what his RAF salary would have been.

The Court considers it reasonable that his annual salary was likely to be lower than the national average for an accountant initially (stated by the Government to be GBP 33,000), while noting that it had risen to a figure approaching that amount after only six years in civilian life.",

The amount of that loss is necessarily speculative, depending as it does on, inter alia, the period during which the applicants would have remained in service and on their rank at the time of leaving service. The Court notes, in particular, that had the applicants for any reason left the armed forces before they were entitled to receive an immediately payable pension (after 22 years service in the case of the first two applicants and after 20 years service in the case of the third), they would have been entitled only to a deferred pension, payable at 60 years of age, which would have significantly reduced the amount of their pension loss.",
