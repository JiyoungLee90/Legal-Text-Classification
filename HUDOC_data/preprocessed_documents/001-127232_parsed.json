Following his conviction, in early 2009 he was sent to serve his sentence in a correctional colony. The Court has previously examined the situation of the applicants who had been transferred from the remand prison to the correctional colony to serve their sentence and who had later returned to the same prison in connection with proceedings in a different criminal case. Their departure to the colony being definitive at the material time and their subsequent return to the same prison being a mere happenstance, the Court reached the conclusion that their transfer marked the end of the situation complained about (see Mitrokhin v. Russia, no. 35648/04, \u00a7 36, 24\u00a0January 2012, and Yartsev v. Russia (dec.), no. 13776/11, \u00a7 30, 26\u00a0March 2013). Admittedly, in the instant case the applicant was brought back to the same prison in connection with a hearing in the framework of the same criminal proceedings. However, it must be recalled that supervisory review is an extraordinary remedy in Russian legal system. Accordingly, the applicant may have or have not been summoned to the hearing and his accommodation in the same prison more than one year after his conviction had become final and after he had started serving the sentence was an incidental occurrence rather than an anticipated continuation of the criminal proceedings against him. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s detention prior to 16\u00a0February 2009 and his detention in 2010 did not constitute a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d and must be viewed as distinct periods of detention.",

This complaint was raised more than three years after the end of the period in question but within six months of the final judgment by the Tomsk Regional Court on the applicant\u2019s claim for compensation for the inadequate conditions of his detention. The Court reiterates its constant position that, in the present state of Russian law, a civil action for compensation for inadequate conditions of detention cannot be considered an effective remedy (see, most recently, Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a042525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7\u00a7 113-118, 10\u00a0January 2012, with further references). A complaint about the inadequate conditions of detention must accordingly be introduced within six months of the day following the applicant\u2019s transfer out of the detention facility (see Norkin (dec.), cited above). The applicant should have been aware of the ineffectiveness of the judicial avenue he had made use of, before he lodged his application with the Court. The final disposal of his claims for compensation cannot be relied upon as starting a fresh time-limit for his complaints.",

In this regard, the Court reiterates that the nature of the alleged violation in the present case is such that it would not be possible to eliminate the effects of the infringement of the applicant\u2019s right to a fair hearing without re-opening the domestic proceedings (see Rozhin, \u00a7\u00a023, cited above). It further notes that Article 392 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for re-opening the proceedings in case of a judgment by the European Court finding a violation of the Convention or its Protocols. However, there is no apparent provision of Russian law that would allow the courts to re-open the proceedings on account of a decision by the Court to strike a case out of its list of cases (ibid.).",
