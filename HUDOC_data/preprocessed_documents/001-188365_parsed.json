The applicant asked the court to oblige the VCA to restore her property rights to 0.3013\u00a0hectares of land in Vilnius and to 1.72 hectares in the Vilnius region, as well as to award her 10,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL, approximately 2,896\u00a0euros (EUR)) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. The court held that the applicant had submitted several requests in 2006 asking the VCA to proceed with the restoration of her property rights; however, the latter had refused to act. Moreover, the authorities\u2019 decision of 19 May 2006 (see paragraph 10 above) had remained unenforced. It was explained to the applicant that several measures had yet to be carried out in order to proceed. The court held that the applicant had to be included on the list of citizens wishing to receive land in Did\u017eioji Rie\u0161\u0117, but that due to the authorities\u2019 inactivity, she had not been included on the list. The court also found that she still had a right to the restoration of her title to 0.6223 hectares of land and that the restitution process in her case had been going on for more than eighteen years. The court ordered the VCA to issue a decision restoring the applicant\u2019s property rights to 0.6223 hectares of land within three months of the date on which the aforementioned court decision became final. As regards compensation, the court awarded the applicant EUR 579 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",

She had received 0.5124 hectares in 2001 (see paragraph 9 above). In 2001 she had applied for the restoration of her property rights to 0.2 hectares of land in Vilnius (see paragraph 16 above), and in 2003 she had asked for the remaining land to be returned in kind (see paragraph 17 above). In 2005 and 2006 the applicant\u2019s property rights to 0.0973 and 0.0544 hectares of land had been restored (see paragraph 18 above). In 2012 the applicant had informed the authorities that she would not accept monetary compensation and still wanted to receive the remaining land in natura (see paragraph 19 above). In 2013 her property rights had been restored to 0.0005\u00a0hectares of land (see paragraph\u00a020 above). The court also indicated that before 1\u00a0April 2003 the applicant had changed her mind as to the form of restitution and had claimed that she wanted to receive the land in natura. The court noted that the process of restoration of the applicant\u2019s property rights had been carried out in several stages: in 2005 she had received a plot of 0.0937\u00a0hectares in Pa\u0161ilai\u010diai, Vilnius (see paragraph 18 above); in 2006 a document confirming that she had a right to receive 0.32 hectares of State redeemable land had been drawn up; and in 2006 and 2013 her property rights had been restored to 0.0544\u00a0hectares and 0.0005 hectares respectively (see paragraphs\u00a018 and 20 above). As regards the plot for the construction of an individual house, the court held that a decision to restore the applicant\u2019s property rights to 0.0937 hectares of land had been issued in 2005 and had not been challenged. The court also ruled that the restitution process was not over and would be continued. In the court\u2019s opinion, the authorities had not acted unlawfully and there were no grounds for awarding the applicant compensation.",

Lithuania, no. 27576/05, \u00a7 86, 21 July 2009; Igarien\u0117 and Petrauskien\u0117 v. Lithuania, no. 26892/05, \u00a7 58, 21 July 2009; Pauk\u0161tis v.

The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s right to restore her property rights to her late father\u2019s land was never contested by the authorities and that after 1991 she had a legitimate expectation to have her property rights restored (see, mutatis mutandis, Valan\u010dien\u0117 v.

She also requested a plot of forest in a rural area as an alternative form of restitution (see paragraph 11 above). The Government submitted that she had done so after the deadline indicated by the authority (see paragraph 45 above), but the Court notes that the Government\u2019s submission is completely opposite to what the documents in the Court\u2019s possession state. The deadline indicated by the authority was 1\u00a0March 2015 and the applicant submitted her request on 27\u00a0February 2015 (see paragraph 11 above), thus she submitted her request on time. Moreover, she participated in the meetings to which she had been invited and she chose several plots of land (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). The only proposal she refused was monetary compensation (see paragraph 19 above), but she was not under any obligation to accept it under domestic law (see paragraph\u00a034 above). The Court observes that the court proceedings instituted by the applicant undoubtedly protracted the restitution process; however, she instituted them in order to protect her rights. The authorities also exercised their right of appeal and it also prolonged the proceedings (see paragraph 25 and 29 above); and finally the courts acknowledged the inactivity on the part of the authorities (see paragraphs 23, 24, 26 and 28 above). The Court thus holds that the fact that the court proceedings were ongoing did not absolve the authorities from their duty to complete the restitution process in the applicant\u2019s case.",
