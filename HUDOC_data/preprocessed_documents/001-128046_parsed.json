The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, but not that recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v.

It further reiterates that in the Russian legal system although a court itself has no competence to institute criminal proceedings, its power to annul a refusal to institute criminal proceedings and indicate the defects to be addressed appears to be a substantial safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power by the investigating authorities (see Trubnikov v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a049790/99, 14 October 2003). The Court has previously pointed out that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically: for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069, and Aksoy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54).",

During this period the criminal proceedings were discontinued and reopened nine times (see paragraphs 18, 21, 24, 28, 29, 32, 35, 37 and 38 above).

This being so, the Court is not convinced that an appeal to a court or to a higher prosecutor against the decision of 5\u00a0December 2006 would have offered the applicant any redress. It considers, therefore, that such an appeal in the particular circumstances of the present case would have been devoid of any purpose (see, for example, Khatsiyeva and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a05108/02, \u00a7 151, 17 January 2008, and Vanfuli v. , no. 24885/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a072-75, 3\u00a0November 2011).

He was charged with two crimes: robbery in a shop and theft of paintings. At the hearings he pleaded not guilty (as to the attack on the shop, he stated that he had entered the shop without intent to robbery); however, his guilt was substantially confirmed by witnesses, victims, expert evidence and clues (masks, weapons, paintings), and he was ultimately convicted by the national court on some of the charges and acquitted on others. The gang operated for two years (2003-2004); there were six members participating in the robbery (against nine police officers), and one of them managed to escape arrest in the shop. These facts raise even more doubts in relation to possible reasons for ill-treatment and justify more strongly the use of force to stop the violence, which had lasted for two years.",

One of these values is peaceful life. This value is so fragile and delicate that we should all feel responsible for maintaining the peace. If anyone takes up a shotgun or weapon with violent intent, this value is immediately placed at great risk. So, any such applicant should understand that the lives of others are in danger, that such danger is immeasurable because he may participate in killings, and that he may be injured or even killed as a result of the resistance to his unlawful violence (subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Convention). The use of force against the applicant during his arrest was a way of making him take responsibility for the lack of respect he had shown for peaceful life.
