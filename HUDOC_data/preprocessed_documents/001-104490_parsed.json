They thus acted in order to protect potential victims from physical and psychological harm amounting to inhuman or degrading treatment which might be caused by the applicant. Under the Court's well-established case-law, States are indeed required under Article 3 to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, including such ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see, for example, A. v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, \u00a7 22, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI; M.C. v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a039272/98, \u00a7\u00a7 149-150, ECHR 2003XII; and Opuz v. Turkey, no.\u00a033401/02, \u00a7\u00a0159, ECHR 2009...).

The wording of Article 7 paragraph 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 28; Jamil, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031; Adamson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42293/98, 26 January 1999; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 142).

Moreover, he had had to pay EUR 8,693 to a psychologist for a behaviour therapy and for the treatment of his depressions in order to obtain the necessary psychological care helping him to come to terms with his illegal preventive detention. He could not be expected to have made a different therapy while in illegal detention. Furthermore, he had been obliged to pay EUR 12,620.12 for an antibody therapy to cure a cancer of his eyes, having refused a radiotherapy proposed by the prison authorities which had entailed a risk to go blind. He alleged that a statutory health insurance company, which would have been his insurer had he lived in freedom, would have reimbursed the costs of the antibody therapy.",

As for the medical fees paid to his psychologist by his wife, the Government submitted that the applicant could not claim the reimbursement of the costs of his behaviour therapy he had not borne himself. The authorities had refused to pay for that therapy because the applicant should have made a more far-reaching social therapy in order to treat his personality disorder. He had, however, refused to accept the prison authorities' repeated offers of such treatment which would also have included help in order to deal with a long period of detention. As for the costs for the antibody therapy to cure the cancer of his eyes, the Government argued that those costs, paid again by his wife, had not been caused by his allegedly illegal detention.

Consequently, no clear causal connection between the Convention violations and the applicant's loss of estimated earnings and pension rights has been established and the Court therefore rejects the applicant's claim in this respect. As to the costs for his psychological treatment, the Court observes that the applicant was offered a more comprehensive social therapy, including help to deal with his long detention. Therefore, the costs incurred for his behaviour therapy cannot be said to have been caused by his detention in breach of the Convention. Finally, the applicant failed to demonstrate that he would not have had to bear the costs of the antibody therapy he chose to cure the cancer of his eyes had he not been in detention at the relevant time; consequently, a causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged has not been established in this respect either.
