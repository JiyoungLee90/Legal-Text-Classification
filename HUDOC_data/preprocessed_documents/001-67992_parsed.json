The applicant did so and on 26 July 1994, after the Customs Administration had filed its answer, the Plovdiv District Court forwarded the appeal to the .

In particular, the car bought by the applicant had been impounded as a piece of evidence. The fact that later it had later been delivered to the customs authorities did not change that. Nor was it significant that the criminal proceedings were against a third party and that the penal order against the applicant had been quashed, because the applicant could still suffer the negative consequences of the criminal proceedings, e.g. the forfeiture of the car.",

The fact that the court had repeatedly inquired about the conduct of the investigation did not mean that that there had been activity in the criminal proceedings.

As regards the fact that the oral proceedings before the Plovdiv District Court had to be reopened because the applicant's lawyer had not been able to prepare and was absent during the hearing on 10 September 2002, the Court, noting that this failure was due to the sending of the casefile to the Ministry of Justice in the period immediately preceding the hearing (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above), does not consider that the resulting delay can be held against the applicant.",

The Court will not interfere with their rulings unless the applicant succeeds in demonstrating that they acted arbitrarily. Nor can the Court find that a system providing for the dependence of civil proceedings on criminal ones, when they concern the same or related facts, goes per se against the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention. However, the Court notes that after the civil proceedings were stayed, no activity took place in the concurrent criminal proceedings for more than six years (see paragraph 24 above).

The Court does not find that the hourly rate of EUR 50 is excessive as such (see Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, \u00a7 176 in fine, ECHR 2002-IV, and Nikolov v. Bulgaria, no. 38884/97, \u00a7 111, 30 January 2003). However, it considers that the number of hours claimed is excessive and that a reduction is necessary on that basis. It also considers that a reduction should be applied on account of the fact that part of the application was declared inadmissible (see paragraph 6 above). Finally, the claim for translation expenses is not supported by relevant documents.",
