Detention for over forty-eight hours was permitted only on the basis of a court order and provided that the administrative removal could not be effected otherwise. The court order was necessary to guarantee protection not only from arbitrary detention of over forty-eight hours, but also from arbitrary detention as such, while the court assessed the lawfulness of and reasons for the placement of the person in custody. The Constitutional Court further noted that detention for an indefinite term would amount to an inadmissible restriction on the right to liberty as it would constitute punishment not provided for in Russian law and which was contrary to the Constitution.",

The expulsion order did not specify that the applicant was to be taken to Uzbekistan, but merely stated that he was to be removed from the territory of the Russian Federation. As to the applicant\u2019s allegation that he risked ill-treatment in Uzbekistan, the Government pointed out that Uzbekistan had ratified various international human-rights treaties, that it was making democratic improvements, and that the habeas corpus procedure had been implemented in January 2008. They further argued that the case-law of the Court gave no examples of individuals who had been ill-treated in Uzbekistan following their extradition from Russia. The Government were sceptical about the NGO reports concerning the situation in Uzbekistan referred to by the applicant; in the Government\u2019s view, they contained general allegations that were uncorroborated by specific factual information.

Contrary to the Government\u2019s claim, nothing in the expulsion order of 23 May 2013 had indicated that the risk of ill-treatment had somehow been taken into account.

His placement in the detention facility foreclosed the possibility of his voluntary and independent departure from Russia and prevented him from choosing the country of destination. He disagreed with the Government\u2019s submission that his expulsion had been made necessary because of his failure to abide by the Russian migration laws and the absence of family ties in Russia.

On the first point, the Court reiterates that, whilst a person\u2019s failure to seek asylum immediately after arrival in another country may be relevant for the assessment of the credibility of his or her allegations, the domestic authorities\u2019 findings as regards the failure to apply for refugee status in due time did not, as such, refute his allegations under Article 3 of the Convention (see Ermakov, cited above, \u00a7 196). On the second point, the Court emphasises that the criteria that are laid down for granting refugee status are not identical to those that are used for assessment of the risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. The applicant made detailed submissions about the risk of his being subjected to ill-treatment if he were returned to his home country, relying on information from various international organisations and on the judgments of this Court. However, the domestic decisions did not mention those submissions or draw any conclusions from them. The Court has no information on the outcome of the final round of appeal proceedings on refugee status (see paragraph 24 above).",

Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. The notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary, and thus contrary to the Convention. To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention must be appropriate; and the length of the detention must not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Azimov, \u00a7 161, and Rustamov, \u00a7 150, both cited above, with further references).",

The Court reiterates that in Azimov, it found that a decision ordering the applicant\u2019s detention pending expulsion had served to circumvent the maximum time-limits laid down in the domestic law for detention pending extradition (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0165). However, it does not need to determine whether the same is true in the instant case because even where the purpose of detention is legitimate, its length should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7 166, and Shakurov v. Russia, no.\u00a055822/10, \u00a7\u00a0162, 5 June 2012).",

Under Article 31.9 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Administrative Offences, an expulsion decision must be enforced within two years \n(see paragraph 27 above). Thus, after the expiry of such a period, a detainee should be released. This may happen in the present case; however, the possible implications of Article 31.9 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Administrative Offences for the applicant\u2019s detention are a matter of interpretation, and the rule limiting the duration of the detention of an illegal alien is not set out clearly in the law. It is also unclear what will happen after the expiry of the two-year time-limit, since the applicant will clearly remain in an irregular situation in terms of immigration law and will again be liable to expulsion and, consequently, to detention on that ground (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0171).",

In the present case the \u201cpreventive\u201d measure was much heavier than the \u201cpunitive\u201d one, which is not normal (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0172).",
