In particular, it should be noted that this was a statement neither written by the applicant himself nor a verbatim record, but the expert\u2019s concise notes based on the applicant\u2019s verbal description. Similarly, upon a careful scrutiny of the wording of the records, the Court is not persuaded that the information the applicant had given to the neurosurgeon and the expert about his fall had necessarily included two different causes of that fall (see paragraphs 14 and 21 above). More explanation was required as to why the domestic authorities took the view that these submissions negated the applicant\u2019s later allegation that he had been pushed to the ground.",
