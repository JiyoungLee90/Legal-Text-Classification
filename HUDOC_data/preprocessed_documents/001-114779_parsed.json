While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10. The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive (see, for example, Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2004XI).",

Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. In addition, the Court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation. In cases such as the present one the national margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of democratic society in enabling the press to exercise its vital role of \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d in imparting information of serious public concern (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.

In the applicant\u2019s opinion these provisions were discriminatory against women and, if adopted, would have harmful effects on them and on children. Within the scope of this framework the applicant voiced her distress at what she described as the views of some Commission members charged with the preparation of the draft Criminal Code. In her opinion the views of these commission members demonstrated the mentality behind these provisions. The Court finds that the subject matter of the articles in question, particularly a legal framework which promoted alleged gender discrimination, concerned important matters in a democratic society which the public has a legitimate interest in being informed of and which fall within the scope of political debate. The articles in question therefore contributed to a debate of general interest.",

The second plaintiff, a law professor, was also advisor to the Minister of Justice (see paragraph 22 above).

The Court considers that, even assuming that the language and expressions used in the two articles in question were harsh and that they could be perceived as offensive, they were, however, mostly value judgments based on particular facts, events or controversial views voiced in the media and thus were already known and subject to virulent debate before the general public, as the applicant sought to demonstrate in the domestic proceedings (see paragraphs 8, 17 and 29 above). They therefore had a factual basis. In so far as it concerns statements of fact contained in the impugned articles, the Court finds that the domestic courts did not attempt to distinguish them from value judgments nor do they appear to have examined whether the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention were observed on the part of the applicant or the publishing company. In particular, for the Court, the domestic courts\u2019 decisions failed to assess whether the articles were published in good faith.",

In the instant case, for the Court, the domestic courts, in their examination of the cases, omitted to set the impugned remarks within the context and the form in which they were expressed (see paragraph 56 above). In this connection, the Court reiterates that offensive language may fall outside the protection of freedom of expression if it amounts to wanton denigration, for example where the sole intent of the offensive statement is to insult (see Ska\u0142ka v. Poland, no.\u00a043425/98, \u00a7 34, 27 May 2003). However, the use of vulgar phrases in itself is not decisive in the assessment of an offensive expression, as it may well serve merely stylistic purposes. For the Court, style constitutes part of communication as a form of expression and as such is protected together with the content of the expression (see Uj v. , no. 23954/10, \u00a7 20, 19 July 2011).",

This finding makes in unnecessary for the Court to pursue its examination in order to determine whether the amount of compensation which the applicant was ordered to pay was proportionate to the aim pursued.
