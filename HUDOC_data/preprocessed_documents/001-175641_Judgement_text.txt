.  The case originated in an application (no. 62812/12) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Sergey Petrovich Bulava (“the applicant”), on 6 September 2012.
.  The applicant was represented by Ms A. Zheltyakova, a lawyer practising in Novosibirsk. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
.  The applicant alleged that the authorities had not secured his wellbeing in detention as they had failed to provide him with adequate medical care. He also argued that he had had no effective remedies to complain of the quality of that treatment in detention.
.  On 3 September 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
.  The applicant was born in 1965 in the Altay Region. He lives in Novosibirsk.
.  At the relevant time the applicant was serving a prison sentence for aggravated robbery in correctional colony no. 21 in the Novosibirsk Region.
.  On 20 January 2007 he complained to a prison doctor that he had started experiencing severe pain in the lower back after an accidental fall. The doctor diagnosed lumbar osteochondrosis and prescribed the standard treatment.
.  The treatment proved to be ineffective. Thirty days later he was admitted to the correctional colony’s medical unit for a month-long course of inpatient treatment. According to the applicant, the unit did not employ the necessary medical specialists and did not have the equipment needed to treat his condition.
.  Since there were no positive developments in the applicant’s health and the pain persisted, on 13 March 2007 he was taken to the regional prison hospital in Novosibirsk. He was seen by a neurologist, who diagnosed myelopathy, a neurological problem related to the spinal cord, accompanied with a mild dysfunction of the legs. The treatment regimen was amended, but his condition did not change. He was discharged from the hospital on 2 April 2007.
.  On two occasions, between 20 April and 23 June 2007 and between 17 September and 2 November 2007, the applicant was treated in the correctional colony’s medical unit.
On 28 November 2007 the applicant was certified as having a thirddegree disability.
.  On 18 February, 25 August and 1 November 2008 the detention authorities applied to move him to Gaaza Prison Hospital in St Petersburg for “neurosurgical treatment”, but apparently received no reply.
.  In the meantime, the applicant was sent back and forth between the medical unit and the prison hospital, mainly receiving medication for his symptoms. He developed paresis, a neurological condition of muscle weakness, in three of his limbs, and started using crutches.
.  On 1 December 2008 a special medical board confirmed the applicant’s disability and ordered a magnetic resonance imaging examination (“MRI”), however, the detention facility had no funds to pay for it. After collecting enough money, the applicant had an MRI on 10 December 2009. It revealed an abnormal narrowing of the spinal canal. The applicant was prescribed conservative treatment.
The treatment he received did not stop the illness’s progression and on 2 April 2010 he was certified as having a second-degree disability.
.  In July 2010 the detention authorities applied for his admission to the spinal surgical unit of the Gaaza hospital. On 27 September 2010 their request was dismissed owing to the absence of a fresh MRI.
.  On 6 December 2010 the applicant complained to the prosecutor of Novosibirsk Region about the failure of the medical authorities to duly apply for his transfer to the prison hospital. By a letter of 28 December 2010 the prosecutor supported the applicant’s allegations, noting that a prison official had already been disciplined for the failure to submit the applicant’s complete medical file to Gaaza Prison Hospital. The prosecutor ordered the detention authorities to apply for the applicant’s admission to the prison hospital.
.  On 24 February 2011 the applicant was seen by the chief traumatology specialist of Novosibirsk Region, who prescribed spine surgery, an operation which was accessible through the quota system (for the applicable quota regulation see paragraph 28 below). On 1 March 2011 the hospital’s medical board asked the regional authorities to allocate a surgery quota to the applicant.
.  On 9 September 2011 the detention authorities paid for an MRI for the applicant in a civilian hospital. On the basis of that examination, a civilian doctor confirmed three days later that spine surgery was required.
.  In the meantime, the applicant brought a tort action with the Toguchinskiy District Court of Novosibirsk Region, complaining about the authorities’ failure to provide him with effective medical assistance, in particular, the required spine surgery.
.  On 23 November 2011 the District Court dismissed the applicant’s claim, finding that he had been provided with the required medical assistance. As regards the subject of the claim, the alleged failure to perform spine surgery, the court noted that the authorities had already asked for a surgery quota to be allocated to the applicant.
.  On 29 March 2012 the Novosibirsk Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal and it became final.
.  On 5 July 2012 the Novosibirsk Regional Court refused to reopen the case by way of a cassation appeal, affirming the lower courts’ decisions.
.  On 7 November 2012 a special medical board at the Novosibirsk Research Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedics, the regional medical authority in charge of quota distribution, refused to allocate one to the applicant. Conservative treatment was recommended.
.  In 2012 and 2013 the applicant went to the prison hospital for several courses of inpatient treatment. No positive effect on his spine condition was recorded.
.  The applicant was released on parole on 19 July 2013.
.  The relevant general provisions of domestic and international law on the general health care of detainees are set out in Ivko v. Russia (no. 30575/08, §§ 55-62, 15 December 2015).
Order no. 1689н, issued on 28 December 2011 by the Russian Healthcare Ministry, regulates the procedure for admitting patients to treatment which requires the use of advanced technology. The doctor in charge of treating the person has to prepare medical documents for the allocation of a quota and should submit them to a hospital board, which, within three working days, has to render a decision as to whether the quota application should be forwarded to the regional authorities for a final decision (paragraphs 4-7). If the hospital board’s decision is positive, the patient’s medical file must be sent within the following three days to the regional authorities. Those authorities must make a decision on the quota allocation within ten days of receipt of the patient’s documents (paragraph 11).
.  The provisions of domestic law establishing the legal avenues for complaints about the quality of medical services are cited in the following judgments: Patranin v. Russia (no. 12983/14, §§ 86-88, 23 July 2015); Reshetnyak v. Russia (no. 56027/10, §§ 35-46, 8 January 2013); Dirdizov v. Russia (no. 41461/10, §§ 47-61, 27 November 2012); and Koryak v. Russia (no. 24677/10, §§ 46-57, 13 November 2012).
