In 1959 the Housing (Decontrol) Ordinance, Chapter\u00a0158 of the Laws of Malta (hereinafter \u201cthe HD Ordinance\u201d) was enacted, which provided incentives to encourage landlords to rent their property, and created a special class of dwelling houses free from rent control.",

It noted that such a conclusion required three elements, namely the same parties (eaedem personae), the same object (eadem res) and the same cause of action (eadem causa petendi). Moreover, where the arguments raised were different, it had to be seen whether they could have been raised at the time of the principal judgment. In the present case, it considered that there had been no doubt that the requirement of eaedem personae had been met, despite the fact that the applicant had attempted to bring the present proceedings against the State and that the other proceedings had been against the Attorney General, as it was clear that the defendant in both cases was the Maltese Government. The element of eadem res had also been satisfied in so far as the present case concerned the same lease of the same property, with the same tenants and the same circumstances that had led the applicant to institute proceedings the first time round. Similarly, the element of eadem causa petendi had also been satisfied, since the applicant\u2019s applications to the court were to a great extent the same, if not identical, despite the fact that he had made further arguments and submitted that his situation had remained unchanged notwithstanding the 2009 amendments to the Civil Code. The court considered that the changes to the application had not changed the nature of the action, namely a claim that the restrictions on the rent imposed by the law had been disproportionate. This matter had already been dealt with by the court in the first set of proceedings (no.\u00a049/05), where it had decided that a fair balance had been struck by the authorities; it was not therefore open to the applicant to relitigate the matter. The court further held that even though the applicant had argued that despite the 2009 amendments (if they applied at all) he had remained a victim of the alleged violation, there was already a judgment in his respect stating that the law in so far as it applied to his case had not breached his rights, and the more recent amendments had not worsened his situation. Thus, the Civil Court (First Hall) held that there could not have been a breach of his rights even under the new law. Lastly, it concluded that any new arguments put forward by him should have been incorporated into the first set of proceedings. As to the Court\u2019s recent case-law, it considered that the judgment cited did not entitle the applicant to ask for a fresh examination of his case.",

Indeed, the Government had not submitted any evidence of an emergency situation existing in 1979 when the laws had been amended in the tenants\u2019 favour (following twenty years of a free market). Nor had these laws done any good, given that people had started to mistrust the Government, who could tip the balance to one end or another at their convenience. In fact, people had stopped investing in residential property, opting to invest in holiday accommodation which was not subject to restrictions. Thus, instead of achieving the Government\u2019s alleged aim of decent residential accommodation, the measure had been counterproductive. The Government had not even substantiated that there were tenants in need of protection nowadays. In fact, if this were so, it would be in stark contrast to the liberalisation of leases undertaken after 1995. Thus, the Government had failed to prove that the existence of such restrictions to date pursued any existing and current public interest. In reality, as in the present case, the restrictions had solely aimed to enrich tenants and impoverish landlords. The applicant noted that in the present case, the tenant and his sister had received by donation a plot of land measuring 2,185 square metres, which had been subsequently parcelled out into nine building plots and sold to third parties. Despite such land availability or the relevant income, couple C remained housed by the applicant at an extremely low rent. To add insult to injury, the tenants were ready to move out had they been paid a financial incentive (key money) of EUR 232,494.",

Thus, the amendments had only marginally ameliorated his position, in that the minimum rent had been adjusted to EUR 185 per year and was revisable every three years. Any other provisions were either inapplicable or had already been provided for by the 1979 law. Admitting that he had erred in his claims during the proceedings before the RRB in 1998, he considered that under domestic law an appeal could only be lodged in respect of applications for the repossession of premises or on a point of law; however, neither of these categories applied to his case. He further noted that, had the proper regime been applied, the rent should have been adjusted to EUR 246 in 1994 and EUR 363 in 2009, and in that case the amendments of 2009 would not even have applied to him. In addition, he submitted that the Government\u2019s calculations as to the increases available to him were incorrect. In reality, it had only been in 2013 that such an increase had been due and this would have amounted to EUR 194.63 per year in his current position, while under the HD Ordinance it would have amounted to EUR\u00a0381.83. Thus, even assuming the Government\u2019s rental estimate for that year amounting to EUR 2,900 (see paragraph 15 above) to be correct (although the applicant considered it improbable), the said rents would still have amounted to 6.7 % and 13.17 % of the current market value respectively. This went to show how meagre the improvements had been, and the fact that an increase according to inflation did not reflect price increases in immovable property, which according to the Immovable Price Index Notice (Subsidiary legislation 246.08) had been 42.92% for the period between 2004 and 2012.",

It followed that the property had not lost any worth since he had inherited it.

The rent could be increased every three years in accordance with inflation. While owners retained their rights to dispose of the property, tenants had limited rights and were obliged to take good care of the property as well as incur all expenses related to ordinary repairs and maintenance. In the event that owners were to make extraordinary repairs to the property, the law allowed for a further increase in the annual rent by 6% of the value of the repairs. Furthermore, tenants could only use a property for its intended purpose and any other use, or non-use, for twelve months, would entitle owners to ask for the dissolution of the contract. Lastly, the revision of the definition of tenant had been more favourable to land owners (see Relevant domestic law above). The law had thus struck a balance between the rights of tenants and those of owners, who under these circumstances could make some profit.",

In that sphere, decisions as to whether, and if so when, it may fully be left to the play of free market forces or whether it should be subject to State control, as well as the choice of measures for securing the housing needs of the community and of the timing for their implementation, necessarily involve consideration of complex social, economic and political issues. Finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, the Court has on many occasions declared that it will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is in the \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cgeneral\u201d interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Hutten-Czapska, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 165-166).",

Croatia, no. 12027/10, \u00a7 126, 10 July 2014). Thus, while he remained the owner of the property, he was subjected to a forced landlord-tenant relationship for what appears to be an indefinite period of time. He could only bring the lease to an end if his tenants failed to pay the rent or caused considerable damage to the house, or if they otherwise failed to comply with the conditions of the lease or their obligations thereunder, or if they used the premises for a purpose other than mainly as their ordinary residence. The Court further considers that the possibility of the tenants leaving the premises voluntarily was remote, especially since the tenancy could be inherited (despite the disputed application of the definition of tenant, which was varied only slightly by the 2010 amendments). The Government\u2019s contention that transfer of the tenancy by inheritance was improbable given that couple C were of an advanced age and currently living alone was not substantiated and remains to be considered as pure speculation.

The Court points out that in the application of the 1979 and subsequent amendments to his case, he was in an even worse position as regards the amount of rent payable because of an error in the RRB proceedings, which he admitted (see paragraph 44 above). In fact it is not disputed that the RRB had based its decision on a regime which was not applicable to the property at issue, thus providing a lower rent, and that the applicant had not appealed. In this connection, the Court does not find it necessary to determine whether an appeal before the RRB would have been possible in the instant case, as in any event it has not been contested that, even if the proper law was applied, the RRB could not have awarded more than what was established by law which, according to the applicant, was not a fair amount of rent. It follows, however, that this further pejoration in the rent payable is attributable to him, and the assessment of the proportionality of the measure will thus take into account what he would have received in rent under the applicable regime complained of, as also amended in 2009 and 2010, and not what he actually received. Further, the Court notes that it is not up to it to interpret domestic law, and for the purposes of the present case it can in any event consider that the 2009 and 2010 amendments \u2013 slightly improving a landlord\u2019s position \u2013 applied to the applicant\u2019s case. The parties are also in disagreement as to the maximum amount of rent applicable; however, it suffices for the Court to note that in 2013 such rent would not in any event have exceeded EUR 382 annually (see paragraph 44 above), which is less than 1/7th of the rental market value as established by the Government for that year (EUR 2,900). The Court considers that State control over levels of rent falls into a sphere subject to a wide margin of appreciation by the State, and its application may often cause significant reductions in the amount of rent chargeable (see, in particular, Mellacher and Others, cited above, \u00a7 45). Nevertheless, this may not lead to results which are manifestly unreasonable, such as amounts of rent allowing only a minimal profit (see Amato Gauci, cited above \u00a7 62).",

Thus, in its balancing exercise the Court will have to determine whether such a degree of tenant protection to the detriment of owners is still justified thirty years after those amendments, that is to say, from 2008 onwards.",

Secondly, as admitted by the Government, steps were being taken to phase out controlled leases and that new leases were no longer controlled after 1995. Despite this open regime being in force for nearly two decades, it seems from the statistics submitted by the Government that from 2008 onwards less than 2% of the population were requesting aid for social housing. Regrettably, the Government have not submitted information as to how many tenants still benefit today from protected rents and whether these protected rents are justified in respect of each tenant (see Bitt\u00f3 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 109-110). In addition, as had been established in other cases (see Amato Gauci, cited above), there has been a rise in the standard of living in Malta over the past decades. It follows from the above that the needs and the general interest which may have existed in 1979 must have decreased over the three decades that ensued. Indeed, as submitted by the Government, the minimum wage in 2008 was EUR 146 a week or EUR 7,592 per year, and in 2013 it was EUR\u00a0162 a week or EUR 8,424 per year. The Court further observes that the national minimum pension according to the Social Security Act is, according to circumstances, four fifths (if the husband was maintaining his wife) or two thirds of the relevant minimum wage. It follows that, for example, for the year 2013, even assuming couple C were dependent solely on one individual\u2019s minimum wage (EUR 8,424 per year), what they should have paid in annual rent for lodging purposes according to the 1979 amendments (which the Court noted in paragraph 63 above could not in any case be more than EUR 382 per year) amounted to less than 5% of their annual income (what they were actually paying amounted to less than 2.2%). Had they been dependent only on one national minimum pension it would have amounted to less than 6% of their annual income.",

It has further considered the legitimate purpose of the restriction imposed, reiterating that legitimate objectives in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d, such as those pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see James and Others, cited above, \u00a7 54, and Jahn and Others v.

However, the situation in the present case might be said to involve a degree of public interest which is less marked than in previous similar Maltese rent-law cases and which does not justify such a substantial reduction compared with the free market rental value (see Amato Gauci, cited above, \u00a7 77). It further considers that a one-off payment of 5% interest should be added to the above amount (see Ghigo v. Malta (just satisfaction), no. 31122/05, \u00a7 20, 17 July 2008). The Court, also bearing in mind that it was because of the applicant\u2019s own fault that he was receiving an even lower rent, considers it reasonable to award EUR 11,550, from which must be deducted the sums already deposited in court by couple C in rent since 2008, which can still be retrieved by the applicant.",
