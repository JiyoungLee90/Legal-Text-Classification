In respect of X being adopted by his foster parents, it noted that this could be beneficial to X because it would offer him increased security and stability. It considered, however, that the foster parents would continue to support X even if he were not adopted, and that the first and second applicants would not in the future be likely to use their procedural rights to have his care order and their contact rights revised in a manner that would be harmful to X. Furthermore, adoption would entail X being cut off from his parents and thereby his ties to Philippine culture, and there were no grounds for assuming that the first and second applicants lacked caring skills. The High Court therefore concluded that it would not be correct to authorise X\u2019s adoption. The High Court noted that post-adoption contact under section 420a of the Child Welfare Act had been decided (see paragraph\u00a038 below), and that adoption would thus not entail X losing all contact with his parents. Such post-adoption contact would be of a very limited extent, however, and in the High Court\u2019s view contact to a more traditional extent would be in X\u2019s best interests.

He called his foster parents \u201cmummy\u201d and \u201cdaddy\u201d. He had a close and good relationship with the foster parents\u2019 biological son, who was a little older, with a younger girl who was also a foster child in the family, and with the extended family. It was clear from a memorandum from the child welfare services dated 17 October 2014 that X usually used his foster parents\u2019 surname when anyone asked what he was called.",

That consideration was supported by a White Paper on the protection of children\u2019s development (NOU 2012:5: Better protection of children\u2019s development (Bedre beskyttelse av barns utvikling)).

The High Court had referred to the fact that he was described as an insecure child, particularly in new and unfamiliar situations. He had started school by the time that the Supreme Court was considering its judgment, and it had been decided that he should have a special-needs education. The Educational and Psychological Counselling Service (pedagogisk-psykologisk tjeneste \u2013 PPT) had referred to \u201cthe need for an overview and predictability, the security of knowing who will look after him and who he should go to\u201d.

The foster parents had taken a positive attitude to the contact visits, and there was every reason to believe that the visiting arrangement would work as intended. As had been stated by the European Court of Human Rights in the Aune case (see Aune, cited above, \u00a7 78), the contact visits meant that X would not be cut off from his roots and his ethnic background.",

It had turned out, however, that the first and second applicants had been incapable of providing X with the necessary care.

Norway [GC], no.\u00a037283/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0202-213, 10 September 2019, to which reference is made. For the purpose of the present analysis, the Court reiterates that regard to family unity and for family reunification in the event of separation are inherent considerations in the right to respect for family life under Article 8 of the Convention. Accordingly, in the case of imposition of public care restricting family life, a positive duty lies on the authorities to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible. Moreover, any measure implementing such temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the natural parents and the child. The positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible will begin to weigh on the competent authorities with progressively increasing force as from the commencement of the period of care, subject always to its being balanced against the duty to consider the best interests of the child. The ties between members of a family, and the prospect of their successful reunification will perforce be weakened if impediments are placed in the way their having easy and regular access to each other (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0205 and 208).",

The Court thus recognises that the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of taking a child into care. A \u201cstricter scrutiny\u201d is called for in any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by the authorities on parental rights of access, and of any legal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between the parents and a young child are effectively curtailed (ibid., \u00a7 211).",

Moreover, in the instant case, X clearly enjoyed \u201cfamily life\u201d with his foster parents at the time that the decision to authorise his adoption was made, and it was accordingly not the adoption decision that set in motion the bonding of the child with the adoptive parents; rather, that decision consolidated and formalised existing ties (see, for example, Chepelev v. Russia, no. 58077/00, \u00a7 29, 26 July\u00a02007). In addition, the Court reiterates that it has previously refrained from attempting to untangle the opposing considerations inherent in questions concerning whether adoption or long-term foster care may be in the best interests of a child in a specific case (see, in particular, P., C. and S. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 56547/00, \u00a7 136, ECHR 2002VI).",

In order to consider those proceedings correctly, the Court has to put them into their context, which inevitably means to some extent having regard to the related proceedings concerning public care and contact restrictions (ibid., \u00a7 148). In doing so, the Court observes that X\u2019s initial placement in care was to a large part related to the first and second applicants\u2019 issues with mental health at the time in question (see paragraph 9 above). Notwithstanding that circumstantial justification for the care order, the Board and the District Court both proceeded on the assumption that the placement would be long-term (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above). When the Board issued the care order on 23 October 2009, it, referred to, inter alia, the likely long-term nature of the foster care and set the first and second applicants\u2019 contact rights at only two visits yearly, each time for two hours (see paragraph 12 above). That decision was upheld by the District Court. In the meantime, only one visit was carried out (see paragraph 13 above).",

However, in this case the decision to impose a very strict visiting regime cemented the situation at the very outset, making it highly probably that the child would become attached to the foster parents and alienated from the natural parents, thus precluding any realistic possibility of eventual reunification. Indeed, this is precisely what happened in the present case. In this respect, the Court recalls that where the authorities are responsible for a situation of family breakdown because they have failed in their obligation to take measures to facilitate family reunification, they may not base a decision to authorise adoption on the grounds of the absence of bonds between the parents and the child (see Strand Lobben and Others, cited above, \u00a7 208).",

That issue was not expressly raised by the District Court, which itself failed to include any assessment of the first and second applicants\u2019 caring skills in the mandate given to the expert that it appointed (see paragraphs 16-17 above). It was, however, aptly illustrated by the report by the expert appointed by the High Court: that expert expressly stated in her report that the first and second applicants had been allowed neither to fully demonstrate nor to develop their caring skills to any particular degree (see paragraph 17 above). At the time of the impugned proceedings, there was thus in the Court\u2019s view already a risk that the family would not be reunited, even though there had been improvements in the first and second applicants\u2019 situation, and that expert found nothing to indicate that they lacked caring skills (ibid.). Nonetheless, instead of attempting to find measures that could counter that risk \u2013 and in a situation where the first and second applicants had effectively consented to uphold the status quo by not appealing against the High Court\u2019s judgment in respect of the refusal to lift the care order \u2013 the domestic authorities, by way of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment, ultimately decided to increase it by authorising X\u2019s adoption and setting only limited post-adoption contact visits. In those circumstances, the Court does not find it decisive that the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment on adoption was not based on an assessment of the first and second applicants\u2019 caring skills, but on X\u2019s attachment to his foster home only.",

The Court considers that while maintenance of contact between an adopted child and his or her biological parents, in a situation where there are clearly no prospects of reunification, may be a relevant factor in ensuring continuing respect for family life (see Aune, cited above, \u00a7 78), the extremely limited nature of the contact arrangements in the present case \u2013 two hours twice a year \u2013 rendered them incapable even of allowing the development of a meaningful relationship.",
