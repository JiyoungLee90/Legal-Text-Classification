Ukraine (no.\u00a061333/00, 2\u00a0November 2004) the Court found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in that the quashing of a final judgment of pecuniary nature in the applicant's favour constituted a disproportionate interference with his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.
