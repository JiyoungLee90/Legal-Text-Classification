In order to decide this question, regard must be had to, among other considerations, the specific features of the proceedings in question and the manner in which the applicant\u2019s interests were actually presented and protected before the appeal court, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it and of their importance to the appellant (see, among many other authorities, Kremzow v.

The Court notes that, in general, the CCrP expressly provides for the accused\u2019s right to be present at appellate hearings at second instance, and the Court refers, in particular, to Article 91.5.25 of the CCrP in this regard (see paragraph 20 above). Article 392.2 of the CCrP appears, at first sight, to further reinforce the importance of this right by outlining circumstances where the presence of the accused at the hearing is \u201cimperative\u201d (see paragraph 21 above). Moreover, the Government have not elaborated as to how the accused\u2019s right to be present, unequivocally declared by Article 91.5.25 of the CCrP, could be ignored in a situation where the circumstances outlined in Article 392.2 did not obtain. Nor do they refer to any domestic case-law containing an interpretation of these legal provisions that would support the Government\u2019s argument. Furthermore, the CCrP expressly provides for only two exceptions to the accused\u2019s right to be present at second-instance appeal hearings (see paragraph 22 above), neither of which applied in the present case.",

The Court considers that these arguments indicate that the applicant wished to obtain a review by the Court of Appeal of the factual circumstances in which the search was conducted and a new assessment as to the admissibility and reliability of the evidence obtained. Furthermore, the applicant also complained that the court had applied the most severe punishment provided for in the relevant provision of the Criminal Code, without giving due consideration to his personal circumstances.
