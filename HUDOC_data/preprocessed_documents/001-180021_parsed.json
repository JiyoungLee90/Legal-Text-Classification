Turkey (dec.), no. 57039/00, 31 January 2002). In the present case the Court observes, however, that the applicants do not specifically allege that it was those ten members of the military who had been responsible for the killing of their relative. Indeed, they do not accuse any particular individual of the killing, but assert that it was soldiers from the Ge\u00e7imli military station who shot their relative. To that end, when the prosecutor charged the commander of the Ge\u00e7imli station with the offence of murder, the applicants Halima \u0130ncin and Haz\u0131m \u0130ncin, that is the mother and the son of the deceased, joined the criminal proceedings as interveners (see paragraph 16 above) and when the commander was acquitted, they appealed against the trial court\u2019s judgment. Thus, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that the applicants did not fail to comply with the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies by not lodging an objection against the prosecutor\u2019s decision not to prosecute the ten military personnel.",

The complaints concerning the actual killing of the applicants\u2019 relative in 1995 and the effectiveness of the investigation conducted between the date of the killing and the lodging of the official complaint by the applicants on 22 March 2005 were declared inadmissible by the Court in its partial decision of 10 November 2015 on account of the applicants\u2019 failure to comply with the six-month time-limit set out in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see \u0130ncin v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a03534/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-44, 10 November 2015). In the same decision the Court considered that the lodging of the complaint in 2005 and the subsequent developments \u2212 such as the exhumation of the body, the diligence shown by the applicants and the steps taken in the investigation \u2212 had revived the obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into the killing (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 45-47).",

The investigation must be thorough, impartial and careful (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27\u00a0September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0161-63, Series A no. 324). In that connection, the Court points out, in particular, that a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating a use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see McKerr v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, \u00a7 114, ECHR 2001III and the cases cited therein; see also Mocanu and Others v.
