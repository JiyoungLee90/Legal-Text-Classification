The last flat had been assigned to the applicant and his family on 30 October 2002. Further enforcement had been stopped because of the applicant's behaviour.

The relevant domestic law established that citizens may, in particular, be provided with housing on the basis of a tenancy agreement (see paragraphs 25 and 30 above).

His commander therefore provided him with the opportunity to take possession of the flat in accordance with the final judgment. The Court is not persuaded by the applicant's arguments that the authorities' failure to register the newly built residence by the stated time and the nature of the construction defects had prevented him from occupying and subsequently using the assigned flat. Therefore, the Court considers that the national authorities had fulfilled their obligation to provide the applicant and his family with housing by 20 February 2003.",

One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, among other things, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should, in principle, not be called into question (see Brum\u0103rescu v.

If an applicant raises an Article 8 defence to prevent eviction, it is for him to do so and for the opponent to rebut the claim. As previously held, the Court does not accept that the grant of the right to an occupier to raise an issue under Article 8 would have serious consequences for the functioning of the domestic systems or for the domestic law of landlord and tenant (see, McCann v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 54).\u201d",
