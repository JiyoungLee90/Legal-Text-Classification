The case originated in an application (no. 7096/08) against Montenegro lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Ms Slobodanka Tomašević (“the applicant”), on 21 January 2008.
The Montenegrin Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms V. Pavličić.
On 3 December 2014 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings in question was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1948 and lived in Igalo, Montenegro. On 14 June 2011 the applicant died.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
On 9 August 2004 the applicant lodged a civil claim concerning a property issue against eleven other persons with the Court of First Instance (Osnovni sud) in Herceg Novi.
On 15 March 2011 the Court of First Instance in Herceg Novi ruled partly in favour of the applicant.
On 18 March 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal with the High Court (Viši sud) in Podgorica.
On 8 November 2013 the High Court in Podgorica quashed the judgement and remitted the case back to the Court of First Instance.
On 6 July 2015 the Court of First Instance in Herceg Novi ruled against the applicant. On 3 August 2015 the applicant lodged an appeal against this judgment. The proceedings are still pending at the second instance.
