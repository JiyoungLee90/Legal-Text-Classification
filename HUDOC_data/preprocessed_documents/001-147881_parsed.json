The Court also recalls that allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence (see Tanr\u0131kulu and others v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a045907/99, 22 October 2002). Furthermore, in assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Av\u015far v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7 282, ECHR 2001VII (extracts)). Such proof may, however, follow from the co-existence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see G\u00fcler and \u00d6ngel v. Turkey, nos. 29612/05 and 30668/05, \u00a7 26, 4 October 2011, and Ireland v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, 18\u00a0January 1978, \u00a7 161, Series A no. 25). Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000VII).",

Although the applicant maintained that he had been ill-treated while in police custody, in their observations the Government stated that the police officers had had to use force because at the time of his arrest the applicant had resisted and had shot and killed a police officer. The Court observes in this connection that, according to the medical report issued on the day of his arrest, namely 18 March 2009, there were superficial grazes on the applicant\u2019s back and bruises to the frontal region of his head. These injuries support the Government\u2019s contention that the police officers had had to use force to neutralise the applicant. However, the second report, issued on 20 March 2009, revealed that the applicant had a haematoma under his left eyelid, a red-coloured bruise measuring 5 x 10 cm and swellings in his occipital region, and purple-coloured bruises on his right eye and periorbital region. It was also noted that the applicant had several bruises on his left eyebrow, on the zygoma, on both sides of his mouth, between his eyebrows, on his left arm and both wrists, and also on his penis. The doctor noted that the bruises on the applicant\u2019s wrists could have been sustained as a result of the use of handcuffs. It was further noted that the applicant had complained about shortness of breath, headaches and pain in his ribs. Consultations from the thoracic surgery, neurosurgery and internal medicine departments were requested. Consequently, on 21 March 2009 the applicant was taken to the Emergency Service of the Uluda\u011f University Hospital, where he was examined by several doctors from the radiology, general surgery, thoracic surgery and neurosurgery departments. In the final report, it was noted that there were no fractures to the applicant\u2019s body. According to the documents in the case-file, on the same day the applicant was also taken to the Bursa State Hospital, where he was examined by several doctors. The medical report prepared by the doctor in the emergency department noted that the applicant\u2019s eighth and ninth ribs were fractured and it was concluded that the applicant was suffering from post-traumatic injury and he was admitted to the emergency department for monitoring and observation. The Court considers that these new findings matched at least the applicant\u2019s allegation of having been beaten during his police custody. It further notes that the applicant remained in detention during this time and therefore reiterates that the domestic authorities were under an obligation to provide a plausible explanation for these injuries. However, the Government have failed to the so.",

In the Court\u2019s view, an additional expert opinion from the Forensic Medicine Institute on the cause and timing of the injuries on the applicant\u2019s body could have provided helpful information regarding the applicant\u2019s allegation that he had been ill-treated while in police custody. In this connection, the Court further notes that in the public prosecutor\u2019s nonprosecution decision there appears to be no mention of the medical report drawn up by the Bursa State Hospital on 21 March 2009 stating that the applicant\u2019s eighth and ninth ribs were fractured.
