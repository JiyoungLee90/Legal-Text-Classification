The conclusive argument was, in their view, that the Court of Appeal could not increase the sentence imposed because of the application in the applicant\u2019s case of the provision prohibiting reformatio in pejus (see paragraph 20 above). The requirement of fairness and the object and purpose of Article 6 (art. 6) were said to be satisfied by the manner in which the Court of Appeal had conducted its examination of the case; in particular, there was equality of arms as between the applicant and the prosecution, the Court of Appeal had before it all relevant papers for determining the case, and, as regards publicity, the full case-file was available to the public (see paragraph 18 above).",

The States Parties to the Convention have a very broad discretion in providing or excluding appeals against criminal decisions, especially in minor cases like the present one, where only a fine of 600 Swedish crowns was imposed by the City Court. (This is confirmed by Protocol No. 7, which is not yet in force) (P7).",

They can exclude any form of appeal; they can confine appeals to questions of law; or they can provide a special procedure and special conditions for the admission of an appeal. I do not see any basic difference between these alternatives and the system adopted by Sweden in the present case: if the Appeal Court is satisfied, having regard to the files and the written submissions of the parties, that the decision of the court of first instance is correct - and if it does not propose to increase the sentence -, it can reject the appeal without a further hearing. This can, at least to a certain extent, be compared with a procedure whereby an appeal requires special leave; in any event, it does not afford fewer guarantees or less protection than the other alternatives mentioned earlier. The present decision of the  could even have adverse effects. States may restrict appeals in order to avoid difficulties of the kind which arose in this case.",
