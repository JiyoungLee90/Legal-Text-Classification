After his release he was found to have sustained other bodily injuries confirmed by medical evidence. The Court considers that the injuries are consistent with the applicant\u2019s allegations, notably the haemorrhages in both eyes could arguably have resulted from the applicant being chocked by the police officers and the contusions of the right kidney and the lumbar region from his being punched and hit by them. His allegations are also supported by the applicant\u2019s photograph, taken on 28\u00a0April 2007 at a photographer\u2019s studio, which shows signs of blood effusion into both eyes.",
