They also had regard to the fact that the applicant was a habitual offender and that the offence of armed robbery with which he had been charged constituted a serious social danger. In this respect, the Court notes that the severity of the possible sentence and the applicant\u2019s criminal record are relevant elements in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. The Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001). However, taking into account the particular circumstances of the instant case, the Court considers that the severity of the likely penalty taken in conjunction with the fact that the applicant was a recidivist offender were \u201csufficient\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d to justify holding the applicant in detention for the entire pertinent period. In addition, the Court attaches certain weight to the fact that the applicant\u2019s detention under consideration consisted not of one uninterrupted period, but of two separate periods, namely first one up to his first conviction and the second one following the quashing of the trial court\u2019s judgment by the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 29 above).",

In this regard, the Court firstly notes that no significant periods of inactivity occurred on the part of the prosecution authorities and the trial court. The Court observes that the investigation was completed by the District Prosecutor within a relatively short period of time and the trial court held hearings at regular intervals. Furthermore, the Court notes that the criminal case at issue was a relatively complex one on account of the seriousness and number of charges against the applicant. A significant amount of evidence had to be examined in the course of the proceedings. In addition, the Court observes that the authorities examined the applicant\u2019s numerous applications for release on health and family grounds, having obtained relevant medical or court officers\u2019 reports. For these reasons, the Court considers that the domestic authorities handled the applicant\u2019s case with relative expedition.",

In addition, the respondent Government placed emphasis on the complexity of the case and the fact that it had been before the trial court and the Court of Appeal on two occasions.

Moreover, as is noted in the judgment, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand.
