In the result, the jury was rightly discharged from returning a verdict and a new trial was ordered. The unfortunate complainant had to give evidence of his ordeal on a second occasion.

In its judgment handed down on 16 June 2011, shortly before the present applicant commenced her jury service, the Divisional Court said that there was nothing new about the proposition that a juror may be in contempt of court. Referring to the obligation of jurors to swear an oath to \u201cgive true verdicts according to the evidence\u201d, the court described as \u201celementary\u201d the conclusion that a verdict not given by each juror conscientiously in accordance with her assessment of the evidence at trial constituted a breach of that promise. The court emphasised that the jury\u2019s deliberations, and ultimately their verdict, had to be exclusively based on the evidence given in court, a principle which applied as much to communication with the Internet as it did to discussions by members of the jury with individuals not on the jury. Information provided by the Internet was not evidence and its use by a juror exposed her to the risk of being influenced. This, the court explained, offended \u201cour long held belief that justice requires that both sides in a criminal trial should know and be able to address or answer any material (particularly material which appears adverse to them) which may influence the verdict\u201d.",

It noted that the relevant conduct was treated as contempt because it was a breach of the order made by the judge at the start of the trial instructing jurors not to undertake research into the case, but that there was no specific form of words that judges had to use. As a consequence, the scope of the criminal contempt depended on the exact wording that each judge adopted in warning the jurors at the start of the trial. Further, while the prohibition on searching for extraneous material was explained to jurors as forbidden because it was \u201ca contempt of court\u201d, the Law Commission doubted whether, from the point of view of a layperson, it was obvious what \u201ca contempt\u201d was or what the implications of this were. It considered that the message would be clearer for jurors if they were told that such conduct was a crime. Finally, the Law Commission pointed to doubt whether extraneous research by jurors was a contempt by its own nature or only because it was a breach of the directions given by the judge. This, the Law Commission said, was a further source of confusion. It continued:",

The test for contempt of court at common law was clear: it required specific intent to impede, or create a risk of prejudicing, the due administration of justice. The application, in her case, of a test which required only \u201cdeliberate disobedience of a direction by the judge\u201d and creating a risk to the due administration of justice was a separate and distinct test which, she argued, equated with a \u201cbreach-of-an-order\u201d test.

The words \u201cgo on the internet\u201d, used in the judge\u2019s direction (see paragraph\u00a011 above), were not adequately defined. She further argued that a penal warning was necessary because it was not clear which directions, if breached, could attract a criminal penalty and which would not.

The applicant, in complaining that it had formulated a new test of liability, had mischaracterised and misunderstood the domestic judgment and domestic law. In particular, the court had applied the well-established mental element required, namely an intent to impede or prejudice the due administration of justice. It had merely reformulated the law to the specific facts of the applicant\u2019s case. The nature of the order in her case was a prohibition on doing an act which was inherently and inevitably prejudicial to the fairness of the proceedings, prejudicial to the administration of justice and contrary to the jury oath or affirmation. In these circumstances, the question whether the applicant had intended to prejudice the administration of justice was indistinguishable from the question whether she had deliberately disobeyed the order of the court. Her counsel had agreed that there was no distinction between these two questions (see paragraphs 32-34 above). The approach of the court was uncontroversial: it was the approach that the Divisional Court had previously taken in Fraill (see paragraphs 50-52 above); it was supported by the Supreme Court in the applicant\u2019s case when refusing permission to appeal (see paragraph 42 above); and it was clear from the subsequent case of Davey and Beard (see paragraphs 53-54 above) that, in the applicant\u2019s case, the court had done nothing more than find that the requisite intent had been proved by reference to the particular issues in her case. Even if it were possible to formulate an academic argument that there was a distinction between proof of deliberate disobedience of the judicial order and proof of an intent to impede or prejudice the due administration of justice, the application of the former test would not violate Article 7. Liability based on disobedience of such an order was obviously foreseeable, having regard to the fact that it had a foundation in domestic case-law, including in the Fraill judgment (see paragraph 50-52 above).",

The Court\u2019s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Rohlena v. the Czech Republic [GC], no.\u00a059552/08, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2015).",

There is no dispute between the parties as to the correct test for common law contempt of court. The test required, in particular, that two elements be present: first, there had to be an act which created a \u201creal risk\u201d of prejudice to the administration of justice; and second, there had to be an intention to create that risk (see paragraphs\u00a027 and 29 above). It is true that, in its summary of the test, the Divisional Court omitted the word \u201creal\u201d from its description of the risk (see paragraph\u00a032 above). However, it subsequently held that the applicant had caused \u201cactual prejudice\u201d to the due administration of justice, and not merely a risk of such prejudice (see paragraph 37 above). It is not, therefore, arguable that the Divisional Court in her case applied a lower threshold than the test required. Further, the summary of the test in the subsequent case of Davey and Beard shows that the court in the applicant\u2019s case did not alter the nature of the risk which had to be demonstrated (see paragraph 54 above).",

In deciding that specific intent could be derived from the foreseeability of the consequences of certain actions, the Divisional Court was not replacing the specific intent test with a test of \u201cbreach of an order\u201d or with a more basic intent test. Rather, it was finding the specific intent test to be met in the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case. This approach to proof of specific intent had clear precedent (see paragraph 47 above). While it was open to the applicant\u2019s counsel to argue, as it appears that he to some extent did, that it was not appropriate to proceed in this way in her case (see paragraph 30 above), it cannot reasonably be suggested that the approach of the Divisional Court was not foreseeable, having regard to existing case-law on this question. Thus, by stating that intent could be demonstrated by the foreseeability of consequences, the court did not overstep the limits of what can be regarded as an acceptable clarification of the law.",

The Court cannot accept that the direction given by the judge, especially when taken in the context of the other information provided to the applicant by the jury officer, the notices posted around the court building and her oath or affirmation at the start of the trial (see paragraphs 8-10 above), was ambiguous. The jury members were clearly told, twice, that they were not to \u201cgo on the internet\u201d. They were told not to \u201ctry and do any research of [their] own\u201d and that, once they left the courtroom, they were not to deal with the case in any way (see paragraph 11 above). While the judge\u2019s direction was in broad terms, it is not argued that the applicant understood the direction as prohibiting any use of the Internet whatsoever. Had she done so, she could have sought clarification from the trial judge. The judge further alluded to the Fraill case (see paragraphs 50-52 above) and warned the jurors of the severe problems which arose for a juror who went on the Internet (see paragraph 11 above). The fact that no explicit penal warning was included in the direction does not affect the clarity of the instruction given by the judge. Such a warning is not required under domestic law and had the applicant wished to know further details of the sanctions applicable to a breach of the direction, she could again have sought clarification from the judge. The consequences of contempt of court by Internet research were also made clear in the notices in the jury waiting room (see paragraph 9 above). The applicant went on the Internet to conduct research into the previous conviction of the defendant in the case in which she was sitting as a juror. On any interpretation of the judge\u2019s direction, such action was clearly prohibited.",
