Moldova, no.\u00a03456/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08890, 4 October 2005). In the case of Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v.\u00a0Georgia, in which the applicants, who were public figures, were held in a cage and guarded by heavily armed men wearing black hood-like masks during the judicial review of their detention while the hearing was broadcast live throughout the country, the Court also found such treatment to have been degrading (see Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v.\u00a0Georgia, no.\u00a01704/06, \u00a7\u00a0101, 27 January 2009). It found likewise in two other cases in which applicants were kept in a cage during appeal proceedings (see Ashot Harutyunyan v.\u00a0, no. 34334/04, \u00a7\u00a7 126-129, 15 June 2010), or the entire trial (see Khodorkovskiy v. , no. 5829/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0125-126, 31\u00a0May 2011). The fact that the applicants were accused of non-violent crimes and had no previous convictions, together with their orderly behaviour and the absence of any evidence giving serious grounds for fears that they would resort to violence, abscond, or that their own safety would be at risk, were factors taken into account by the Court.",
