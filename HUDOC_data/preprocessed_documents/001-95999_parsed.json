Even if the applicant had brought a complaint against the State and obtained a decision confirming that the failure to enforce the judgment of 23 December 2003 had been unlawful in domestic terms, such an action would only have produced the same results, the only outcome being confirmation of the judgment's legal force enabling the enforcement officers to proceed with the enforcement of the judgment of 23 December 2003 (see, mutatis mutandis, Tarverdiyev v.

Accordingly, the applicant is still entitled to enforcement of that judgment. The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85). Having regard to the violation found, the Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well. It therefore considers that the Government must secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the judgment of 23\u00a0December 2003.",
