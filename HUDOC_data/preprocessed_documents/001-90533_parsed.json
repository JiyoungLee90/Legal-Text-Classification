Accordingly, the Court holds that the applicants need not in addition have sought to pursue the civil remedy relied on by the respondent Government (see, H.D. v. Poland, cited above). Moreover, a tort action would have at most resulted in an award of damages, whereas in cases of serious illtreatment by State agents an alleged breach of Article 3 cannot be remedied exclusively through the payment of compensation (see, among many other authorities, \u0130lhan v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a022277/93, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2000VII).

The Regional Prosecutor in her decision of 16 May 2001 found that in accordance with an unspecified subsequent forensic report the same injuries could have resulted from the applicants' son being struck or kicked or from his falling on to a hard surface. The Court observes that the forensic report dated 16 December 2000 was made available to it by the applicants and was not contested by the Government. It listed the injuries sustained by the applicants' son and concluded that they \u201ccould occur in the circumstances described by the victim\u201d, namely following an assault by police officers. The report did not mention the conclusions relied on by the District Prosecutor and the Court is thus unable to see how the prosecutor could refer to them. The other forensic report referred to in the Regional Prosecutor's decision suggested that the applicants' son's injuries could have also resulted from his being struck. The Court notes that the other forensic report apparently obtained by the prosecuting authorities was not produced by the Government. In addition, its conclusions and the conclusions referred to by the District Prosecutor are inconsistent with the medical report of 5 August 2000 and the forensic report of 16 December 2000. Having regard to the above, the Court considers that the Government's explanation as to the origin of the injuries of the applicants' son is deficient (see, mutatis mutandis, Corsacov v. , no.\u00a018944/02, \u00a7\u00a059, 4 April 2006).",

However, his testimony was disregarded by the District Prosecutor apparently on the ground that he had not seen the impugned incident from the start. The Court fails to see any justification for such an approach and agrees with the applicants that it was irrelevant whether the witness had seen the incident from the beginning. Moreover, by doing so the prosecuting authorities appear to give the regrettable impression that kicking and hitting a person under police control could be justified. The Court observes that the present case can be distinguished on that ground from Berli\u0144ski v. Poland (cited above) where there were no witnesses to establish whether any ill-treatment had occurred in the police van as alleged by the applicants in that case. Furthermore, in Berli\u0144ski it was established that the applicants had submitted to the arrest only when threatened with a gun and had been subsequently convicted of an assault on the police officers.",

The Government did not advance any additional argument that would allow the Court to establish that the applicants' son's conduct was of such a character as to justify recourse to the considerable physical force that, judging by the relative seriousness of the injuries, must have been employed by the police (see Dzwonkowski v. , no. 46702/99, \u00a7\u00a055, 12\u00a0April 2007).",

However, the investigation appears flawed in several respects. Firstly, the prosecutor failed to explain the origin of the applicants' son's extensive injuries despite the medical evidence. Even though the forensic reports relied on by the prosecuting authorities suggested that the injuries could have resulted from excessive use of force, they still failed to address that point and appeared to presume that all of them resulted from the conduct of the applicants' son. Secondly, the prosecutor dismissed without giving cogent reasons the evidence of D.G. which had clearly indicated that the police officers had ill-treated the applicant. Thirdly, the prosecutor failed to hear evidence from Dr D.S., who had examined the applicant shortly after his release and prepared the first medical report in the case.",
