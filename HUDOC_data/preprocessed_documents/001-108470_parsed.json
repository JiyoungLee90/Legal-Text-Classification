On 25 October 2004 the Varna District Court instructed the applicant to specify and quantify the damage sustained by him as a result of each alleged act or omission of the prison administration. This resulted in the applicant having to split his initial claim into five separate claims of BGN 10,000 (EUR 5,113) each, as follows: (1)\u00a0for poor sanitary conditions in the prison; (2) for the lack of opportunity to maintain his personal hygiene on a daily basis; (3) for poor living conditions in the cell; (4) for food of poor quality and insufficient quantity; and (5) for inadequate medical services.",

It established that the applicant had been allowed to leave his cell three times a day for forty-five minutes each time and had had to use a bucket in the cell for his toilet needs outside these periods, in front of other prisoners, which had been upsetting for him. It found that the amount of BGN 100 (EUR 51) would remedy the discomfort experienced by him. As to the remaining four claims, the court noted witnesses\u2019 statements to the effect that there had been no running water in the applicant\u2019s cell, that the cell had been damp and draughty, without a floor covering and with plaster peeling off the walls; the toilets and the canteen had been infested with rats; and the applicant had only been allowed to bathe once every two weeks. However, it held that it had not been proven that these deficiencies had caused any damage to the applicant. The court further considered irrelevant the fact that there had been rats in the toilets and in the canteen, as the applicant had not mentioned rats in his statement of claim. As to the claim concerning the medical services in prison, the District Court established that the applicant suffered from asthma and epilepsy. On the basis of his medical records, it found that he had been examined by a physician at least once a month and had been prescribed treatment. It further noted that on several occasions he had been urged to refrain from smoking but apparently he had not followed this advice. It therefore dismissed this claim as ill-founded. It also dismissed the claim concerning the quality and quantity of food, reasoning that the applicant had failed to adduce any arguments or evidence in this respect.",

It was further explained that the applicant had been sentenced to life imprisonment and was not involved in any pending proceedings.

The Court finds that this analysis had the effect of diminishing the relevance of each argument in assessing the overall conditions of detention and thus amounted to a failure to consider the cumulative effects of these conditions on the applicant, as required by the Convention (see Dougoz v. , no. 40907/98, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2001II). Such an approach could easily lead to the conclusion that none of the complaints were, in themselves, serious enough to call for compensation, even in cases where the general impact on the particular prisoner, had it been assessed in the light of the Convention case-law, would have been found to reach the threshold under Article 3 of the Convention (see\u00a0Iliev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 49).",

However, they considered that no mental distress and suffering had been proved in this respect and that, concerning the rats, their presence could not be taken into consideration, as the applicant had not mentioned them when complaining of bad conditions in general (see paragraph 9 above). The Court has previously criticised this approach of the domestic courts in a number of judgments against Bulgaria (see Iovchev, \u00a7 147, Iliev and Others, \u00a7 48, both cited above, and Radkov v.  (no. 2), no. 18382/05, \u00a7 39, 10 February 2011), remarking that it was unduly formalistic and allowed a large number of cases involving complaints of emotional distress rather than physical injury or illness to be dismissed as unsubstantiated.

He did not allege that he had been subjected to similar conditions there. A compensation action cannot therefore be ruled out as ineffective in respect of the complaint that between September 2006 and February 2009 the applicant remained in the same inadequate conditions of detention. As the Court found in Radkov (2) (cited above, \u00a7 59), the fact that no adequate redress was obtained in a previous action by the applicant does not automatically mean that another action would have been devoid of any prospect of success. The Court notes, however, that unlike Radkov (2), in the present case the applicant did bring a further action, several years after the first one. Regrettably, its outcome was even worse, as the courts found that no obligation on the State to provide better conditions existed (see\u00a0paragraphs\u00a013-14 above). Thus, after having brought two sets of proceedings involving questioning of witnesses, gathering written evidence and appeals to several levels of the courts, it cannot be considered that the applicant was required under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention to attempt a third action before the same courts and for the same purpose. The Court emphasises that the application of the exhaustion rule must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has already held that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned, but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Spasovski v. \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, no. 45150/05, \u00a7 23, 10 June 2010, with further references). Therefore, and without speculating about the possible outcome of a further action under the SMRDA, the Court considers that in the specific circumstances of this case the applicant could not be expected to have brought a third claim in respect of the remaining period of his detention in Varna Prison.",

Outside these periods, he had had to use a bucket in the cell for relieving himself. This had often happened in the presence of other inmates. He had only been able to bathe once a fortnight. Further, while the courts did not make formal findings in this respect, they noted the witnesses\u2019 statements that the canteen and the sanitary premises had been infested with rats and that the cell had been draughty and damp. These facts were not disputed by the Government. Taking into account the cumulative effects of these conditions on the applicant as well as the period of his detention, the Court considers that the distress and hardship endured by him exceeded the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and went beyond the threshold of severity under Article 3 (see Slavcho Kostov v.

In these circumstances, even accepting that the applicant\u2019s allegations of inadequate food and medical help are not supported by sufficient evidence, the Court considers that the other aspects of the conditions of his detention were serious enough to be qualified as degrading treatment.",

As already observed, remedies for conditions of detention which are of a purely compensatory nature may be regarded as effective only in respect of applicants who have been either released or placed in conditions which meet Convention standards (see\u00a0Orchowski, \u00a7 109, and Norbert Sikorski, \u00a7 116, both cited above).

While the applicant was indeed responsible for several adjournments, the bulk of the delay in his case was due to reasons beyond his control, such as the non-appearance of witnesses, experts or even judges or jurors (see paragraphs 17-25 above).",
