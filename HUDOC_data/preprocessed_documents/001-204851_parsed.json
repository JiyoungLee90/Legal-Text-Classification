He also barred the applicant from entering or residing in Bulgaria for five years. The order referred to section 42(1)(2) of the 1998 Aliens Act (hereinafter \u201cthe Aliens Act\u201d), taken in conjunction with sections 10(1)(1) and 44(1) (see paragraphs\u00a012-15 below).

The content of the proposal was classified and as such it has not been submitted by the Government.

No such particular reason exists in the present case and the issue of the applicability of Article 8 of the Convention falls therefore to be examined at the admissibility stage (see, mutatis mutandis, Denisov v.\u00a0Ukraine [GC], no.\u00a076639/11, \u00a7 93, 25 September 2018).",

Furthermore, a child born of such a relationship is ipso jure part of that \u201cfamily unit\u201d from the moment of its birth and by the very fact of it (see Kroon and Others v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1994, \u00a7 30, Series A no.\u00a0297C). Turning to the present case, although the exact duration of the applicant\u2019s relationship with Ms G.M. was disputed by the parties, the Court finds it indisputable that the applicant and Ms G.M. had lived together and that they had a child for whom they jointly cared (see paragraph 6 above). Those aspects show that the applicant and his partner were committed to each other to a sufficient degree to constitute a \u201cfamily\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. Thus, the Court is not convinced that the facts referred to by the Government suffice to disprove the applicant\u2019s claims. The applicant\u2019s relationship with his son, who was one year old at the time the applicant left Bulgaria, is also part of the \u201cfamily life\u201d the applicant enjoyed in Bulgaria prior to his departure (see, mutatis mutandis, Berrehab v. the Netherlands, 21\u00a0June 1988, \u00a7 21, Series A no. 138). Therefore, it could be concluded that the applicant had a family life in Bulgaria, under the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention.",

The Court notes that Article 8 also protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world and can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual\u2019s social identity; hence, the totality of social ties between settled migrants and the community in which they are living constitutes part of the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a08 (see Maslov v. Austria [GC], no. 1638/03, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2008). It depends on the circumstances of the particular case whether it is appropriate for the Court to focus on the \u201cfamily life\u201d rather than the \u201cprivate life\u201d aspect (see \u00dcner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2006XII). The Court takes note of the fact that the applicant arrived in Bulgaria in 2009 and was granted asylum in 2013, and that he was a partner in a company registered in Bulgaria (see paragraphs 5 and 19 above). Nevertheless, unlike in Maslov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 10-11), where the applicant had lawfully spent all or the major part of his childhood and youth in the host country, in the present case the material before the Court does not permit it to establish whether the applicant was a settled migrant who had developed social and economic connections and whose removal from Bulgaria would also amount to an interference with his right to respect for his private life. The Court will therefore focus on the examination of the possible interference with the applicant\u2019s family life only.",

It also notes at the outset that the Government submitted a letter by the Migration Directorate which stated that the authorities had accompanied the applicant to the border checkpoint in order to ensure his return to Turkey as part of the enforcement of the order for his expulsion (see paragraph 10 above). The Court is of the view that this represents an express acknowledgment by the authorities of State interference in the implementation of the expulsion order in respect of the applicant. The Court notes that the Government\u2019s assertions that the applicant had signed a form for his voluntary return and had cooperated in the enforcement of the expulsion order are not supported by copies of the relevant documents (see paragraph 10 above). Even if it is accepted that the applicant had provided such cooperation and had chosen a safe third country of return, that circumstance cannot change the fact that, according to the material in the case file and by virtue of the domestic law (see paragraph 12 above), the expulsion order in issue was immediately enforceable, upheld by the final decision of the Supreme Administrative Court of 30 May 2016 and enforced by the competent authorities (see paragraphs\u00a07 and 9 above). In addition, the five-year ban on the applicant\u2019s re-entering Bulgaria was still in force (see paragraph 7 above). In such circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the measures provided for in the enforceable expulsion order, dated 22 October 2015, as well the applicant\u2019s return to the Republic of Turkey on 24 November 2015, are to be regarded as amounting to an interference with his family life (see, mutatis mutandis, AlNashif v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 50963/99, \u00a7 115, 20 June 2002; and Lupsa\u00a0v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a010337/04, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27, ECHR 2006VII).",

In particular, in C.G. and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a042-50), the Court found, inter alia, that the domestic courts had not examined whether the executive had been able to demonstrate the existence of specific facts serving as a basis for its assessment that the applicant presented a national-security risk. The Court found, in addition, that the domestic courts had applied a formalistic approach and had left a governmental agency full and uncontrolled discretion to certify, with reference to little more than its own general statements, that an alien was a threat to national security and had to be expelled. Since such \u201ccertifications\u201d were considered to be beyond any meaningful judicial scrutiny, there was thus no safeguard against arbitrariness (see also Kaushal and Others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02834; and Grabchak, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035-40, both cited above).",

The expulsion order appeared to be the result of a purely internal assessment by the National Security Service, made on the basis of undisclosed evidence, contained in a classified proposal. Furthermore, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s application for judicial review of the expulsion order without engaging in any meaningful scrutiny of the executive\u2019s allegations, stating merely that the order in question did not breach the law as the data gathered in the administrative proceedings, in particular mentioned in the proposal (see paragraph 7 above), were sufficient to justify a conclusion that he represented a threat to national security (see paragraph 9 above).

The Court also notes that, unlike in Abulail and\u00a0Ludneva (decision cited above, \u00a7 56), referred to by the Government (see paragraph 28 above), in the present case it does not appear from the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court that the applicant\u2019s lawyer was presented with excerpts of the documents on which the decision for his expulsion was based, nor is it clear whether he was aware of the specific facts alleged against the applicant (see paragraph 9 above). The Court also observes that, as in the cases referred to in paragraph 30 above, the Supreme Administrative Court devoted no attention to questions of proportionality and did not comment on the applicant\u2019s arguments concerning his right to respect for family life (see paragraph 9 above). In this connection, the Court also notes that, unlike the expelled applicant in Abulail and Ludneva (decision cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52), in the present case the applicant did not fail to raise at the domestic level his complaint under Article 8, namely that the expulsion would interfere with his right to respect for his family life. It follows that the judicial review proceedings in the present case did not secure to the applicant the effective domestic remedy which Article 13 requires in respect of his complaints regarding the breach of his right to respect for his family and private life (see, mutatis mutandis, C.G. and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, \u00a7\u00a063; and Grabchak, \u00a7 42, both cited above).
