He further contested the decision ordering the examination before the higher courts. As the second examination was never carried out and the courts based their decisions on the first expert report, the Court doubts whether the second examination was necessary at all. Furthermore, it appears from the wording of the applicant\u2019s appeal in cassation that he contested the decision on the second examination with the aim of expediting the proceedings, rather than postponing them. It cannot therefore be said that the applicant abused his procedural rights; rather, he engaged in legitimate procedural activity in asserting his claims.

In this connection, the Court recalls that, although a party to civil proceedings cannot be blamed for using the avenues available to him under domestic law in order to protect his interests, he must bear the consequences when it leads to delays (see Malicka-Wasowska v. Poland (dec.), no.\u00a041413/98, 5 April 2001). It is therefore possible to accept that, by contesting the judgment of 14 March 2002, the applicant contributed to the delay, which was then aggravated when the applicant had to resubmit his appeal in cassation against that judgment for failure to comply with the procedural formalities.
