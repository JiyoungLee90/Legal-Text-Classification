It is clear from the above that living space per patient was grossly insufficient at the time of the visit and several patients routinely asked the staff to be transferred into the isolation/seclusion room (8 m\u00b2) to gain some private space.

The Government submitted that the applicant received adequate psychiatric treatment, based on an individual plan, by two visiting psychiatrists (present at the premises for three half-days a week) and referred to an expert report of February 2008 indicating the improvement of the applicant's mental health.

Furthermore, the feeling of inferiority and powerlessness which is typical of persons who suffer from a mental disorder calls for increased vigilance in reviewing whether the Convention has been complied with (ibid., \u00a7 47). However, unlike in Dybeku where the applicant was treated like other inmates, notwithstanding his suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia, which together with entirely inappropriate material conditions clearly had a detrimental effect on his health and well-being, the applicant in the present case shared one of the dormitories in Zenica Prison Forensic Psychiatric Annex with other psychiatric patients and received a regular psychiatric treatment. Moreover, although the general conditions in the Annex were unsatisfactory in terms of the hospital standards (as noted by the CPT), the applicant's mental health improved during his detention therein, as evidenced by a recent expert report submitted by the Government.",
