As he lived in a shared flat, the room, and hence the drugs, could have belonged to any of his flatmates. With regard to the admissibility of the evidence the Court of Appeal found that the hashish found during the search could be used as evidence against the applicant. The infringement of the applicant\u2019s basic rights with regard to the criminal proceedings concerning copyright piracy had not been so serious that the applicant\u2019s interest in respect for his home outweighed the public interest in prosecution. The Court of Appeal referred to the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraph 26 below), according to which unlawfully obtained evidence could be used in criminal proceedings as long as, after a thorough balancing of the different interests at stake, the public interest in prosecution did not have to stand back against the right to respect for his home of the person concerned and as long as that person\u2019s rights had not been violated on purpose. It reiterated the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s finding that the applicant\u2019s basic rights had been seriously infringed (see paragraph 12 above). Whether or not the search warrant had been sufficiently precise, and whether a sufficient initial suspicion for issuing a search warrant had been present or not, did not have to be determined because, even assuming that this had not been the case, such shortcomings did not render the obtained evidence unlawful. Because of the seriousness of the crime of drug possession, and the substantial amount of hashish found, the public interest in prosecution outweighed the applicant\u2019s interest in respect for his home. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s rights had not been deliberately infringed, the house search had not been arbitrary and the amount of hashish found would theoretically have justified a house search. The Court of Appeal was hence of the view that the hashish found during the search could be used as evidence against the applicant.",

The court noted that under the well-established case law of the Federal Constitutional Court (see paragraph 26 below) an unlawful house search did not automatically mean that the evidence seized during such a house search could not be used in the trial against the person concerned. Evidence might, however, be precluded if the violation of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his home had been particularly serious.

Hence, the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his home had been infringed in such a severe way that despite the seriousness of the crime of drug possession and the substantial amount of hashish found, the public interest in prosecution could not outweigh the applicant\u2019s interest in respect for his home.",

As regards the question whether the applicant had been in possession of the drugs the Regional Court relied on a statement of the applicant dated 13 March 2007 according to which the room in which the hashish had been found was solely used by himself. Furthermore, the Regional Court was of the view that the Court of Appeal\u2019s findings in its judgment of 5 September 2006 (see paragraph 15 above) on the admissibility of the hashish as the sole evidence were binding and that hence the hashish found in the applicant\u2019s flat could be used as evidence against him. Moreover, the court made it clear that even if the Court of Appeal\u2019s findings were not binding in this respect it was itself of the view that, weighing the applicant\u2019s interest in respect for his home against the public interest in prosecution, the latter prevailed and that the evidence was thus admissible.",

On 2 July 2009 the Federal Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint (file no. 2 BvR 2225/08). The decision was served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 3 August 2009. The court assessed the applicant\u2019s arguments mainly under the head of Article 13 of the Basic Law. It held that the Court of Appeal had balanced all the interests at stake in a way that was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable and that the conviction of the applicant, although exclusively based on the evidence found during the house search, did not infringe the applicant\u2019s constitutional rights.

The prohibition on the use of evidence therefore has to remain an exception (see Federal Court of Justice, no. 3 StR 181/98 of 11 November 1998). Such a prohibition is, however, imperative in the case of a serious, deliberate or arbitrary breach of procedural rules which has systematically ignored constitutional safeguards. Such a prohibition is also imperative where evidence has been obtained in violation of constitutional rights which affect the core of private life (see Federal Constitutional Court, no. 2 BvR 446/98 of 15 July 1998; no. 2 BvR 1027/02 of 12 April 2005; and no.\u00a02\u00a0BvR\u00a0954/02 of 16 March 2006).

His statement regarding his exclusive use of the room in the flat where the hashish had been found could not be regarded as evidence as it was not related to the hashish found. Lastly, he maintained that the public interest in prosecution could not outweigh his right to respect for his home as the offence had been of minor consequence for the public, and the breach of his basic rights severe. His case could therefore be compared to the case of Jalloh v. Germany ([GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7\u00a7 94-96, ECHR 2006IX).",

In doing so, they had very carefully balanced the applicant\u2019s basic rights with the public interest in law enforcement. The fact that there was no initial suspicion of a drug offence was counterbalanced by the amount of hashish found, which would have permitted the issuing of a search warrant. The domestic courts\u2019 balancing was therefore appropriate. The facts of the case could not be compared to those at issue in the case of Jalloh (cited above). Furthermore, the applicant availed himself at all stages of the proceedings of the opportunity to challenge the admission of the unlawfully obtained evidence. Lastly, the circumstances under which the hashish was found cast no doubt on its reliability or accuracy as evidence, nor were the drugs the only evidence.

As concerns the level of intrusiveness, the Court notes that the present case significantly differs from the case of Jalloh (cited above). In Jalloh the authorities subjected the applicant to a grave interference with his physical and mental integrity against his will and the evidence was therefore obtained by a measure which breached Article 3 of the Convention, one of the core rights guaranteed by the Convention (see Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a082), whereas in the present case the evidence was obtained by a measure which was in breach of domestic law, which did not breach Article 3. As regards the question whether the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy, the Court notes that it is undisputed between the parties that the evidence was found in a room within the flat used exclusively by the applicant (see paragraph 18 above). Furthermore, the amount and quality of the hashish has been determined by an expert whose findings have not been challenged by the applicant at any stage of the proceedings. Thus nothing casts any doubts on the reliability or accuracy of the evidence (contrast Layijov v. Azerbaijan, no. 22062/07, \u00a7\u00a075, 10\u00a0April 2014; Horvati\u0107 v.

It further notes that the Regional Court relied on the statement the applicant himself made in writing to the effect that he was in possession of the drugs. The Court recalls that the relevance of the existence of evidence other than the contested evidence depends on the circumstances of the case. In the present circumstances, where the substances found in the applicant\u2019s home were strong evidence, and where there was no risk of the evidence being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence was correspondingly weaker (compare Lee Davies, cited above, \u00a7 52).",

The Court notes that the national courts addressed in detail the applicant\u2019s arguments regarding the use of the evidence and thoroughly reasoned why they were of the opinion that the evidence, although obtained by an unlawful house search, could be used as evidence in the criminal proceedings at issue. They weighed the public interest in prosecuting the crime of drugs possession against the applicant\u2019s interest in respect for his home. Unlike in the case of Jalloh (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0107), where the domestic authorities considered the admittance of evidence obtained by the forcible administration of enemetics authorized by domestic law, in the present case the national courts were aware of their discretion to exclude the unlawfully obtained evidence when they considered the evidence at hand. In these circumstances, and further given that the considerable amount of hashish which had been detected (in contrast to the case of Jalloh in which only a small amount of cocaine was found) was taken into consideration by the domestic courts, their conclusion that the public interest outweighed the applicant\u2019s basic rights was carefully and thoroughly reasoned and did not disclose any appearance of arbitrariness or disproportionality.",
