More specifically, the investigators failed: to follow up on the information regarding the registration number on the perpetrator\u2019s vehicle; to question Ms A.D., who had allegedly seen Mr Dibirov in detention; to analyse data from Mr Dibirov\u2019s mobile telephone; to check the database of unidentified remains; and to investigate Officer\u2019s G.G. statement that Mr\u00a0Dibirov had been detained in Khankala. As regards Mr Isayev\u2019s case, the Court notes that the criminal proceedings were initiated after a significant delay (see paragraph 58 above), and from the beginning the investigators failed to verify information indicating that ROVD and OMON officers had been involved in the abduction (see paragraph 95 above). Despite the applicant\u2019s assertions, they failed to obtain registration logs of detainees from the Makhachkala police station (ibid.), and failed to obtain DNA samples from Mr Isayev\u2019s relatives to check those against the database of unidentified remains. The Court notes the police\u2019s manifest failure to cooperate with the investigators. Such a formalistic approach and such reluctance evidently undermined the effectiveness of the operational-search measures and the investigation as a whole (see paragraph 100 above).",

Apparently, those important actions were not taken, despite the direct orders of the investigators\u2019 superiors given on 2 October 2013 (see paragraphs 142 and 152 above). The Court observes that the OMON\u2019s persistent reluctance to comply with the investigators\u2019 requests could not justify the investigators\u2019 inaction, and should, on the contrary, have rendered the investigators more proactive. Furthermore, from the material in the Court\u2019s possession, it does not appear that the investigators analysed the telephone data from Mr\u00a0Ilyasov\u2019s mobile telephone operator, or that they obtained a DNA sample from his relatives to check against the database of unidentified remains.",

Lastly, the Government argued that the present case was the subject of well-established case-law of the Court, and therefore preparation of the case would have been relatively simple. In the remaining cases, the Government left the issue to the Court\u2019s discretion.",
