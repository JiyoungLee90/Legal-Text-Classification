That information was sent to the applicants\u2019 representative on 16 February 2011 and 30 January 2012. He did not dispute that fact nor did he provide exact date of deaths. Moreover, the Court did not receive any statement from the applicants\u2019 potential heirs or close family members expressing the wish to pursue their cases. In these circumstances, the Court concludes that it is no longer justified to continue the examination of the applications nos. 3171/10 and 47332/10 in so far as they were brought by Mr Du\u0161an Simi\u0107 and Ms Mara Lazi\u0107 within the meaning of Article\u00a037 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c) of the Convention. Furthermore, the Court finds no reasons of a general nature, as defined in Article 37 \u00a7 1 in fine, which would require the examination of these complaints by virtue of that Article (contrast Karner v. Austria, no. 40016/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-28, ECHR 2003IX). It therefore decides to strike the applications nos. 3171/10 and 47332/10 out of its list of cases in so far as they were brought by Mr Du\u0161an Simi\u0107 and Ms Mara Lazi\u0107 (see Erol Direk\u00e7i and Erg\u00fcl Direk\u00e7i v.  (dec.), no. 47826/99, 31\u00a0March 2005).",

Furthermore, it ought also to protect the authorities and other persons concerned from being under any uncertainty for a prolonged period of time. The rule also affords the prospective applicant time to consider whether to lodge an application and, if so, to decide on the specific complaints and arguments to be raised (see, for example, Worm v. , 29 August 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-V). Where the alleged violation constitutes a continuing situation against which no domestic remedy is available, such as the non-enforcement of final and enforceable domestic judgments in the present cases, the six-month period starts to run from the end of the continuing situation (see Are\u017eina v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), nos.\u00a066816/09 et al., 3 July 2012).",

The respondent State enforced the judgments under consideration in that case in cash and undertook to so enforce a number of other similar judgments (see Momi\u0107 and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 28730/06, 17\u00a0May\u00a02011). However, it should be emphasised that none of the applicants in those cases, unlike the present applicants, had accepted government bonds. The present case must therefore be distinguished from the \u010coli\u0107 and Others jurisprudence. Given further that some of the present applicants have already sold their bonds on the Stock Exchange (paragraph 10 above) and that the legal costs awarded to them have already been paid in cash, the Court considers the impugned domestic judgments to have been enforced.",

Italy (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0180 and 193, ECHR 2006V). One of the features of such redress is the amount awarded by the national authorities (see Kudi\u0107 v. , no. 28971/05, \u00a7 17, 9 December 2008). While it is true that the national authorities expressly acknowledged the breach alleged in the present case, the applicants were not able to obtain any compensation in respect of the delayed enforcement of the judgments (paragraph 8 above). Therefore, they may still claim to be victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention in relation to the period during which the judgments remained unenforced (see Dubenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a074221/01, \u00a7 36, 11 January 2005). The Court thus rejects the Government\u2019s objection.",
