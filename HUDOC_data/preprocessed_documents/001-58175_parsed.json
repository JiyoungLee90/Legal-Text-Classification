Secondly, they claimed under Article 3 of the Convention that, as a result of the unfair pension procedure, each of them had suffered severe mental stress. Thirdly, they alleged that the Government\u2019s failure to monitor their exposure to radiation while they were stationed on Christmas Island gave rise to violations of Articles 2 and\u00a03.

The Court recalls that the applicants submitted, in connection with Article 6 \u00a7 1, that the radiation levels records would not have been of use to them in the proceedings before the PAT (see paragraph 79 above). Nonetheless, the Court considers that, since these documents contained information which might have assisted the applicants in assessing radiation levels in the areas in which they were stationed during the tests, and might indeed have served to reassure them in this respect, they had an interest under Article 8 in obtaining access to them. As it has observed above (see paragraph 88), the existence of any other relevant document has not been substantiated and is thus no more than a matter of speculation. For this reason, the present case is distinguishable from that of Guerra and Others (cited in paragraph 69 above), where it was not disputed that the inhabitants of Manfredonia were at risk from the factory in question and that the State authorities had in their possession information which would have enabled the inhabitants to assess this risk and take steps to avert it.",

Whilst I agree with the majority that, in the absence of any clear evidence of the existence of relevant documentation, such a duty does not arise on the facts of the present case, which is therefore distinguishable from the Guerra and Others v. Italy (see paragraph 99 of the judgment), I consider that the State should have made available to the applicants an effective and accessible procedure allowing them to seek any relevant and appropriate information (see paragraph 101 of the judgment).
