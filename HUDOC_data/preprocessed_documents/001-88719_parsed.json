On that day he sought the withdrawal of Judge E. C. because she had taken the decisions authorising the searches of his office and apartment. He submitted that the relevant decisions were unreasoned and did not mention his status as the lawyer of an accused in the case in respect of whom the search had been ordered, which suggested that the judge had not even considered the case before signing the decision. In addition, the decision itself did not give any time-limits for making the searches, the aims of the searches or the person(s) authorised to carry them out, contrary to Article 306 CCP. Finally, the judge allegedly took the side of the prosecution, thus infringing the right to equality of arms. In an addendum, the applicant mentioned that he was about to lodge a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights about the searches and emphasised the superficial manner in which the judge had examined the investigator\u2019s request since she had failed to note the applicant\u2019s status as a legal representative. On the same date, another judge of the R\u00e2\u015fcani District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for Judge E.C. to be withdrawn.",

In addition, he had been removed as a legal representative in order to make it possible to question him as a witness. The court found, having analysed all the materials in the file, that the actions of the investigating authority, including the orders to bring in the applicant by force and his removal as his client\u2019s representative, had been lawful and well-founded.

On the other hand, his office contained case files of his clients. Having regard to the fact that the search was conducted at the applicant\u2019s law office, with the implications that such a search could have for lawyer-client confidentiality, the Court would have expected the investigating judge to have given compelling and detailed reasons for authorising this course of action and for putting in place particular measures to safeguard the privileged materials protected by professional secrecy. Moreover, before being removed from the case by the investigator, the applicant had represented a person in the criminal case in connection with which the search had been ordered. The search could thus have led to the finding of items or documents obtained by the applicant as the accused\u2019s representative, with obvious repercussions for that accused\u2019s rights guaranteed under Article 6 of the Convention. Therefore, an even higher degree of caution was required before a search could be authorised in the applicant\u2019s home and office. However, no analysis of any of these considerations was made by the investigating judge in her decisions of 26 May 2004.",
