The Committee is concerned at reports that the Investigative Committee lacks independence from the Executive branch and does not have specialized units tasked with investigating allegations of torture and illtreatment.

However, the applicant may be understood as claiming that he had not committed the offences (that is, he had not received a bribe or forged a document). In this connection, it suffices for the Court to note, in so far as the assessment of the extradition request is concerned, that the material before the Russian authorities and before the Court disclosed that there was sufficient basis for a reasonable suspicion against the applicant in relation to the allegation that he had taken a bribe and forged a document, on account of, inter alia, the incriminating statement from the person who had given the bribe. There is enough material to confirm that this suspicion was supported by an array of documentary evidence and witness statements (see paragraph 26 above).",

Russia [GC], no. 5826/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0170-71, 22\u00a0May 2012, and Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a056581/00, \u00a7\u00a085, ECHR 2006II). However, the absence of such fresh determination of the charge is not problematic under Article 6 of the Convention if it has not been unequivocally established that the defendant has waived his right to appear and to defend himself or that he intended to evade trial (see Sanader v.

Therefore, even accepting as established the fact that the trial judge refused to hear oral representations from the applicant, this shortcoming was counterbalanced, to a certain extent, by the admission of the written submissions. Thus, the omission did not entail a \u201cflagrant denial of justice\u201d within the stringent test of unfairness applicable in the extradition context. Moreover, it does not appear that the applicant articulated and substantiated his allegations under this heading before the appeal court in his extradition case, in particular with reference to the witness statements, which he submitted only to this Court (see paragraph 21 above). Similarly, the fact that many years later the judge was sanctioned by the European Union on account of unrelated proceedings in which he had issued judgments (see paragraph 71 above) is not, by itself, sufficient either, in particular given the Court\u2019s findings relating to the overall fairness of the proceedings conducted by that judge at the applicant\u2019s trial.",

In so far as the observance of Article 6 of the Convention by a Contracting State is concerned, it is not the function of this Court to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a domestic court of the Contracting State unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see Murtazaliyeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0149). In the determination of whether the proceedings were fair, this Court does not act as a court of fourth instance deciding on whether the evidence had been obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law, its admissibility or on the guilt of an applicant (ibid). It is not appropriate for this Court to rule on whether the available evidence was sufficient for an applicant\u2019s conviction and thus to substitute its own assessment of the facts and the evidence for that of the domestic courts.

Rules on nonpecuniary damage contained in Chapter 59 part 4 of the CC establish a rule similar in essence: strict liability is provided only for cases where non-pecuniary damage has been caused by the \u2018unlawful conviction, unlawful institution of criminal proceedings, unlawful application of a preventive measure in the form of placement in custody ...\u2019.

The Court has already observed that \u2018the Russian law of tort limits strict liability for unlawful detention to specific procedural forms of deprivation of liberty which include, in particular, deprivation of liberty in criminal proceedings and administrative punishment\u2019 ... The unlawful detention in the present case was imposed within extradition proceedings, not as a custodial measure within a criminal case opened in Russia. The Court is aware that, in the absence of special provisions concerning detention pending extradition, the Russian courts apply\u00a0mutatis mutandis\u00a0provisions of the CCrP which regulate custodial measures ... However, it is not certain whether they would be prepared to consider \u2018unlawful detention pending extradition\u2019 an equivalent of \u2018unlawful application of a preventive measure in the form of placement in custody\u2019, which undoubtedly gives rise to a strict liability.

The Court notes that the notion of \u2018fault\u2019 is quite vague: it includes intentional behaviour as well as various forms of negligence. Furthermore, it is unclear whether under the law the applicant had to prove the fault of the prosecutor who issued the detention order, or the fault of the prosecution authority in general for an error committed by one of their employees. The Government did not refer to any case-law or other source of law which would demonstrate that the applicant\u2019s unlawful detention would be regarded as resulting from the \u2018fault\u2019 of the authority or official involved, whatever it meant.",

The Government did not refer to other sources of law which would help in interpreting the legislative provisions at issue. Therefore, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant\u2019s claim for damages had prospects of success. Due to that uncertainty, the Court is prepared to conclude that ... that the applicant cannot be blamed for not having used that legal avenue.

More concretely, in the decision of the 3rd Section case B.T.\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 40755/16, 5\u00a0December 2017, the Court examined the general principles and applied them to the above concrete case. The application also concerned an order by the Russian authorities for the extradition of the applicant to Uzbekistan. In the case of B.T. v.\u00a0Russia the Court concluded as follows: \u201c... beyond a broad reference to illtreatment in the light of the general practice in the criminal justice system of Uzbekistan, the applicant, both at domestic level and in his submissions before the Court, failed to refer to any individual circumstances and to substantiate his fears of ill-treatment in the event of his extradition to Uzbekistan. He did not refer to any personal experience of illtreatment at the hands of the Uzbek lawenforcement authorities, neither did he allege that members of his family had been politically or religiously active or persecuted\u201d (see B.T.\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a029).

They concern the conditions of detention in SIZO4 from 7 June to 13 November 2009. The applicant \u201cnotes to the European Court that he lodged a complaint against his conditions of detention in the St Petersburg pre-trial detention facility, SIZO-4, with the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Russia on 11 November 2009\u201d (Applicant\u00b4s Observations in response to the Observations of the Government, \u00a7 58). The applicant complained \u201cof his detention in the cell with prior criminal convicted persons (recidivists), who fought with each other, with blood spilling over the cell, which posed a risk of violence towards the applicant; of the lack of responses to his written applications to the Governor of SIZO4; of him being transferred for a day to another cell and back again in order to psychologically suppress and humiliate him; and of his poor medical treatment\u201d (Applicant\u00b4s Observations, no. 59). The Russian General Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s reply no. 17-200/2009 of 29 January 2010 answers the applicant as follows: \u201cin respect of placing you in SIZO4 cells, a violation was found of Article 33 of the Federal Law requiring the separate placement of different categories of accused persons in pre-trial detention facilities\u201d (Observations n\u00ba 60).
