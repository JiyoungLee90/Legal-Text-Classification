In particular, whilst the applicant had named M.M. as a witness, the latter had confirmed to the investigators that she had not witnessed the abduction.

The applicant's son had been detained by a large group of armed individuals wearing camouflage uniforms, acting under one command and using military equipment, such as portable radios. Those individuals had driven military vehicles freely through the town at night, during curfew hours. The fact of the use of military vehicles had been proved by the statements of M.Ch., who had seen the abductors drive away, M.M.'s reference to the noise of military vehicles, A.M.'s statement that she had seen an APC and two military UAZ vehicles and the Town Court's findings concerning the APCs.

It notes at the same time that due to the application of Article 29 \u00a7 3 in the present case, the applicant's representatives submitted their observations on admissibility and merits in one set of documents. The Court thus doubts that legal drafting was necessarily time-consuming to the extent claimed by the representatives. Furthermore, the case involved little documentary evidence, in view of the Government's refusal to submit most of the case file. Hence, it is also doubtful whether research was necessary to the extent claimed by the representatives. Lastly, the Court notes that it is its standard practice to rule that awards in relation to costs and expenses are to be paid directly into the applicant's representatives' accounts (see, for example, To\u011fcu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0158; Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos.\u00a043577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a0175, ECHR 2005VII; and Imakayeva, cited above).",
