They also stated that the applicant was the defendant and thus the proceedings were not particularly significant for him, whereas they were for the plaintiff. Also, in respect of some minor shortcomings identified by the Constitutional Court, the Government referred to the Court\u2019s decision in Hor\u0148\u00e1k v.
