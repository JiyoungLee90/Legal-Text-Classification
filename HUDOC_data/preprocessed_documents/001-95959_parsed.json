The burden of proof is on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that an effective remedy was available in theory and in practice at the relevant time; that is to say, that the remedy was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see, inter alia, T. v. the  [GC], no. 24724/94, \u00a7 55, 16\u00a0December 1999).",

Turkey judgment of 16\u00a0September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, p. 1211, \u00a7 69). Further, an effective domestic remedy must form a part of the normal process of redress and cannot be of a discretionary character. The applicant must, therefore, be able to initiate the proceedings directly, without having to rely on the benevolence of a State body (see, inter alia, Lepoji\u0107 v. , no.\u00a013909/05, \u00a7\u00a053, 6\u00a0November 2007).

In any event, the applicants had only become aware of the final outcome of their civil suits upon receipt of the decisions rendered by the District Court at second instance. The applicants had further had \u201cno right under law\u201d to request directly the preliminary consideration of their claims by the Supreme Court in accordance with Article 176 of the Civil Procedure Act (see paragraph 39 above), no \u201clegal interest\u201d, as admitted by the Government themselves (see paragraph 46 above), to file a Request for the Protection of Legality with the same court, and certainly no obligation to bring a separate civil suit concerning the same underlying issue.

Bosnia and Hercegovina (dec.), no. 13628/03, 16 May 2006). With this in mind, given the power of the Serbian Constitutional Court (see paragraph 26 above, in particular Articles 7 \u00a7 1, 82 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, 83 \u00a7 1, 89 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Constitutional Court Act), as evidenced through its case-law (see paragraphs 32-34 above), as well as the competence of the Commission for Compensation (see paragraphs 26 and 35 above, in particular Articles 89 \u00a7 3 and 90 of the Constitutional Court Act quoted in paragraph 26), the Court is of the opinion that a constitutional appeal should, in principle, be considered as an effective domestic remedy within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in respect of all applications introduced as of 7 August 2008, that being the date when the Constitutional Court's first decisions on the merits of the said appeals had been published in the respondent State's Official Gazette (see paragraph 33 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, Piki\u0107 v. , no. 16552/02, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 25 and 29, 18 January 2005). In the present case, however, since all applicants had filed their applications with the Court before that date and because the issue of whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is normally determined by reference to the date when the application was lodged, the Court considers that the applicants had indeed had no obligation to exhaust this particular avenue of redress before turning to Strasbourg (see Cvetkovi\u0107 v. Serbia, no. 17271/04, \u00a7 41, 10 June 2008).",

Since these conflicts were not institutionally resolved, all this created a state of continued uncertainty, which in turn must have reduced the public's confidence in the judiciary, such confidence, clearly, being one of the essential components of a State based on the rule of law. The Court therefore, without deeming it appropriate to pronounce as to what the actual outcome of the applicants' lawsuits should have been (see, mutatis mutandis, Garcia Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999-\u00a0I), considers that the judicial uncertainty in question has in itself deprived them of a fair hearing before the District Court in Belgrade. There has consequently been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on this account (see, mutatis mutandis, Tudor Tudor v. Romania, cited above, \u00a7 32, 24 March 2009).",
