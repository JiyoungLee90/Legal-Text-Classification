The Government underlined that it was primarily for the enforcement creditor to give initiative and propose to the competent court the means of enforcement with a view to settling his claim. The Court observes that the State cannot be held liable for a situation in which the enforcement debtor has no means to satisfy his debt or, as in the instant case, for the impossibility to sell the debtor\u2019s property on public auctions. However, the Court notes that the applicant firstly sought enforcement on the debtor\u2019s bank account and movable property. Following the unsuccessful public auctions, the applicant requested an injunction prohibiting the transfer of shares held by the debtor in other companies, which motion was decided more than a year after it had been lodged. Moreover, the applicant also requested the court to order the debtor to disclose its assets. In these circumstances, the Court does not accept the Government\u2019s argument as to the applicant\u2019s inactivity in the proceedings.",
