Such investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Otherwise, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would, despite its fundamental importance, be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2000IV).",

The authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or illfounded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see, for example, Kopylov v. Russia, no. 3933/04, \u00a7 133, 29\u00a0July 2010). Thus, the mere fact that no appropriate steps were taken to reduce the risk of collusion between the alleged perpetrators amounts to a significant shortcoming in the adequacy of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 330, ECHR 2007II, and Turluyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a063638/09, \u00a7 107, 20 June 2013). Furthermore, the investigation must be independent, impartial and subject to public scrutiny (see Mesut Deniz v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 36716/07, \u00a7 52, 5 November 2013). It should result in a reasoned decision to reassure a concerned public that the rule of law had been respected (see, mutatis mutandis, Kelly and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 30054/96, \u00a7 118, 4 May 2001).",

The FSB officers, who claimed that the applicant had visible injuries at the time of his arrest, made no effort to record them or ensure the applicant\u2019s access to a medical practitioner. In such circumstances, the Court cannot accept as credible the Government\u2019s argument that the injuries in question pre-dated the applicant\u2019s arrest. The Court thus finds it established, for the purposes of this case, that he was in good health prior to being taken into custody (compare T\u00fcrkan v.
