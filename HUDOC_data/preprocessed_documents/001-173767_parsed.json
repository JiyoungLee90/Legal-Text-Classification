However, the local authorities had been faced with a very difficult policy situation, which explained the delay in enforcement. The mountainous local landscape did not leave many options for constructing a cemetery that was accessible and which complied with sanitary requirements. The municipality had discussed various options and in 2005 talks had taken place with the Yaremche forestry company on allocating land for a new cemetery. However, no suitable option had been found. The old village cemetery had become overcrowded by 1997 and the need for a new cemetery had been extremely urgent. As the applicant had been the only person to complain about the location of the new cemetery, the municipality had needed to strike a fair balance between her individual interests and the needs of the community. Moreover, in 2001 the applicant\u2019s son had died and she had obtained permission to bury him in the old cemetery in exchange for a promise not to dispute the location of the new cemetery, but she had not kept that promise. In any event, according to the information received from the Yaremche municipal authorities, no new burials had de facto been authorised at the disputed cemetery since the beginning of 2011 because of the applicant\u2019s protests and had again taken place at the old cemetery.",

Furthermore, the Court finds that the Government\u2019s submissions, which are not supported by any documentary evidence, are inconclusive. It appears from the available material that no formal policy decision has been made to prevent the use of the cemetery at issue for future burials. The Court is mindful of the fact that enforcement of the judgments in the present case necessitated putting in place a complex policy solution, which may take time. However, it has not been provided with evidence that in the present case the municipality has taken all the steps that could be reasonably expected of it to address the problem in a comprehensive and consistent manner with a view to finding an optimal and prompt solution (see, notably, paragraphs\u00a019, 21, 22-24 and\u00a02829 above).",

As can be seen from the letter of the sanitary doctor and also from various documents presented by the parties in the Dzemyuk case (\u00a7\u00a7 10 and 12-14) those sanitary regulations were based on the opinion of domestic experts that the 300-metre \u201chealth protection zone\u201d was necessary to prevent water and soil pollution.",

Similarly, in cases relating to town planning and environmental decision-making, the Court has consistently held that the margin of appreciation should be wide, given that national authorities are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs (see Buckley v. the United Kingdom, 25 September 1996, \u00a7 75, Reports 1996-IV, and Hatton and Others, cited above, \u00a7 97).",

However, in the absence of more detailed objective data concerning the actual level of nuisance, what is notable is that the applicant\u2019s subjective desire to be shielded from the psychological disturbance caused by the cemetery was in line with the requirements of nationally approved and longstanding planning regulations. In that light, the applicant may be said to have had a certain objective expectation that her subjective sensitivities would be protected. While it follows from the text of the applicable regulations that the 300-metre \u201chealth protection zone\u201d was required for sanitary reasons, as indicated in the expert opinions referred to in Dzemyuk, the reduction of psychological pressure on the residents of nearby houses could also be a factor to take into consideration. Moreover, the fact that the rule on a 300-metre health protection zone had been in force for some time, since 1977 at least, could also have influenced popular culture concerning the acceptable distance between houses and cemeteries.",
