Accordingly, an applicant must have made normal use of domestic remedies which are likely to be effective and sufficient and when a remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Kozac\u0131o\u011flu v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 2334/03, \u00a7 40, 19 February 2009).

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII).",
