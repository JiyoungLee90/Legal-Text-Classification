This money is intended to cover travel expenses to the place of residence and initial maintenance outside of the prison. The amount of savings in the fund was limited to one average monthly salary. Article 126 was amended with effect from 1 January 2012 so as to allow prisoners to place their savings in an interest-earning bank account of his or her choice. If a prisoner lacks sufficient funds on the day of his or her release, he or she may apply to the prison governor for a financial help in the amount of up to 30% of the average monthly salary (Article\u00a0166 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Code).",

Poland, no.\u00a059285/12, \u00a7\u00a039, 12 January 2016). This conclusion cannot be altered by the fact that the applicant was released from the regime twice, on 16\u00a0November 2011 and 27\u00a0March 2013. Although the prison authorities\u2019 concerns for the safety of the prison were not unreasonable (see paragraph 38 above), taking into account the cumulative effects of the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime on the applicant, the Court finds that the authorities did not provide sufficient and relevant reasons to justify the severity of the measures taken in their entirety in order to attain the legitimate aim of ensuring prison security.",

They argued that that provision did not impair the right of States to enact such laws as they deem necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The purpose of the relevant legislation was to ensure that prisoners have some necessary savings when released from prison having served their sentence. The applicant had been entitled to use half of his money and the second half had not been confiscated from him, merely saved for the future. As of 1 January 2012 the applicant had been authorised to place his savings in an interest-earning savings account of his choice but he had failed to do so. Even though such a regulation interfered with the right of prisoners to freely dispose of their money, it was not a disproportionate interference because prisoners were provided, free of charge, with food, clothing and other items and services. Without any funds upon release, prisoners would need financial help from the State for their trip back home and initial living expenses. Moreover, such regulations were in compliance with European Prison Rules which endorsed encouraging prisoners to save a part of their earnings (see\u00a0paragraph 29 above). The measure of obliging the prisoners to save money should be considered proportional to the aim pursued as it was limited to 50% of the sum received by the prisoners and the amount saved could not exceed the national average monthly salary as established by the Central Statistical Office (in December 2011 it amounted to PLN 4,015 \u2013equivalent to 950 euros (EUR)).",

However, half of the money he had received from his poor relatives had been taken away from him and placed in an account to which he did not have access while in detention. Between June 2009 and November 2011 he had received PLN 695 from his relatives but he had only been able to use only half of that money (PLN 347 \u2013 equivalent to EUR 80). The applicant considered that the State should not force poor prisoners to save, leaving them with derisory sums at their disposal.

The sums in release savings accounts were quite moderate, with the maximum amount of savings to be deposited equal to the average monthly salary as estimated by the statistical office (about EUR\u00a0950 at the material time).
