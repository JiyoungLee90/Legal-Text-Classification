Their remains were found on 19 December 2002, that is, four days later. The Court is not persuaded that in the\u00a0present case there was a distinct\u00a0long-lasting period during which the applicants sustained uncertainty, anguish and distress characteristic to the specific phenomenon of disappearances (see, by contrast, Luluyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 115; and Kukayev v. Russia, no.\u00a029361/02, \u00a7\u00a0107, 15\u00a0November 2007). Nonetheless, in order to decide whether there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in respect of the applicants, the Court deems it necessary to pay attention to the following. Ramzan and Rizvan Khadzhialiyev\u2019s corpses were dismembered and decapitated. Only some of their fragments were discovered, while the missing parts have not been found to date. For almost six years the applicants have been unable to bury the dead bodies of their loved ones in a proper manner, which in itself must have caused their profound and continuous anguish and distress. The Court thus considers in the specific circumstances of this case the moral suffering endured by the applicants has reached a dimension and character distinct from the emotional distress which may be regarded as inevitably caused to relatives of a victim of a serious human-rights violation (see, by contrast, Nesibe Haran v. Turkey, no.\u00a028299/95, \u00a7\u00a084, 6 October 2005).",

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",

However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III, p. 1020, \u00a7 64).",
