They stressed that the applicant\u2019s detention had been justified by the persistence of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences and by the gravity of the charges against him which attracted a heavy sentence. The Government further argued that there had been a risk that the applicant, if released, might obstruct the proceedings and tamper with evidence. That risk, in their submission, stemmed from the fact that there had been five defendants in the case and that on the date of the applicant\u2019s remand in custody, the investigation was still in progress and a number of suspects were in hiding. There was thus a risk of collusion if the applicant were to be released. The Government also asserted that the sentence given by the trial court, although later quashed, justified the continuation of the applicant\u2019s detention, since the severity of the likely sentence could have him tempted to go into hiding. The Government contended that there had been a risk that the defendants might exert pressure on witnesses. They submitted that according to the case file one of the defendants had attempted to intimidate a witness. Lastly, they maintained that the authorities displayed adequate diligence in dealing with the applicant\u2019s case, having regard to its complexity and the need to obtain voluminous evidence. In conclusion, the Government refrained from expressing their opinion on the merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint, having regard to the Court\u2019s case-law in similar cases.",

Until conviction, he must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continuing detention ceases to be reasonable (see McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a0543/03 , \u00a7 41, ECHR 2006-...).",

It notes however that the relevant decisions did not mention any argument capable of showing that these fears were well-founded. The Court considers that such a generally formulated risk based on the nature of the offences with which the applicant had been charged may possibly have justified his detention in the initial stages of the proceedings. Nevertheless, in the absence of other factors capable of showing that the risk relied on actually existed, the Court cannot accept those grounds as a justification for holding the applicant in custody for the entire period under consideration. Furthermore, it appears that this risk did not materialise following his release under police supervision on 6 October 2005. As regards the Government\u2019s assertion that there was a risk of exerting pressure on witnesses given the fact that one of the defendants had intimidated a witness, the Court notes that the Government have failed to produce any evidence to substantiate their contention.
