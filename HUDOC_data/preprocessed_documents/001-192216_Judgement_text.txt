The case originated in applications against the United Kingdom lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on the various dates indicated in the appended table.
Notice of the applications was given to the United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) on 21 September 2018.
A list of the applicants is set out in the appendix.
The applicants were all incarcerated at the relevant time following criminal convictions for a variety of offences. They were automatically prevented from voting, pursuant to primary legislation, in one or more of the following elections: the elections to the European Parliament on 22 May 2014; the elections to the Scottish Parliament on 5 May 2016; and the parliamentary election on 8 June 2017 (for further details see the appended table).
The relevant domestic law and practice is set out in the Court’s judgments in Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, ECHR 2005IX; and Greens and M.T. v. the United Kingdom, nos. 60041/08 and 60054/08, ECHR 2010 (extracts).
Further developments since the Greens and M.T. judgment are set out in the Court’s decision in McLean and Cole v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 12626/13 and 2522/12, 11 June 2013; in Firth and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 47784/09 and 9 others, 12 August 2014; in McHugh v. the United Kingdom, no. 51987/08 and 1,014 others, 10 February 2015; and in the Court’s decision in Millbank and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 44473/14 and 21 others, 30 June 2016).
In 2018 the respondent Government adopted a number of administrative measures, including a change in policy and guidance in relation to prisoners released on temporary licence and on home detention curfew. On 6 December 2018 the Committee of Ministers at its 1331st meeting adopted Resolution CM/ResDH(2018)467 declaring that it was satisfied with the measures adopted by the respondent Government and deciding to close the examination of the Hirst (No.2) group of cases.
The applicants complain under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention that as convicted prisoners in detention they had been subject to a blanket ban on voting in elections and had accordingly been prevented from voting in elections (see paragraph 4 above).
