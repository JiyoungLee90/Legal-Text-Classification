Firstly, Article 110A of the Criminal Code as in force at the time the application was lodged had only concerned those who had been suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and not those who were HIV-infected, as had been the case of the applicants. The provision had been amended by Law no. 4322/2015 and under the new version, a certain degree of disability could justify early release of a detainee. The applicants mentioned by the Government as having made use of that remedy had been able to do so on the basis of the amended version and according to the degree of disability of each one with the exception of the sixteenth applicant who had made use of that provision as he suffered from tuberculosis, which was explicitly mentioned in the law. Secondly, the early release scheme provided for by Article 110A could only be availed of once and the relevant procedure lasted several months; therefore, it was only natural that the applicants preferred the early release schemes based on non-medical grounds. Thirdly, Article 110A was applicable under certain conditions and did not concern those in pre-trial detention or those who were serving a sentence of more than ten years. Among the applicants, the second, fifth, twelfth and eighteenth of them were in pre-trial detention, while another ten of them were serving a sentence of more than ten years; therefore, they could not make use of that remedy even in its amended form.",

Specifically as regards the first, fourth, fifth, eighth, ninth, twelfth, fourteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth applicants the personal space available to them from December 2014 until July 2016 was 2.93 sq. m owing to the fact that wards 7 and 8 in which they were detained held fifteen\u00a0inmates during that period. In addition, at the time the applications were lodged and for a non-specified period of time, the sixth, seventh, eleventh and thirteenth applicants had at their disposal 2.32 sq. m as they were detained in ward 6 which accommodated in total nineteen detainees (for the Court\u2019s methodology in calculating the minimum personal space available to a detainee in multioccupancy accommodation for its assessment under Article 3 see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 114). As regards the second and third detainees who were detained in a cell measuring 17 sq. m. which accommodated four inmates, they had at their disposal a personal space of 4.25\u00a0sq. m.

In the Court\u2019s view, the Government, apart from some general remarks, did not adduce any detailed arguments capable of rebutting the applicants\u2019\u00a0allegations and of persuading it to reach a different conclusion than in the above-mentioned case. The measures highlighted by the Government, such as the operation of the second-chance school or the legislative measures which led to the release of detainees, were only implemented after April\u00a02015, that is to say after the present application had been lodged and when the majority of the applicants had already been released. It is further noted that in the documents adduced by the Government, the prison authorities acknowledged that the conditions of detention in the Prison Hospital had improved after 2015. In view of the above and keeping in mind that all the services and activities within a prison will be adversely affected if it is required to cater for more prisoners than it was designed to accommodate, the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s assertion, which is not supported by conclusive documentary evidence, that the applicants\u2019 wards remained unaffected by the existing overcrowding and that the conditions of detention which the applicants had been afforded complied with Convention standards.",

In those cases, the applicants complained of particular circumstances which had affected them personally as individuals and to which the prison authorities could have put an end by taking the appropriate measures. On the other hand, the Court has ruled on many occasions that when applicants claim to have been personally affected by the conditions prevailing in a prison, the remedies provided by Article 572 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and by Article 6 of the Penal Code are not effective (see among other authorities, Papakonstantinou v.\u00a0Greece, no. 50765/11, \u00a7 51, 13 November 2014).

On the contrary the conditions of detention do not figure among the grounds on which a detainee could be granted early release, nor did the Government adduce any examples of past court rulings capable of demonstrating convincingly that the lodging by the applicants of the complaints provided for by Article 497 \u00a7 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and by Laws no. 4322/2015 and 4274/2014 could have remedied their complaints under Article 3 of the Convention.
