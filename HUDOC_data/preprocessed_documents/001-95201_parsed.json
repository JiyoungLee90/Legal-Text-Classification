Moreover, one such decision on 16\u00a0July 2007 suspending the publication and distribution of G\u00fcncel (paragraph 7 above) was not based on this provision, but on a cross reference to the fact that the owner, journalists and content of G\u00fcncel\u00a0were the same as those of G\u00fcndem, whose publications had previously been suspended.
