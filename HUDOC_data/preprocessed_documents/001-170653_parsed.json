Even assuming that the applicant could reasonably consider the sense of the words \u201cthank you\u201d in the above context as meaning that the applicant could commit a violent offence, it had to be noted that the Regional Court, including Judge P., had just established that the applicant still suffered from fantasies of sexual violence and that there was at that time a high risk that he would again commit serious offences against the life and sexual self-determination of others. Assuming that Judge P. had indeed made the remark in question, his \u201cadvice\u201d had therefore constituted in substance nothing more than the application of the Regional Court\u2019s said findings to a particular case.

However, this assessment had been in line with the finding that the Regional Court, with Judge P.\u2019s participation, had reached in its judgment of 22 June 2009 \u2013 just before Judge P. had made that remark. In that judgment, the court had ordered the applicant\u2019s retrospective preventive detention in view of the high risk that the applicant would again commit criminal offences against life and sexual integrity. The remark did not, therefore, justify fears of a lack of impartiality on the part of Judge P. in the proceedings here at issue, in which the Regional Court, including Judge P., had delivered another judgment against the applicant on 3 August 2012 (more than three years later). At that time, moreover, the applicant\u2019s situation (in particular the legal situation) had changed as a result of the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 4 May 2011.",

It further notes that Judge P. made the impugned statement in the course of a confidential exchange between the judges of the Regional Court and the applicant\u2019s two defence lawyers. That discussion, which took place just after the Regional Court had delivered its first judgment ordering the applicant\u2019s retrospective preventive detention on 22\u00a0June 2009, concerned the applicant\u2019s possible future transfer to a psychiatric hospital. It appears uncontested between the parties, and the Court agrees with that interpretation, that the remark allegedly made by Judge P. within that context to the effect that the applicant\u2019s female counsel should be careful that the applicant would not visit and \u201cthank\u201d her when released was to be understood as meaning that Judge P. considered that there was a risk that the applicant would commit a serious violent or sexual offence against his lawyer (similar to the one he had been found guilty of) if released.",

In determining whether it was established in view of this alleged remark that Judge P. was personally prejudiced against the applicant (see the above-mentioned \u201csubjective test\u201d), the Court attaches decisive weight to the context in which Judge P.\u2019s statement was made. Assuming, as the national courts did, that he actually made the alleged remark, he did so immediately after the Regional Court, of which he was a member, had ordered the applicant\u2019s retrospective preventive detention as it considered that the applicant was still suffering from violent sexual fantasies and that there was a high risk that the applicant would again commit serious sexual offences, including murder for sexual gratification, if released (see paragraph 8 above). In these circumstances, Judge P.\u2019s alleged remark amounted in substance to a confirmation of the Regional Court\u2019s finding in the judgment it had just delivered. The Court therefore is not persuaded that, even assuming that the remark was made, there is sufficient evidence that Judge P. displayed hostility for personal reasons and was thus personally biased against the applicant.",

The impugned statement does not give any legitimate reason to fear that Judge\u00a0P. would not have carried out that necessary fresh assessment of the level of danger that the applicant posed on the basis of the evidence produced and arguments heard in the new proceedings.",
