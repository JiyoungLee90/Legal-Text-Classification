It appears that the hindrance in obtaining compensation for the transfer of allotment land and in letting out the land at a rent reasonably related to the value of the property, which the Court has found contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, arises from the application of a law to a specific category of citizens. Several other applications concerning the same issue are pending before the Court.
