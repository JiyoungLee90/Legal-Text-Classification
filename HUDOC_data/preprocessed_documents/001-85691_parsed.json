Russia (dec., no. 34687/02, 13\u00a0May 2004) since the Government were unable to produce any case-law showing the effectiveness of that remedy. In the present case the Government\u2019s objection was again confined to the assertion that such a claim would have been an effective remedy, without reference to any judicial practice. In this connection the Court reiterates that it is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999-V, and Mifsud v. France (dec.), no. 57220/00, \u00a7 15, ECHR 2002VIII). Furthermore, as regards the possibility of lodging a claim for inflation losses, such an action would only have produced repetitive results, namely a writ of execution which would not be enforceable because of insufficient funding of the Tank Institute. In fact, the applicant had availed himself of that remedy on one occasion but the judgment he had obtained remained without enforcement, for the same reasons as the original one. In these circumstances, the Court dismisses the Government\u2019s objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",
