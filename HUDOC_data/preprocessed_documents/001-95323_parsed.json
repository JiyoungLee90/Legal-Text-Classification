The court established that on 23\u00a0October 1995 an incident had taken place in the court building between , the applicant's father, and Mr D., as parties summoned to attend a hearing scheduled for that day. The applicant intervened in the quarrel and knocked Mr D. down. Mr D. sustained severe head injuries and a brain haemorrhage as a result of the fall and died seven days later. The applicant also hit a judge several times. He was subsequently prevented from assaulting a third person. The court found that the applicant was \u201cslightly mentally retarded\u201d and considered aggressive and a danger to the public, in particular villagers whom he had allegedly often assaulted. Two medical reports drawn up by three psychiatric experts confirmed that the applicant was mentally ill, and needed medical treatment in a specialised psychiatric hospital.",

Even if he escaped, as he did on a number of occasions, he would be brought back by the police. The applicant is still detained in a semi-open ward which he can leave only with prior authorisation from the responsible medical officer.

However, the particular circumstances of this case, and notably the reasons which the domestic courts advanced for the applicant's continued detention, put into question the continued applicability of sub-paragraph (a). In this connection, the Court observes that, contrary to the Government's contentions, the 2003 review did not make any reference to the applicant's conviction of 1998, but rather focused on his mental health with reference to the interests of the public, if released. The Court finds that by the time of the 2003 review, there was no longer a causal connection between the applicant's conviction and his detention. Indeed, it has not been disputed between the parties that the lawfulness of the applicant's detention falls to be determined on the basis of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 (e) of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Johnson v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1997, \u00a7 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VII).

Italy, 23 February 1984, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 75). Whether or not recovery from an episode of mental illness which justified a patient's confinement is complete and definitive or merely apparent cannot in all cases be measured with absolute certainty. It is the behaviour of the patient in the period spent outside the confines of the psychiatric institution which will be conclusive of this (see Johnson, cited above, \u00a7 61). A requirement of continued psychiatric supervision does not in itself justify continued detention (see Johnson, \u00a7 65)",

The query made by the trial court aimed at securing information from the police about the applicant's behaviour outside the hospital. However, the Court notes that this review did not reveal any objective sign that the applicant presented a threat or danger to the community (unlike the previous review in which the trial court referred to the 2001 incident, see paragraph 11 above). The domestic courts relied solely on the perceived fears of the villagers. There was no evidence before the court of a risk that the applicant would reoffend if released (see, a\u00a0contrario, X v. the United Kingdom, 5 November 1981, \u00a7 23, Series A no.\u00a046, where the applicant was recalled to the medical institution upon a complaint by his wife that he had threatened her). It was only the villagers' fears that stood against and prevailed over the applicant's conditional release from the hospital. The domestic court noted that the applicant had visited his village in August 2003, but did not find that he had demonstrated any hostility or aggression (see, a contrario, Van Droogenbroeck v.\u00a0Belgium, 24 June 1982, \u00a7 14, Series A no. 50, where each time the applicant was released, he yielded to impulse and committed further offences). In addition, there was no indication in the hospital's reports that the applicant was still aggressive or would present, if released, a risk to the public (see, a contrario, Hutchison Reid v. the United Kingdom, no. 50272/99, \u00a7 19, ECHR 2003IV). On the contrary, the hospital described him as cooperative, having regularly received his mild therapy (see, a contrario, Puttrus, cited above). The applicant's loud utterances (see paragraph 15 above), even though deaf and mute, cannot be regarded as decisive for restricting his freedom. The events after the 2003 review did not add anything new in this respect.",
