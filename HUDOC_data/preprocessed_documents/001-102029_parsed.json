The factual description from the indictment alleged that in November and December 1991 in Osijek, in the period when the city was being defended from the joint aggression by the YPA and the paramilitary formations of the rebel local Serbian population against the constitutional order of the Republic of Croatia, the defendants had acted contrary to Article 3 of the [Fourth] Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, as well as Article 4 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2(a), Article 5 \u00a7 3 and Article 13 \u00a7 2 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), in that the first defendant, B.G., initially as the secretary of the Secretariat for People's Defence of the Osijek Municipality and from 7 December 1991 as the commander-in-chief of the defence of the city of Osijek, the second defendant, I.K., as a commander of the special [military] squad for reconnaissance and sabotaging tasks, the third defendant, Gordana Geto\u0161Magdi\u0107, as a commander of one of the subdivisions of that squad and the fourth to seventh defendants as members of that subdivision, had participated in illegal arrests, kidnappings, inhuman treatment and killings of civilians of Serbian origin. In November and December 1991 in Osijek, they had arrested an unknown man, and bound with self-adhesive tape J.G., M.K., S.V., an unknown woman and B.G., and had taken them to the banks of the river Drava. Once there they had shot them in the head with firearms and thrown their bodies into the river. They had also taken B.L. and A.\u0160. to , where they had struck A.\u0160. all over his body, and had then taken them to the banks of the Drava, where they had shot them with firearms before throwing them into the river. They had beaten M.S., thus causing him multiple injuries, and had then tied him up with rope and killed him by throwing him from a railway bridge into the Drava. They had arrested P.L., taken him to the banks of the Drava, shot him with firearms and thrown [his body] into the river. They had arrested R.R. and taken him to 30\u00a0Dubrova\u010dka Street and then to the banks of the Drava, where they had shot him at least twice with firearms and thrown him into the river, but he had nevertheless survived; [the defendants] had thus committed the criminal offence of war crimes against the civilian population under Article 120 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.",

Thus, the grounds relied on by the national authorities cannot be said to have been stated in abstracto. These grounds were justified by the particular gravity of the specific circumstances in the case at issue, as explained by the decisions of the national authorities ordering and extending the applicant's detention, and in particular the decisions of the Supreme Court of 11 May 2007 (see paragraph 48 above) and 22 February 2008 (see paragraph 54 above), as well as the decision of the Zagreb County Court of 12 February 2008 (see paragraph 53 above).
