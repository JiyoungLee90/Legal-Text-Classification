In particular, the Court is not convinced that the requirement to expedite the (appeal) proceedings prevailed in the situation arising in the present case, that is where a penalty of administrative detention was involved. It is also noted that unlike pecuniary penalties, for instance, an unwarranted (unlawful or, a fortiori, arbitrary) and already served sentence consisting in a deprivation of liberty could not be undone by the mere fact of an eventual favourable appeal decision ...",

It is uncontested in the present case that the applicant, who had not validly waived his right of appeal, was the only party who sought to initiate appeal proceedings. He did so by way of instructing his lawyer to lodge a statement of appeal, which was done on 1 September 2014, that is to say some seven days after the delivery of the trial judgment that was being appealed against, and shortly before completing serving the sentence imposed in that judgment (compare Tsvetkova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055). It is not clear whether the appeal decision was delivered when the applicant had already been released or was about to finish his sentence. Be that as it may, acting as he did the applicant conducted himself in compliance with the domestic law that afforded him an opportunity (and time) to take cognisance of the content of the trial judgment and to put forward points of appeal within ten days. Thus, the Court finds it immaterial from the standpoint of the legal issue examined in Tsvetkova and Others that the appeal was introduced and/or examined shortly before the end of the detention period.",
