It established that the County Court had repeatedly sent summonses to the witnesses O.U. and T.N. Since the letters had been returned to the County Court by the postal service, the Court of Appeal concluded that the whereabouts of these witnesses had been unknown to the County Court. It had been lawful for the County Court to disclose their statements made during the preliminary investigation. As the County Court had disclosed the statements and examined them at its hearing, it had used these statements as evidence in compliance with the law. The Court of Appeal noted that the applicant's lawyer had failed to specify, either before the County Court or in her appeal, what information she would have wished to obtain from these witnesses. The Court of Appeal rejected the appeal in respect of the alleged lack of evidence and incompatibility of the County Court's conclusions with the factual circumstances, relying on the statements of witness K.K., given during the preliminary investigation and disclosed at the County Court's hearing, and the statements of witness R.L., given prior to the trial and confirmed by him at the hearing. The Court of Appeal noted that the County Court had rightly disregarded the statements of the accused. It also referred to the statements of U.T., given at the County Court's hearing, and to the forensic expert opinion. The court upheld the County Court's judgment in its relevant part in substance omitting, however, the element of hooliganism in the behaviour of the applicant and M.K. (Article 107 \u00a7 2 (2) of the Criminal Code).

There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence; as a general rule, paragraphs 1 and\u00a03\u00a0(d) of Article 6 require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he makes his statements or at a later stage (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III, p. 711, \u00a7 51). A conviction should not be based either solely or to a decisive extent on statements which the defence has not been able to challenge (see, among others, A.M. v.

As a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which the defendant seeks to adduce. It is not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Perna v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a048898/99, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2003V, with further references).
