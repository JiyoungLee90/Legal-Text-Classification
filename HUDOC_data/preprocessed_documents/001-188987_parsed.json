Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 103, and Satakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v. Finland [GC], no.\u00a0931/13, \u00a7 180, 27 June 2017). By standing in the parliamentary elections, M.I.-I. entered the political arena and inevitably and knowingly laid himself open to close scrutiny \u2013 scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large. For these reasons, he was required to display a greater degree of tolerance (see, among the most recent authorities, Genner v. Austria, no. 55495/08, \u00a7 35, 12 January 2016).",

According to the Cluj-Napoca Court of First Instance, those statements had harmed M.I.-I.\u2019s reputation and dignity and should not have been made public via the media, especially because they referred to private matters (see paragraph\u00a010 of the judgment). Furthermore, the court took into consideration the harmful effect that the distribution by third parties of electoral leaflets, reproducing the content of the applicant\u2019s article, had had on M.I.-I.\u2019s reputation (see paragraph 11). However \u2013 and this is crucial for our dissent \u2013 the domestic courts failed, in our view, to undertake a balancing exercise between M. I.-I.\u2019s reputation and the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s \ncase-law.

The statements in the article therefore concerned a matter of public interest for the local community, even if some of them might appear harsh or far-fetched. As a general rule, the Court considers that opinions and information pertinent to elections which are disseminated during an electoral campaign should be considered as forming part of a debate on questions of public interest, unless proof to the contrary is offered. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, in respect of matters of public interest restrictions on freedom of expression should be interpreted narrowly (see, by way of example, Ko\u015b\u0107 v. Poland, no. 34598/12, \u00a7 38, 1 June 2017).",

France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7\u00a7 155-157, ECHR\u00a02015). While it is true that some of the applicant\u2019s statements, such as those concerning M.I.-I.\u2019s alleged imposture and propensity to make immoral compromises, could be considered statements which lacked a sufficient factual basis, the thrust of the applicant\u2019s article was to cast doubt on the suitability of a local politician for public office. Admittedly, the applicant\u2019s article and, in particular, the expressions used, could be considered as polemical, involving at least a certain degree of exaggeration. The Court, however, has stated that persons taking part in a public debate on a matter of general concern are allowed to have recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation, or in other words to make somewhat immoderate statements (see, mutatis mutandis, Do Carmo de Portugal e Castro C\u00e2mara v.\u00a0Portugal, no. 53139/11, \u00a7 43, 4 October 2016), and the instant case is about exactly that. We are of the view that the said expressions do not amount to a gratuitous personal attack because the author supported them with an objective explanation, namely the existence, at the time of the article, of an actual commercial dispute before the Arbitration Tribunal concerning M.I.-I.\u2019s alleged refusal to repay a loan (see paragraph 10 of the judgment). Moreover, the Court has also held that in the field of political debate, political invective often spills over into the personal sphere; such are the hazards of politics and the free debate of ideas, which are the guarantees of a democratic society (see, among the most recent authorities, Lykin v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 19382/08, \u00a7 29, 12 January 2017).",

Although the applicant has not shown what his financial situation was at the time and whether or not he struggled to pay that amount, we are of the view that, in the circumstances, the sanction imposed was capable of having a \u201cchilling\u201d, dissuasive effect on the applicant\u2019s exercise of his right to freedom of expression (see, for instance, Lombardo and Others v. Malta, no. 7333/06, \u00a7 61, 24 April 2007, and Ghiulfer Predescu v. Romania, no. 29751/09, \u00a7 61, 27 June 2017).",
