Whatever the conditions attached to specific grants of permission, stationing a residential caravan here would detract significantly from the quiet rural character and appearance of the site.

The government was concerned that this guidance had not been taken up. ACERT research (see below) had shown that 24% of local authorities (96) had no policy at all on Gypsy sites and that many in the process of reviewing their plans at the time of the survey did not feel it necessary to include policies on Gypsy provision. It was emphasised that it was important to include consideration of Gypsy needs at an early stage in drawing up structure and development plans and that detailed policies should be provided. Compliance with this guidance was essential in fulfilling the Government's objective that Gypsies should seek to provide their own accommodation, applying for planning permission like everyone else. It was necessary, therefore, that adequate Gypsy site provision be made in development plans to facilitate this process. ",

Notwithstanding the objectives of planning policy that local authorities make provision for Gypsies, most local authorities did not identify any areas of land as suitable for potential development by Gypsies and reached planning decisions on the basis of land-use criteria in the particular case. It was therefore not surprising that most Gypsies made retrospective applications and that they had little success in identifying land on which local authorities would permit development.

In 1991, the last years in which the success of application rates was evaluated, it was ascertained that 90 per cent of applications for planning permission by Gypsies were denied. In contrast, 80 per cent of all planning applications were granted during the same period. It is to be noted that, as a category, Gypsy planning applications are relatively unique in so far as they typically request permission to park caravans in areas or sites which are subject to restriction by local planning authorities. As such, virtually all Gypsy planning applications are highly contentious. Nonetheless, the fact remains that there is inadequate provision or availability of authorised halting sites (private or public), which the high rate of denial of planning permission only exacerbates. Moreover, there are indications that the situation has deteriorated since 1994. ...

Because planning inspectors visit the site, hear the arguments on all sides and allow the examination of witnesses, they are better placed than the Court to weigh the arguments. Hence, as the Court observed in Buckley (judgment cited above, p. 1292, \u00a7 75 in fine), \u201c[i]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation\u201d, although it remains open to the Court to conclude that there has been a manifest error of appreciation by the national authorities. In these circumstances, the procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has, when fixing the regulatory framework, remained within its margin of appreciation. In particular, the Court must examine whether the decision-making process leading to measures of interference was fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8 (see Buckley, cited above, pp.\u00a01292-93, \u00a7 76).",

All disclose elements of hardship and pressure on a vulnerable group within the community. While complaints about the planning and enforcement measures imposed on a Gypsy family who occupied their own land without planning permission have a precedent in Buckley v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 25 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV) which concluded in a finding of no violation, we consider that this cannot bind the Court, whose first task is to implement effectively the Convention system for the protection of human rights. We must pay attention to the changing conditions in Contracting States and give recognition to any emerging consensus in Europe as to the standards to be achieved. We would note that the Buckley case was decided four years ago by a Chamber of the Court prior to the reforms instituted by Protocol No. 11. Its finding of no violation was reached by six votes to three. This Court, constituted as a Grand Chamber of seventeen judges, has the duty to review the approach adopted in the Buckley case in the light of current conditions and the arguments put forward by the parties and, if necessary, to adapt that approach to give practical effect to the rights guaranteed under the Convention.",

We also agree with the majority that there has been an interference with the enjoyment by the applicant of these rights under Article 8 of the Convention.

We accept that the examination of planning objections to the particular use of a site is not a role for which this Court is well suited (see paragraph 92 of the judgment). Where town and country planning is concerned, the Court has previously noted that this involves the exercise of discretionary judgment in the implementation of policies adopted in the interest of the community (see Buckley, cited above, p. 1292, \u00a7 75, and Bryan v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-A, p. 18, \u00a7 47). It is indeed not for us to substitute our own view of what would be the best policy in the planning sphere or the most appropriate individual measure in planning cases, which involve a multitude of local factors.

                        "content": "In Buckley (judgment cited above, p. 1292, \u00a7 75) it was stated that in principle national authorities, for the above reasons, enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in the choice and implementation of planning policies. However, in our view, this statement cannot apply automatically to any case which involves the planning sphere. The Convention has always to be interpreted and applied in the light of current circumstances (see Cossey v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 184, p. 17, \u00a7 42). There is an emerging consensus amongst the member States of the Council of Europe recognising the special needs of minorities and an obligation to protect their security, identity and lifestyle (see paragraphs 55-67 of the judgment, in particular the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities), not only for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of the minorities themselves but also in order to preserve a cultural diversity of value to the whole community. This consensus includes a recognition that the protection of the rights of minorities, such as Gypsies, requires not only that Contracting States refrain from policies or practices which discriminate against them but also that, where necessary, they should take positive steps to improve their situation through, for example, legislation or specific programmes. We cannot therefore agree with the \nmajority's assertion that the consensus is not sufficiently concrete or with their conclusion that the complexity of the competing interests renders the Court's role a strictly supervisory one (see paragraphs 93-94 of the judgment). In our view, this does not reflect the clearly recognised need of Gypsies for protection of the effective enjoyment of their rights and perpetuates their vulnerability as a minority whose needs and values differ from those of the general community. The impact of planning and enforcement measures on the enjoyment by a Gypsy of the right to respect for his or her home, private and family life therefore has a dimension beyond environmental concerns. Having regard to the potential seriousness of an interference which prohibits a Gypsy from pursuing his or her lifestyle at a particular location, we consider that, where the planning authorities have not made any finding that there is available to the Gypsy any alternative, lawful site to which he or she can reasonably be expected to move, there must exist compelling reasons for the measures concerned.

Moved by considerations of family health and the education of the children, the applicant took the step of buying land on which to station her caravans with security. However, planning permission for this was refused and they were required to leave. The applicant was fined twice and left her land. She returned, however, as they had again been moved on constantly from place to place. She and her family remain on their land subject to the threat of further enforcement measures.

It is apparent however that, notwithstanding the statistics relied on by the Government (see paragraph 53 of the judgment), there was still a significant shortfall of official, lawful sites available for Gypsies in the country as a whole and that it could not be taken for granted that vacancies existed or were available elsewhere. It is also apparent that the legislation and planning policies which have been introduced over the last half century have drastically reduced the land on which Gypsies may station their caravans lawfully while travelling. Following the latest legislation, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, unauthorised campers \u2013 persons who station a caravan on the highway, on occupied land without the owner's consent or on any other unoccupied land \u2013 commit a criminal offence if they fail to comply with directions to move on.",

Nor does the fact that she has shown an intention to settle on land on a long-term basis detract from the seriousness of the interference. The pressure on the historic nomadic lifestyle of Gypsies from the legislation passed from 1960 onwards has had the effect of inducing many Gypsies to adopt the solution of finding a secure, long-term base for their caravans on their own land, while retaining the ability to travel seasonally or from time to time. Indeed, it may be noted that the official policy for some decades has been to encourage Gypsies to find their own private sites (see paragraphs 38-40 and 46 of the judgment).",

These indicated that there was a general presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt, that Gypsy sites were not regarded as appropriate developments in the Green Belt and that very special circumstances would be required to justify such an inappropriate development. Having regard to the fact that in this case it was accepted that no other official sites were available to the applicant to station her caravans and that she had worked to improve and screen the site, we consider that the burden placed on the applicant to prove very special circumstances is extremely high, if not insuperable.

There was no indication in the planning procedures that the applicant had anywhere else to which she could reasonably be expected to move her caravans. The local authority had been found in breach of their duty to make adequate provision for Gypsies in the area in 1985 and had been under a direction from the Secretary of State to comply with their statutory duty, without any concrete improvement of the situation resulting since. In these circumstances, we find that the planning and enforcement measures exceeded the margin of appreciation accorded to the domestic authorities and were disproportionate to the legitimate aim of environmental protection.

The long-term failure of local authorities to make effective provision for Gypsies in their planning policies is evident from the history of implementation of measures concerning Gypsy sites, both public and private (see paragraphs 36-37, 46 and 49 of the judgment). Recognition has been given domestically to the difficulties of the Gypsies' situation through the \u201ctoleration\u201d of some unlawful sites and the sensitivity urged on local authorities in the exercise of their \u201cDraconic\u201d enforcement powers (see paragraphs 47-48 of the judgment). This indicates that the government is already well aware that the legislative and policy framework does not provide in practice for the needs of the Gypsy minority and that its policy of leaving it to local authorities to make provision for Gypsies has been of limited effectiveness (see paragraphs 49-52 of the judgment). The complexities of the problem have been adverted to above and it is not for us to impose any particular solution on the United Kingdom. However, it is in our opinion disproportionate to take steps to evict a Gypsy family from their home on their own land in circumstances where there has not been shown to be any other lawful, alternative site reasonably open to them (see, mutatis mutandis, Buckley, cited above, p. 1281, \u00a7 26, and p. 1294, \u00a7 81, where the problems of vandalism alleged to exist on the official site 700 metres from the applicant's land did not appear to pose any specific threat to her or her family's health or security). It would accordingly be for the authorities to adopt such measures as they consider appropriate to ensure that the planning system affords effective respect for the home, private life and family life of Gypsies such as the applicant.",

Nor are they able to use such private residential sites for seasonal or temporary transit. The planning authorities themselves recognise that the only practicable options open to Gypsies are local authority-owned sites or privately owned Gypsy sites. It is not a question of Gypsies imposing particular preferences as to location and facilities without realistic reference to their own resources (see paragraph 112 of the judgment). The options open to them are, as in this case, severely limited, if they exist at all. ",

In this case, the applicant had a home, in her caravan on her land, but was being prevented from settling there. Furthermore, it is not the Court's case-law that a right to be provided with a home is totally outside the ambit of Article 8. The Court has accepted that there may be circumstances where the authorities' refusal to take steps to assist in housing problems could disclose a problem under Article 8 \u2013 see, for example, Marzari, cited above, where the Court held that a refusal of the authorities to provide housing assistance to an individual suffering from a serious illness might in certain circumstances raise an issue because of the impact of such refusal on the private life of the individual. Obligations on the State arise therefore where there is a direct and immediate link between the measures sought by an applicant and the latter's private life (see Botta v. Italy, judgment of 24 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 422, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34).",

This approach ignores the fact, earlier acknowledged by the majority, that in this case the applicant's lifestyle as a Gypsy widens the scope to Article 8, which would not necessarily be the case for a person who lives in conventional housing, the supply of which is subject to fewer constraints. The situations would not be likely to be analogous. On the contrary, discrimination may arise where States, without objective and reasonable justification, fail to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different (see Thlimmenos v.\u00a0Greece, no. 34369/97, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2000-IV).",

United Kingdom legislation and policies in this area have long recognised the objective of providing for Gypsies' special needs. The homeless have a right under domestic legislation to be provided with accommodation (see paragraph 54 of the judgment). Our view that Article 8 of the Convention imposes a positive obligation on the authorities to ensure that Gypsies have a practical and effective opportunity to enjoy their right to respect for their home, and their private and family life, in accordance with their traditional lifestyle, is not a startling innovation.
