In this respect it noted, firstly, that the divorce had come through in 1997 and secondly, that the parties had separated on 22 September 1995. The court found that it had been clear from the parties\u2019 pleadings and their oral evidence before it that separation had actually taken place on 22\u00a0September 1995. It held that the court could not amend the statement of claim ex officio, as suggested by the applicant, since the date of separation was the crucial time for the calculation of the increase in property and all the evidence provided by the parties\u2019 valuation experts had taken as the time of termination the date when the parties had separated, namely, 22\u00a0September 1995. Furthermore, no evidence had been put before the court with regard to any other date of separation. The court also noted that it had pointed out this issue to the parties in good time so if the applicant had so wished he had had the time to file an application to amend his statement of claim. However, he did not file such an application. Finally, the court dismissed the respondent\u2019s counter-claim as being unsubstantiated.",

It noted that this argument, as stated in the grounds of appeal, had been vague and unsubstantiated and that as a result the court had had to verify all the minutes of the evidence taken. In this respect the court observed that it had been clear from the minutes that both parties had stated, when asked during oral evidence, that they had separated in September\u00a01995. The court observed in this connection that the evidence given by the parties themselves as to when separation occurred was a significant element in determining the time of separation, especially when, as in the present application, the parties agreed.",

Although the proceedings had been long and slow, this had been exclusively due to the parties\u2019 conduct. In this connection, the court noted, inter alia, that the parties had been tardy in the filing of their pleadings, had filed a number of interim applications and that the trial dates had been set on dates to facilitate the lawyers\u2019 attendance. Furthermore, extensive evidence had been put before the court. The Family Court of Appeal therefore found that the applicant\u2019s allegations in this respect had been wrong and unfair. Finally, it observed that the applicant\u2019s claims before it as to the consequences of the length of the proceedings, in particular, that \u201cif the trial had been conducted within a reasonable time the applicant would have had access to elements which would have helped him with his application\u201d, had been vague.",

In this connection, the Court recalls that the domestic courts retain an obligation to ensure compliance with the guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, for example, Scopelliti v. Italy 23 November 1993, \u00a7 25, Series A no.\u00a0278) and that this provision imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial system in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see, for example, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi\u00a0v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a025444/94, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 1999II; Frydlender, \u00a7 45, cited above; and K\u00f6nig v. Germany, 28 June 1978, \u00a7\u00a0100, Series A no. 27). Even in legal systems applying the principle that the procedural initiative lies with the parties, the latter\u2019s attitude does not absolve the courts from the obligation to ensure the expeditious trial required by Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 (see Pafitis and Others v. Greece, 26 February 1998, \u00a7\u00a093, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I).

For similar reasons, the applicant does not have an \u201carguable claim\u201d for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention, and the latter provision is therefore inapplicable in the present case (see, Ellersiek v.

Both parties, when giving oral evidence before the court, had stated that they had separated then. It therefore rejected the applicant\u2019s arguments in this respect and upheld the first instance judgment (see paragraph 44 above). In that judgment the first instance court had noted that the applicant had never filed an application to amend his statement of claim in this respect and that all the evidence that had been submitted by the parties\u2019 valuation experts had been based on 22 September 1995 as the date of separation. Although the applicant had suggested that the court amend the statement of claim ex officio this could not be done since the date of separation was the crucial time for the calculation of the increase in property and all the evidence provided by the parties\u2019 valuation experts had taken as the time of termination the date when the parties had separated. No evidence had been submitted with regard to any other date of separation (see paragraph 42 above).",
