Any other interpretation, which allowed circumstances that had occurred after the final domestic decision to be taken into account, would run counter to the rationale underlying the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, namely that a Contracting State was answerable only for alleged violations after having had an opportunity to put things right through its own legal system.

However, as Article 8 also protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world and can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual\u2019s social identity, it must be accepted that the totality of social ties between settled migrants and the community in which they are living constitutes part of the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8.

However, their decisions in this field must, in so far as they may interfere with a right protected under paragraph 1 of Article 8, be in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society, that is to say justified by a pressing social need and, in particular, proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see Dalia v.

While a number of Contracting States have enacted legislation or adopted policy rules to the effect that long-term immigrants who were born in those States or who arrived there during early childhood cannot be expelled on the basis of their criminal record (see paragraph 39 above), such an absolute right not to be expelled cannot, however, be derived from Article 8 of the Convention, couched, as paragraph 2 of that provision is, in terms which clearly allow for exceptions to be made to the general rights guaranteed in the first paragraph.",

France, no. 52206/99, \u00a7 31, 15 July 2003). Indeed, the rationale behind making the duration of a person\u2019s stay in the host country one of the elements to be taken into account lies in the assumption that the longer a person has been residing in a particular country the stronger his or her ties with that country and the weaker the ties with the country of his or her nationality will be.

Thus, the State\u2019s margin of appreciation goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court (see, mutatis mutandis, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Colas Est and Others v. France, no. 37971/97, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2002-III). The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether an expulsion measure is reconcilable with Article 8.",

The one violent offence consisted in pushing, kicking and bruising another juvenile.

The Court\u2019s case-law under Article 8 has given consideration to the obligation to have regard to the best interests of the child in various contexts (for instance in the field of childcare; see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7 148, ECHR 2000VIII), including the expulsion of foreigners (see \u00dcner, cited above, \u00a7 58). In \u00dcner the Court had to consider the position of children as family members of the person to be expelled. It underlined that the best interests and well-being of the children, in particular the seriousness of the difficulties which any children of the applicant were likely to encounter in the country to which the applicant was to be expelled, was a criterion to be taken into account when assessing whether an expulsion measure was necessary in a democratic society. The Court considers that the obligation to have regard to the best interests of the child also applies if the person to be expelled is himself or herself a minor, or if \u2013 as in the present case \u2013 the reason for the expulsion lies in offences committed when a minor. In this connection, the Court observes that European Union law also provides for particular protection of minors against expulsion (see paragraph 41 above, Article 28 \u00a7 3 (b) of Directive 2004/38/EC). Moreover, the obligation to have regard to the best interests of the child is enshrined in Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (see paragraph 36 above).",

The consideration given to the proportionality of the measure must also embrace other factors, including the possibility open to the applicant of requesting \u2013 after a certain amount of time has elapsed \u2013 that the authorities reverse their decision. He would then be able to argue that he has not committed any further criminal offences in his current country of residence. He would also be able to argue that , of which he is a national, is now a member of the European Union. These two factors combined provide the applicant with a possibility that he did not have before. Having regard to the requirement of proportionality which must also be considered alongside the margin of appreciation afforded to States in a sphere in which the public expects decisions that safeguard individual rights but also the legitimate rights of society, I incline to the conclusion that there has not been a violation.",
