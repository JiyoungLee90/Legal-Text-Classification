Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a068416/01, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, ECHR 2005-II). Thus, the questions of personal presence, the form of the proceedings \u2013 oral or written \u2013 and legal representation are interlinked and must be analysed in the broader context of the \u201cfair trial\u201d guarantee of Article 6 of the Convention. The Court should establish whether the applicant, a party to the civil proceedings, had been given a reasonable opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations made or evidence adduced by the other party and to present his case under conditions that did not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent (see Siwiec v.\u00a0Poland, no. 28095/08, \u00a7\u00a047, 3 July 2012; Larin v. Russia, no. 15034/02, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, 20 May 2010; Steck-Risch and Others v. Liechtenstein, no.\u00a063151/00, \u00a7 54, 19 May 2005; Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 and Others v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a035376/97, \u00a7 39, 3 March 2000; and Dombo Beheer B.V. v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, 27 October 1993, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a0274). From the Convention standpoint, an applicant does not need to show that his absence from a hearing resulted in actual prejudice or affected the outcome of the proceedings, for such a requirement would deprive the guarantees of Article\u00a06 of their substance (see P., C. and S. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a056547/00, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2002VI, and Artico v. Italy, 13\u00a0May 1980, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 37). Finally, the Court reiterates that, in determining issues of fairness of proceedings for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention, it must consider the proceedings as a whole, including the decision of the appellate court (see C.G. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a043373/98, \u00a7 35, 19\u00a0December 2001).",

Nevertheless, the obligation under this Article to hold a hearing is not an absolute one. An oral hearing may not be necessary due to the exceptional circumstances of the case, for example when it raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties\u2019 written observations (see Koottummel v. Austria, no. 49616/06, \u00a7\u00a019, 10 December 2009; Pursiheimo v. Finland (dec.), no. 57795/00, 25\u00a0November 2003; D\u00f6ry v.

Article\u00a06 of the Convention allows States to organise their legal systems in a manner which facilitates expeditious and efficient judicial proceedings (see Boddaert v. Belgium, 12 October 1992, \u00a7\u00a039, Series A no. 235-D), including provision for the possibility of issuing default judgments. However, this may not be done at the expense of other procedural guarantees (see, among many other authorities, Dombo Beheer B.V., cited above, \u00a7 33, and Ankerl v.\u00a0Switzerland, 23 October 1996, \u00a7 38, Reports 1996V). Also, provided that an oral hearing has been held at first instance, a less strict standard applies to the appellate level, at which the absence of such a hearing may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue. Thus, leavetoappeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, although the appellant was not given an opportunity of being heard in person by the appeal or cassation court (see Miller v. Sweden, no.\u00a055853/00, \u00a7 30, 8 February 2005).",

However, the general concept of a fair trial, encompassing the fundamental principle that proceedings should be adversarial (see RuizMateos v. Spain, 23 June 1993, \u00a7 63, Series A no.\u00a0262), requires that the person against whom proceedings have been initiated should be informed of this fact (see Dilipak and Karakaya v.

Whenever an oral hearing is to be held, the parties have the right to attend it and to make oral submissions, choose another way of participating in the proceedings, for example by appointing a representative, or ask for an adjournment. For the effective exercise of these rights, the parties must be informed of the date and place of the hearing sufficiently in advance to have adequate time to make arrangements to attend it, to retain and instruct a representative, or to inform the court of their decision not to attend.

Whereas all of those cases concerned the same Convention issue, namely the applicant\u2019s right to know in advance about the hearing in his case so as to be able to attend it, some of them featured a slight variation in the underlying factual circumstances. Accordingly, before analysing the present cases, the Court considers it useful to set out the way in which it analyses an alleged violation of the right to a fair trial, as it has emerged in its case-law in respect of this type of case.",

France, no. 18851/07, \u00a7\u00a042, 12\u00a0April 2012), such as reliability of the local postal service, the location of the parties, and the availability of technical equipment. Nor can the Court assess in abstracto the effects that any particular means of notification may have had on the parties\u2019 right to effective participation in their civil dispute (see Zavodnik v. Slovenia, no. 53723/13, \u00a7\u00a7 73-74, 21\u00a0May 2015). The Court\u2019s role in such cases is therefore confined to ascertaining whether the effects of the implementation and interpretation of procedural rules were compatible with the Convention (see Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Sotiris and Nikos Koutras Attee v. Greece, no.\u00a039442/98, \u00a7\u00a017, ECHR 2000XII).",

The Code of Civil Procedure does not restrict the courts\u2019 choice to a particular means of notification as long as it provides for proof of receipt. This means that whichever specific method is chosen to notify the parties, domestic courts should normally be in possession of evidence confirming receipt of notification by the addressee (see paragraph 17 above, and Zemlyachenko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 23866/06, \u00a7 22, 22 January 2013; Zelenkov v. Russia, no.\u00a029992/05, \u00a7 25, 18 April 2013; and Litvinova, cited above, \u00a7 16). This evidence should enable the domestic courts to ascertain whether the judicial summonses had reached the parties sufficiently in advance and, should this not be the case, adjourn the hearing. The Court has found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention in many Russian cases where domestic courts did not check whether or not proof of receipt had been obtained and confined their analysis to a general observation that the party had been \u201cduly notified\u201d, unsupported by any evidence of delivery (see, in addition to the cases cited in paragraph 34 above, Vorobyev v. Russia, no. 15722/05, \u00a7\u00a023, 9 October 2012; Puzyrevskiy v. Russia, no. 41603/05, \u00a7 20, 9 October 2012; Sazonov v. Russia, no. 1385/04, \u00a7 24, 16 October 2008; and Zaytseva v. Russia, no. 11583/05, \u00a7 26, 26 November 2009). It follows that domestic courts have a duty to examine the proof of receipt which may or may not be in their possession, and to record their findings in the text of the judgment. The manner in which the courts have examined this issue is the focal point of the Court\u2019s inquiry in similar cases (see Kolegovy, cited above, \u00a7 41; \u00d6v\u00fc\u015f v. Turkey, no. 42981/04, \u00a7 49, 13 October 2009; and Nikoghosyan and Melkonyan v. Armenia, nos. 11724/04 and 13350/04, \u00a7\u00a039, 6 December 2007).",

Spain (dec.), no 43555/98, 29 August 2000, and Sevillano Gonz\u00e1lez v. Spain (dec.), no 41776/98, 2 February 1999), provided that such parties had knowledge of the civil action brought against them (see Dilipak and Karakaya, cited above, \u00a7 77). If the party has stated its preference for a method of notification that does not provide for tangible proof of receipt, the court will be unable to ascertain whether the litigant has been duly apprised of the hearing, or to inform him about an adjournment of his case if such a decision is taken. The domestic courts are therefore expected to ascertain whether the litigant has expressly consented to that particular means of communication, and whether any updates to contact details have been taken into account. Their findings on this matter will enable the Court to ascertain whether or not the loss or delay in receipt of the notification was attributable to the litigant\u2019s own lack of diligence.",

The analysis that the Court expects to find in domestic decisions must go beyond a reference to a dispatch of judicial summonses, and must make the most of the available evidence in order to ascertain whether the absent litigant was in fact informed of the upcoming hearing sufficiently in advance (see A\u017edaji\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 70, and, mutatis mutandis, Gryaznov v. Russia, no.\u00a019673/03, \u00a7 50, 12 June 2012). The answer to this question shall enable the courts to determine whether the hearing must be adjourned pending due notification (see Zemlyachenko, cited above, \u00a7 22, and Kokurkhayev v. Russia, no. 46356/09, \u00a7 31, 13 December 2011). The courts cannot conclude that the absent litigant had waived the right to personal attendance without ascertaining whether he or she had been made aware of the very existence of that right and, therefore, of the hearing in question (see Dilipak and Karakaya, cited above, \u00a7\u00a087). Lastly, the Court reiterates that whenever the domestic courts examine the issue of timely notification of the absent litigant, they are expected to attach special importance and give full effect to the right to present his or her case effectively before the court without a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his or her opponent. It will then fall to the Court to judge on the basis of the courts\u2019 decisions and its reasoning whether the proceedings as a whole were fair in terms of Article 6 of the Convention.",

The appellate courts were empowered to carry out a full review of the case and to consider additional evidence and arguments which had not been examined in the first-instance proceedings (see Article\u00a0347 of the Code of Civil Procedure). Given the broad scope of review of the appeal court, the fair trial guarantees enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention, including in particular the right to make oral submissions to the court, were as important in the appellate proceedings as they were in the first-instance courts. However, for those guarantees to be given practical effect, as required by the Convention, rather than remaining a theoretical or illusory right, the applicants had to be apprised of the hearing in such a way as to give them the opportunity to attend it once they had decided to exercise the right to appear at hearings established in the domestic law (see Yakovlev, cited above, \u00a7 21).",

The Government claimed that the legal nature of the civil claims brought by Mr\u00a0Belkin and Mr Kiryushkin rendered their presence before the appeal courts unnecessary. As to Ms Shevchenok, they submitted that non-receipt of the summons could have been due to the applicant\u2019s having provided a postal box number instead of full contact details. The Court observes firstly, as it did in many similar cases, that, pursuant to the applicable provisions of Russian law, whichever specific means was chosen to notify the parties the domestic courts should have been in possession of evidence confirming that the notification had been duly served; otherwise the hearing was to be adjourned (see, in particular, Articles 160 and 167(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, and Zelenkov, \u00a7 25; Gusak, \u00a7 26; and Litvinova, \u00a7\u00a016, all cited above). However, the appeal judgments do not mention any proof of receipt of summonses by the applicants or any analysis as to whether or not it might be necessary to adjourn hearings pending their proper notification. Nor did they say anything about the nature of their legal claims which might have rendered their presence unnecessary. It follows that the arguments raised by the Government were not tested in the domestic proceedings and appeared for the first time in the proceedings before the Court. The Court reiterates in this regard that that a lack or deficiency of reasons in the domestic decisions cannot be made up ex post facto in the Court proceedings, for it cannot take the place of the national courts which had the evidence before them. For that reason, the Court is unable to entertain the claims which the respondent Government raised for the first time in the proceedings before it (see, mutatis mutandis, Valeriy Kovalenko v.

Furthermore, even where a Contracting State provides for the possibility of requesting a reopening of terminated judicial proceedings on the basis of a judgment of the Court, it is for the domestic authorities to provide for a procedure to deal with such requests and to set out criteria for determining whether the requested reopening is called for in a particular case.
