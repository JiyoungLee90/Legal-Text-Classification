They pointed out that Mr Granger had had full legal aid for his trial, extending to the obtaining of counsel\u2019s opinion on the prospects of an appeal, which opinion had been negative (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above); that the Legal Aid Committee, an independent and expert body, had not been satisfied that there were substantial grounds for the appeal (see paragraph 16 above); that the applicant had been able to present argument at the appeal hearings (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above); and that the case had to be seen in the context of the Scottish system in which an active role was played by the appeal court and an impartial role was expected of the Crown and where the automatic right of appeal resulted in the filing of many appeals which were without merit (see paragraphs 25 and 28 above).",

However, it is not the Court\u2019s task to go further into this matter, notably by formulating its own view as to whether the Committee was correct in concluding, on 11 July 1985, that it was not satisfied that there were substantial grounds for appealing. The question whether the interests of justice required a grant of legal aid must be determined in the light of the case as a whole. In that respect not only the situation obtaining at the time the decision on the application for legal aid was handed down but also that obtaining at the time the appeal was heard are material.",

After hearing argument, it decided that this ground - which turned on what the Solicitor General himself described at the \u2019s hearing as the \"difficult\" distinction between \"precognitions\" and other statements (see paragraph 17(b) above) - deserved more detailed consideration. It adjourned its hearing and called for a transcript of the evidence given at the applicant\u2019s trial, so as to be able to examine the matter more thoroughly (see paragraph 19 above).

According to the scheme in operation at the relevant time, however, the Legal Aid Committee\u2019s decision of 11 July 1985 was stated to be final (see paragraphs 16 and 31 above). The Government, it is true, maintained that as a matter of practice the decision could have been reviewed after the High Court had called for a transcript of the evidence and adjourned its hearing of the appeal (see paragraphs 39-40 above). In fact no such review took place. It would appear to the Court that in all the circumstances of the case it would have been in the interests of justice for free legal assistance to be given to the applicant at least at that stage for the ensuing proceedings. Such a course - which would have been in line with what occurred in the later cases of Larkin and Williamson (see paragraph 39 above) - would in the first place have served the interests of justice and fairness by enabling the applicant to make an effective contribution to the proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, the Pakelli judgment of 25 April 1983, Series A no. 64, p. 18, \u00a7 38). Furthermore, the High Court of Justiciary would then have had the benefit of hearing - just as it does before giving an opinion on a reference by the Lord Advocate (see paragraph 32 above) - expert legal argument from both sides on a complex issue.",
