However, if the infringement of the right to life or to physical integrity has not been caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case. In the specific sphere of medical negligence, this obligation may for instance also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and for the publication of the decision, to be obtained. Disciplinary measures may also be envisaged (see Vo v. France [GC], no. 53924/00, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2004VIII, with further references).",

Nor was it regarded as such by the domestic authorities, who initiated a criminal investigation and eventually convicted the doctor who had been in charge of the applicant\u2019s child. It is common ground between the parties that any parallel civil proceedings for damages would not have been an effective course of action while the criminal proceedings were pending. The parties agreed that in such circumstances the civil courts would not have been in a position to determine the civil claims based on the facts, specifically acts or inactivity by the medical staff, which were also the subject-matter of the pending criminal case. The Court must therefore examine whether the criminal proceedings were conducted promptly for the purposes of Article\u00a02.",

Subsequently, following the trial court\u2019s instructions, it took a considerable period of time for the investigating authorities to carry out additional investigative measures and resubmit the case to the trial court (see paragraphs 14-17 above). Furthermore, the available material does not suggest that the length of the investigation and court proceedings could be justified by the complexity of the case or by the applicant\u2019s behaviour.
