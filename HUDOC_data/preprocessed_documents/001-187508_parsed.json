Discriminatory practices are also reported to be widespread and include arbitrary checks, unwarranted searches, confiscation of documents and, as noted in ECRI\u2019s first report, discriminatory enforcement of crime prevention policies targeting persons with criminal records. ECRI urges that action be taken to address manifestations of unlawful behaviour on the part of law enforcement officials generally, including through a more effective institutional response to such manifestations and through training and awareness raising measures. In addition, noting reports that the response of the police to crimes committed by the general population against Roma/Gypsies is often inadequate, ECRI recommends that the Ukrainian authorities take measures to ensure that the police react promptly and effectively to all crimes, including those committed against Roma/Gypsies and, in line with its recommendations formulated above, to ensure that the racist element of such offences is duly taken into account.\u201d",

In a different context, the Court, in finding the treatment suffered by applicants to be contrary to Article 3 and even to constitute torture, found it relevant that they had been detained in a place where there had been no rule of law (\u201czone de non-droit\u201d) and the most elementary guarantees of rights had been suspended and where, therefore, they had had no protection from abuse (see Azzolina and Others v.

Proving racial motivation will admittedly often be difficult in practice. The respondent State\u2019s obligation to investigate possible racist overtones to a violent act is an obligation to use its best endeavours and is not absolute. The authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumstances to collect and secure the evidence, explore all practical means of discovering the truth and deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of racially motivated violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a0160, ECHR 2005VII). Treating violence and brutality with a discriminatory intent on an equal footing with cases that have no such overtones would be turning a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention (see\u00a0Identoba and Others, cited above, \u00a7 67).",

Admittedly, the mob appears to have been motivated in part by desire for revenge against the families of those involved in the murder which had triggered the events (compare Fedorchenko and Lozenko v. Ukraine, no. 387/03, \u00a7 68, 20 September 2012, where Roma houses were burned in an attack allegedly targeting houses of drug dealers).",

That being so, there is no information as to why they did not intervene to protect the applicants\u2019 homes.

The decision to leave their homes before the attack was thus not a result of the exercise of their free will but their way of protecting their physical integrity. Their feelings of fear, anguish, helplessness and inferiority were further exacerbated by understanding that their homes would likely be plundered, but that they were unable to protect them without putting their lives at risk. All in all, it grossly diminished their dignity. The Court concludes that the role of the police, which chose not to protect the applicants but advise them to leave before the \u201cpogrom\u201d (see paragraph 12 above) \u2013 and the fact that those events involved the invasion and ransacking of the applicants\u2019 homes by a large mob that was driven by sentiment aimed at them as Roma (that is to say members of a vulnerable group) \u2013 was such as to constitute an affront to the applicants\u2019 dignity sufficiently serious as to be categorised as \u201cdegrading\u201d treatment. This assessment renders it unnecessary for the Court to resolve the dispute between the parties as to whether the ninth applicant was at home at the time of the attack and had to confront the attackers (see\u00a0paragraph 18 above).",

There was no evidence of any threat to the Roma in the village after 9 September 2002, even though a certain resentment towards them might still remain. Many of them had been able to safely return and reside in their houses until they had sold them. They had not provided sufficient proof that they had sold their houses for less than their market price or that the proceeds had been insufficient to obtain new housing elsewhere. The Government considered this factor, together with the fact that they had been able to sell and move, decisive in the assessment of the applicants\u2019 Article 8 complaint. In this respect they compared the Court\u2019s findings in (i) Fadeyeva v. Russia (no. 55723/00, \u00a7 121, ECHR 2005IV) (where the applicant was unable to move and this was a factor in finding of a violation) and (ii) Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no.\u00a036022/97, \u00a7 127, ECHR 2003VIII) (where the house prices in the applicants\u2019 area and, accordingly, their ability to move, were not affected by aircraft noise). In the Government\u2019s opinion, that case-law was relevant because the applicants in the present case had essentially exercised their right to relocate from an environment (in the village) that they had found oppressive. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the applicants\u2019 living conditions had deteriorated after they had moved from the village, and nor had they sought any help in improving them.",

Moreover, they belonged to a particularly vulnerable group by virtue of their Roma ethnicity and being in a situation tantamount to that of internally displaced persons.
