Furthermore, the domestic court considered that, in view of the fact that he did not have a family, did not work and had no income (see paragraph 8 above), there was a risk of the applicant\u2019s committing other crimes and absconding. The above reasoning was subsequently reiterated by the domestic court on 2 February 2004 when it examined and rejected the applicant\u2019s request for release, having established no grounds for replacing detention on remand with a more lenient preventive measure (see paragraph 12 above).
