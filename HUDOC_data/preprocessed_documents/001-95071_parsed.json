They claimed that the conditions of the applicant's detention in the remand prisons were satisfactory and in compliance with applicable domestic norms and standards. They provided copies of the inspections conducted in January and July 2001 stating that the average temperature in the cells was 220C in the winter and 26.50C in the summer. They also submitted a copy of the report dated 30\u00a0January 2001 concerning the lighting in cell no.\u00a044. The Government also presented a copy of the applicant's registration card from remand prison IZ-4/1 listing the individual bedding items and cutlery the applicant had been provided with. The information provided by the Government with regard to the surface area of the cells and the number of inmates detained with the applicant was based on the certificates issued by the remand prisons' administration in December 2006 and on colour photos taken at remand prison IZ-4/1 at the same time. Without disputing the applicant's allegations that he had contracted scabies and fungus infections while in detention, the Government further submitted that the applicant's file containing his medical history for 2001-2003 had been lost. As regards the fact that the applicant had developed tuberculosis in April 2001, they speculated that this fact alone was not sufficient to prove that the applicant had indeed contracted tuberculosis at the material time. The possibility that the applicant had been infected with tuberculosis some years before and that TB bacteria had remained dormant until April 2001 should not be excluded. Lastly, they observed that the applicant had failed to complain about the conditions of his detention either to the prosecutor or the court and that his complaint should be dismissed in accordance with Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention.",

The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Although measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element, in accordance with Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092-94, ECHR 2000-XI).",
