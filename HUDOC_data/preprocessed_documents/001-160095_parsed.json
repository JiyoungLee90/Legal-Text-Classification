Despite this wording, the Court accepts that the applicant could not have been released immediately after the end of the court hearing, that is to say at 5.16 p.m., and that his release inevitably required that some administrative formalities be complied with (see Petyo Petkov, cited above, \u00a7 74). It considers that a period of time of somewhat less than two hours might reasonably have been necessary to accomplish the formalities in the case. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s detention between 5.16 p.m. and 7 p.m. on 7 June 2012 does not appear to have been in breach of domestic law.",

In addition, even assuming that the applicant might have been considered a witness in the proceedings at issue before having had charges brought against him on 10 June 2012, the use against him of any measures involving force should, once again, have been justified by his having been duly summoned before a competent body, and having failed to appear without a valid reason (see paragraph 13 above).
