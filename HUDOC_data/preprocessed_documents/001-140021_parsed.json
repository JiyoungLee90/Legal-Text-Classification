As established in the Court\u2019s case-law, Article 6 guarantees the right to adversarial proceedings. That right means in principle that the parties to a criminal or civil trial should have the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on all evidence adduced or observations submitted (see Lobo Machado v.\u00a0Portugal, judgment of 20\u00a0February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, \u00a7\u00a031). It includes the right not only to be present, but also to hear and follow the proceedings (see, inter alia, Ziliberberg v. Moldova, no. 61821/00, \u00a7\u00a040, 1\u00a0February 2005). In this connection, the Court considers that the right to a public hearing would be devoid of substance if a party to the case were not apprised of the hearing in such a way as to have an opportunity to attend it, should he or she decide to exercise the right to appear established in the domestic law (see Yakovlev v. Russia, no.\u00a072701/01, \u00a7\u00a022, 15\u00a0March 2005).",

This matter is not in dispute. However, the applicants claimed that the person on whom the documents had been served, namely Mr M.B., was neither a member of the board of directors nor an employee of the applicant company. In the absence of any relevant documents, the Court cannot speculate as to whether such a person had ever worked for the company. Even assuming that such a person did not work for the company, the Court finds that, in the circumstances of the present case, the authorities cannot be held solely responsible, since there was obviously a failure on the part of the applicant company to take appropriate measures to ensure effective receipt of any correspondence sent to it by the domestic courts at the address indicated by it.",

Although it would have been another opportunity to inform the second applicant of the proceedings against it, the Court does not find any arbitrariness in the non-communication of the documents submitted to the case file by the plaintiff on 17\u00a0March 1998, since no such obligation is prescribed by the Civil Procedure Code, as applied to cases examined under the simple procedure followed in the present case.",

In this connection, the Court observes that the second applicant was able to appeal against the firstinstance court judgment and was able to put forward its arguments at a hearing before the Court of Cassation, which had the competence to review the case, particularly from a procedural point of view. In view of the above considerations, the Court considers that the second applicant had an adequate opportunity to advance its defence before the Court of Cassation. Moreover, the Court cannot ignore the fact that the second applicant merely argued before the Court of Cassation that Mr M.B. was not a member of the board of directors, in support of its claim that it had not been duly notified of the case before the first-instance court. There is no requirement under domestic law for notification to be served solely on members of the board of directors. The second applicant submitted no other arguments or documents to demonstrate that its complaint under this head was not manifestly devoid of merit.

It normally requires also that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at the international level should have been aired before those same courts, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see, among many other authorities, Fressoz and Roire v.

Insofar as there exists at national level a remedy enabling the national courts to address, at least in substance, the argument that a Convention right has been violated, it is that remedy which should be used. If the complaint presented before the Court has not been put, either explicitly or in substance, to the national courts when it could have been raised in the exercise of a remedy available to the applicant, the national legal order has been denied the opportunity to address the Convention issue which the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies is intended to give it. It is not sufficient that the applicant may have, unsuccessfully, exercised another remedy which could have overturned the impugned measure on other grounds not connected with the complaint of violation of the Convention right. It is the Convention complaint which must have been aired at national level for there to have been exhaustion of \u201ceffective remedies\u201d.

Nevertheless, in the present case, the Court is unable to glean from the decision of the Commercial Court how and why the applicant company had breached public order. It notes in this connection that criminal proceedings had been initiated against these two branch offices. It further observes that during a search conducted in the \u015eanl\u0131urfa branch office, the police had confiscated certain newspapers, books, cassettes and documents which were allegedly illegal. However, the subsequent criminal proceedings, which had been initiated for storing banned books, had been discontinued since the prosecution had become time-barred pursuant to Article 102 of the Criminal Code. Furthermore, various books and publications, including a calendar prepared by Mesopotamia Publishing, had been confiscated from the Diyarbak\u0131r branch office; nevertheless, similarly, the ensuing criminal proceedings, which had been instituted against the Diyarbak\u0131r branch office, for disseminating propaganda of an illegal organisation, had been suspended pursuant to Law no. 4454. As a result, no criminal convictions had been delivered in respect of Mesopotamia Publishing. At this point the Court recalls that under Turkish law, civil courts are not bound by the conclusions of criminal courts. However, as stated above, the brief reasoning of the Commercial Court cannot be regarded as sufficient and relevant justification for the interference with Mesopotamia Publishing\u2019s right to freedom of expression.",
