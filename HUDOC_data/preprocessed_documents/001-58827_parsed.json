The Poiss case concerned a complaint about the length of civil, land consolidation proceedings which, under Austrian law, consist of a series of intermediary decisions leading in their entirety to a redistribution of land among farmers.

Furthermore, by March 1993, a key witness had been traced in the United States and had given evidence in Vienna before the Investigating Judge. As regards the expert opinions to which the Government refer, the Court cannot see why this evidence could not have been obtained at an earlier stage rather than waiting until after the bill of indictment had become final. In any event, the expert's report was received by the court in October 1995, but the retrial only started in August 1996. In this respect the Government submit that the delay was caused by a change of presiding judge.
