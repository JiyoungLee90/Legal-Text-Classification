Applying the above-mentioned principles, it has concluded that it would be sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case of abduction of the missing persons by State agents, thus falling within the control of the authorities, and it would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof, either by disclosing documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, for example, concerning abductions in Dagestan, Umarovy v. Russia, no. 2546/08, 12 June 2012; Alpatu Israilova v. Russia, no. 15438/05, 14 March 2013; and Abdurakhmanova and Abdulgamidova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 41437/10, 22\u00a0September 2015). If the Government failed to rebut this presumption, that would entail a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its substantive part. Conversely, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Shafiyeva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 49379/09, \u00a7 71, 3 May 2012).",

The abductors, who arrived in civilian vehicles, acted as an organised group and did not hesitate to open fire in a public place, in daylight and in the presence of witnesses. The abductors were in police uniform and had special equipment usually only used by the police, such as truncheons and handcuffs. Subsequently, in spite of the applicants\u2019 urgent complaint that the abductors must have been State agents, the authorities took no steps to verify this information. On the contrary, within a few days of the abduction, the applicants and their relatives had been questioned and searched by the police (see paragraphs 24, 28 and 31 above) on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities (see paragraphs 14, 31, 49 and 55 above). Further, the investigators took no meaningful steps to check whether the abduction could have been perpetrated for other reasons, such as because of a blood feud, for a ransom, it was related to drugs trafficking, or simply due to hostility towards the abducted persons. No serious steps were taken to verify or discount such motives and no information was obtained indicating that the abductors could have been persons other than State agents (see, by contrast, Zubayrayev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a067797/01, \u00a7 81, 10\u00a0January 2008). Lastly, the procrastination on the part of the authorities in respect of the investigation into the matter, along with the applicants\u2019 consistent allegations that law-enforcement officers had been involved in the incident (see, for example, paragraphs 12, 20, 21, 25, 26, 49 and 55 above), provide the Court with grounds for concluding that the applicants have made a prima facie case that their relatives Sirazhudin Aliyev and Gazimagomed Abdullayev were abducted by State agents. The Government\u2019s statement that the investigators have found no evidence that members of lawenforcement authorities were involved in the disappearance is insufficient to discharge them of the above-mentioned burden of proof. Having examined the documents submitted by the parties, and drawing inferences from the Government\u2019s failure to provide another plausible explanation for the events in question, the Court finds that Sirazhudin Aliyev and Gazimagomed Abdullayev were apprehended on 21 January 2012 by State agents (see, in respect of a similar situation, Askhabova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 54765/09, \u00a7 135, 18 April 2013, and Abdurakhmanova and Abdulgamidova, cited above, \u00a7 66).",

In response, on the same date the authorities obtained the evidence from four persons and examined the crime scene the following day (see paragraphs\u00a01317 above). However, they took no steps to verify the applicants\u2019 allegation of the possible involvement of State agents. Several days later, after the first applicant had specified that the abductors had been in traffic police uniform and named eyewitnesses to the events, no steps were taken to verify this detailed allegation. The criminal case was opened only ten days after the applicants had made a complaint on 21 January 2012, in spite of the evidence obtained on the day of the incident (see paragraphs\u00a01317 above) and just a few days later (see paragraphs 20-21). There is no explanation for the belatedness of the reaction to such reliable information concerning such a serious crime. Thus, the authorities failed to demonstrate diligence and promptness in dealing with a serious matter (see Shafiyeva, cited above, \u00a7 90). Further, it would be reasonable to presume that the investigators could have questioned immediately, amongst other witnesses, officers from the traffic police and other lawenforcement agencies or enquired as to whether any special operations had been carried out by them. Such critical steps were not taken, neither at the very beginning of the proceedings nor later. In mid-February 2012 the first applicant pointed out that the abducted men had been detained on the CTC\u2019s premises and then transferred to the Stavropol region (see paragraphs 26-27 above). In spite of the applicants\u2019 and their relatives\u2019 consistent allegations of the involvement of the law-enforcement officers in the abduction (see paragraphs 12, 21, 25, 26 and 27 above), the investigators obtained a statement from only one police officer, and that statement was obtained almost five months after the receipt of the applicants\u2019 allegations of police involvement (see paragraphs 31 above). The investigators failed to take such crucial steps as checking the logbooks of the police detention facilities or those of the CTC in Makhachkala and Stavropol to verify the theory that State agents were involved in the disappearance of Sirazhudin Aliyev and Gazimagomed Abdullayev. It is noteworthy that the investigators tried to verify the first applicant\u2019s allegation, made on 15 February 2012, concerning the involvement of traffic police (see paragraph 26 above), only one year and nine months later, in November 2013 (see paragraph 52 above).",

Russia (dec.), no.\u00a09790/99, 14 October 2003; Dzhamaldayev v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a039768/06, \u00a7 28, 22 January 2013; and Borgdorf v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a020427/05, \u00a7 27, 22 October 2013). However, the Court has on many occasions found this remedy ineffective where the essence of the applicants\u2019 complaints lay in challenges to the investigators\u2019 inaction, resulting from the failure to take the necessary and timely steps and to keep the families informed of the progress and main procedural steps of the proceedings (see Shafiyeva, cited above, \u00a7 95, and Askhabova, cited above, \u00a7 159).",

However, from the contents of the investigation file it is apparent that because of the delays in taking the necessary steps and the constant criticism by the supervisory authorities, the applicants learned of the omissions in the proceedings at a later date. In addition, there was no specific procedural act to challenge. In cases such as the one at hand the domestic courts are unable to issue specific guidelines to the investigating authorities, because of the absence of such a procedural act. Therefore, in the instant case, a challenge by the applicants before a court in respect of the investigators\u2019 actions or omissions would have had a very little chance of redressing defects in the investigation given (i) the nature of the matter, (ii) the need to react promptly, and (iii) the limited scope of review of such a court. Accordingly, the Court finds that an application to the domestic courts in respect of complaints concerning alleged acts or omissions on the part of the investigating authorities would have been ineffective in such circumstances; it therefore dismisses the Government\u2019s objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
