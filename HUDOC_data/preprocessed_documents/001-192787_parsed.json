The judge applied the rules governing contracts of mandate as established by the domestic caselaw and practice, relying, in particular, on the duty of the agent (mandatario  in this case, company S.M.I.) to give evidence of the operations carried out in execution of a mandate in order to demonstrate that it had fulfilled its reporting obligation (obbligo di rendiconto). According to the judge, the only evidence that company S.M.I. had submitted for that purpose had been the abovementioned financial statement. However, B. had demonstrated that the statement was incomplete and therefore unreliable.

Thus, the judge considered all the credit entries (amounting to LIT\u00a034,962,635,382) and deducted from them the sums which B. acknowledged having received and those which company S.M.I had used on his instructions (amounting to LIT\u00a025,927,371,050) as also admitted by him.

The judge specified that none of the grounds for abstention under section\u00a010 of Law no. 145 of 2003 existed in that case. In particular, he had not given advice or opinions, nor had he illegitimately expressed his opinion on the facts which were the subject of the proceedings. He excluded that he had made any statements concerning those facts in his previous decisions and judgments (in different proceedings concerning the applicant), but even assuming that he had done so, that would have happened while he had been exercising his legitimate jurisdictional functions, thus it could not have been considered an illegitimate expression of opinion. The judge also considered that not even the ground for facultative abstention under section 10(4) (that is to say, abstention for \u201creasons of appropriateness\u201d) was applicable to the applicant\u2019s case.",

A party may be requested to take such an oath by the judge, who draws up wording to that effect. The \u201csupplementary oath\u201d can be requested by means of an interlocutory discretionary decision of the judge in order to decide the case if the facts were not fully established at the probative stage. According to domestic case-law and legal literature, a \u201csupplementary oath\u201d is only admissible in the case of a partial lack of evidence (semiplena probatio) and should preferably be requested from the party who partially gave evidence of his or her statement in the course of the proceedings. The factual findings which derive from statements made under oath cannot be examined any further by the judge. Thus, the sworn statement of facts creates an unrebuttable presumption of truth (legal proof). According to the domestic practice, the only admissible ways to contrast the factual findings arising from statements made under oath are: (i) a declaration of falsity in criminal proceedings for perjury (\u201cfalse oath\u201d - Article 359 of the Criminal Code), and (ii) the submission of new evidence concerning facts of which the party had knowledge after the taking of the oath or written evidence which would have been impossible to submit earlier (\u201cjactitation suit\u201d  azione di iattanza).",

It marks out the temporal limits of the supervision carried out by the organs of the Convention and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see Ble\u010di\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia [GC], no. 59532/00, \u00a7\u00a068, ECHR 2006III; Pe\u0148aranda Soto v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a016680/14, \u00a7\u00a043, 19\u00a0December 2017, and the caselaw cited therein).

However, the Court considers that the proceedings before the Court for Trusts were instead a different and autonomous civil action, which had to determine a different main issue i.e., whether B. had lied under oath, and then consequently, whether the sums, which S.M.I. had been ordered to pay in the civil proceedings, be diminished or setoff. Moreover, while the proceedings before the Court for Trusts concerned the same set of facts, they had been brought by a different party (the applicant in his own name instead of company S.M.I.). Most importantly, even had it been considered as a \u201creopening\u201d, which is not the case, the Court notes that, while the applicant had been successful in part, the final outcome of the proceedings before the Court for Trusts had no impact on the impugned decision in the ordinary civil proceedings and did not lead to a reopening of those proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis and a contrario, Dicle and Sadak v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 48621/07, \u00a7 55, 16 June 2015), nor did they consist of a review of that decision (see, a contrario, Sapeyan, cited above, \u00a7 24). Thus, in any event, the decision in the \u201cjactitation suit\u201d brought by the applicant before the Court for Trusts cannot be considered an exception to the rule mentioned in paragraph 79 above. It follows that the starting point for the running of the six-month rule is the final judgment of the Court of Appeal of 9 June 2011 which was filed with the registry on 30\u00a0June 2011 and served on the applicant on 20 July 2011 (see paragraph\u00a021 above).",

Furthermore, the applicant noted that section 4 of Delegate Decree no.\u00a0128 gave too much discretion to the President with respect to the choice of composition of the court in a given case and did not contain any guidelines as to which of the different formations of the court (single judge, panel or full court) were appropriate in a specified case.

The wording of the abovementioned section 4 (1a): \u201che also decides the members and the President\u201d (see paragraph 57 above), does not necessarily imply that a panel always has to be made up of at least three members. In this connection, the Court notes that besides being the president of the panel, the latter was also a member. It is conceivable that only after choosing the members of the panel would the President of the Court for Trusts choose its president, thus, the use of the term \u201cmembers\u201d in the plural (which also caters for the possibility of having a number of other members), does not in itself exclude a twojudge formation. Moreover, the Court notes that the above-mentioned provision did not oblige the President to provide any reasons for his decision on the composition of the panel, whereas it unambiguously provided that the decision was not amenable to appeal. The Court considers that this in itself does not contravene the Convention. Indeed, the instant case does not refer to a reassignment of judges once proceedings had already started, which may require reasons for such changes and the possibility for applicants to comment (compare Bochan v. Ukraine, no. 7577/02, \u00a7 71, 3\u00a0May 2007 and Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v. Spain, 6 December 1988, \u00a7 78, Series A no.\u00a0146). The present case concerns the first assignment of a judge to the case in question. Bearing in mind that the applicant\u2019s complaint does not concern the impartiality or independence of the assigned judges at that stage of the proceedings, and that the decision was taken within the limits of domestic law, the Court does not find that in determining the composition in the present case the situation was one where the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the domestic authorities in such matters was exceeded.",

Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge\u2019s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Ramos\u00a0Nunes de Carvalho e S\u00e1, \u00a7 146; Denisov, \u00a7\u00a062; and Micallef, \u00a7\u00a095; all cited above).",

Also, in the Court\u2019s view, the scope of the examination as to whether or not to grant leave to appeal against the decision of the Court for Trusts, did not amount to an assessment of the merits of the appeal (see, mutatis mutandis, R.M.B. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, (dec.), no.\u00a037120/97, ECHR 16 January 2007, and Central Mediterranean Development Corporation Limited v.\u00a0Malta (no. 2), no.\u00a018544/08, \u00a7\u00a7 3536, 22\u00a0November 2011), which, had leave been granted, would have been determined in line with the opinion of a different judicial body, namely a panel of experts (see paragraph\u00a057 above) (see, mutatis mutandis, Warsicka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044).

That fact was established by the President of the Court for Trusts (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above) and confirmed by the Judge of Civil Appeals (see paragraphs 53 and 54 above) in, moreover, fully reasoned decisions. The Court reiterates that, according to its settled caselaw, the fact that an appeal lies only when it is certified by a court that the decision appealed against involved a point of law does not, as such, amount to an unjustified denial of right of access to a court (see, mutatis mutandis, R.M.B. v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, (dec.)., cited above). In the present case, the Court is satisfied that the limitation on the admissibility of appeals on points of law in civil cases before the Court for Trusts pursues a legitimate aim, namely the effective and speedy administration of justice. The Court further accepts that the manner in which that limitation is set out in section\u00a011 (1\u00a0and 2) of Delegate Decree no. 128 of 30 September 2013 is within the State\u2019s margin of appreciation (see, mutatis mutandis, Valchev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a087). Finally, bearing in mind that the applicant had been able to request a criminal investigation which in fact ensued, as well as the fact that the applicant\u2019s claim had already been examined by the firstinstance Court for Trusts, having full jurisdiction, three years after the end of the original proceedings giving rise to the applicant\u2019s complaint, the Court cannot find that the restriction was disproportionate or that it impaired the very essence of the applicant\u2019s right to a court.",

As to accessibility, the Government noted that Delegate Decree no. 128 of 30 September 2013 (see paragraph\u00a057 above) had been circulated in line with the ordinary procedure for the publication of laws, which required not only the posting of the legislative texts in the Government building but also their publication in the Official Gazette (Bollettino Ufficiale) and on Parliament\u2019s website, the latter being permanently accessible to anyone. The predictability of such a general provision had been further ensured through the adoption of the Rules of 2\u00a0February 2014 by the President of the Court for Trusts. Both those rules and subsequent rules adopted by the President of the Court for Trusts on 10\u00a0September 2015 had been published on the website of the court, in a section specifically devoted to legislation and regulatory measures. Therefore, all the relevant law and regulations had been constantly accessible and (i) had provided for precise criteria concerning the calculation of legal costs before the Court for Trusts; (ii)\u00a0had linked the amount of such costs with the value of a given claim and the costs normally paid by the State for the remuneration and expenses of judges, as well as court fees; and (iii) had required that part of the legal costs be paid in advance. In the light of the content of that legislation, the Government considered that the applicant had been perfectly able to foresee the economic burden of the proceedings before the Court for Trusts, thus, according to the Government, the relevant legal basis, from a qualitative point of view, had also been predictable. Moreover, the costs payable had been proportionate to the high value of the claim (approximately EUR\u00a04,662,778.93).",

It further reiterates, however, that the amount of the fees assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of a given case, including the applicant\u2019s ability to pay them, and the phase of the proceedings at which that restriction has been imposed are factors which are material in determining whether or not a person enjoyed his right of access and had \u201ca ... hearing by [a] tribunal\u201d (ibid., \u00a7\u00a060).",

In this connection, the Court notes that section 2 (2b) of Delegate Decree no.\u00a0128 of 30\u00a0September 2013 (see paragraph 57 above) provides that to avoid the claim being barred, an application must be filed with the registry together with evidence of payment of court fees in the amount periodically determined by the President and, in general, also calculated on the basis of the value of the claim. In addition, section 4 (1b and c) of the same law (see paragraph\u00a057 above) provide that, at the beginning of the proceedings, the President decides, by a final decision not amenable to appeal, the amount of the variable part of the remuneration of the single judge or panel and the amount of legal fees (which can vary depending on the complexity of the case and/or its value). Moreover, pursuant to that same provision, the applicant must pay, within seven days, to avoid the claim being barred, a part thereof, which is calculated in relation to the total amount of remuneration and expenses payable to the judges. Such a sum is determined by the President applying a variable increase between 10 and 20% to the cost incurred by the State for the remuneration and expenses payable to judges, as well as court fees.",

Indeed, these rules had not been issued prior to the applicant lodging his claim. Thus, the President, in calculating the legal costs and expenses in the specific case of the applicant, relied on a detailed series of criteria which he had established himself the day before in his (administrative) capacity as President of the Court for Trusts. In this connection, however, the Court considers that such criteria were perfectly in line with the above-mentioned sections 2\u00a0(2b) and\u00a04 (1b\u00a0and c) of Delegate Decree no. 128 of 30 September 2013, which, as stated above, constituted the more general legal basis of the President\u2019s request to the applicant to pay, in advance, legal costs and expenses.

The summary of the basis on which the domestic courts accepted the \u201cjactation suit\u201d (see \u00a7 42) also provides no real indication of any basis on which it would be appropriate for this Court to assume that the dispute before the Court for Trusts would be \u201cdeterminative\u201d of the applicant\u2019s \u201ccivil rights\u201d so as to engage Article 6 \u00a7 1.\u00a0 Any indirect consequences of the proceedings before the Court of Trusts on the applicant\u2019s pecuniary position would not, in our view, be sufficient to engage Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01; this is even more so where, in light of the fact that S.M.I. is in \u201ccompulsory liquidation\u201d, any pecuniary/proprietary interest this applicant may have in relation to S.M.I. may well have to be assessed in the context of and in competition with any pecuniary claim or interest of any possible creditors.
