There is nothing to suggest that the legal basis for his detention was not clearly defined and, therefore, lacked the necessary foreseeability required under the Convention. The Court is therefore satisfied that the applicant's detention complied with the requirements of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01. Moreover, the Court does not see any appearance of arbitrariness on the part of the relevant judicial authorities when deciding on the applicant's continued detention. It also observes, and without prejudice to its conclusion under Article 5 \u00a7 3, that its lawfulness was repeatedly reviewed by the competent domestic courts (see, mutatis mutandis Malik v. , no. 57447/00, \u00a7 26, judgment of 4 April 2006).",
