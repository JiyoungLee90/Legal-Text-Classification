As regards the alleged lack of confidentiality of communication between Mr\u00a0Kosteletskiy and his lawyer, the Court notes that unlike for example, Mr\u00a0Chernenko (see paragraph 29 above), Mr Kosteletskiy did not state that third persons had indeed been present in the court room during the second appeal proceedings in respect of his case \u2013 he had only speculated, without providing any specific details, that there may have been others. Moreover, as can be seen from the parties\u2019 submissions, following two meetings with his lawyer via video link, Mr Kosteletskiy did not lodge any complaints about any lack of confidentiality and did not request a meeting with his lawyer in person, which the Court considers as being strongly indicative of Mr\u00a0Kosteletskiy\u2019s overall satisfaction with their communication.",
