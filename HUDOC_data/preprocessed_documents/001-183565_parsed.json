This process had continued while the external audit was being carried out and the Bank had incurred more expenses in this regard. All contracts with Z. had been approved and signed by the Bank\u2019s highest management.

The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10. However, where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient \u201cfactual basis\u201d for the impugned statement; if there is not, that value judgment may prove excessive. In order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment it is necessary to take account of the circumstances of the case and the general tone of the remarks, bearing in mind that assertions about matters of public interest may, on that basis, constitute value judgments rather than statements of fact (see Morice v.

It is open to the relevant State authorities to adopt appropriate measures in order to react without excess to defamatory accusations that are devoid of foundation or formulated in bad faith. Moreover, freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities, and any person who chooses to disclose information must carefully verify, to the extent permitted by the circumstances in question, that it is accurate and reliable (see Guja v. Moldova [GC], no. 14277/04, \u00a7\u00a075, ECHR 2008).

Also, it was undisputed in the domestic proceedings and before the Court that A.L. \u2013 during his time in office as the President of the Bank and throughout the pre-election period \u2013 had acted in a public context. While the domestic courts\u2019 did not provide full analysis of the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraph 51 above), the Court does not consider it necessary to examine this further because the crux of the present case is the question of whether the applicant\u2019s allegations contained a factual basis that was sufficient in view of the particular circumstances of the present case.",

The domestic courts\u2019 reasoning in this respect was rather succinct as they limited themselves to finding that the applicant\u2019s allegations turned out to be unfounded \u2013 which fact the applicant did not contest \u2013 and had thus been false from the very beginning. While the Court considers that some of the applicant\u2019s assertions could be regarded as constituting value judgements, his pronouncements also included statements of fact susceptible of proof. In any event, the Court is of the view that the issue that must be determined in the present case is whether there was at least a \u201csufficient factual basis\u201d for the applicant\u2019s allegations. The reasonableness of the efforts made to verify the accuracy of the information disclosed must be determined in the light of the situation at the time that the statements were made, rather than with the benefit of hindsight, on the basis of the subsequent internal and external audit reports (see, mutatis mutandis, Med\u017elis Islamske Zajednice Br\u010dko and Others, cited above, \u00a7 109). The Court also refers here to the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d associated with freedom of expression (see paragraph 54 above) and notes their pertinence to the present case, given the applicant\u2019s public status under the domestic law as the chairman of the supervisory board of the partly State-owned Bank, as well as his own affirmation that he had the duty to inform the public of the supervisory board\u2019s activities.",

He had requested and received internal information from the marketing and economics departments in this regard and informed the supervisory board about his personal findings of undocumented advertising and marketing expenses in the Bank. He also commented on his allegations to the journalists, who \u2013 on the day after the supervisory board\u2019s extraordinary meeting \u2013 published the first article alleging that under the Bank\u2019s previous management large sums of money had been transferred without any documentation in order to finance advertising and marketing activities. The applicant was directly quoted as stating that \u201csomebody is receiving this paid money back\u201d and \u201cthis is money that has been stolen from the shareholders.\u201d In later newspaper articles the applicant was also quoted as saying: \u201cIt is possible that this is the money that provided the foundation for the Latvia\u2019s First Party\u2019s sizable advertising campaign.\u201d These statements made by the applicant (see also paragraph 15 above) contained serious allegations. The Senate of the Supreme Court, relying on the journalists\u2019 testimony, held that the applicant\u2019s allegations had specifically concerned A.L. and not \u2013 as claimed by the applicant \u2013 the Bank\u2019s management as a whole. What is in issue in the present case is whether the applicant exceeded the limits of acceptable criticism by commenting on his allegations to the journalists at the material time.",

The domestic courts established that the journalists had had no reason to doubt the credibility of the information provided by the applicant owing to his position as the chairman of the supervisory board. Indeed, the journalists could not further verify the applicant\u2019s allegations given that they concerned the Bank\u2019s internal documents and did not appear to have been publicly available (compare Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a068).",

The Court notes that it took only around fourteen days for the internal audit department to carry out its preliminary verification of the applicant\u2019s allegations and to dismiss them. Nonetheless, the applicant commented on his allegations to the press without awaiting the outcome of the internal audit, which was still ongoing when he made those comments.

Given the applicant\u2019s position at the Bank and the nature of his allegations, the Court does not consider that the applicant could rely on the degree of exaggeration or even provocation that can usually be used in the exercise of freedom of expression in the context of a political debate (see, mutatis mutandis, Petrina v.
