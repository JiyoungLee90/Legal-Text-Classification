Where the infringement of the right to life or physical integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminallaw remedy in every case. In the sphere of medical negligence, the obligation may, for instance, also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and for the publication of the decision, to be obtained. Disciplinary measures may also be envisaged (ibid., \u00a7\u00a051; Lazzarini and Ghiacci v. Italy (dec.), no.\u00a053749/00, 7 November 2002; and Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a037703/97, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2002-VIII).",
