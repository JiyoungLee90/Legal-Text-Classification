This was unquestionably the case in the periods comprised between 5 March 1990 and 6 March 1992 and again between 25 August 1993 and 21 March 1994, where detention had been ordered in the rape proceedings.  However, even during the period going from 6 March 1992 to 25 August 1993, where technically the applicant was being detained exclusively on the strength of orders made in the extradition proceedings, the only reason for extending his detention was that the investigation into the rape allegations was still incomplete.  In other words, the Spanish extradition authorities, who had ordered the applicant\u2019s detention on the basis of a request for extradition - which was as such covered by Article 5 para. 1 (f) (art. 5-1-f) - decided to prolong his detention beyond 6 March 1992 - where provisional release had been granted in respect of the rape proceedings - for reasons (\"reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence\" and risk of absconding) that are more appropriately examined in the context of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c).",

The national authorities were entitled under that legislation to defer the surrender of a person requested for extradition if a criminal investigation was in progress (see paragraph 41 above). Under section 10 (3) of the Extradition Act (see paragraph 40 above) they were further entitled to keep the applicant in detention by applying the same principles as those applicable to pre-trial detainees.",

However, the existence of a strong suspicion of the involvement of a person in serious offences, while constituting a relevant factor, cannot alone justify a long period of pre-trial detention (see the Tomasi v.

Indeed, it is apparent from the case file before it that, after the investigation had been terminated, the evidence against the applicant only included two statements by the complainant, two statements by the accused and four medical certificates.

It is the statutory conditions for detention, both substantive and procedural, as laid down by domestic legislation, that should be taken into account in order to decide what was lawful under the Convention, not the reasons given by the domestic courts in their decisions to justify extending detention with a view to extradition. The Court\u2019s task is precisely to determine whether the latter reasons suggest that detention with a view to extradition pursued an aim other than that for which it was prescribed by law (see the Quinn v.  judgment of 22 March 1995, Series A no. 311, p. 19, para. 47).",

On the other hand, detention with a view to extradition may be ordered only in the context of extradition proceedings.  These requirements are also laid down by Article 5 para. 1 (c) of the Convention (art. 5-1-c), as regards the former, and Article 5 para. 1 (f) (art. 5-1-f) as regards the latter.  In addition, different domestic courts have jurisdiction to determine all questions concerning these two different grounds of detention.  The fact that the two sets of proceedings were being conducted concurrently does not make it right for the Court to treat these two grounds of detention as identical for the purposes of the Convention and does not dispense it from examining them separately, which does not mean that when assessing the length of detention it cannot take into account the total period of imprisonment (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, the Yagci and Sargin v. Turkey judgment of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 319-A, p. 18, para. 49).",

However, although the period in question was considerably shorter than the period considered by the majority, their conclusions on the question whether the detention exceeded a reasonable time remain valid, even for this shorter period.  There were very lengthy periods of inactivity on the part of the Puerto de la Cruz investigating judge not only during the applicant\u2019s detention on remand but also during the period when he was technically no longer being held on remand (6 March 1992 - 25 August 1993), and the delays during this last period directly influenced the fact that his detention continued after 25 August 1993.",

I consider that there is a stage missing from that reasoning.  Under the relevant provision of the Extradition Act (section 19 (2)) and the similar provision of Article 18 of the Extradition Treaty between Spain and the United Kingdom (see paragraph 41 of the judgment), delivery of the person whose extradition is sought into the charge of the requesting State may be deferred until he has discharged his criminal responsibilities if criminal proceedings against him are pending in the State from which extradition is sought.  But these provisions say nothing to the effect that the person whose extradition is sought must be detained with a view to extradition or held at the disposal of the requested State in some other manner, in particular in detention on remand in connection with the domestic criminal proceedings. Consequently, these provisions cannot constitute the legal basis for detention with a view to extradition, which is based on other provisions.",

The Audiencia Nacional\u2019s decision of 17 March 1992 to extend detention with a view to extradition came after the Puerto de la Cruz investigating judge decided, rightly or wrongly, that the applicant should be released from detention on remand (see paragraphs 18 and 19 of the judgment).

The wording in both French and English means that only where extradition proceedings are in progress is deprivation of liberty justified under that provision (art. 5-1-f).  It follows that if the proceedings are not being conducted by the authorities with the necessary diligence, or if continued detention results from the pursuit of aims other than those for which it was prescribed by law, the detention ceases to be justified under Article 5 para. 1 (f) (art. 5-1-f) (see the above-mentioned Quinn judgment, p. 19, paras. 47 and 48; see also application no. 7317/75, decision of 6 October 1976 in the Lynas v. Switzerland case, Decisions and Reports 6, pp. 141 et seq.).
