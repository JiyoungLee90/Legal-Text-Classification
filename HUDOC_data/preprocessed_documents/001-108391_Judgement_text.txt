The applicant was represented by Mr S. Çakmak, a lawyer practising in Van. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that his right of access to court was breached by the domestic court’s refusal of his legal aid request.

The applicant was born in 1987 and lives in Van.
In 2008, during his military service, the applicant was disbanded from the army as he was diagnosed with a psychotic illness by the Van Military Hospital.
Subsequently, on 7 October 2008 he initiated compensation proceedings, claiming that he had become ill during his military service as a result of the degrading treatment he had been subjected to in the army. He claimed that he had been healthy before and that the Ministry of Defence had failed to provide medical treatment for his condition. The applicant requested a total of 150,000 Turkish liras (TRY) (approximately 80,000 euros (EUR) at the time) in both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, submitting the medical records from the Van Military Hospital in support of his claims. He also requested legal aid for the court fees, presenting a certificate from the office of the headman (muhtar) attesting to his poverty.

The court concluded that the requirements were not met in the applicant’s case.
On 31 October 2008 the court informed the applicant that he was to pay a total of TRY 2,384 (approximately EUR 1,300) in court fees within thirty days for the proceedings to be continued.
On 4 February 2009 the  decided to discontinue the compensation proceedings because the applicant had not paid the necessary court fees.
