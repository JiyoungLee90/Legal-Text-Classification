The case concerns the applicants’ complaints under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 of the State’s failure to pay a supplement to their pensions.
The first applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Donetsk. The second applicant was born in 1936. On 5 November 2019 Mr Yuriy Mikhaylovich Bezdorozhniy, the son and the heir of the second applicant, informed the Court that the latter had died in 2015 and expressed his wish to pursue the application.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
The first applicant has, and the second applicant had, the special status of “child of war” (a person who on 2 September 1945 was no more than 18 years of age) under the Children of War Social Protection Act in force as of 1 January 2006 (“the Children of War Act”). Article 6 of the above Act entitled them to a special supplement to their pension in the amount of 30% of the minimum pension.
The applicants instituted court proceedings against the Pension Fund of Ukraine, claiming, inter alia, the above pension supplement for the period between 2 April and 31 December 2006.
By final decisions delivered on 13 May and 18 August 2011 respectively, the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine and the Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicants’ claims. The courts found that by virtue of the amendments to the State Budget Act 2006, with effect from 2 April 2006, the above pension supplement was to be introduced gradually in 2006, in accordance with a procedure elaborated by the Cabinet of Ministers. However, since in 2006 no such procedure had been elaborated, there was no ground for allowing the claims.
Furthermore, on 31 December 2010 the Kuybyshevskyy District Court of Donetsk ordered the Pension Fund to calculate and pay to the second applicant the pension supplement for the periods between 9 July and 31 December 2007 and between 22 May 2008 and 31 December 2010. The above judgment, which became final on 18 August 2011, remains unenforced.
The provisions of the relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the case of Sukhanov and Ilchenko v. Ukraine (nos. 68385/10 and 71378/10, §§ 17-25, 26 June 2014).
