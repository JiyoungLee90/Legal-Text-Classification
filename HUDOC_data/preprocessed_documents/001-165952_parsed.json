It further notes that it is clear from the case file that the Bender Court of Appeal determined, inter alia, that the applicant was responsible for causing the accident of 14 August 2009. Although that finding did not amount to a final determination of his guilt, it had a decisive effect on such a determination. Indeed, the police based its decision of 22 January 2010 entirely on the conclusions reached by the Bender District Court of 19 November 2009 without making any further investigation or reaching any new conclusions of its own (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). In fact, the chief inspector was obliged to conform to the to the appeal court\u2019s judgment and could not have reached any other conclusion. Moreover, the judgment of 19\u00a0November 2009 had the effect of res judicata in respect of both the applicant and P.C., if only for making the latter immune from responsibility for the accident. Since in a car accident involving two vehicles, there should be at least one person responsible, the final exclusion of P.C.\u2019s responsibility by the Bender Court of Appeal implicitly predetermined the applicant\u2019s guilt. In those circumstances, the Court must conclude that there has been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
