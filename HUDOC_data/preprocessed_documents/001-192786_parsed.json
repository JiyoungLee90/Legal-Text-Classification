[Committee], no. 22796/16, 13 September 2016) the Court had held that in proceedings under the Hague Convention there was no obligation to hear the parties, since domestic courts were left a wide margin of discretion in deciding whether or not to hold an oral hearing. Likewise, in the case of \u0160neersone and Kampanella v. Italy (no.\u00a014737/09, 12 July 2011) the Court had found no violation of either Article 8 or Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the fact that a contested decision of the Italian courts in return proceedings under the Hague Convention had been adopted without a hearing.",

While it was natural that the child, at the age of five, could not go to the expert alone, for the applicant, that was certainly no reason to include the mother in the expert evaluation by interviewing her and leave him, the father, out completely. Furthermore, it was difficult to sustain the Government\u2019s argument that, in the given circumstances, it had been possible to assess the risk of trauma to the child solely on the basis of the interview with the boy alone and the interview in the presence of his mother (see paragraph 77 below). In the applicant\u2019s view, it was \u201cempirical and natural\u201d that, in order to complete that task, the expert had had to assess the emotional bond between the child and him as the father, and their mutual relationship. That was so because the return of the child to the United States without the mother did not necessarily mean that the child would have experienced trauma, given that the boy would have been returning to the father \u2013 a person who had cared for him since birth to the same extent as the mother and to whom he was emotionally attached \u2013 and would have been coming back to a familiar environment in which he had grown up.",

After receiving the expert report and objecting to it, the applicant had expected that the first-instance court would schedule a hearing, as required by the rules of civil procedure (see paragraph 21 above), at which he could examine the expert and where the expert could address his objections.

His involvement was especially important given that those courts eventually refused to order the return of his son. Moreover, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant\u2019s participation in the expert evaluation would have been against the best interests of the child. On the contrary, it could have contributed to establishing what was in the child\u2019s best interests.
