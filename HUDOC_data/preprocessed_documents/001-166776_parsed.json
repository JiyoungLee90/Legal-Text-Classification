Serbia, cited above, \u00a7 14), the Constitutional Court failed to order the State to pay from its own funds the sums awarded in the domestic judgments in question and in respect of the second and the third applicants it dismissed the complaint concerning the right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions. Further, having regard to its case-law (Sto\u0161i\u0107\u00a0v.\u00a0Serbia, no. 64931/10, \u00a7\u00a7 66-68, 1\u00a0October 2013), the Court reiterates that the sums which the Constitutional Court awarded the applicants for non-pecuniary damage cannot be considered as sufficient redress (Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 211-216, ECHR 2006V). Therefore, these applicants must still be considered as victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.",
