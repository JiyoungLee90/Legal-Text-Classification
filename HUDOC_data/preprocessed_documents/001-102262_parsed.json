The decision to discontinue the proceedings was duly served on the applicant on 7 September 1999. On 8 September 1999 the decision was served on Ms Veronika Pint\u00e9rov\u00e1, according to the applicant the applicant's brother's wife, who had the same name and lived at the same address as the applicant's mother. The domestic court concluded that the decision had become final on 23 September 1999. Subsequently, the applicant's mother died on 18 August 2000. In 2001 the applicant initiated a fresh set of inheritance proceedings in respect of the deceased's assets. In these circumstances, the Court accepts the Government's argument concerning the presumption of correctness of a delivery slip and concerning the date when the first set of inheritance proceedings ended, namely 23\u00a0September\u00a01999.",
