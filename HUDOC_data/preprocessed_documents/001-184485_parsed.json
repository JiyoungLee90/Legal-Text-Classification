In particular, the Government adduced a document prepared by the prison authorities asserting that the applicant had been detained with another four of five inmates as a result of Law no. 4322/2015, which had included measures aimed at alleviating overcrowding in prisons (see paragraphs 11 and 20 above). On the contrary, the applicant claimed that he had shared the cell with another nine detainees which had resulted in a living space of 2.2 sq. m per detainee and that he had not benefitted from the provisions of the new law which had entered into force one year prior to his detention in Diavata Prison (see paragraphs 7 and 19 above).",

Once a credible and reasonably detailed description of the allegedly degrading conditions of detention, constituting a prima facie case of ill-treatment, has been made, the burden of proof is shifted to the respondent Government, who alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. They are required, in particular, to collect and produce relevant documents and provide a detailed account of an applicant\u2019s conditions of detention. Relevant information from other international bodies, such as the CPT, on the conditions of detention, as well as the competent national authorities and institutions, should also inform the Court\u2019s decision on the matter (see further Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 122-25).",

The Government initially stated that the applicant had had at his disposal personal space ranging from 3.14 to\u00a03.66\u00a0sq. m, as he had shared the cell with another five or six detainees. They later slightly changed that figure, submitting that the applicant had had at his disposal personal space ranging from 3.14 to 4.4. sq. m, as he had shared the cell with four to six detainees. They further provided the Court with a document stating that the total number of detainees during the applicant\u2019s seven-month stay in Diavata Prison varied between 460 and 500 detainees, a lower figure than at the time of the CPT report, thanks to measures taken in accordance with Law no. 4322/2015. In view of the total number of detainees at the material time, which had exceeded by at least 100 inmates the capacity of Diavata Prison (capacity of 358 detainees on the basis of allocation of 4 sq. m per detainee), the Court notes that the applicant could not possibly have had more than 4 sq. m at his disposal. It further notes that the applicant\u2019s allegations are corroborated by the CPT, which had visited Diavata Prison a year prior to the applicant\u2019s entry into it. In view, however, of the Government\u2019s argument that in the meantime measures aimed at alleviating prison overcrowding had been taken and had resulted in more than 3 sq. m being put at the disposal of each detainee, the Court will turn to the examination of the rest of the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention.",

Agreements of this nature \u2013 giving rise to obligations solely between lawyer and client \u2013 cannot bind the Court, which must assess the level of costs and expenses to be awarded with reference not only to whether the costs are actually incurred but also to whether they have been reasonably incurred (see Iatridis v. Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2000XI, and Stergiopoulos v. Greece, no.\u00a029049/12, \u00a7 63, 7 December 2017).",
