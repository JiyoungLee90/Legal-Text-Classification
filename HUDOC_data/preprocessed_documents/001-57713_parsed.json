It is well known that for a considerable time , or at least certain parts of that country, have been in a serious state of civil disorder, amounting at times to civil war. The authorities have taken steps to suppress the disorders and to locate and detain those responsible for them. These steps, together with the activities of the subversives, have naturally resulted in painful and distressing experiences for many persons innocently caught up in the troubles. As the troubles occurred principally in areas inhabited by Tamils, these are the people who have suffered most. The Secretary of State has in his decision letters expressed the view that army activities aimed at discovering and dealing with Tamil extremists do not constitute evidence of persecution of Tamils as such. This was not disputed by counsel for any of the applicants, nor was it seriously maintained that any sub-group of Tamils, such as young males in the north of the country, were being subjected to persecution for any Convention reason. It appears that the Secretary of State, while taking the view that neither Tamils generally nor any group of Tamils were being subjected to such persecution, also considered whether any individual applicant had been so subjected and decided that none of them had been. Consideration of what had happened in the past was material for the purpose of assessing the prospects for the future.",

The Convention does not enable the claimant to decide whether the danger of persecution exists. The Convention allows that decision to be taken by the country in which the claimant seeks asylum. Under the [Immigration] Act of 1971 applications for leave to enter the , including applications based on a claim to refugee status, are determined by the immigration authorities constituted by the Act. By the Rules made under the Act the appropriate authority to determine whether a claimant is a refugee is the Secretary of State. The task of the Secretary of State in the present proceedings was and is to determine in the case of each appellant whether the appellant will be in danger of persecution if he is sent back to . Danger from persecution is obviously a matter of degree and judgment. The Secretary of State accepts that an appellant who fears persecution is entitled to asylum in this country unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that there is no real and substantial danger of persecution. The Secretary of State has concluded that there is no real and substantial danger of persecution ... In the present case an examination of the decision-making process does not disclose any error on the part of the Secretary of State or justify the court in contradicting his view that the applicants will not be in danger of persecution if they are returned to Sri-Lanka.\"",

It is, therefore, necessary to look at the respondent\u2019s evidence in some detail\". He concluded that the Secretary of State\u2019s rejection of the claim for asylum should be quashed on the ground that \"in reaching his decision he took into account matters which ought not to have been taken into account and failed to take into account matters he should\". A similar approach was adopted by the High Court in the Yemoh case. In the Gaima case it was more a matter of the fairness of the procedures followed in reaching the decision to refuse political asylum in that the Court of Appeal held that the applicant was given insufficient opportunity to give her explanation of the facts taken into account by the Secretary of State in assessing her credibility. In his judgment, with which the other two judges agreed, Lord Justice May stressed that \"in these refugee asylum cases the court is entitled to, and should, subject administrative decisions to rigorous examination.

The national authority envisaged by Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention is one before which an effective remedy can be obtained for a violation of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention. Judicial review cannot grant any relief simply on the grounds that the facts of any given case disclose a breach of the Convention. It may well be that in some cases in which there has in fact been such a breach judicial review may be available to set aside the decision impugned on the grounds that a fatal procedural defect in English law has been proved but this latter ground would be the sole ground. In such a case the existence of a breach of the Convention would be simply a coincidence. The English courts will not review a decision by reason only of the fact that the deciding authority failed to consider whether or not there was a breach of the Convention (see the Soering judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, pp. 18-19, para. 35). The view of the Court on the effectiveness of judicial review expressed at para. 121 of the latter judgment can only be understood in the light of the circumstances of that case because there was no essential question of fact in issue and if there had been judicial review it would not have involved any disputed question of fact or any of the merits of that case. It was theoretically possible, but never put to the test, that the English courts would, as a matter of English law, regard \"the death row phenomenon\" as being so barbarous that any Secretary of State permitting such an extradition would have (in the words of Lord Diplock) reached a decision which was \"so outrageous in its defiance of ... accepted moral standards\" that it would have to be set aside as a matter of law on the grounds that it was one that no reasonable authority could have arrived at it. If such an event had occurred in the English courts that would have been the end of the affair and there would have been no breach of Article 3 (art. 3) and the matter would not have reached the Convention organs. If such an application for judicial review had been unsuccessful the matter would ultimately have been decided by the Court as it did and judicial review would not have been held to satisfy Article 13 (art. 13).",

This conclusion is confirmed by the opinions of associations or organisations especially well- qualified in this field, such as the British Refugee Council, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or Amnesty International. The Adjudicator recognised that the applicants\u2019 arguments were valid and the Government drew the correct conclusions from this by paying the applicants\u2019 travel expenses for their return.
