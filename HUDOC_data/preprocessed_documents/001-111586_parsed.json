In Kehaya and Others it concluded that the interference could not in consequence be deemed lawful in the sense of the Convention, not least because of the fundamental nature in a democratic society of the principle of rule of law of which the legal certainty principle forms part and which is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 76-77). The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion on the facts of the instant case. The present case does not concern re-opening of civil proceedings, within time-limits and under conditions regulated by law, but a failure to recognise the res judicata effect of a final judgment delivered in contentious proceedings. It cannot be considered that a public interest overriding the fundamental principle of legal certainty and the applicants\u2019 rights justified a re-examination of the dispute and the consequential unlawful interference with their possessions (ibid., \u00a7 76 in fine).",

Firstly, the applicants, in the absence of market evidence to the contrary, would have inevitably experienced certain delays in finding suitable tenants and would have incurred certain expenses to maintain the buildings. In addition, they have not shown that all buildings were habitable. Also, they would have been subjected to taxation on any revenue. Finally, the Court observes that there is no reliable information on rental prices in the  throughout the rental period available to it. It nevertheless considers that the applicants have undoubtedly suffered a certain loss of opportunity. Having regard to the large number of imponderables involved and the impossibility to quantify exactly this loss, the Court considers it appropriate to award the applicants jointly EUR 6,000 in that respect plus any tax that may be chargeable on this sum.",
