The applicant considered that Article 14 of the Articles of the Federation, which provided for the membership charge, clearly reflected its nature in that, as was provided therein, FII members paying an industry charge which was transferred to the FII should have that part deducted from their membership fees. Thus, by the levy and collection of the charge, membership of the FII was in fact made compulsory for others, although they enjoyed no rights vis-\u00e0-vis the FII. Consequently, the industry charge was merely a membership fee to the FII. The applicant submitted that he was a member of the MBA, to which he paid his fees and through which he considered his interests to be best served, and he had no wish to be a member of the FII. The latter pursued policies with which he disagreed and which were contrary to his own interests. The compulsory membership of the FII was incompatible with his right to freedom of association as protected by Article\u00a074 \u00a7 2 of the Icelandic Constitution and Article 11 of the Convention. The applicant also argued that by virtue of the 1993 Act, he was unjustifiably taxed in excess of other taxes and that, under the Act, a limited group was being taxed \u201cfor the benefit of another limited group or the restricted interests of others\u201d. Finally, he submitted that the imposition of the charge amounted to discrimination in breach of Article 65 of the Constitution, as the taxation was dependent upon the ownership structure of an enterprise, and the enumeration of activity code numbers, on which the taxation was based, was haphazard in nature.",

They argued that by law it was a tax levied by the State on particular groups of individuals and legal persons, in accordance with general and applicable standards, without anything being required in return. By the same Act, the decision had been taken to have the charge transferred to the FII, which was to use it for the promotion and development of Icelandic industry. Such an allocation of tax revenues to an association provided for by law did not mean that those who paid the relevant tax were thereby obliged by law to become members of it. The charge was not expected to be used for the benefit of the members alone, but for the benefit of all industries and industrial development in , under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry. Any discounts on membership fees were decided unilaterally by the FII, without any connection to the assessment and collection of the charge. The State also denied that the 1993 Act involved discrimination between persons who were in the appellant\u2019s situation and those who enjoyed an exemption from the charge. It was a reasonable and objective arrangement to exempt public enterprises from the charge, and it was in the nature of things that the considerations that applied to companies under public ownership were different from those relating to private enterprises. The State also argued that public support for industry and industrial development sometimes took the form of launching industrial activities that others were not capable of initiating. Finally, the number of publicly owned industrial enterprises had been greatly reduced in recent years. The State also disputed the allegation that the enumeration of activity code numbers governing the taxation had been haphazard.",

The use of the revenues was subject to the supervision of the Ministry of Industry. The Court accepted that this arrangement did not involve obligatory membership of the Federation of Icelandic Industries in breach of the Constitution and the European Convention [on Human Rights]. It also noted that even if the Federation of Icelandic Industries had exceeded the boundaries laid down in the [1993] Act, this could not have the effect of exempting the appellant from paying the charge. With this in mind, and in other respects by reference to the grounds stated in the contested judgment, the Court must reject the conclusion that the appellant\u2019s arguments in this regard may lead to a granting of his request. Bearing in mind that the Federation of Icelandic Industries is under a legal duty to use the revenues from the industry charge for promoting Icelandic industries and industrial development, and consequently for the benefit of the activities being taxed, the Court cannot accept that the legislature thus exceeded its powers.",

As regards this argument, it must be noted that various factors distinguish enterprises under public ownership from privately owned enterprises, and in various fields their taxation is governed by different considerations, as seen in Icelandic tax legislation in general. In his written submissions, the appellant did not present a comparison of his situation vis-\u00e0-vis any particular public enterprises. It has not been established that any discrimination has taken place between the appellant and the parties to whom the exemptions of the [1993] Act apply. Finally, the appellant bases his request on the assertion that the activity code enumeration, by reference to which taxation under section 2(1) of the 1993 Act takes place, is haphazard in nature. The charge is levied on industry, subsequently defined as any activity coming under the activity code numbers enumerated in the classification of Icelandic business activities in an appendix to the 1993 Act, as amended by Law no. 81/1996. Industry, thus defined, does not only cover manufacturing industry, but also processing and services, including the construction industry. This defines the activities to be included under the term \u2018industry\u2019 within the meaning of the [1993] Act, distinguishing them from other fields of economic activity, including activities that have developed within the fields of agriculture and fishing. Such classification of economic activity has furthermore been recognised as a basis for other forms of taxation other than the industry charge. The appellant\u2019s claim cannot be granted on the basis of the arguments presented.\u201d",

It included the observation that \u2018... it may be noted that industrial enterprises and self-employed persons in industry collect various taxes for public authorities, both from their employees and from the consumers. The tax collection they carry out and are responsible for amounts to thousands of millions annually, entirely without remuneration. It therefore seems reasonable that the State should undertake to collect, by way of compensation for these parties, a charge which amounts to only a small fraction of what they collect for the State. This source of revenue should create a financial basis for more active participation by professional federations within Icelandic industry in shaping future industrial development\u2019. The Act also contained a provision similar to that of the Act now in effect, that the Ministry of Industry should be sent an annual report on the use of the revenues derived from the charge. In this context, it was mentioned in the explanatory notes that this was a \u2018provision intended to ensure that public authorities will be given a reasonable account of how the industry charge is used\u2019.",

It was furthermore provided that the revenues derived from the charge should be transferred to the FII in their entirety, whereas under the previous Act they had been distributed between the Union of Icelandic Cooperative Societies, the Canning Industry Sales Office, the Federation of Icelandic Industrialists and the National Federation of Craftsmen.

According to the documents submitted, the association involves itself with political issues, for example as regards membership of the European Union and taxation in various fields. Pursuant to Article 8, each member of the Federation enjoys voting rights at its meetings in proportion to his paid membership fees.

It also appears from a comment in the Federation\u2019s reports on the use of the charge for the years 2002 and 2003 that the Federation does \u2018not keep separate accounts of whether the individual elements of the Federation\u2019s operations are financed by monies derived from membership fees, capital income, or the industry charge\u2019. A similar declaration on this point is found in the report to the Minister in respect of the year 2001, but a report for 2004 is not in the case file. The Federation\u2019s reports to the Minister are also in other respects similar from year to year. In fact the case file seems to permit the inference that part of the charge is used for the general management of the Federation. It cannot be seen from the submissions in this case that the Minister of Industry has made any observations concerning the use of the charge, and in a letter to the Master Builders\u2019 Association of 15 February 2002, following complaints relating to the use of the charge, he expresses the following opinion: \u2018As can be clearly seen from the Industry Charge Act, the FII has the unrestricted power to decide how the charge is allocated, and the Ministry of Industry cannot interfere with this as long as it remains within the framework of the law.\u2019 It can be seen from the submitted reports of the FII for the periods to which this case relates that the arrangement has been used for granting those members of the Federation who pay the industry charge a discount on their membership fees equal to the amount of the charge. As an example, the following comment in the Federation\u2019s report to the Minister of Industry for 2003 may be quoted: \u2018It may be pointed out that members who pay the industry charge have it deducted in full from their membership fees to the Federation. It would not be considered proper that companies within the Federation that are liable to the industry charge should pay more to the Federation\u2019s activities than companies that are members, but not liable to the charge. In this way all the member companies of the Federation make equal payments to the Federation, irrespective of whether they are liable to the industry charge or not. On the other hand other companies, remaining outside, only pay the industry charge and thus make a contribution to the general protection of the interests of Icelandic industries.\u2019",

Supplementary information received from the government at the Committee\u2019s request indicates that the basis for this practice is the single national collective agreement 2001-2002, according to which the amount of the deduction should be no less than 0.3% of salary and no more than the amount of union dues. The Committee observes that by virtue of section 9 of [Law] no. 130/1996 on collective labour agreements, collective agreements apply to all workers in the enterprise, irrespective of their length of service or trade-union membership. In these circumstances, the imposition of a fee on workers who are not members of a trade union constitutes a union security practice that is contrary to the right to organise.",

Prior to that, deductions were only possible with the agreement of both employer and employee. The Committee considers that the procedure for deducting trade union contributions from wages at source may not be prohibited or made obligatory by national legislation. It must be made a criminal offence to use such a procedure for illegitimate purposes, for example to secure information on trade-union membership. ...\u201d",

A monopoly situation imposed by law would be at variance with the principle of free choice of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organisations (ibid., paragraph 320).

The reasons which led the Committee to adopt this position are as follows. As a general rule, when a government can grant an advantage to one particular organisation or withdraw that advantage from one organisation in favour of another, there is a risk, even if such is not the government\u2019s intention, that one trade union will be placed at an unfair advantage or disadvantage in relation to the others, which would thereby constitute an act of discrimination. More precisely, by placing one organisation at an advantage or at a disadvantage in relation to the others, a government may either directly or indirectly influence the choice of workers regarding the organisation to which they intend to belong, since they will undeniably want to belong to the union best able to serve them, even if their natural preference would have led them to join another organisation for occupational, religious, political or other reasons. The freedom of the parties to choose is a right expressly laid down in [ILO] Convention No. 87 [concerning freedom of association and the right to organise].",

It was the FII which decided how to spend the funds it accrued in this way, guided by its policies and views and without regard to the views of the applicant and others who were obliged by law to contribute to its financing. For the reasons set out in particular in the opinion of the dissenting member of the Supreme Court, the applicant had been obliged through the compulsory payment of charges to be a member of the FII and/or to associate himself with others within the FII. Notwithstanding the compulsory character of the industry charge and the fact that FII members could have their charges deducted from their membership fees, the FII had reserved the right to deny the applicant and others like him membership.",

The amount of the industry charge was very low, constituting 0.08% of business turnover. It was not a membership fee but a tax imposed for a specific purpose laid down in statute, in the Industry Charge Act (\u201cthe 1993 Act\u201d), namely to promote industry and industrial development in Iceland. Like other taxes, the charge was collected by the State. In accordance with the Act, the funds were disbursed to the FII, which was obliged to use them for the stated purpose. It should be stressed that, even though the FII was a non-governmental organisation, it had been given a clear and legally prescribed role in one aspect, which was to use the industry charge for the benefit of industry as a whole.

The FII\u2019s use of funds derived from the industry charge had been subject to statutory conditions and effective public scrutiny. In this area, supervision was exercised in a manner fully complying with the requirements of transparency vis-\u00e0-vis persons who, like the applicant, paid the charge to the FII without being a member of it or otherwise affiliated to it. In this regard, the present case differed from that of Evaldsson and Others v. Sweden (no.\u00a075252/01, 13 February 2007). The fact that the FII granted its members who also paid the industry charge a discount on membership fees had no effect on the applicant\u2019s position.

The tax revenues that were transferred to the FII could not be viewed as a form of State subsidy unevenly distributed to one employer association and not to others. On the contrary, they were meant to cover the costs of the official duties imposed on the FII to promote Icelandic industry and industrial development. The reason why no other employer association received revenues from the industry charge was that no other association had been assigned such duties. Thus, there could be no question of discrimination between the FII and the traditional employer associations in the sense envisaged by the ILO Committee.",

Thus, the only consequences, if the applicant were to have refused to pay the industry charge, would have been financial pressure of the same type as that applied to taxes ordinarily.

However, this did not involve the adoption of a particular political view or convictions with which the applicant considered he had been associated contrary to his wishes.

In this respect, the degree of obligation to which the applicant was subjected may be regarded as significantly less serious than that in certain other cases examined by the Court, where an applicant\u2019s refusal to join a union resulted in the loss of his employment or professional licence and, in consequence, his means of livelihood (see, for example, Young, James and Webster, cited above, \u00a7 55, and Sigur\u00f0ur A. Sigurj\u00f3nsson, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36-37).

No other organisations, including the MBA, of which the applicant was a member, received funds derived from the industry charge. Unlike members of the FII, members of other organisations, such as the applicant, were not in a position to have the membership fees which they paid to their respective organisations reduced by the amounts that they had paid by way of the industry charge.

In his view, the imposition of the industry charge amounted to a deprivation of his possessions in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It was inconceivable that the industry charge paid to the FII under the guise of taxation could be viewed as justified in the general interest. Those who, like him, paid the charge were taxed separately, in excess of such other taxes as were imposed on taxpayers generally, without any relevant reasons being given, for instance a requirement that the tax be used for their benefit. This taxation of a restricted group for the benefit of another restricted group or in the interests of others could not be justified.
