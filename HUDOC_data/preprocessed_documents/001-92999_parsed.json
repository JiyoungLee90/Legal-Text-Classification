While owners of property in private ownership were private individuals (natural persons) and some private legal entities called \u201ccivil legal entities\u201d (gra\u0111anske pravne osobe) such as foundations, associations and religious communities, property in social ownership, according to the official doctrine, had no owner. Nevertheless, the federal State, the constituent Republics, municipalities being local government units and other various legal entities called \u201csocial legal entities\u201d (dru\u0161tvene pravne osobe), among which the most important ones were companies, known at the time as \u201corganisations of associated labour\u201d (organizacije udru\u017eenog rada) and later on as \u201csocially owned companies\u201d (dru\u0161tvena poduze\u0107a), were during the socialist period given certain quasi-ownership rights over property in social ownership, such as the right to use it (pravo kori\u0161tenja), the right to administer it (pravo upravljanja) or the right to dispose of it (pravo raspolaganja). Private individuals could also acquire certain rights over property in social ownership. Notably, many individuals living in socially owned flats had specially protected tenancies (stanarsko pravo) in respect of those flats.",

In such situations, which necessarily involve balancing of conflicting interests between current users of the property and persons from whom it had been taken, the State had a wide margin of appreciation. The Split County Court in its judgment relied on the decision of the Constitutional Court which abrogated section 388(4) of the 1996 Property Act because it retroactively allowed acquisition of ownership of socially owned property by adverse possession to persons who held the possession of it without any title and who knew that they could not have acquired its ownership through adverse possession. In such circumstances the impugned provision had thus created a completely new legal situation affording those persons preferential treatment over the former owners from whom the property had been taken by force during the socialist regime. Therefore, the abrogation had had a legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others and maintaining the principle of legal certainty. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision had not been contrary to the principle of proportionality because by adopting the Denationalisation Act the State had regulated the issue of restitution of, and compensation for, the nationalised and confiscated property, and it was under that Act the applicant should have, and indeed had, asserted his right in respect of the property confiscated from his late uncle.",

In this connection the Court notes that under section 428a of the Civil Procedure Act an applicant may file a petition for reopening of the civil proceedings in respect of which the Court has found a violation of the Convention. Given the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and the reasons for which it has found a violation of that Article, the Court considers that in the present case the most appropriate way of repairing the consequences of that violation is to reopen the proceedings complained of. As it follows that the domestic law allows such reparation to be made, the Court considers that there is no call to award the applicant any sum in respect of pecuniary damage.",
