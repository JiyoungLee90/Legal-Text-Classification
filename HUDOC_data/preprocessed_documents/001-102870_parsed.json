Furthermore, in its judgment of 9 February 1998, the Court of Appeal had found that the criminal investigation methods used in the applicant's case had not been illicit. The  found that the second situation did not arise in the applicant's case either, as it did not follow from the applicant's acquittal or from the contents of the criminal case-file as made available to the court that the applicant had not carried out the acts of which he had been suspected.

However, there is only demonstrated innocence when 'it is demonstrated by the ruling of the criminal court or otherwise by the documents relating to the criminal procedure that has not ended with a finding that the charges have been proven (bewezenverklaring) that the suspect is innocent and that the suspicion on which the action of the police or justice authorities was based was unfounded' (Supreme Court, 13 October 2006, ...

In my opinion what really distinguishes this case from the Puig Panella and Tendam cases is that the Court of Appeal's determining reasoning in refusing the applicant's claims was undoubtedly based on his failure to prove that there had never been any probable cause for the charges against him. The Court of Appeal's reasoning stating that the applicant's final judgment and acquittal did not show that he was innocent is clearly of a lateral or secondary nature, being an obiter dictum in the judgment of that Court.
