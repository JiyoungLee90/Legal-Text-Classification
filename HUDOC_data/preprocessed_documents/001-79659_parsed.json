Under section 5(3) of the Concession Act (Lov om konsesjon ved erverv av fast eiendom) of 31 May 1974 (no. 19), such requirements applied to the extent that it was deemed necessary to prevent private properties intended for permanent residential use from being transformed into holiday homes. Provisions to this effect were further contained in Regulation (forskrift) no.\u00a02089 of 14 December 1984, issued under the above-mentioned Act in respect of the Tj\u00f8me Municipality, one of the few municipalities in  which applied permanent residence requirements for all-year residences. The purpose was to fend off pressures exerted on the local community by the exceptionally high demand for holiday homes in the Tj\u00f8me area, an attractive holiday destination for a large number of people residing notably in the  region. There was also a concern that too many residences were unoccupied during off-season periods.",

Had the T\u00f8nsbergs Blad limited itself to stating this, it would have made an accusation that was true. ... Mr Rygh's name was put on the preliminary 'tip-off' list, based on tip-offs from inhabitants, local politicians and others. The High Court has no doubt that a number of local inhabitants could have believed that the residence requirements were breached in so far as Rygh's property was concerned, given the fact that it concerned an all-year residence which had been vacated and used as a holiday home. The mayor of the municipality has explained that he was of the opinion that the permanent residence requirements were breached, as has Mr S\u00e6ter, the director of the Planning and Building Department. However, Mr S\u00e6ter explained in the proceedings before the High Court that, at that time, he had not conducted a further investigation of the property. His view that the property was subject to the permanent residence requirements had been based on his belief that it had been converted from an older residence. He was fully aware that permanent residence requirements did not apply where a person had acquired an open plot of land and then built a house on it. Mr S\u00e6ter also explained that, when he had told the journalist Mr Wilhelmsen that a list would shortly be submitted to the , he was aware that the list would have to be examined first. According to the High Court's understanding of Mr S\u00e6ter, there had been no further elaboration of the preliminary tip-off list since autumn 1999. ... Since Mr S\u00e6ter was well aware of the exception to the residence requirements for new buildings on open plots of land, he would have quickly discovered that no obligation of residence applied here. ... The High Court further notes that to date none of the names that were on the provisional tip-off list from the autumn of 1999 have been transmitted to the County Governor because the Municipality believed that there was a breach of the residence requirements.",

As regards the facts, a unanimous High Court has found that this was a provisional 'tip-off list' based on tips from inhabitants and local politicians in the Municipality. It had been drawn up by the municipal administration in October 1999, and bore the title 'Properties which should be verified in relation to the residence requirements. (Not public)'.

The reliance on anonymous sources otherwise prevents the courts from testing whether the journalist displayed due care by employing that source; see Rt 1987-764, p. 771, and the European Court of Human Rights' judgment in McVicar, \u00a7 86.

In general, the protection of the expression will be stronger if it concerns matters of public interest, value judgments, imparting of information, a public person, and if there are strong reasons for holding the allegation to be true.

For T\u00f8nsbergs Blad as the local newspaper in the region, this was naturally a topic for critical coverage. The fact that there existed a list of properties that there was a question of referring to the County Governor must also be regarded as being of interest for the residents of the region and the newspaper's readership. Which properties or owners were on the list, on the other hand, must in my opinion be regarded as of limited public interest. If any of the individuals who were entered on the 'tip-off list' \u2013 for example owing to their function, position of trust or participation in the public debate \u2013 had had a special connection to the issue of residence requirements, it might have been different. It may well be the case that the modern news industry makes considerable use of known persons to arouse the interest of the readers. But I agree with the High Court that the fact that Mr Rygh was a relatively famous person as the executive VP of Orkla does not mean that he can automatically be regarded as a public person in relation to the rules on residence requirements. The majority's emphasis on his not having involved himself in the public debate on this topic appears very consonant with the European Court of Human Rights' reasoning in its judgment of 25 November 1999 in Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway (no. 23118/93), \u00a7 52, first sub-paragraph, with its emphasis on Bratholm's 'participation in public debate' as the central theme.",

I would first remark that there did not exist any written documentation from the municipality's processing of the matter that could support the allegation, over and above what the unanimous High Court has characterised as 'the provisional tip-off list'. As mentioned, the Supreme Court must in my opinion base its decision on what the High Court has found with regard to the use of an anonymous source. I cannot therefore see that it can be found that the newspaper had other sources or other grounds for its allegation that Mr Rygh's name was on a list that the Municipality should 'in the near future refer to the County Governor'. This was the basis for the accusation that the Municipality considered that Mr Rygh had breached the residence requirements. Even if use of anonymous sources is a recognised tool of modern journalism, such use of sources will imply a stricter requirement of due care. Moreover, in such a situation, it must to a considerable degree be the newspaper's risk that the factual information conveyed may turn out to be untrue.",

In this connection I would not lay any particular emphasis on the fact that representatives of the Municipality may \u2013 before consideration of the tip-off list \u2013 have considered that the residence requirement applied to the Rygh family's property. Nor did the journalist claim to have based his story on information from these people. Otherwise, in my view, there are generally grounds for emphasising the big difference between being on a so-called tip-off list that has not been considered by the Municipality and being on a list that the Municipality has decided, after processing and consideration, to refer to the County Governor, who is the central government's supervisory and administrative authority.",

When the expression concerns a case of public interest, the role of the press as a 'public watchdog' means that interference with freedom of expression requires a weighty justification.

But exceptions to this may be contemplated. If the accusation is to enjoy protection under freedom of expression, it must at the least be demanded that the news coverage in which it is contained is of public interest and additionally that the necessary care was taken by the newspaper. I consider that these criteria were met in this case.",

The question is whether it is in the public interest to publicise a possible breach of the residence requirements on the part of Mr Rygh. I would first mention that in modern journalism it is a common and recognised method of popular education to illustrate general and usually difficult questions by means of the roles and fates of individuals, when they are considered especially relevant. When individuals are unwillingly brought forward, and are subjected to accusations of crime and so forth, a mass medium must have good reasons for this, for example if the person concerned has sought out the light of publicity in this area, or is a prominent person in society who must accept that special demands are made of his integrity and sense of responsibility to society. At the time in question Mr Rygh belonged to the top management of one of the country's biggest industrial conglomerates, and his name was not unfamiliar in the news. In my opinion individuals who have sought prominent positions in society, which require a special degree of trust from the public, must to some extent accept that the media will follow them with the eyes of Argus, not just in their professional activities but also when, in the more private sphere, they challenge laws and other regulations that are particularly meant to safeguard the interests of society. It is therefore possible to conceive of violations of the law by these individuals that in the circumstances will be of public interest, even if the breach carries no criminal responsibility or the penalties are minor. In this case the newspaper thought that Mr Rygh had broken the rules on residence requirements, which in public opinion was and is of major social importance, even if such a contravention is not a criminal offence. I have difficulty seeing that it was not a matter of public interest if such a very prominent person as Mr Rygh had not complied with the residence requirements with regard to his property in the .",

It must be noted that the journalist used an anonymous source when he wrote that Mr Rygh was on the Municipality's list of those who were considered to have breached the residence requirements. It is undisputed that for a long while T\u00f8nsbergs Blad had been working on this topic, and that the journalist \u2013 who lived at Tj\u00f8me \u2013 had been in contact with several representatives of the Municipality. It must also be noted that the journalist, on application to the Municipality, received confirmation that there existed a list that the Municipality had drawn up, but the mistake was that this was a list of individuals who, according to external tip-offs, had breached the obligation, and not a list of individuals whom the Municipality had already found to have breached it. The newspaper thus confused the tip-off list, which contained Mr\u00a0Rygh's name, with the list that the Municipality was indeed to refer to the  for a decision on whether the residence requirements had been complied with.",

The journalist had reason to believe that a municipal assessment had been carried out at that point. In the story of 8 June 2000 the director of the Planning and Building Department confirmed that technical services would 'in the very near future' write to the  regarding individuals whom the Municipality suspected of breaching the residence requirements. The director also stated: 'We know that the residence requirements are not being complied with for several properties in the Municipality'. And the director did not wish to say 'which properties are on the list we are referring to the '. This last statement gave the clear impression that the list which the Municipality had assessed already existed. In addition, prominent representatives of the  \u2013 such as the mayor and the director of the Planning and Building Department \u2013 subsequently stated that, at the time when the newspaper had carried the controversial reportage, they had been of the opinion that Mr Rygh was in breach of the residence requirements. This is clearly apparent from the High Court's judgment, both the minority and majority remarks. T\u00f8nsbergs Blad was therefore close to the truth in its story of 8 June 2000. I would also mention that, according to the story, the newspaper had approached Mr\u00a0Rygh for his view of the matter, but he did not want to comment beyond stating that the fact that his name was on the list must have been due to a misunderstanding.\u201d",

This limitation on the Supreme Court's jurisdiction must have been foreseeable for the applicants. Moreover, the new evidence significantly altered the substance of their complaint under Article 10 of the Convention. As a result the national courts were not given a proper opportunity to review from the angle of Article 10 of the Convention the subject matter of the applicants' complaint as altered by this new evidence, which is the purpose of the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. This provision also requires that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at Strasbourg must first be made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention must be used (see Cardot v. France, judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 18, \u00a7 34; and Akdivar and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports 1996IV, p. 1210, \u00a7\u00a066). Therefore, the Court considers that the witness statements in question fall outside the scope of its review and will accordingly not rely on them. If the Court were to accept such new evidence, it could lead to the unreasonable consequences of making it a forum for reopening of national proceedings. Such a function would not be consistent with its subsidiary role in the Convention protection system.",

Whether or not a publication concerns an issue of public concern should depend on a broader assessment of the subject matter and the context of the publication. The newspaper article of 8 June 2000 had its background in concerns by local inhabitants and politicians about the failure of certain property owners within the Municipality to comply with applicable residence requirements. There was also a perception that affluent persons had found ways of circumventing or exploiting loopholes in the rules. That had led the applicant newspaper to highlight the coverage by focusing on two prominent and well-known personalities, one, Mr Rygh, from the world of industry and the other, Mrs H.K., from the world of culture. The Court does not find that the article was intended to damage Mr Rygh's reputation (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.  [GC], no. 21980/93, \u00a7\u00a063, ECHR\u00a01999III). Rather, the purpose was to illustrate a problem that the public had an interest in being informed about. His name (like that of Mrs\u00a0H.K.) had featured on the provisional tip-off list drawn up by the Municipality of names of persons suspected by local inhabitants and politicians of having breached the residence requirements. While it is true that the information published about Mr Rygh did not directly address his role as an industrial leader, the Court is unable to agree with the Government's suggestion that it related exclusively to his private life. The Court shares the opinion of the dissenting judge of the Supreme Court, Mr\u00a0Justice Rieber-Mohn (see paragraph 40 above), that a possible failure of a public figure to observe laws and regulations aimed at protecting serious public interests, even in the private sphere, may in certain circumstances constitute a matter of legitimate public interest (see Fressoz and Roire, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050).

In addition to the above-mentioned qualifications and counterbalancing elements contained in the 8 June 2000 issue, regard should be had to the fact that, on 30 June 2000, the day after the journalist was informed about the exchange of correspondence between Mr Rygh and the Municipality's Chief Executive Officer, Mr Hans\u00f8, the newspaper published a follow-up article based on an interview by the journalist with Mr Hans\u00f8. The article made it clear that Mr Rygh's name had been removed from the Municipality's list and stated the reasons why the residence requirements did not apply to the property used by him. This must have considerably reduced any injury to Mr Rygh's reputation caused by the report of 8 June 2000. In the article of 8 August 2000 the newspaper, referring to its previous news reports of 8 and 30 June 2000, further emphasised these clarifications. The Court is unable to share the Supreme Court's view that the reports of 30\u00a0June and 8 August 2000, although published some time after the 8\u00a0June\u00a02000 issue, were of negligible significance for the newspaper coverage seen as a whole (see paragraph 51 of the Supreme Court's judgment quoted in paragraph 39 above).

The methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably, depending among other things on the medium in question; it is not for the Court, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted by journalists (see Jersild, cited above, pp. 23-25, \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 34; Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a063; and Bergens Tidende and Others, cited above, \u00a7 57).",

The High Court reasoned that, in view of the impossibility for the courts to verify the extent to which the journalist had acted with due care in relying on the anonymous source, the defamatory allegation ought to be regarded as the newspaper's own. Similarly, the Supreme Court proceeded from the premise that in the use of anonymous sources a stricter duty of care applied and that it would largely be the risk of the newspaper if factual information originating from such sources were false (see paragraphs 43 and 47 of the Supreme Court's judgment quoted in paragraph 39 above). The Court accepts this reasoning and finds no special grounds for dispensing the newspaper from its ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals.",

The journalist had worked on the item over a considerable period, since the autumn of 1999. He was in possession of the tip-off list (entitled \u201cProperties which should be verified in relation to the residence requirements. (Not public)\u201d). This was an official document drawn up by the municipal administration on 11 October 1999 and presented the following day to the Municipal Standing Committee at a meeting open to the public. From the autumn of 1999 he made a number of enquiries to the Municipality on the subject and on 7 June 2000 he interviewed the director of the Municipality's Planning and Building Department, Mr S\u00e6ter (see paragraphs 9 to 11 above).",

However, at the High Court's hearing, both the director of the Municipality's Planning and Building Department and the mayor testified that they, at the time, had been of the view that Mr Rygh was in breach of the residence requirements (see paragraph 33 above). Thus, it was shown that two presumably representative and reliable officials within the Municipality assuming key roles in the handling of the residence matter in substance held the same opinion as that attributed to the Municipality as a whole in the impugned passages when they were published on 8 June 2000.",

This is an issue that should be determined in the light of the situation as it presented itself to T\u00f8nsberg Blad then, rather than with the benefit of hindsight (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7 66), offered by the revelations made subsequently that Mr\u00a0Rygh's name did not actually appear on any list to be transmitted to the County Governor as described in the interview with the director of the Planning and Building Department. Although the High Court stressed in its judgment that the latter had been aware when talking to the journalist on 7 June 2000 that he had to carry out further checks, there is nothing to indicate that this awareness had been imparted to the journalist or that the latter had knowledge of it from any other source by the time of publication. Thus, whether or not at the time of publication the director of the Planning and Building Department and the mayor held an informed opinion cannot be decisive for the truth of the newspaper's allegation about the substance of the Municipality's opinion at that time.",
