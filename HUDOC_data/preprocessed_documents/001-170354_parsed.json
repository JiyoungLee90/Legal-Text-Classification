According to the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Home authorities, a number of fraudsters had already cheated people of large sums of money with the help of mobile phones.

This stemmed from Article 10 of the Code of the Execution of Sentences (see paragraph 29 below). There was no legal provision in Lithuania permitting prisoners to use the Internet. Even so, the prisoners\u2019 right to have computers could not be interpreted so widely as to encompass the right to have Internet access.

The organisation of regime activities in such establishments \u2013 which have a fairly rapid turnover of inmates \u2013 is not a straightforward matter. Clearly, there can be no question of individualised treatment programmes of the sort which might be aspired to in an establishment for sentenced prisoners. However, prisoners cannot simply be left to languish for weeks, possibly months, locked up in their cells, and this regardless of how good material conditions might be within the cells. The CPT considers that one should aim at ensuring that prisoners in remand establishments are able to spend a reasonable part of the day (8 hours or more) outside their cells, engaged in purposeful activity of a varied nature. Of course, regimes in establishments for sentenced prisoners should be even more favourable.\u201d",

The Ministry, as the official body responsible for providing information about study programmes, had indicated no alternative ways or means for the applicant to obtain that information. The applicant further submitted that information about study programmes and the opportunities for distant studies was of a constantly evolving nature.

For the applicant, such access was indispensable for the purposes of obtaining education-related information (see paragraph 17 above). The Court has also recently observed that an increasing amount of services and information is available only via the Internet (see Kalda v. Estonia, no.\u00a017429/10, \u00a7 52, 19\u00a0January 2016). That being so, and given that the applicant\u2019s complaint is construed as concerning the right to receive information \u2013 thus falling under Article 10 of the Convention \u2212 as opposed to a complaint about the denial of education as such, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s objection concerning the failure to properly exhaust the domestic remedies by, firstly, not having written letters to Lithuanian educational institutions in Lithuania and by, secondly, not having pursued court proceedings against the Ministry (see paragraph 41 above). As to the first avenue, it was not even a remedy within the sense of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. As to the second avenue, the Court notes that as a remedy for his grievance of lack of access to information the applicant chose to pursue court proceedings against the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Home which had effectively barred him from accessing the Ministry\u2019s website. In this context the Court recalls that in the event of there being a number of domestic remedies which an individual can pursue, that person is entitled to choose a remedy which addresses his or her essential grievance. In other words, when a remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Leja v. Latvia, no.\u00a071072/01, \u00a7 46, 14 June 2011).",

The Court acknowledges that in\u00a02006, when the applicant requested Internet access in the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Home, no such explicit prohibition on the use of Internet in prisons existed. The ban on the use of \u201cother means of electronic communication\u201d, which could be understood as also encompassing means providing Internet access, was only introduced in March 2010 in Annex no.\u00a01 of the Code of the Execution of Sentences (see paragraph 31 above). Be that as it may, the Court notes that in 2006 numerous domestic legal norms did indeed provide for an explicit ban on telephone and radio communications by prisoners, prohibited the prisoners from working with radio and electronic communication devices, and required that all correspondence by prisoners\u2019 be conducted in writing and sent by post via the prison authorities (see paragraphs 29, 30 and 32 above). It is not unreasonable to hold that all those prohibitions could have been circumvented, if prisoners were allowed access to Internet. The Court therefore does not consider that the applicant was left without an indication that there was a prohibition on the use of the Internet in prison. It therefore concludes that the prohibition on the inmates\u2019 use of the Internet in prison was \u201cprescribed by law\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",

This was moreover noted by the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Home authorities, as well as by the administrative courts of two instances (see paragraphs 14, 16 and 19 above).

The information on that site was regularly updated to reflect, for example, admission requirements for the current academic year. It also provided up to date information from the Lithuanian Labour Exchange about job vacancies and unemployment (see paragraph 7 above). It is not unreasonable to hold that such information was directly relevant to the applicant\u2019s interest in obtaining education, which is in turn of relevance for his rehabilitation and subsequent reintegration into society. As underlined by the CPT, a satisfactory programme of activities, including education, is of crucial importance for the well-being of all detainees, including prisoners awaiting trial. This is all the more relevant in relation to sentenced prisoners (see paragraph 35 above), and the applicant, who was serving a sentence in the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Home, was one such prisoner (see paragraph\u00a05 above). In fact, as regards the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Home, the CPT specifically noted after its 2008 visit that steps should be taken to ensure that all sentenced prisoners in that prison were able to engage in purposeful activities of a varied nature, such as educational programmes (see point 49 in fine of the CPT report, quoted in Mironovas and Others v.\u00a0Lithuania, nos.\u00a040828/12, 29292/12, 69598/12, 40163/13, 66281/13, 70048/13 and 70065/13, \u00a7 65, 8\u00a0December 2015).",

Indeed, in order to make a specific request to an educational institution one would need to be aware of the competencies of that institution and the services provided by it. Such preliminary information would be provided by the AIKOS website. The Court furthermore notes the applicant\u2019s argument that the information about the study programmes was of a constantly evolving nature (see paragraph\u00a040 above). This fact is also highlighted on the AIKOS website itself (see paragraph 7 above).",

It is true that the Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Home authorities pointed out the presence of a secondary school in that prison, as well as the possibility of following computer courses at Elektr\u0117nai vocational school (see paragraph 18 above). However, this appears to be a very remote proposition in relation to the applicant\u2019s wish to acquire a second university degree (see paragraph\u00a06 above). In the present case the Court also observes that the prison authorities or the Lithuanian courts did not even go so far as to argue that extended Internet access could incur additional costs for the State (see paragraphs 14, 15, 16 and 19 above). Whilst the security considerations arising from prisoners\u2019 access to Internet, as such, and cited by the prison authorities (see paragraph\u00a014 above) may be considered as relevant, the Court notes that the domestic courts failed to give any kind of consideration to the fact that the applicant asked for access to a website created and administered by the Ministry of Education and Science, which was a State institution. In fact, both courts were completely silent on the matter of education (see paragraphs 16 and 19 above).",

The Court considers that these developments reflect the important role the Internet plays in people\u2019s everyday lives, in particular since certain information is exclusively available on Internet. Indeed, as has already been established in this case, the AIKOS website provides comprehensive information about learning possibilities in Lithuania. In this connection it is also noteworthy that the Lithuanian authorities did not even consider a possibility of granting the applicant limited or controlled Internet access to this particular website administered by a State institution, which could have hardly posed a security risk.",
