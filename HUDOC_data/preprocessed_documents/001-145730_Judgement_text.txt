The case originated in an application (no. 14902/04) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos (“the applicant company”), on 23 April 2004.
In a judgment delivered on 20 September 2011 (“the principal judgment”), the Court held that in the 2000 Tax Assessment proceedings the applicant company did not have sufficient time for preparation of the case at first instance and on appeal, in breach of Article 6 of the Convention (§§ 534-551 of the principal judgment), that the assessment of the penalties relating to 2000 and the doubling of the penalties for 2001 were unlawful and in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (§§ 563-575), and that in the enforcement proceedings against the applicant company the domestic authorities failed to strike a fair balance between the legitimate aim of these proceedings and the measures employed, in breach of the same Convention provision (§§ 645-658). The Court dismissed the remainder of the applicant company’s complaints.
Under Article 41 of the Convention the applicant company sought just satisfaction of 37,981,000,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage and submitted that the judgment of 20 September 2011 constituted sufficient just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage. The applicant company further requested payment of 4,333,105 pounds sterling (GBP) and 762,148 dollars (USD) in respect of fees, costs and expenses.
Since the question of the application of Article 41 of the Convention was not ready for decision, the Court reserved it and invited the Government and the applicant company to submit, within three months, their written observations on that issue and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (ibid., § 671 of the principal judgment, and point 10 of the operative provisions).
The applicant company and the Government each filed written observations on 13 June 2012. Both parties submitted further written observations and then replied to each other’s observations on 31 July 2012, 1 March and 15 May 2013.
The composition of the Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 23 § 3 of the Convention and Rule 26 § 4 of the Rules of Court. Pursuant to these provisions, Christos Rozakis, Nina Vajić, Sverre Erik Jebens and Giorgio Malinverni continued to sit in the case following the expiry of their terms of office.
