The court accepted that the applicant had honoured her contract with the cooperative and had thus acquired a claim to a particular flat, the one which was given to L. Referring to a 2003 ruling by the Constitutional Court, the court refused to annul the flat purchases by Ch. and then K. because they were protected \u201cpurchasers in good faith\u201d within the meaning of Article 167 of the Civil Code; the court indicated, however, that a claim under Article 302 of the Code would be a proper course of action (see paragraphs 29 and 30 below). The court also observed that any of the above claims could be brought by an \u201cowner\u201d. The court reiterated that only an official certificate from the State register could prove ownership title (see paragraph 31 below). Accordingly, the court refused to accept the applicant's membership card as valid proof of her title to the flat at issue (see, however, paragraphs 14 and 17 above). The court also rejected the applicant's eviction claim against Ms K, because only the proven owner could seek eviction. However, the court awarded the applicant 3,000 Russian roubles (RUB) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and RUB 2,000 in litigation costs (lawyer's fees, photocopying fees, compensation for loss of time).
