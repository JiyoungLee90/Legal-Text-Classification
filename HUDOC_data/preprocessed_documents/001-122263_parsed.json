The investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, but it appears that no significant investigative measures were taken to identify those responsible for the abduction. In such circumstances, contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, the Court considers that the applicants could not be required to challenge every single decision of the district prosecutor\u2019s office in court.
