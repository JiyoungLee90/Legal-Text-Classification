The aim of criminal court proceedings is the protection of the rights and lawful interests of victims of criminal offences and the protection of a person from unlawful and ungrounded accusation, conviction and restriction of his, or her, rights and freedoms (Article 6).
Where the defendant absconds or his “psychiatric disorder”, or other serious illness, precludes his appearance in court, the court shall suspend the proceedings until he has been found or has recovered and shall continue the proceedings in respect of other defendants. If the separation of the proceedings impedes the examination of the criminal case, the entire trial shall be suspended (Article 253 § 3).
In the cases stipulated in paragraph 5 of Article 247 of the Code, at the request of the parties, the examination of the case shall be conducted in the absence of the defendant (Article 253 § 4). In exceptional cases the examination of the case concerning “serious” or “particularly serious” criminal offences may be conducted in the absence of a defendant who is not in the territory of the Russian Federation and/or declines to appear in court, provided that this person has not been held accountable for the criminal offence in question in the territory of a foreign state (Article 247 § 5). The participation in a hearing of a defence lawyer called upon by the defendant or appointed by the court is mandatory (Article 247 § 6).
