Firstly, the applicant had to be detained and secondly, the impugned decision on his detention had to have been in force at the time of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision. Such practice had a legal and procedural justification, in that the Constitutional Court had wanted to keep its powers of review practical and effective by restricting its examination to existing decisions on detention. As the applicant had not lodged his constitutional complaint against the decisions on his detention of 6 and 14 June 2013 until 5 July 2013 (see paragraph 12 above), and as a new decision on his detention had in the meantime been adopted on 8 July 2013 (see paragraph 14 above), the Constitutional Court on 10 July 2013 had declared his complaint inadmissible without examining it on the merits.
