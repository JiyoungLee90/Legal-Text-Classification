They argued that it constituted a reference to the fact that their child had not been christened and thereby revealed their religious beliefs. On 6 March 2018 the Supreme Administrative Court, after citing Articles 25 and 26 of Law no.\u00a0344/1976 (see paragraph 8 below), rejected the application as inadmissible, holding that the applicants lacked legal interest to act. In particular, Law no.\u00a0344/1976 provided that the first name of a child could be registered only by naming, that is to say by the parents or the child\u2019s official guardians declaring the name of the child before the competent registry office, irrespective of whether the child would later be christened. Therefore, the note \u201cnaming\u201d next to the third applicant\u2019s name merely repeated the title of Article\u00a025 of Law no. 344/1976, and was the only legal way of acquiring a\u00a0name. It could not therefore be claimed that it constituted grounds for discrimination and caused the applicants the alleged harm.",

However, registers were not accessible to everyone. Moreover, that note did not appear on the extracts of the birth certificate which the third applicant would be required to submit to schools and other public services. Therefore, there was no chance that she would be subjected to differential treatment owing to her religious beliefs, and the alleged disadvantage caused to the applicants, if any, was insignificant. The fact that they had not referred to any specific incident proved that point. In addition, they complained that their religious beliefs were revealed by the handwritten note \u201cnaming\u201d, while at the same time parents were required to register their religion when registering a birth, and the first and second applicants had never complained about that. The abovementioned arguments proved that the applicants had not suffered any significant disadvantage on account of the alleged violation of the Convention, nor was the Court compelled to examine the case out of respect for human rights. Lastly, the applicants\u2019 complaint had been thoroughly examined by the Supreme Administrative Court. Therefore, all three criteria under Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 (b) of the Convention had been met and the application should be declared inadmissible.",

However, in the circumstances of the present case and contrary to the Government\u2019s allegations, the additional note next to the name of the third applicant was not a mistake made inadvertently, but rather an intentional registration of a true piece of information, that is to say that the third applicant had acquired her name by the act of naming. That information, however, should not figure on her birth certificate, as it revealed the applicants\u2019 religious beliefs. Therefore, the birth certificate was correct and did not contain any inaccurate information for the applicants to request its correction through the procedure provided for by Article 13 of Law no. 344/1976 and Article 782 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

The issue that arose was one of general interest in the Greek legal order, because since 1976, the law had provided for \u201cnaming\u201d as the only legal way of acquiring a name. However, registrars continued to consider christening as an alternative way of legally obtaining a name and, therefore, they continued to note next to the first name of a newborn child whose parents declared the child\u2019s name by the civil act of naming, the words \u201cnaming\u201d, as opposed to acquiring the name by christening. Against that background, the fact that some parents chose not to name their child through christening revealed something about their religious beliefs. Therefore, the applicants had suffered significant disadvantage due to the violation of the negative aspect of their rights under Article 9 of the Convention.",

When the first and second applicants were born, which was prior to 1976, christening had been the only legal way of acquiring a\u00a0name. Therefore, anyone born prior to 1976 had had to be christened in order to have a name, irrespective of whether they were true Christians or not.

The Court also reiterates that it is incumbent on the Government pleading non-exhaustion to satisfy it that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see, in particular, Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999V; Sejdovic v.

Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her of the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v.

Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case. In other words, the absence of any \u201csignificant disadvantage\u201d can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant. However, the applicant\u2019s subjective perception cannot alone suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, with further references, C.P. v. the United Kingdom (dec.) no. 300/11, \u00a7\u00a042, 6\u00a0September 2016). A violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest (see Korolev v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a025551/05, ECHR\u00a02010-V).",

In particular, since 1976 Greek legislation had recognised the civil act of naming as the sole way in which an individual could acquire a name. However, there was a\u00a0longstanding administrative practice on the part of the registry offices presenting christening as another, alternative way of acquiring a name, and circulars issued by the Ministry of the Interior instructed registrars to accept christening as a declaration of a name. The existence of such a practice was proven from the circumstances of the present case and was corroborated by the Greek Ombudsman\u2019s observations. In that context, the inscription of the word \u201cnaming\u201d next to the third applicant\u2019s name indicated the absence of christening and, as such, the philosophical and religious affiliation of the first and second applicants, as the parents of the third applicant. On the contrary, when parents declared the christening of their child, the name given was registered without any note next to it, as at the same time a\u00a0section of the birth certificate concerning christening was completed.",

Such misperception was sustained by the administrative practice. The word \u201cnaming\u201d was added only when one chose to declare the name of one\u2019s child without having christened him or her. On the other hand, if parents when declaring the birth of their child explicitly stated that the child would later be christened, then the name of the child was left blank and filled in once the christening had taken place.

The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it.

In this regard, the Court has also held that the right to manifest one\u2019s religion or beliefs also has a\u00a0negative aspect, namely an individual\u2019s right not to be obliged to disclose his or her religion or beliefs and not to be obliged to act in such a way that it is possible to conclude that he or she holds \u2013 or does not hold \u2013 such beliefs.

In particular, the observations filed by the Greek Ombudsman before the Court demonstrate a widely held belief and subsequent practice on the part of some registries that naming is one of the two available ways in which a child can acquire a name, the other being christening. Moreover, the Court cannot see why it would be necessary to indicate \u201cnaming\u201d next to the third applicant\u2019s name, thereby repeating the title of Article 25 of Law no.\u00a0344/1976, if not in order to distinguish it from something else. That conclusion is further reinforced by the problematic structure of the birth certificate as described in paragraph 47 above (see also see also paragraph\u00a07 concerning the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s considerations and paragraph 8 concerning the content of the birth registration act according to the domestic legislation). In particular, on the right side of the document, there is a section concerning christening, including the name given, which in the third applicant\u2019s case has been left blank.

That conclusion is further reinforced by the section concerning christening that is included in the birth registration act which in the third applicant\u2019s case has been left blank. Such information appearing in a public document issued by the State constitutes an interference with the right of all of the applicants not to be obliged to manifest their beliefs, which is inherent in the notion of freedom of religion and conscience as protected by Article 9 of the Convention.
