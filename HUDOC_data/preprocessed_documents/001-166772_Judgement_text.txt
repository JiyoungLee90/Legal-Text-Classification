The case originated in three applications (nos. 20750/04, 39413/07 and 39657/07) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Russian nationals (“the applicants”). The applicants’ details and the dates of their applications to the Court appear in the Appendix.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants complained, inter alia, of the quashing of final judgments in their favour by way of supervisory review between 2003 and 2008.
.  On various dates indicated in the Appendix these complaints were communicated to the respondent Government.
All the applicants took part in the clean-up operation at the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site. They were subsequently registered disabled, and became entitled to various social benefits.
Between 2003 and 2006 the applicants successfully brought a number of proceedings against the welfare authorities, seeking inflation adjustment of these benefits.
The judgments in the applicants’ favour either remained unenforced for a long period of time or were quashed in supervisory review proceedings and subsequently on the basis of newly discovered circumstances for those which were based on the findings of the judgments quashed in supervisory review (see the Appendix).
The relevant domestic provisions governing the supervisory review procedure in force between 1 February 2003 and 7 January 2008 is summed up in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kot v. Russia (no. 20887/03, § 17, 18 January 2007).
