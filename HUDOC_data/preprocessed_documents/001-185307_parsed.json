Accordingly, any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors, including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities, discrimination against the targeted group, the tone and content of the speech, the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate. For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website. Similarly, artistic expression should be considered with reference to its artistic value and context, given that art may be used to provoke strong feelings without the intention of inciting violence, discrimination or hostility.",

The Government also referred to the witness statements of three police officers, who had pointed out at the trial that they had perceived the impugned text as insulting and targeting all police officers indiscriminately rather than only the \u201cdishonest\u201d ones. The Government also pointed out that some other witnesses had stated that a number of bloggers had been \u201coutraged\u201d by the applicant\u2019s comment and had considered it to be extremely harsh (see paragraph 18 above). The Government thus argued that, in view of the adduced evidence, the domestic courts had been justified in their finding that the applicant\u2019s comment could not have been regarded as a criticism of law-enforcement agencies, even expressed in a harsh form, but had aimed at inciting hatred and enmity as it had humiliated the dignity of the police officers as a group and had publicly called for violence against them.",

It is true that the need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice (see, for instance, Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, \u00a7 64, ECHR 2004I, and Altu\u011f Taner Ak\u00e7am v. Turkey, no. 27520/07, \u00a7 87, 25 October 2011). The scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see, for instance, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July, cited above, \u00a7 41). It may be assumed therefore that, even if generally formulated, the provision in question may be regarded as compatible with the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirement, if interpreted and applied by the domestic courts in a rigorous and consistent manner. The Court is furthermore mindful that its task is not to review domestic law in the abstract but to determine whether the way in which it was applied to the applicant gave rise to a breach of the Convention (see Perin\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7 136).",

The Court recognises that in the area under consideration it may be difficult to frame laws with absolute precision and that a certain degree of flexibility may be called for to enable the Russian courts to assess whether a particular action can be considered as capable of stirring up hatred and enmity on the grounds listed in that Article (see Dmitriyevskiy v.\u00a0Russia, no. 42168/06, \u00a7 80, 3 October 2017, and the authorities cited therein). It has consistently held that in any system of law, including criminal law, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, there will inevitably be a need for interpretation by the courts, whose judicial function is precisely to elucidate obscure points and dispel any doubts which may remain regarding the interpretation of legislation (see, for instance, \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, cited above, \u00a7 55, and, mutatis mutandis, Jorgic v.

The applicant, in turn, pointed to a lack of relevant practice of the Russian courts (see paragraph 42 above). Indeed, it was not before 2010-11, several years after the applicant had been convicted at final instance, that the highest courts in Russia addressed the problem with the interpretation of Article 282 of the Criminal Code and provided at least some guidance in that connection for the national courts (see paragraphs 31-32 above). At the same time, the Court notes that the domestic courts\u2019 interpretation of Article 282 in the present case, to regard the police as a \u201csocial group\u201d which could benefit from the protection of the provision, does not conflict with the natural meaning of the words.",

That being so, as a matter of principle it may be considered necessary in democratic societies to sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify violence or hatred based on intolerance provided that any \u201cformalities\u201d, \u201cconditions\u201d, \u201crestrictions\u201d or \u201cpenalties\u201d imposed are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, mutatis mutandis, G\u00fcnd\u00fcz v.

Moreover, where such remarks incite violence against an individual, a public official or a sector of the population, the State enjoys a wider margin of appreciation when examining the need for an interference with freedom of expression (see, among many other authorities, \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, cited above, \u00a7 66; and Ceylan v.

It is the interplay between the various factors rather than any of them taken in isolation that determines the outcome of a particular case (ibid., \u00a7 208).

The Court observes in that connection, that the text in question is, indeed, framed in very strong words. In particular, its first part refers to police officers as \u201ccops\u201d and largely uses vulgar, derogatory and vituperative terms, labelling them all as \u201clowbrows and hoodlums\u201d as well as \u201cthe dumbest and least educated representatives of the animal world\u201d.

The Court stresses that not every remark which may be perceived as offensive or insulting by particular individuals or their groups justifies a criminal conviction in the form of imprisonment. Whilst such sentiments are understandable, they alone cannot set the limits of freedom of expression. It is only by a careful examination of the context in which the offending, insulting or aggressive words appear that one can draw a meaningful distinction between shocking and offensive language which is protected by Article 10 of the Convention and that which forfeits its right to tolerance in a democratic society (see, for a similar approach, Vajnai v. Hungary, no.\u00a033629/06, \u00a7\u00a7 53 and 57, ECHR 2008).

In the light of its accessibility and its capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information, the Internet plays an important role in enhancing the public\u2019s access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general. It is furthermore true that the risk of harm posed by content and communications on the Internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms is certainly higher than that posed by the press, as unlawful speech, including hate speech and calls to violence, can be disseminated as never before, worldwide, in a matter of seconds, and sometimes remain persistently available online (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0110 and 133). At the same time, it is clear that the reach and thus potential impact of a statement released online with a small readership is certainly not the same as that of a statement published on mainstream or highly visited web pages.

Although the access to the impugned statement had not been restricted, it drew seemingly very little public attention. Indeed, even a number of the applicant\u2019s acquaintances remained unaware of it, and, it appears it was only the criminal prosecution of the applicant for his online publication that prompted the interest of the public towards his comment (see paragraph 18 above). It is also important to note that, at the time of the events under examination, the applicant does not appear to have been a well-known blogger or a popular user of social media (see Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g v.\u00a0Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, \u00a7 168, ECHR 2016), let alone a public or influential figure (contrast, Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001, and F\u00e9ret, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 75 and 76), which fact could have attracted public attention to his comment and thus have enhanced the potential impact of the impugned statements. In such circumstances the Court considers that the potential of the applicant\u2019s comment to reach the public and thus to influence its opinion was very limited.",

They did not try to analyse the impugned statements in the context of the relevant discussion and to find out which idea they sought to impart. Whilst holding that that the applicant\u2019s offence was particularly \u201cblatant and dangerous for national security\u201d as running against \u201cthe fundamentals of the constitutional system and State security\u201d, the courts provided no explanation for the reasons for that conclusion. They made no attempt to assess the potential of the statements at hand to provoke any harmful consequences, with due regard to the political and social background, against which they were made, and to the scope of their reach. The Court thus finds that, in reaching their conclusions, the domestic courts failed to take account of all facts and relevant factors. Therefore the reasons cannot be regarded as \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d to justify the interference with the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression.",

The Court reiterates in this connection that a criminal conviction is a serious sanction, having regard to the existence of other means of intervention and rebuttal (see Perin\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7 273). Moreover, although sentencing is in principle a matter for the national courts, the imposition of a prison sentence for an offence in the area of a debate on an issue of legitimate public interest will be compatible with freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been seriously impaired, as, for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see Otegi Mondragon v. Spain, no. 2034/07, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, ECHR 2011); the Court has already found (see paragraph 78 above) that the applicant\u2019s text was not likely to encourage violence.",

In the present case, although the wording of the impugned statements was, indeed, offensive, insulting and virulent (for which the applicant eventually apologised), they cannot be seen as stirring up base emotions or embedded prejudices in an attempt to incite hatred or violence against the Russian police officers; as the Court has noted in paragraph 71 above, it was rather the applicant\u2019s emotional reaction to what he saw as an instance of an abusive conduct of the police personnel. The Court furthermore discerns no other elements, either in the domestic courts\u2019 decisions or in the Government\u2019s submission, which would enable it to conclude that the applicant\u2019s comment had the potential to provoke any violence with regard to the Russian police officers, and thus posed a clear and imminent danger which required the applicant\u2019s criminal prosecution and conviction (compare G\u00fcl and Others, cited above, \u00a7 42).",
