The applicants, who were practising members of the Jewish faith, criticised the refusal of an Austrian court to grant their request for a hearing in a case concerning them to be adjourned on the grounds that the date set coincided with an important Jewish holiday. The Commission found that, had the applicants, on learning of the date of the hearing, duly informed the court that it presented them with a problem for religious reasons, the court would have had to set a new date. In that case, however, the applicants had reacted too late: although they had been informed on 30 May that the hearing would take place on 4\u00a0October, they had not written to the court until 25 September in order to request an adjournment. In view of the complexity of the proceedings, which involved a large number of persons, and the fact that the request had been made at short notice, the Commission held that the court\u2019s decision had not been unreasonable.",

The reasonable-time requirement relied on by the Italian judge in refusing the applicant\u2019s request is undoubtedly legitimate but, in the absence of any further explanation, appears in this case to be more in the nature of an excuse. Of course, the requested adjournment might have caused some administrative inconvenience stemming, for instance, from the need to inform the parties involved of the new date for the hearing.
