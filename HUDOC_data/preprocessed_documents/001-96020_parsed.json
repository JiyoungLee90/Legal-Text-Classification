Parents who were married had obliged themselves on marriage to take responsibility for each other and their children. In contrast to this, the legislator could not assume that parents of children born out of wedlock lived together or wanted to take responsibility for each other. There was insufficient evidence that a father of a child born out of wedlock would want to bear joint responsibility as a general rule. The child\u2019s well-being therefore demanded that the child had a person at birth who could act for it in a legally binding way. In view of the very different life conditions into which those children were born, generally it was justifiable to grant sole custody to the mother, and not to the father or to both parents. This legislation could also not be objected to from a constitutional point of view because the legislature had given both parents of children born out of wedlock the possibility of obtaining custody through a joint declaration.",

Joint custody required a minimum of agreement between the parents. If the parents were unable or unwilling to cooperate, joint custody might run counter to the child\u2019s well-being. The legislator assumed that the will to exercise joint custody which parents explicitly expressed upon marriage also showed their will to cooperate. Unmarried parents could express this will to cooperate through a joint custody declaration. The father\u2019s right to custody indeed depended on the mother\u2019s willingness to exercise joint custody, but the mother in turn could not demand joint custody without the father\u2019s consent. The parents could thus only exercise joint custody if they both wanted to. That limitation on the father\u2019s right to respect for his family life was not unjustified, given that the joint custody exercised by a married couple was based on their marriage. The applicable law gave unmarried couples the possibility of exercising joint custody, in particular, if they lived together with the child and not after the couple had separated. The legislator could legitimately assume that, if\u00a0the parents lived together but the mother refused to make a joint custody declaration, the case was an exceptional one in which the mother had serious reasons for the refusal which were based on the child\u2019s interest. Given this assumption, the applicable law did not infringe the father\u2019s right to respect for his family life by not providing for a judicial review. In the event of such serious reasons it could not be expected that the courts would consider joint custody to be in the child\u2019s best interest.",

With the primary assignment of parental custody to the mother, whose identity \u2013 in contrast to that of the father \u2013 was established at the time of birth, the intention was to have a clear allocation of the right of custody for the purpose of legal certainty, so that from the outset there would be a binding determination of the statutory representative for the protection of the child concerned. The approval requirement applying to both parents for the joint exercise of parental custody was based on the notion that parents who could not agree to make a custody declaration were highly likely to come into conflict when specific questions relating to the exercise of parental custody were at stake, which could cause painful disputes which would be detrimental to the child\u2019s interests.",

While it was true that the majority of the Member States provided for paternal participation in custody if the parents were not married to each other, either irrespective of the mother\u2019s will or at least by court order following an evaluation of the child\u2019s interests, other European countries (such as Austria, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Denmark) had similar rules to those in force in Germany. As the Court did not evaluate the abstract statutory position but rather the way in which the rules were being applied to the applicant under the specific circumstances concerned, the agreement of the parents, with the assistance of the Youth Welfare Office, which gave the applicant contact with the child for a good four months every year, had to be taken into account. Therefore the applicant had had the opportunity to play a large part in his daughter\u2019s life. He had neither been discriminated against by the ruling in favour of the mother nor had the ruling discriminated against married or divorced fathers. The mother\u2019s situation and the father\u2019s situation were not totally comparable, given that fatherhood could not be established from the outset if the parents were unmarried. While taking into account as far as possible the interests of everyone concerned, the above provisions in the Civil Code were not linked to gender, but sought to regulate parental custody in a balanced manner in the case of children born out of wedlock. Moreover, German law provided that joint custody with the mother was linked to her consent, regardless of whether the parents were married or not. The Government finally contended that, under the circumstances of the present case, it could not be ruled out that the ordering of joint custody would cause conflicts between the parents and would therefore be contrary to the child\u2019s best interests.",

That joint custody against the will of the mother was necessarily to the detriment of the child\u2019s best interests remained mere speculation. Under the applicable law, the authorities and courts did not even have to take into account the child\u2019s best interests, given that the law explicitly provided that a father could not obtain joint custody without the mother\u2019s consent. Furthermore, the child had not been heard in the present case. Article 1626\u00a0a \u00a7\u00a02 of the Civil Code was based on the assumption that fathers of children born out of wedlock were less suitable to exercise custody compared with mothers of children born out of wedlock. The present application, however, proved the opposite, as the applicant\u2019s care for his daughter had in fact been excellent. Moreover, the Federal Republic of Germany had not given sufficient reasons in the present case for excluding the applicant\u2019s right to custody, which he was willing to exercise. The German legislator had assumed that a father\u2019s right to custody was not justified in view of the allegedly numerous unstable relationships with children born out of wedlock in society, thereby ignoring developments such as the growing number of unmarried couples who were willing to exercise joint custody. It was hence unacceptable generally to exclude joint custody for fathers of children born out of wedlock simply due to negative experiences with the exercise of joint custody by couples in unstable relationships. Furthermore, the legislator had failed sufficiently to fulfil its obligation to keep current and recent developments under scrutiny.",

However, the defect in the currently applicable domestic law was not so much that the mother would initially obtain the right to sole custody as that the father did not have the opportunity to correct that decision. Even if the mother\u2019s refusal to make a joint custody declaration was completely arbitrary, the father had no chance to have that declaration replaced by a court order pursuant to Article 1672 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Civil Code. The legal situation breached, in particular, the father\u2019s right to respect for his family life in situations in which the father had had contact with the child for a considerable amount of time and was closely attached to the child. As regards Article 14, the applicant submitted that the applicable law discriminated against the applicant on grounds of sex and as an unmarried father without sufficient justification. The child\u2019s interest would not allow the mother to veto a declaration on joint custody. Moreover, the applicant did not have the opportunity to substitute that veto with a court decision.",

The Court notes that on the other hand parental authority over a child born out of wedlock is attributed to the mother unless both parents consent to make a request for joint authority. While the pertinent provisions do not categorically exclude the possibility that the father may obtain joint custody in future, Articles 1666 and 1672 of the Civil Code provide that the family court may only transfer the right to custody to the father if the child\u2019s well-being is threatened by negligence on the mother\u2019s part or if one parent makes the relevant application with the consent of the other parent. In the absence of these prerequisites, that is to say if the child\u2019s well-being is not jeopardised and if the mother does not consent to a transfer of custody, as has been established in the present case, German law does not provide for judicial examination as to whether the attribution of joint parental authority to both parents would suit the child\u2019s best interests.",

The approach taken by the German courts in the present case thus fully reflects the underlying legislation. Consequently, as there was no alternative decision possible under national law, the domestic courts did not examine whether the granting of joint custody would jeopardise the child\u2019s welfare in this individual case or whether on the contrary the granting of joint custody would be in the best interests of the child. The crucial point is that joint custody against the will of the mother of a child born out of wedlock is prima facie considered as not being in the child\u2019s interest.",

Germany, no. 74969/01, \u00a7 42, 26\u00a0February 2004, and Sommerfeld v.  [GC], no. 31871/96, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2003VIII). Contrary to the majority, I think that in the instant case this wide margin of appreciation has not been exceeded by the statutory rules and the court decisions based on them. The reasoning underlying the relevant legal provisions, especially Article 1626a \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code, is\u00a0tenable and can especially not be dismissed in the applicant\u2019s case. The\u00a0German legislature has fully recognised and considered the problems arising for the father from the mother\u2019s privileged position and has deliberately decided against so-called \u201cenforced harmony\u201d (which means the legal possibility of joint parental custody by court order). The\u00a0explanation of the report submitted by the Legal Affairs Committee of the German Federal Parliament following the deliberations on the amended Law on Family Matters makes clear that the interests of the father and the problems of the proposed solution were not only fully considered in the weighing-up-process, but that the legal provisions are based on close examination and a defensible reasoning.",

Parliament could legitimately assume that in the case of children born out of wedlock, joint custody for both parents enforced by a court order against the will of the mother was contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. This is especially true when the parents do not live together, as in the present case. This crucial point was emphasised by the  in its judgment of 29 January 2003, which confirmed the legal approach as constitutional. If\u00a0the parents did not make a joint custody declaration while they were living together (in the present case until the child was aged three and a half), after the parents\u2019 separation and a custody dispute the assumption of the legislature that joint custody enforced by court order regularly entails more disadvantages than advantages for the child is even more justified. In such a case it is obvious that there is no basis for cooperation between the parents and therefore no basis for joint custody in the child\u2019s best interests.",

It has to be borne in mind that the Court \u2013 as a general rule \u2013 does not assess the abstract legal situation but the manner in which the rules are applied to the applicant in the given specific circumstances. With regard to this principle, the following facts have to be considered. Before the  had decided the question of the constitutionality of Article 1626a of the Civil Code the domestic courts additionally examined in the context of the applicant\u2019s application for legal aid in respect of his application for custody whether the granting of joint custody would jeopardise the child\u2019s welfare and they answered this question in the affirmative. The Cologne District Court referred in a decision of 29\u00a0August\u00a02002 to \u201ca dispute between the parents on fundamental questions\u201d. It further stated explicitly that joint parental custody would not be in the child\u2019s interests and the fundamental dispute between the parents would even be a reason to revoke joint custody. The Cologne Court of Appeal made itself even more clear in a decision of 19 July 2002 when it explained that the applicant, \u201cirrespective of section 1626a of the Civil Code\u201d, could not obtain joint parental custody because it was not in the child\u2019s interests. In the light of these remarks by the domestic courts \u2013 albeit only in the context of the applicant\u2019s application for legal aid and not in the main proceedings \u2013 I do not agree with the majority, who dismiss the Government\u2019s argument that in the circumstances of the present case the ordering of joint custody by a court would be likely to cause conflicts between the parents and would therefore be contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. Moreover, it has to be considered in this connection that the applicant exercises a relatively extensive right of access without any problems, namely a good four months a year, giving him the opportunity to play a large part in his daughter\u2019s life.",

Like the majority I do not see a European consensus on this issue. The judgment states correctly that only a limited number of countries explicitly address the issue of a lack of agreement between the parents. Although the majority of the member States may provide for scrutiny by the courts in the event of a conflict between the parents, the provisions and the underlying legal approaches are very different in their details and cannot be compared to each other, as a comparative-law survey on parental authority over a child born out of wedlock shows. Where there is no uniform approach it has to be accepted in my opinion that there are a number of possible ways of solving the conflict between the different interests at stake. Moreover, the common starting-point of the legislation in the member States is, as in , the child\u2019s best interests. With regard to this common goal and the non-existent consensus among the member States, I am not convinced that providing the father with the possibility of obtaining joint custody by court order against the will of the mother should be the only legal solution in accordance with the Convention. Besides, it is rather in line with past decisions of the Court that Parliament\u2019s evaluation can anticipate the weighing-up process without providing for a weighing-up of interests in every individual case (see Evans v. the United Kingdom, no. 6339/05, \u00a7 65, 7 March 2006). It has additionally to be mentioned that the advantage of such anticipation is a clear law which provides certainty for the persons involved.",

Furthermore, the mother\u2019s and the father\u2019s situations are not totally comparable; sole custody of the mother is, at least initially, necessary for reasons of legal certainty, as the majority concede. The fact that the father cannot enforce joint custody later on is justified, as mentioned above, especially in the event of a separation, by the notion of the child\u2019s well-being, with a view to avoiding painful disputes between the parents at the child\u2019s expense. The statutory rules legitimately proceed from the idea that parents who are unable to agree on joint custody are also unable to solve the difficult problems arising in the exercise of joint custody. Moreover, the situation of the applicant is not totally comparable to that of divorced fathers and unmarried fathers who have exercised joint custody based on joint declarations. In the case of married parents joint custody is founded on joint declarations manifesting themselves in the marital vows. The right of a divorced father is therefore based on a continuation of his legal position which was established beforehand by both parents. This is equally true for parents who are not married to each other if they have previously exercised joint custody by means of a joint declaration. Besides, in both cases joint custody is linked to the consent of the mother. On the contrary, the legislature could legitimately assume that parents do not wish to exercise joint parental custody if they are not married to each other and do not make joint declarations.",

This is especially true in the present case, where the German courts involved in the above-mentioned decisions ascertained that joint custody would be against the child\u2019s interests and would on that account have even had to be revoked had it been established previously. This underlines the validity of the argument of the Federal Constitutional Court in its judgment of 29 January 2003, concerning another case, where it stated that the applicable law, especially Article 1626a \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code, did not infringe the father\u2019s right to respect for his family life by not providing for judicial review, because in the event of a serious dispute between the parents it could not be expected that the courts would consider joint custody to be in the child\u2019s best interests. However, in the end the different assessment by the majority in this case means that the domestic legislature is left with hardly any margin of appreciation with regard to the details of regulating parental custody for children born out of wedlock. I\u00a0consider this to be a too far-reaching consequence of the judgment and would have preferred a more cautious approach in this difficult area. For the foregoing reasons I have therefore voted against finding a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention.",
