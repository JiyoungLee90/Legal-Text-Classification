In the context of prisoners, the Court has had previous occasion to emphasise that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and that the authorities are under a duty to protect them. It is incumbent on the State to account for any injuries suffered in custody, which obligation is particularly stringent when an individual dies (see, for example, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7 99, ECHR 2000-VII).",

Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For a positive obligation to arise regarding a prisoner with suicidal tendencies, it must be established that the authorities knew, or ought to have known at the time, of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual and, if so, that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7\u00a7 89 and 92, ECHR 2001III).",

Thereby, the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness and must of their own motion initiate investigations which would be capable of, firstly, ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and any shortcomings in the operation of the regulatory system and, secondly, identifying the State officials or authorities involved. The nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfy the minimum threshold of effectiveness depend on the circumstances of each particular case. They must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (see Koseva v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 6414/02, 22\u00a0June 2010). Furthemore, the obligation to investigate is not one of result, but of means only.",

Turkey, no. 26129/95, \u00a7 150, ECHR 2001III (extracts)). It went on to clearly conclude as to suicide by hanging. It is true that certain facts in the autopsy report (the time of discovery of JM\u2019s body and the time of death) did not match the report of the investigating judge and the prison guard\u2019s statement (paragraphs 16, 18 and 20 above). However, while some effort should have been made to clarify these inconsistencies, the Court does not find this oversight sufficient to conclude that the investigation into JM\u2019s death was sufficiently flawed as to undermine its effectiveness, since the precise time of death was not of crucial importance in the present case (contrast Velikova v. , no. 41488/98, \u00a7 79 in limine, ECHR 2000VI). Moreover, the applicant could have but did not challenge the expert\u2019s conclusions after he had received the autopsy report.",

Once the public prosecutor decided not to prosecute and the applicant took over the prosecution, the investigating judge requested a new report from the prison authorities and gathered more evidence. However, having examined all documents, he considered that there were not enough elements for indictment and that the investigation should be discontinued. That conclusion was upheld by the District Court and by the Supreme Court of Serbia. This also shows that the applicant has been involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his interest as a next-of-kin.",
