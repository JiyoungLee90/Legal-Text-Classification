The High Court observed that, although the paper had not mentioned the applicant by name, it ought to have been possible for those who knew him in advance to recognise him, in particular from the photograph taken of him from behind and from the information about his residence- and work places contained in the 25 May 2000 issue. It was hard to derive anything specific about the strength of the suspicion. Although it was true that formally speaking the applicant had only been given witness status, seen as a whole the report was capable of giving the ordinary reader the impression that the paper regarded the applicant as a person who already at an early stage of the investigation had stood out as the most probable perpetrator among those who had been in the police\u2019s search light. The High Court moreover noted a number of other aspects of the publications confirming this impression. It concluded that the impugned publications were defamatory in the sense of Article 247 of the Penal Code.",

The High Court found that the photograph created associations of arrest. This was presented together with the information that, after having been brought home, another police car with a dog patrol had arrived at the house, had passed by in low speed, had turned and had vanished in the dark. In addition to this the newspaper rendered statements by a police inspector to Verdens Gang that the police had received much information with substance, and that the answer to who had killed the two little girls was to be found in the police records. Also the rendering on 25 May that the police were looking for a locally known murderer with a greatly deviant personal character, in the High Court\u2019s opinion supports the view that the applicant may be a person with the special character that are a requisite for committing such a heinous crime. The High Court did not find that the rendering of [the applicant]\u2019s denial and of the neighbours\u2019 warning against prejudging were sufficient to weaken the suspicion created by the newspaper coverage as a whole.",

The City Court found for TV2 and rejected the applicant\u2019s claims. On an appeal by the applicant, on 8 December 2006 the Agder High Court upheld the applicant\u2019s claim that the news coverage constituted unlawful defamation and ordered the defendants to pay him NOK 250,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage and discontinued the case with regard to his claim for pecuniary damage. As regards the contents of the disputed broadcasts and their defamatory effect, the Agder High Court made similar findings in the TV2 case as made by the appellate courts in the present case. In finding the defamation unlawful it had regard to several factors, notably TV2\u2019s national as opposed to local media role, unlike that of F\u00e6drelandsvennen, the potency of the televised medium, the rule of caution applicable to the press with regard to identification of person regarding coverage of early stages of criminal investigations and the fact that, although aware of an autopsy report made available on 24 May 2000 revealing that the murders had involved rape, TV2 had in the evening news of that date continued to focus on the applicant notwithstanding the fact that his 1988 criminal conviction had not concerned sexual offences.

While it was true that the 24 May 2000 issue had quoted the applicant on top of the front page saying \u201cI am completely innocent\u201d, by publishing this peculiar interview, covering almost the upper half of the front page, the newspaper had actually made things worse. It had contributed to arise more suspicion against the applicant, not less. By describing him in the ensuing text on the front page as the \u201cmost interesting\u201d person interviewed by the police, the newspaper in reality did not create a \u201cbalance\u201d but rather imbalance to the applicant\u2019s detriment. Also, on this point he shared the view held by the Supreme Court minority (in paragraph 95 of the judgment quoted at paragraph 33 above) that the so-called balancing had not improved matters, agreeing with the High Court\u2019s findings that the coverage had made the suspicion against him stronger, not weaker.",

The Government thus concurred with the Supreme Court\u2019s finding that the articles in F\u00e6drelandsvennen had not been unlawful for the purposes of Articles 246 and 247 of the Criminal Code and that the applicant\u2019s claim for non-pecuniary damages under section 3-6 of the Damage Compensation Act had accordingly been unfounded.",

However, as the Court has stated on previous occasions, the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition. It covers the physical and psychological or moral integrity of a person (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91, p. 11, \u00a7 22; Raninen v.\u00a0Finland, judgment of 16\u00a0December 1997, Reports of judgments and Decisions 1997-VIII, \u00a7 63) and can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual\u2019s physical and social identity (see Mikuli\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a053176/99, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2002-I; for a more detailed summary of the case-law, see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, ECHR 2002-III, \u00a7 61).",

In Pfeifer (cited above, \u00a7 35), the Court held that a person\u2019s reputation, even if that person was criticised in the context of a public debate, formed part of his or her personal identity and psychological integrity and therefore also fell within the scope of his or her \u201cprivate life\u201d. The same considerations must also apply to personal honour. In order for Article 8 to come into play, the attack on personal honour and reputation must attain a certain level of gravity and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see Sidabras and D\u017eiautas v.
