Having examined the medical documentation submitted by the parties, the Court, however, finds the applicant\u2019s allegations unsubstantiated. According to the applicant\u2019s medical file, at the relevant time he was examined by medical practitioners and prescribed requisite treatment which led to his recovery. The irregularities in the medical assistance provided to him, if any, were not such as to render it incompatible with the standards set out in Article\u00a03 of the Convention.

The Court has found that the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 3 of the Convention concerning the conditions of his detention and alleged lack of adequate medical care are manifestly ill-founded and therefore inadmissible. It accordingly finds that that claim cannot be said to be \u201carguable\u201d within the meaning of the Convention case-law (compare Aleksandr Dmitriyev v. Russia, no.\u00a012993/05, \u00a7\u00a042-43, 7 May 2015).

Whether or not contacts between the authorities and an applicant are tantamount to unacceptable practices from the standpoint of Article 34 must be determined in the light of the particular circumstances of the case. In this respect, regard must be had to the vulnerability of the complainant and his or her susceptibility to influence exerted by the authorities (see Akdivar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0105). The applicant\u2019s position might be particularly vulnerable when he is held in custody with limited contacts with his family or the outside world (see Cotle\u0163 v.
