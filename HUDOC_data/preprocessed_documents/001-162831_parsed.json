The Constitutional Court further referred to Parliament\u2019s autonomy, which was protected by the Fundamental Law.

However, since disciplinary decisions of Parliament did not fall into any of the above categories, the lack of a remedy against them was not unconstitutional in itself. In addition, from a historical and comparative perspective, disciplinary powers with respect to MPs formed part of Parliament\u2019s autonomy. Having regard to the above, the Constitutional Court found that the disciplinary power of Parliament concerned the internal functioning of Parliament, and as such the conduct of members of parliament in the exercise of their mandate. Thus, no obligation to provide a remedy against such decisions could be derived from Article XXVIII \u00a7 7 of the Fundamental Law.",

He considered that the right to freedom of speech of MPs did not originate from freedom of expression as that freedom was a fundamental right of citizens against the State. The basis of the freedom of speech of MPs was the right of members of parliament to a free mandate enshrined in the Fundamental Law. Nonetheless, he found that, should regulations restrict the exercise of freedom of speech, it was reasonable to invoke an infringement of the freedom of expression as well. The President of the Constitutional Court noted that the Fundamental Law created the basis for Parliament\u2019s power to impose sanctions in the interests of the undisrupted functioning of Parliament. However, this did not mean that Parliament\u2019s right to create its own Rules also allowed it to disregard the core element of the right to freedom of expression. The President of the Constitutional Court found that qualifying an expression as gravely offensive or offensive entailing serious disorder and the exclusion of a member of parliament could only be considered proportionate if it was preceded by a call to order and a warning of the legal consequences. Currently this was not the case either in committee meetings (section\u00a052(2)(a)) or in plenary sessions (section 48(3)).",

Given this quality of a representative, the limits of expression were different from those concerning private individuals: because of an MP\u2019s immunity, those limits were wider on the one hand, and, given the parliamentary disciplinary rules, narrower on the other hand. Part of MPs\u2019 expressions were governed by the parliamentary disciplinary rules precisely because of the farreaching immunity which MPs enjoyed in their parliamentary activities. It was therefore justified for the Speaker to have prerogatives in such cases so as to be able to prevent abuses of the right to freedom of expression by MPs. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court noted that the right to speak in Parliament was not only a personal right belonging to an MP; it was also a fundamental element of parliamentary debate which had to be regulated from the perspective of the effective functioning of Parliament.",

This provision, together with the preceding subsections of that section, adequately reflected the principle of gradual application of the sanctions (the more severe the disciplinary breach, the more severe the sanction that could be applied).",

The Constitutional Court had dealt with complaints of the violation of individual rights through specific resolutions of Parliament on a number of occasions (for example, ruling no. 65/1992 (XII.17), in which a member of parliament had requested the Constitutional Court to quash a decision to suspend his immunity).

However, in certain situations referred to in section 45(4) of the CCA the Constitutional Court could declare the impugned legislation unconstitutional ex tunc. In such cases, the restoration of the status quo ante was called for. The Constitutional Court had exercised this option in decision no.\u00a033/2012 of 16 July 2012 in which it had found the provisions on the compulsory retirement age of judges unconstitutional and repealed the relevant regulation with retroactive effect.

Even if a\u00a0constitutional complaint were to have been successful, it would have had no greater effect than the annulment of the relevant provisions of the Parliament Act. The applicants further argued that, unlike the Code of Criminal, Civil and Administrative Procedures, the Parliament Act or the Rules of Parliament did not contain any regulations concerning the consequences of a finding of unconstitutionality in the context of parliamentary disciplinary sanctions.

Denial of the right to speak during a debate restricted an MP\u2019s right to freedom of expression, but certain more severe sanctions might prevent an MP from exercising the rights flowing from his mandate for an even longer period of time. These harsher sanctions \u2013 namely, exclusion from a session and/or suspension of the MP\u2019s rights \u2013 were applied in the majority of the member States as well as in the PACE and in the European Parliament. It was important to note that these harsher sanctions imposed a general limitation on MPs\u2019 rights and in respect of all parliamentary affairs for a specified time, and did not merely suspend an MP\u2019s right of expression in respect of the matter related to a disciplinary breach. In addition to the actual and immediate effects of these sanctions, financial consequences could also arise. In the majority of the member States a temporary suspension of an MP\u2019s rights could, ipso jure or upon a decision to that effect, also entail the full or partial forfeiture of the MP\u2019s remuneration.

Secondly, to ensure that the right was not abused, members of parliament submitted to the authority and discipline of Parliament.

Firstly, free speech, protected from any fear of litigation or external sanction, was essential if MPs were to represent the people and debate matters of importance. Otherwise, there would be a powerful chilling effect on debate within the legislature. Parliament had to be free to organise and determine its own procedure and to hear robust debate on any subject, without fear of external interference. Secondly, as a counterbalance, there had to be a system of parliamentary discipline, under which the conduct of MPs was controlled by Parliament itself, to ensure that the right to freedom of speech of its members was not abused, and that the work of the legislature proceeded effectively. The Government maintained that the Court had recognised both of the above principles in A. v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a035373/97, ECHR 2002-X) and Kart v. Turkey (cited above). The wide margin of appreciation applied, according to the Government, to whether to prohibit the use of items such as banners, billboards and megaphones as well as to national assessments as to the seriousness of such conduct.",

Such political speech received a\u00a0high level of protection under Article 10. But within the House of Commons, all MPs limited their political expression to reasoned oral argument. Free speech was not prohibited: all MPs enjoyed an equal right to speak, question, intervene and vote. But a necessary and reasonable restriction was imposed on the time, place and manner of all MPs\u2019 political expression, in order that debates could take place in Parliament on a fair and equal basis. The Government emphasised that such rules were essential to ensure that all sides of the argument were fairly heard. If the use of billboards, banners, megaphones and other such devices were permitted, it could lead to an escalation amongst MPs with the effect of inhibiting the very freedom of expression. A proportionate but dissuasive penalty was called for to ensure that parliamentary debate was confined to fair and reasoned oral debate, discussion and voting. Such rules promoted a high standard of political debate, and ensured that all MPs were treated equally and fairly. It would be contrary to this principle to give special privileges to cause disruption to any member, whether part of the majority or the minority. All elected MPs should be treated with equal respect by a Speaker, and the same rules of conduct should apply to each of them.",

Parliament is a unique forum for debate in a democratic society, which is of fundamental importance. The elevated level of protection for speech therein is demonstrated, among other things, by the rule of parliamentary immunity. The Court has acknowledged that the longstanding practice for States generally to confer varying degrees of immunity on parliamentarians pursues the legitimate aims of protecting free speech in Parliament and maintaining the separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary. Different forms of parliamentary immunity may indeed serve to protect the effective political democracy that constitutes one of the cornerstones of the Convention system, particularly where they protect the autonomy of the legislature and the parliamentary opposition (see, among other authorities, Kart, cited above, \u00a7 81, with further references, and Syngelidis v. Greece, no. 24895/07, \u00a7 42, 11\u00a0February 2010). The guarantees offered by both types of parliamentary immunity (non-liability and inviolability) serve to ensure the independence of Parliament in the performance of its task. Inviolability helps to achieve the full independence of Parliament by preventing any possibility of politically motivated criminal proceedings (fumus persecutionis) and thereby protecting the opposition from pressure or abuse on the part of the majority (see Kart, cited above, \u00a7 90). The protection afforded to free speech in Parliament serves to protect the interests of Parliament as a whole and should not be understood as protection afforded solely to individual MPs (see A. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 85).",

A Contracting State may make it subject to certain \u201crestrictions\u201d or \u201cpenalties\u201d, but it is for the Court to give a final ruling on the compatibility of such measures with the freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 (see Castells, cited above, \u00a7 46, and Incal v. Turkey, 9 June 1998, \u00a7 53, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV). The exercise of freedom of expression in Parliament carries with it \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d referred to in Article 10 \u00a7 2 in order to ensure the effective operation of Parliament. Parliaments are entitled under this provision to react when their members engage in disorderly conduct disrupting the normal functioning of the legislature. Just as the generally recognised rule of parliamentary immunity offers enhanced, but not unlimited, protection to speech in Parliament, so some restrictions on speech in Parliament \u2013 motivated by the need to ensure that parliamentary business is conducted in an orderly fashion \u2013 should likewise be regarded as justified. It is relevant to note in this connection that the Venice Commission observed that in most national parliaments members could be subjected to internal disciplinary sanctions by Parliament (see paragraphs 48-49 above).",

The Court considers that the States \u2013 or indeed parliaments themselves \u2013 should, in principle, independently regulate the time, place and manner of speech in Parliament, and that, correspondingly the Court\u2019s scrutiny in this respect should be limited. By contrast, States have very limited latitude in regulating the content of parliamentary speech. However, some regulation may be considered necessary in order to prevent forms of expression such as direct or indirect calls for violence. In verifying that the freedom of expression remains secured, the Court\u2019s scrutiny in this context should be stricter. In any case, through the generally recognised rule of parliamentary immunity, the States provide an increased level of protection to speech in Parliament, with the consequence that the need for the Court\u2019s intervention could nonetheless be expected to be rare.",

Latvia [GC], no.\u00a058278/00, \u00a7\u00a7 98 and 103, ECHR 2006IV). Thus, the Convention establishes a close nexus between an effective political democracy and the effective operation of Parliament. Accordingly, there can be no doubt that the effective functioning of Parliament is a value of key importance for a democratic society and therefore the exercise of free speech in Parliament may have to yield on occasions to the legitimate interests of protecting the orderly conduct of parliamentary business as well as the protection of the rights of other members of parliament. Orderly debate in Parliament ultimately serves the political and legislative process, the interests of all members of the legislature, enabling them to participate on equal terms in parliamentary proceedings, and the interests of society at large. The Hungarian Constitutional Court considered in this context that the task was to find the right balance between the rights of individual MPs and the guaranteeing of effective parliamentary activity (see paragraph 41 above). The Court agrees with that approach, adding that the rights of the parliamentary minority should also be part of the equation. In a more general vein, the Court reiterates that pluralism and democracy must be based on dialogue and a spirit of compromise (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, \u00a7 45, Reports 1998I; Leyla \u015eahin v.

In accordance with this principle, widely recognised in the member States of the Council of Europe, Parliament is entitled, to the exclusion of other powers and within the limits of the constitutional framework, to regulate its own internal affairs, such as, inter alia, its internal organisation, the composition of its bodies and maintaining good order during debates. The autonomy of Parliament evidently extends to Parliament\u2019s power to enforce rules aimed at ensuring the orderly conduct of parliamentary business. This is sometimes referred to as \u201cthe jurisdictional autonomy of Parliament\u201d.

Similar rules exist in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and in the European Parliament (see paragraphs 42-44 and 50-52 above respectively). It can be seen from the comparative-law survey that parliaments dispose of a varying range of disciplinary measures to ensure the orderly conduct of parliamentary proceedings, including, inter alia, a call to order or a\u00a0warning, as well as certain far-reaching measures such as denial of the right to speak, exclusion from a session and financial sanctions. It may be inferred from this that, despite differences related to the nature and extent of the disciplinary measures, the member States generally accept the need for regulations sanctioning abusive speech or conduct in parliaments.",

Therefore, where the underlying purpose of the relevant disciplinary rules is exclusively to ensure the effectiveness of Parliament, and hence that of the democratic process, the margin of appreciation to be afforded in this area should be a wide one. The Court observes that it has already acknowledged that member States have a wide margin of appreciation in the context of the regulation of parliamentary immunity, which belongs to the realm of parliamentary law (see Kart, cited above, \u00a7\u00a082).",

The latter should be compatible with the concepts of \u201ceffective political democracy\u201d and \u201cthe rule of law\u201d to which the Preamble to the Convention refers. The Court reiterates that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a\u00a0\u201cdemocratic society\u201d. Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of people from minorities and avoids abuse of a dominant position (see, among other authorities, Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, \u00a7 63, Series A no. 44; Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2004I; and Leyla \u015eahin, cited above, \u00a7 108). Accordingly, parliamentary autonomy should not be abused for the purpose of suppressing the freedom of expression of MPs, which lies at the heart of political debate in a democracy. It would be incompatible with the purpose and object of the Convention if the Contracting States, by adopting a particular system of parliamentary autonomy, were thereby absolved from their responsibility under the Convention in relation to the exercise of free speech in Parliament (see, mutatis mutandis, Cordova (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7 58). Similarly, the rules concerning the internal operation of Parliament should not serve as a basis for the majority to abuse its dominant position vis-\u00e0-vis the opposition. The Court attaches importance to protection of the parliamentary minority from abuse by the majority. It will therefore examine with particular care any measure which appears to operate solely, or principally, to the disadvantage of the opposition (see, with regard to the compatibility with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 of restrictions on electoral rights, T\u0103nase, cited above, \u00a7 179). The Court further notes that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has stressed the need for equal treatment of all members of parliament (see paragraph 47 above).",

The Contracting States have a margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists and, in the present case, the Court has established that the margin of appreciation is a wide one (see paragraph 146 above). The Court has no difficulties in accepting that in the instant case it was necessary to react to the applicants\u2019 conduct in Parliament, which was a matter for the House to consider in the exercise of its autonomy.

One of the applicants, Ms\u00a0Lengyel, also used a megaphone to speak in the course of a vote (see paragraphs 20-21 above). It appears that the applicants were given a warning by the Speaker (see, respectively, paragraphs 13, 16 and 21 above). The Court considers that displaying a placard or banner in Parliament is not a conventional manner for MPs to express their views on a given subject debated in the House. Having chosen this form of conduct, the applicants disrupted order in Parliament. They had been free to convey the same message in their parliamentary speech stricto sensu and had they done so the consequences of their actions might have been entirely different.

In the case of Ms Sz\u00e9l, Ms Lengyel and Ms Osztolyk\u00e1n the Speaker observed that their conduct had been gravely offensive to parliamentary order on account of the display of their banner and the use of the megaphone (see paragraph 23 above). On the facts of the case, the Court is satisfied that the applicants did not receive sanctions for expressing their views on issues debated in Parliament, but rather for the time, place and manner in which they had done so. This conclusion is borne out by the fact that in the parliamentary proceedings there was no examination of the actual content of the applicants\u2019 expression.",

However, it sees no need to rule on whether, bearing in mind the State\u2019s wide margin of appreciation, those reasons as such were also sufficient to show that the disputed interference was \u201cnecessary\u201d. The Court finds it more appropriate to concentrate its review on whether the restriction on the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression was accompanied by effective and adequate safeguards against abuse. Indeed, as stated above (paragraphs\u00a0133 et seq.), the fairness of proceedings and the procedural guarantees afforded are factors which may have to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with freedom of expression. Furthermore, the Court has found above (see paragraph\u00a0140) that its scrutiny of how the time, place and manner of speeches in Parliament are regulated should be limited.",

At the same time the Court should pay due regard to the autonomy of Parliament, which ought to weigh heavily in the balancing of interests to be carried out under the proportionality test.

This distinction is reflected, for example, in the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament (see paragraph 51 above). The Court considers that the procedural safeguards available regarding these different types of sanctions may vary too. Immediate sanctions (which are not in issue in the present case) are imposed in the case of a grave disturbance of parliamentary order and in terms of procedural safeguards they would require a warning. However, it may also be envisaged that in extreme cases no warning will be required. In this context, the justification would be that clearly abusive speech or conduct of an MP nullifies the protection of his or her right to freedom of expression or may be considered an abuse of the right.",

The Court reiterates that the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, \u00a7 34, Series\u00a0A no. 18; Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 50, Reports 1996III; and Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999II). The rule of law implies, inter alia, that there must be a measure of legal protection in domestic law against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see, among other authorities, Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 28, and Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, \u00a7 67, Series A no. 82). With regard to ex post facto disciplinary sanctions, the Court considers that the procedural safeguards available to this effect should include, as a minimum, the right for the MP concerned to be heard in a parliamentary procedure before a sanction is imposed. It notes that the right to be heard would indeed increasingly appear as a basic procedural rule in democratic States, above and beyond judicial procedures, as demonstrated, inter alia, by Article 41 \u00a7\u00a02\u00a0(a) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (see paragraphs\u00a05455 above).",

In the exercise of his or her functions, the Speaker ought to act in a manner that is free of personal prejudice or political bias. In addition, while, in the light of the generally recognised principles of parliamentary autonomy and the separation of powers, an MP who has been disciplinarily sanctioned cannot be considered entitled to a remedy to contest his sanction outside Parliament, the argument for procedural safeguards in this context is nonetheless particularly compelling given the lapse of time between the conduct in issue and the actual imposition of the sanction.",

In the Grand Chamber case of Jaloud v. the Netherlands (no. 47708/08, ECHR 2014), the lawyers had charged an hourly rate of EUR 110, while in the Grand Chamber case of Bouyid v. Belgium (no. 23380/09, ECHR 2015), the lawyers had charged EUR 85 and EUR 125 per hour respectively. The applicants\u2019 lawyer had charged an hourly rate of EUR 200, which was twelve times higher than the legal-aid rate in Hungary in 2015 and disproportionate to the average income in Hungary. The Government further disputed the number of hours of legal work. The total number of legal hours claimed (265) would correspond to one and a half months\u2019 work, which was not justified by the complexity of the case. The Government considered that the number of hours of legal work on a number of specific tasks was excessive. They pointed out, inter alia, that the applicants\u2019 lawyer had claimed fifteen hours to study the Court\u2019s case-law in the Chamber proceedings and a further twenty-four hours for the same task in the Grand Chamber proceedings. Similarly, he had claimed ten hours of work to study the file and the relevant Hungarian law before the Chamber and a further forty hours for the same work before the Grand Chamber.",

The Court finds, however, that the amount claimed appears to be excessive, having regard to the relevant economic circumstances and the examples from its case-law.
