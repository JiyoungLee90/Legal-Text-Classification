It must nevertheless be noted that the monitoring failed to produce any decisive results enabling the conclusion to be reached that Mr\u00a0Valenzuela\u00a0 had been guilty of making the threats of which he was suspected, inasmuch as the only finding was that frequent calls in which the caller had remained silent had been made from his home to the home of the person receiving the threats, as the caller had hung up as soon as [the victim] answered. The decisive factor in this respect [the finding that the applicant was guilty] was the evidence as a whole including the amparo appellant\u2019s recent relationship with [Mrs\u00a0M.], the fact that he was the deputy head of personnel in the company where she worked, the fact that it had been shown that some of the calls had been made from that company\u2019s premises, the fact that the photographs enclosed with some of the anonymous letters were from the company\u2019s archives to which only members of the personnel department had access, [Mr Valenzuela\u2019s] reactions during the oral hearing, etc. That evidence, which was properly reviewed by the [Audiencia provincial] in a clearly reasoned judgment that was not illogical, may be considered to have been sufficient to rebut the presumption that the appellant was innocent...\u201d",

It reiterates that the conditions referred to in the judgment cited by the Government concerning the quality of the law stem from the Convention itself. The requirement that the effects of the \u201claw\u201d be foreseeable means, in the sphere of monitoring telephone communications, that the guarantees stating the extent of the authorities\u2019 discretion and the manner in which it is to be exercised must be set out in detail in domestic law so that it has a binding force which circumscribes the judges\u2019 discretion in the application of such measures (see paragraph 46(iii) and (iv) above). Consequently, the Spanish \u201claw\u201d which the investigating judge had to apply should have provided those guarantees with sufficient precision. The Court further notes that at the time the order for the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s telephone line was made it had already stated, in a judgment in which it had found a violation of Article 8, that \u201cthe law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to this secret and potentially dangerous interference with the right to respect for private life and correspondence\u201d (see the Malone judgment cited above, p. 32, \u00a7 67). In addition, it points out that in any event the investigating judge who ordered the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s telephone communications had himself put in place a number of guarantees which, as the Government said, did not become a requirement of the case-law until much later.",
