The applicant's heirs also claimed that his standing in the country and abroad had been tarnished as a result of the protracted proceedings, that he had in effect been denied the opportunity to return to his native country for their duration in fear of being wrongfully persecuted and had been forced to sever various family and other relationships as a result. Due to his death prior to the termination of the proceedings he had also been denied the opportunity to return to his country.",
