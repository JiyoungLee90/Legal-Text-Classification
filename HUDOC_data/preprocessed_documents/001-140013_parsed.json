The latter was taken to a room where he was given first aid by an ambulance doctor. As Mr Shchiborshch was bleeding profusely from his neck, it was decided to take him urgently to a hospital. He was carried on a blanket to the ambulance and transported to City Hospital no. 7. R. then called for an investigative unit to inspect the scene. It was established that Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch had wounded four police officers. R. returned to the OVD and was later informed that Mr Shchiborshch had died. In his view, it had been the result of a tragic concurrence of circumstances, since in his presence nobody had either beaten or hit Mr Shchiborshch.

He had been forcibly placed for in-patient treatment a number of times as he had never agreed to it voluntarily. His condition had gradually worsened in the past four years: anxiety had been exacerbated, delirious ideas had accumulated and he had been losing contact with the people around him. He considered everybody his enemy and persecutor. His condition had worsened considerably since he had stopped taking regular medication. The investigator asked K. whether Mr Shchiborshch, who would have been suffering from fatigue in the absence of the necessary medication, could have actively resisted his placement in hospital. K. answered that in a delirious period he could be aggressive and reveal great physical force, because he perceived everyone as a persecutor. K. also submitted that Mr Shchiborshch had resisted the previous placements in hospital but she did not know whether he had used weapons. The investigator further asked about Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch\u2019s relationship with his parents.

In addition to his initial statement he submitted that when Mr Shchiborshch had opened the lobby door he had not known that he and the police had come to place him in hospital, otherwise he simply would not have opened the door. On that day he had mistaken the first applicant for a burglar and had been holding a knife. The first applicant warned the police that when Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch saw them he might try to lock himself in the flat. That is why when Mr Shchiborshch opened the door, the first applicant asked one of the police officers to hold it open. Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch was wielding a knife and would not let anyone near him. Police officer G. then aimed his gun at Mr Shchiborshch and told him to drop the knife. Mr Shchiborshch did not react and shouted back at G. to take away the gun. G. eventually put the gun away but Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch would not drop the knife. G. then made a movement towards him, probably intending to seize the knife, and Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch, while wielding the knife, wounded G. in the chest. The latter moved aside. One of the police officers took a baby pram that had been placed nearby and tried to knock the knife out of Mr Shchiborshch\u2019s hand with it. Another officer hit his other hand with the butt of a submachine gun trying to remove it from the door handle so as to stop him closing the door.",

However, the assistance of the police was required in order to place Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch in hospital, as the first applicant could not have done it on his own. He believed that the police officers had had to apprehend Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch because his psychiatric condition at that time had been very serious.

However, the negotiations with Mr Shchiborshch did not lead to any results. Furthermore, the latter threw a heavy object through the glass door of the kitchen and shards of broken glass fell on the police officers; and he kept lunging at them with a knife. Given how small that part of the flat was, those actions were really dangerous for the police, so it was decided to apprehend him. During the operation the police were equipped with bullet-proof vests, shields and helmets. The leather gloves with kevlar inserts that S. was wearing had no metal inserts. Through the broken glass in the kitchen door the police could see that Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch had barricaded the door with furniture and a refrigerator. The four police officers tried to open it. B. had a big shield which he pushed against the kitchen door with the help of S. and Kh. When they managed to slightly open the door, B. leaned with his hand against the door stud and Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch wounded him in the palm of his right hand.

The second applicant stated that the submissions of S. and D-n. of the special police unit were untenable and pointed out that in response to important questions they had answered that they either did not know or did not remember. In particular, they did not remember how they had broken the kitchen door and the kitchen table and thrown them into the lobby. Immediately after the events the first applicant found a broken table leg in the kitchen near the balcony window. The end of the table leg had blood on it. The first applicant put it on the balcony, where it remained to this day. Hence, D-n.\u2019s statement that he had found a rubber truncheon on the refrigerator in the kitchen was untrue, as a rubber truncheon could not have been there. Not only had the regular police squad not entered the flat but by that time they had left, and the special unit officers were the first ones to enter the kitchen.

Moreover, D-n.\u2019s submissions that he had entered the balcony through the broken window made no sense given that he could have used the door. Similarly, it was unlikely that he had not heard Mr Shchiborshch calling the police for help, as his first call, made at 2.10 p.m., had been heard even by those standing in the lobby. Therefore, it was untenable that D-n., standing next to the kitchen door, had not heard the call made at 2.39 p.m.",

They also submitted that it was possible that after having sustained the craniocerebral trauma, Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch had been able to move independently for a short period of time. In cases of similar craniocerebral trauma, there could be periods \u2013 ranging from several minutes to several hours \u2013 when the injured person was able to talk and consciously perform certain actions. The craniocerebral trauma was caused by a hard blunt object with a limited surface. It could not be ruled out that it was caused by kicking with boots. However, there were no signs leading to the conclusion that it was caused by a baton. The experts further stated that inflammatory complications in the brain could not have developed in the course of the forty minutes\u2019 resuscitation efforts before Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch\u2019s death. Lastly, having regard to the entry in Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch\u2019s medical file to the effect that he had suffered from moderate blood loss, the experts stated that the results of the general blood test showed that blood loss had been light to moderate. They reiterated that Mr Shchiborshch\u2019s death had been caused not by the blood loss alone but by a combination of factors.",

However, he refused to accompany them and resisted the police officers with the use of arms, wounding one of them in the chest and finger. Given that Mr Shchiborshch committed a criminal offence by using violence against a police officer on duty and that he posed a danger to others, it was decided to ask a special police unit for support in order to apprehend him. After negotiations with Mr Shchiborshch had proved futile, the special unit officers stormed the flat. In the course of the operation they used rubber truncheons, handcuffs and means of defence. As a result of Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch\u2019s actions, four police officers sustained various injuries. As a result of the police operation, Mr Shchiborshch was apprehended and immediately transferred to hospital for medical assistance, as he had sustained injuries. He died on the same date.",

The police officers could not have left the flat without having apprehended him. Similarly, they were unable to use certain special tools as they would have endangered other residents. The police officers had valid reasons to call the special police unit for assistance, since Mr Shchiborshch had actively resisted them and had wounded one of them in the chest. The use of special tools in order to apprehend him was also justified as his mental state and the fact that he had wounded a police officer were reasons to believe that he posed a real danger to them and might commit unlawful acts in respect of others or hurt himself. In accordance with the Law on Police 1991, police officers may use physical force if other means employed in order to fulfil their duties prove futile. A police officer may use special tools to repel attacks against the police and other citizens.

Whereas according to some of them Mr Shchiborshch\u2019s death had been caused by massive blood loss, others concluded that it had been caused by the craniocerebral trauma. Therefore, the investigation was unable to establish with certainty the cause of death and had to take into account all the injuries. In particular, all the experts agreed that the neck wound had probably been caused by a glass shard. As Mr Shchiborshch was resisting the police from behind the balcony door in which there was broken glass, he probably sustained that wound when some of the police officers pulled him by the hand and he cut himself on a protruding glass shard. The police thus had no intention of injuring Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch and he sustained the injury also as a result of his own actions. Such an injury, regarded as grave and possibly the cause of Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch\u2019s death, could not have been foreseen.",

Whereas some of the reports stated that it could have been caused as a result of Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch hitting his head against something or falling down, other reports concluded that it had probably been caused as a result of blows to the head. A definitive conclusion might have been reached following an additional examination of Mr Shchiborshch\u2019s skull, but his relatives did not give their consent to exhumation and the investigator\u2019s request for exhumation was refused by the court. Therefore, there remained no further opportunities to clarify the cause of the injury, and the investigation still had certain doubts in that respect. Should the craniocerebral trauma have been caused as a result of Mr Shchiborshch\u2019s falling onto protruding objects, no questions concerning the police officers\u2019 responsibility would arise. Should it have been caused by blows to the head, the investigation took the view that the police had had no intention of harming Mr Shchiborshch. That was confirmed by the fact that immediately after the storming of the flat, a doctor had been asked to provide him with medical assistance. From the witness statements it followed that the police had used rubber truncheons to knock the knife out of Mr Shchiborshch\u2019s hands. It could not be ruled out that some of the blows had accidentally hit Mr Shchiborshch on the head. However, that would not have been intentional. In any event, any conclusions in that respect were of a probabilistic nature and could not be regarded as established facts, as the investigation had unresolvable doubts concerning the cause of the injury. Taking this into account, there was insufficient evidence to show that the police officers had committed an offence, and the investigation should therefore be closed.",

It was likewise in accordance with section 14 of the Law on Police, which authorised the police to use force and special tools in particular situations. As it had been established that at the time of the events Mr Shchiborshch had posed a danger to himself and others, and had resisted the lawful demands of the police, the use of force had been justified. Furthermore, it had also been established that a number of his injuries, including those leading to his death, had been self-inflicted either intentionally or negligently through actions resulting from his mental state.",

Firstly, they maintained that the entire operation had not been conducted in a way that minimised the risk to Mr Shchiborshch\u2019s life. The operation had been neither well-planned nor controlled. Whereas under the applicable law, involuntary hospitalisation had to be carried out by psychiatric emergency services personnel, with police officers providing assistance if necessary, in this case the police acted on their own. Furthermore, the special police unit stormed the kitchen without any grounds for applying such drastic force and still in the absence of psychiatric assistance, which was on its way. Moreover, given that it was not the first time that Mr Shchiborshch had had to be subjected to involuntary hospitalisation, the police could have foreseen his reaction and planned the operation in such a way as to make it less traumatic for him, which had not been done. Secondly, the use of force was disproportionate. Even though Mr Shchiborshch was armed with a knife, he was only trying to hide in the flat and did not try to attack anyone. Furthermore, being of slender build and exhausted by his condition, he could hardly have posed any real danger to police officers wearing bullet-proof vests, helmets and Kevlar gloves and equipped with shields. The applicants further pointed out that neither the regular police nor the special police had been trained to deal with mentally unstable persons and thus had not been able to act appropriately in the situation, especially in the absence of any qualified medical personnel. The applicants also argued that the use of rubber truncheons by the police had been unlawful. At the same time the police failed to even consider using other special tools, such as electroshock or tear gas, which might have minimised the damage caused to Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch. In particular, no evidence was submitted to show that they had actually checked the possibility of using tear gas. Overall, in the applicants\u2019 view, the State was responsible for their son\u2019s death.",

The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see Andronicou and Constantinou, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0171, and Huohvanainen v.

Any use of force must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c).

When lethal force is used within a \u201cpolicing operation\u201d by the authorities it is difficult to separate the State\u2019s negative obligations under the Convention from its positive obligations. In such cases the Court will normally examine whether the police operation was planned and controlled by the authorities so as to minimise, to the greatest extent possible, recourse to lethal force and human losses, and whether all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of a security operation were taken (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27\u00a0September 1995, Series\u00a0A no. 324, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0146-50 and\u00a0194; Andronicou and Constantinou, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0171, 181, 186, 192 and 193; Ergi v.\u00a0Turkey, 28\u00a0July 1998, Reports\u00a01998-IV, \u00a7\u00a079; Hugh Jordan v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a024746/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0102\u201304, ECHR\u00a02001-III; Makaratzis v.

Between 11.20\u00a0a.m. and 12:40 p.m. on 7 July 2006 the first applicant went with police officers G., L. and D. to Mr Shchiborshch\u2019s place of residence (see paragraphs 18, 22 and 23 above). On arrival, the police officers put on bullet-proof vests and hid in the stairwell on the sixth floor. The first applicant rang at the door. Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch opened the door. Being in a delirious state, he did not recognise his father, and when he saw the police he mistook them for burglars. He had a kitchen knife in his hand and began to wield it, trying to force them out. He stabbed G. in the chest with it and also cut G\u2019s finger. The police officers tried to explain that they wanted to take him to hospital. The attempted negotiations, which lasted several minutes, proved futile. Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch still believed that the police were burglars and shouted at them to go away. At a certain point he started throwing faeces at them. The police then tried unsuccessfully to knock the knife out of his hand with rubber truncheons and a submachine gun butt. The use of the latter was confirmed by the statements of the first applicant, L. and G. (see paragraphs 68, 72 and 79 above). The police also used a baby pram which they found in the lobby either to defend themselves from the attempts to stab them or to try to knock the knife out of Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch\u2019s hand (see paragraphs 26, 39, 68, 77, 78, 80 and 102).",

During all that time, Mr Shchiborshch remained barricaded in the kitchen. D-n. was the first to go up to the sixth floor to find out what the situation was. The other three police officers were ordered to go up after about fifteen minutes. D-n. then told them that Mr Shchiborshch was threatening to kill them, saying that the kitchen door was under electric current. Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch shouted that he had already \u201cknocked down\u201d one man and that the same would happen to the others (see paragraph 19 above). While they were still in the lobby, the special unit police officers heard a crash in the kitchen, and then the glass in the kitchen door broke. They could see Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch through the opening in the door. He was holding a knife in each hand. The police officers introduced themselves and asked him to put the knives down. The negotiations were mostly conducted by D-n. and lasted about ten or fifteen minutes (see paragraph 21 above). Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch did not react to the requests to drop the knives and surrender, and continued to lunge at the special unit officers. The latter then put on bullet-proof vests and prepared to storm the kitchen. It is not clear when and exactly how the decision to storm was taken (see paragraphs 23, 37, 39, 53, 91, 104, 109 and 148 above).

Kh. then retreated and D-n. accompanied him to the doctor in the lobby. Kh. no longer took part in the operation. B. again took up the position in front of the door with S. behind him. When D-n. returned from the lobby he stood behind S. They kept pushing against the door while Mr Shchiborshch pushed against it from the other side. After a while the police pushed the door abruptly and there was crash sound on the other side. Then they saw Mr Shchiborshch stepping back towards the balcony. As he ran towards the balcony, according to S. he twice stumbled against pieces of the barricade and fell (see paragraph\u00a091 above). When he was on the balcony the police cleared some of the barricade and entered the kitchen.

Mr Shchiborshch kept moving around and hitting his head and shoulders against the broken glass that remained in the window frames (see paragraph 91 above). After D-n. had knocked the knife out of Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch\u2019s left hand, the latter continued to lunge with his right hand. S. caught him by the wrist and with his other gloved hand caught hold of the knife\u2019s blade. Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch tried to free himself and pulled S. towards him. S. lost his balance and fell down on the balcony floor with Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch, putting all his weight on the latter. Although it cannot be established with certainty, it cannot be ruled out that the police kicked Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch (see paragraphs 65, 115 and 128 above). D-n. then handcuffed him and the police took him to the kitchen and put him on the kitchen floor. It appears that he was bleeding profusely.

However, even leaving that question aside, the Court finds that the use of special tools in these circumstances did not comply with the police\u2019s duty to minimise the risks to Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch\u2019s life and health. Although the Court has accepted that there existed grounds for Mr Shchiborshch\u2019s involuntary hospitalisation, no evidence has been submitted to show that he posed such an immediate danger to himself or others as to require urgent measures. Insofar as he might have endangered the police officers, having threatened them with a knife and, indeed, having wounded police officers B., D-n., G., and Kh., the Court considers this to have been caused by the police\u2019s own actions. As corroborated by a psychiatrist\u2019s opinion, Mr Shchiborshch resisted the police with arms trying to protect himself from \u201cburglars\u201d because of the delirious and agitated state he was in, when he was neither aware of the meaning of his actions nor able to control them (see paragraphs 59 and 208 above). This is further confirmed by Mr Shchiborshch\u2019s telephone calls to the police and the ambulance service asking for help because burglars in police uniform had broken into his flat. The Court reiterates that the police were not supposed even to proceed with the involuntary hospitalisation in the absence of qualified medical personnel. A fortiori, when they nevertheless started to act on their own and were faced with the fact that Mr\u00a0Shchiborshch was in a delirious state and therefore unable to comprehend who they were or their demands, the only appropriate recourse was to discontinue any efforts to apprehend him until the arrival of psychiatric assistance. However, they persisted in their attempts to apprehend him as if they were dealing with any armed offender. The Court is particularly struck by G.\u2019s order to shoot to kill should Mr Shchiborshch try to leave or attack the police (see paragraphs 26, 68, 70 and 209 above), which, although not executed, in the Court\u2019s view was clearly excessive and demonstrated the police officers\u2019 inability to assess the situation and react appropriately.",

No explanation for such a delay has been provided to the Court. Moreover, at the same time a special police unit was called for support. The Court notes that the responsibilities of special police units include a range of tasks aimed, in particular, at ensuring public safety in public spaces, including in a state of emergency; crime prevention; participation in the investigation of crimes; and the fight against terrorism (see paragraph 193 above). Assistance in involuntary hospitalisation is not specifically mentioned among their tasks and functions, and no evidence has been provided to the Court that the special unit officers had had any special training in that respect. Consequently, for the reasons set out in the preceding paragraph with respect to the regular police unit, the Court considers that the special unit\u2019s attempts to apprehend Mr Shchiborshch in the absence of qualified medical personnel did not correspond to their duty to minimise the risks to his life and health. The Court notes in this respect that following the arrival of the special unit, negotiations with Mr Shchiborshch were conducted by D-n., who was a sniper by training (see paragraph 55 above) and thus had neither the relevant training nor experience of dealing with mentally disturbed individuals. The Court finds it particularly difficult to understand why the special unit acted on its own when emergency psychiatric assistance had already been called for and Mr Shchiborshch remained barricaded in his kitchen, where he posed no imminent danger to anyone.",

From the materials available to it, the Court has only incoherent information about how the decision to storm was taken. It appears that the police had not received orders to that effect when they left for the operation, and the decision was taken somewhat hastily when they were in Mr Shchiborshch\u2019s flat and he kept refusing to give himself up (see paragraphs 36, 91 and 104 above). The Court accepts that in certain situations the police might need to decide on the use of force very quickly, in particular where there are reasons to consider that their lives or the lives of others are in immediate danger (see Andronicou and Constantinou, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0191-93). However, the Court does not consider that this was the situation at hand. Mr Shchiborshch remained barricaded in his kitchen for hours, in an attempt to protect himself from the police whom he believed to be burglars. He did not attack them unless they approached him, did not pose an immediate danger to others, and emergency psychiatric assistance had already been called for. Thus, the Court finds no pressing circumstances that would require any urgent actions on the part of the police. However, there is no evidence that the storming operation resulted from any kind of preliminary planning and consideration.

However, even assuming that the lethal injuries were the consequence of his own actions, the Court considers this to be the result of the way in which the involuntary hospitalisation operation was carried out, in particular: (i) emergency psychiatric assistance was called for with an inexplicable delay; (ii) both police units, who had received no special training in dealing with mentally disturbed individuals, acted on their own in the absence of qualified medical personnel, contrary to domestic law; (iii)\u00a0the police used force as if dealing with any armed offender and without regard to Mr Shchiborshch\u2019s delirious state or to the fact that he did not pose an immediate danger to either himself or others; (iv) the storming of the kitchen in which Mr Shchiborshch had barricaded himself, in the course of which he sustained injuries that proved lethal, was not subject to any preliminary planning and assessment but was hastily decided at the scene in the absence of any call for urgent action. Taking into consideration all these circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the police operation in the present case was conducted in an uncontrolled and unconsidered manner and that the measures taken by the police lacked the degree of caution to be expected from law-enforcement officers in a democratic society (see Golubeva v. Russia, no. 1062/03, \u00a7 110, 17 December 2009).",

The Court reiterates that it has already found on a number of occasions that there is no case-law authority for Russian civil courts to be able, in the absence of a finding of guilt in criminal proceedings, to consider the merits of a civil claim relating to alleged serious criminal actions. The Court has found that while the Russian civil courts in theory have the capacity to make an independent assessment of factual and legal issues, in practice the weight attached to the findings of the preceding criminal proceedings is so important that even the most convincing evidence to the contrary furnished by a plaintiff would be discarded and such a remedy would prove to be only theoretical and illusory rather than practical and effective, as required by the Convention (see Menesheva v. Russia, no. 59261/00, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2006III; Chember v. Russia, no. 7188/03, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2008; and Denis Vasilyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a032704/04, \u00a7 136, 17 December 2009). In cases where criminal proceedings against public officials were discontinued at the pre-trial stage or ended in an acquittal, any other remedy available to the applicant, including a claim for damages, had limited chances of success and could not be regarded as capable of affording redress to the applicant (see Tarariyeva v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a04353/03, \u00a7\u00a0101, ECHR 2006...
