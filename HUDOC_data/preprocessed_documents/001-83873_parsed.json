The writ reiterated the applicant\u2019s claims, enclosing copies of her request to the District Court to appoint an expert and to take a statement from G. for use at a hearing before the Supreme Court. It moreover outlined the facts of the case and stated the applicant\u2019s grounds for appeal. It referred to her claims, arguments and evidence submitted in the District Court proceedings. The applicant protested against the assessment made by the expert before the District Court. She maintained that G. had examined the house, including the roof, in detail before signing the acquisition offer. The offer of purchase had been issued on 6 June 1999 and G. had taken possession of the property on 25\u00a0June 1999, whereas the sales agreement had been issued on 27\u00a0August\u00a01999. Thus, the applicant argued, when the sales agreement had been issued, G. had been in possession of the property for two months without ever mentioning that there had been a discrepancy between the retail accounts of the house and the state of the house with regard to roof tiles. It was unthinkable that G. had not known that the tiles were old at the time of the sales offer and certainly upon signature of the sales agreement. It was improbable that G., who was an active person of keen interest, would not have taken a look at the roof. The slope of the roof had been quite steep and could be seen from the side-walk. It was preposterous to claim that the wording of the retail could be stretched to mean something other than what could be seen in plain sight. This was the essence of the case.",

This indifference was further illustrated by the fact that he alleged to have discovered a leak shortly after taking possession of the property but had made no comments during the signing of the sales agreement or the deed.

She also claims that the repairs were only that some of the oldest tiles or cracked tiles were exchanged for others and only in certain areas of the roof. When asked, the plaintiff did not remember if this had been especially discussed in detail with the defendant, when he examined the house the first time. She did however tell the defendant that the roof had been repaired and that it no longer leaked. It is the court\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff should have known that this description in the summary report for the sale of the house and the description of the current status of the roof, would give the defendant the wrong impression of the actual condition of the roof. The defendant should have reason to trust the description of the house in the summary report for the sale of the house and therefore have reason to believe the house had been renovated. Since the roof had not been fully renovated, the defendant has a right to compensation. In accordance with this and in other respects the Supreme Court of Iceland refers to the District Court ruling and proceedings and verifies the District Court ruling hereby.\u201d",

The purpose would have been to enlighten the Supreme Court about the fact that the purchaser had indeed known about the condition of the house upon purchasing it as he had inspected the roof himself. Besides, merely by looking at the roof from the sidewalk anyone could have seen that it was the original roof of the house, built 55 years ago, not a new roof. Such matters had been of great legal importance due to the 12 months time-limit for reclamation under the relevant national law. However, before the District Court the plaintiff had denied the applicant the possibility to summon the persons who had worked on the house as witnesses by refusing to disclose their names. In the applicant\u2019s view, his behaviour revealed an attempt to conceal information about the fact that he as the purchaser had thoroughly checked and been aware of the conditions of the roof in the summer of 1999. This point would have been one of the main items for her oral pleadings before the Supreme Court had the latter granted her request to hold an oral hearing. However, the argument had not been made out in the appeal, due to constraints imposed by the Supreme Court, by virtue of its restrictive practice with regard to written appeal submissions generally, and its conduct of the proceedings in this case. Her written observations had simply consisted of outlines of the main facts of the case. Thus she had not adduced references to national case-law, other expert opinions in the relevant field, further evidence, arguments or exhibits of relevant facts. Nor had she submitted any claims that the buyer had seen and approved of the house in its state at the material time or that he had thereby forfeited his rights.",

A further element of a fair hearing within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 is the right to adversarial proceedings; each party must in principle have the opportunity not only to make known any evidence needed for his claims to succeed, but also to have knowledge of and comment on all evidence adduced or observations filed with a view to influencing the court\u2019s decision (see, Mantovanelli v. France, judgment of 18 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II, p.\u00a0436, \u00a7 33).

Thus, there is an apparent discrepancy between the national standards applied and the Convention case-law (summarised in paragraphs 33 and 34 above), notably the requirement that regard must be had particularly to the nature of the issues to be decided by the appellate court, and whether these raise any questions of fact or questions of law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case-file.

Moreover, in her appeal to the Supreme Court, the applicant disputed the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the description of the property and presented a number of arguments challenging its findings to the effect that G. had been ignorant about the actual state of the roof at the time in point. With regard to this matter, which appears to have been an important issue of fact raised in the applicant\u2019s appeal,\u00a0it should also be noted that the applicant, as she had done unsuccessfully before the District Court, asked the Supreme Court to hear witnesses who had carried out work on the house for G. during the summer of 1999. In the light of this and bearing in mind what was at stake for the applicant, the Court finds that the question of her liability to pay compensation to G. could not, as a matter of fair trial, have been properly determined by the Supreme Court without a direct assessment of the evidence given by the\u00a0parties in person (see, Ekbatani v.
