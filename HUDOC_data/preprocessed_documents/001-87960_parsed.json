After pre-trial investigations the criminal case, in which the mother of the applicant claimed damages, was set down for trial by the public prosecutor six months after the accident (7 December 2000). Exactly one year after that date \u2013 less than eleven months after the first hearing \u2013 the court of first instance pronounced its judgment (7 December 2001). In the meantime fourteen hearings had been scheduled, of which ten were adjourned. That fact alone makes it clear that the national courts apparently did not want to lose extra time and showed particular diligence. Three and a half months later (26 March 2002) the regional court dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicant\u2019s mother. A further three months later \n(25 June 2002) the Court of Appeal upheld the appeal lodged by the applicant\u2019s mother and T.M. The case was sent back to the court of first instance. In the second half of 2002 six hearings were scheduled but adjourned at the request of T.M. or the insurance company. Still, seven months after the judgment of the court of appeal the court of first instance delivered another judgment (23 January 2003). Three and a half months later (8 May 2003) the regional court rejected the appeal lodged by the applicant\u2019s mother. Six and a half months later (20 November 2003) the court of appeal quashed the previous judgment and sent the case back for retrial. After the retrial, judgment was delivered on 3 March 2004. \nThree and a half months later (27 May 2004) the final judgment was given.",

All of these measures, undoubtedly, took time but none of them was unimportant in the overall objective of the pursuit of justice. In complaining about the length of the proceedings, reference is made, inter alia, to the fact that ten of the fourteen hearings held in 2001 were adjourned and that on two occasions judgments were quashed due to procedural errors. Undoubtedly, these events extended, somewhat, the overall duration of the proceedings but it is an unfortunate fact of life (and of legal systems) that adjournments are necessary and that errors, though regrettable, occur and require rectification. Eight of the \nten adjournments in 2001 were for reasons relating to the absence of witnesses or expert reports, for the purpose of hearing new witnesses and for ordering a new expert report. These appear to be entirely legitimate grounds for adjournment, not directly imputable to the Government.
