In this context the Court is particularly mindful of the objective difficulties experienced by applicants in collecting evidence to substantiate their claims about conditions of their detention. Still, in such cases applicants must provide a detailed and consistent account of the facts complained of (ibid. \u00a7\u00a0122). In certain cases applicants are able to provide at least some evidence in support of their complaints. The Court has considered as evidence, for example, written statements by fellow inmates or if possible photographs provided by applicants in support of their allegations (see, for example, Golubenko v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 36327/06, \u00a7 52, 5 November 2013, and cases cited therein; see further Tehrani and Others v. Turkey, nos. 32940/08, 41626/08 and 43616/08, \u00a7 88, 13 April 2010).",

Even though he was provided with a food bag for the whole day, there was no water available to prepare meals. He also missed the outdoor exercise period. The applicant continued to be subjected to such treatment during his trial and at detention hearings, which is when he most needed his powers of concentration and mental alertness.",

It also observes that such warrants, as a rule, contain classified information which provides, inter alia, for the protection of police informants, undercover agents or secret police methods. Accordingly, in the Court\u2019s opinion, when dealing with a request for the disclosure of a warrant, the domestic courts are required to ensure a proper balance of the interests of the accused and the public and the accused should be granted access to the documents in question unless there are compelling concerns to prevent such a decision.",

They did not specify why disclosure of the decision of 6\u00a0December 2004, after the applicant\u2019s mobile telephone communications had already been recorded and the investigation had been completed, would have impeded the effective administration of justice. As a result, the applicant did not know whether the decision complied with the law and what its content was. In that connection, the Court emphasises that the interception of telephone communications constitutes a serious interference with the right to private life and the person affected should in principle be able to have the proportionality and reasonableness of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles of Article 8 of the Convention. However, the applicant has not been afforded such a possibility. Against this background, the authorities\u2019 refusal to give access to any information concerning the interception of his telephone communications amounts to a violation of Article\u00a08 of the Convention.",
