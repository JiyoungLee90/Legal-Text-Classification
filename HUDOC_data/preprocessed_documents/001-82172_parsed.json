The extinction of the applicant companies\u2019 title was not, in his view, a deprivation of possessions nor a confiscatory measure for which payment of compensation would be appropriate, but simply a logical and pragmatic consequence of the barring of the right to bring an action after the expiration of the limitation period. In the alternative, Mummery LJ found that any deprivation was justified in the public interest, the conditions laid down in the 1980 Act being reasonably required to avoid the risk of injustice in the adjudication of stale claims and as ensuring certainty of title: those conditions were not disproportionate, the period of twelve years being reasonable and not imposing an excessively difficult burden on the landowner.",

Some of those purposes (i.e., the grazing) would have fallen within a hypothetical grazing agreement. But the rest are only consistent with an intention, verified by Mr Michael Graham, to use the land as they thought best. That approach was adopted from the outset.

They sought rights to graze or cut grass on the land after the summer of 1984, and were quite prepared to pay. When Pye failed to respond they did what any other farmer in their position would have done: they continued to farm the land. They were not at fault. But the result of Pye\u2019s inaction was that they enjoyed the full use of the land without payment for 12 years. As if that were not gain enough, they are then rewarded by obtaining title to this considerable area of valuable land without any obligation to compensate the former owner in any way at all. In the case of unregistered land, and in the days before registration became the norm, such a result could no doubt be justified as avoiding protracted uncertainty where the title to land lay. But where land is registered it is difficult to see any justification for a legal rule which compels such an apparently unjust result, and even harder to see why the party gaining title should not be required to pay some compensation at least to the party losing it. It is reassuring to learn that the Land Registration Act 2002 has addressed the risk that a registered owner may lose his title through inadvertence. But the main provisions of that Act have not yet been brought into effect, and even if they had it would not assist Pye, whose title had been lost before the passing of the Act.

As we have explained above, adverse possession can take place without it being readily detectable. In any event, this particular justification has much greater force in relation to unregistered land than it does for land with registered title. Unregistered title ultimately depends upon possession. It therefore behoves a landowner to be vigilant to protect that possession and not to sleep on his or her rights. ...

Applying the judgment of the House of Lords in the present case, the judge found that under English law as it stood up to the entry into force of the Human Rights Act 1998 the registered owner of the land lost all claim to it. However, on analysing the facts on a Convention basis, he found that there was no real public or general interest in the law on adverse possession in the case of registered land, and that the adverse consequences for the landowner were disproportionate.

Whilst accepting that in the case of unregistered land the law of adverse possession served two important public interests \u2013 namely the prevention of uncertainty and injustice arising from stale claims, and ensuring that the reality of unopposed occupation of land and its legal ownership coincided \u2013 the Chamber considered that the importance of these aims was more questionable in the case of registered land where the ownership of the land was readily identifiable by inspecting the proprietorship register of the relevant title at the Land Registry. However, the Chamber noted that, despite the major changes to the law of adverse possession made by the Land Registration Act 2002 (\u201cthe 2002 Act\u201d), in the case of registered land the law itself had not been abolished, and it rejected the applicant companies\u2019 argument that it served no continuing public interest so far as registered land was concerned.

The Chamber noted criticism of the state of the law by the domestic courts and the Law Commission, and further noted that the result for the applicant companies was one of exceptional severity in that not only were they deprived of their property but they received no compensation for their loss. The lack of compensation had to be viewed in the light of the lack of procedural protection for the right of property within the legal system in force at the relevant time. In this respect the Chamber attached weight to the fact that since the present case the law had been amended to provide for notice to be given to a paper owner before title is transferred, thereby giving the paper owner an opportunity to stop the running of the limitation period. The Chamber saw the changes in the law as an indication that Parliament had recognised the deficiencies in the procedural position of registered landowners before the 2002 Act. The Chamber concluded that the fair balance between the public interest and the applicant companies\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions had been upset, such that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

Secondly, they saw no justification for depriving them of the land without having to pay any compensation.

There were no exceptional circumstances which justified the taking of property without compensation. Thirdly, there was no justification for depriving them of their land when there was no procedural protection providing that the person in adverse possession only acquired title if he or she first stated a claim to which the formal title owner had an opportunity to respond.",

Unlike in previous cases, the Government in this case had not appropriated property to its own use, and had not introduced legislation for the involuntary transfer of private property from one person to another in pursuit of a social-policy objective. The only interference with the applicant companies\u2019 land came about through the actions of private individuals, the squatters, who obtained adverse possession in 1983-84. The outcome of the proceedings was dictated by the applicant companies\u2019 own inaction. They contended that the application to the present facts of the conventional case-law as to the necessity, in principle, for compensation to be paid in respect of deprivations of property confirmed the logic of analysing the case by reference to Article 6: the purpose of a limitation period is to deprive a claimant, at the end of the relevant time period, of any opportunity of enforcing his rights through the courts.

In other words, the Court must determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest and the interest of the individuals concerned. In determining whether a fair balance exists, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation, with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see AGOSI, cited above, \u00a7 52, and, for a more recent authority concerning a deprivation of possessions, Jahn and Others, cited above, \u00a7 93). In spheres such as housing, the Court will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, \u00a7 49, ECHR 1999-V). In other contexts, the Court has underlined that it is not in theory required to settle disputes of a private nature.

Andorra, no. 69498/01, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2004VIII). When discussing the proportionality of a refusal of a private television company to broadcast a television commercial, the Court considered that a margin of appreciation was particularly essential in commercial matters (see VgT Verein gegen Tierfabriken v. Switzerland, no.\u00a024699/94, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2001VI). In a case concerning a dispute over the interpretation of patent law, and at the same time as noting that even in cases involving litigation between individuals and companies the State has obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to take measures necessary to protect the right of property, the Court reiterated that its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention, and not to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless Convention rights and freedoms may have been infringed (see Anheuser-Busch Inc., cited above, \u00a7 83).",

The Court observes that the Court of Appeal in the present case was of the view that the Grahams had not established the requisite intention to possess the land, so that time had not started to run against the applicant companies (see paragraph 17 above). It nevertheless considered that the extinguishment of title at the end of the limitation period of an action for recovery of land was a logical and pragmatic consequence of the barring of the right to bring an action after the expiration of the limitation period. The House of Lords disavowed the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation of the law on intention to possess, but did not comment on the suggestion that to terminate title at the end of the limitation period was \u201clogical and pragmatic\u201d. Even though the general position in English law is that the expiry of a limitation period bars the remedy but not the right, the Court accepts that where an action for recovery of land is statute-barred, termination of the title of the paper owner does little more than regularise the respective positions, namely to confirm that the person who has acquired title by twelve years\u2019 adverse possession is the owner. Moreover, the law reflected the aim of the land registration legislation, which was to replicate the preregistration law so far as practicable. As already noted above (see paragraph 74), such a regime cannot be considered as \u201cmanifestly without reasonable foundation\u201d.",

The fact that the rules contained in both the 1925 and 1980 Acts had been in force for many years before the first applicant even acquired the land is nevertheless relevant to an assessment of the overall proportionality of the legislation. In particular, it is not open to the applicant companies to say that they were not aware of the legislation, or that its application to the facts of the present case came as a surprise to them. Indeed, although the case proceeded domestically as far as the House of Lords, the applicant companies do not suggest that the conclusions of the domestic courts were unreasonable or unforeseeable, in the light of the legislation.",

The Court would also add that, even under the provisions of the 2002 Act, which the applicant companies use as confirmation that the provisions of the earlier legislation were not compatible with the Convention, no compensation is payable by a person who is ultimately registered as the new owner of registered land on expiry of the limitation period.",

As pointed out in the judgment, not only is there nothing in principle to exclude the examination of a claim under Article 1 where the complaint is directed against legislation concerning property rights, but the Government\u2019s argument gives insufficient weight to the fact that the Court is concerned in the present case not only with the limitation of actions but with the law of adverse possession as it affects registered land. That law is embodied not merely in the provisions of section 17 of the 1980 Act, which bars a course of action to recover the land, but in the provisions of section 75 of the 1925 Act, the effect of which is to extinguish beneficial title to the property after twelve years\u2019 adverse possession. The Court of Appeal in the present case held that the extinction of the applicant\u2019s title (under section 75) was simply a \u201clogical and pragmatic\u201d consequence of the barring of an owner\u2019s right to bring an action (under section 15). This view appears to be endorsed by the majority of the Court in asserting that, where an action for recovery of land is statute-barred, \u201ctermination of the title of the paper owner does little more than regularise the respective positions, namely to confirm that the person who has acquired [the] title by twelve years\u2019 adverse possession is the owner\u201d (paragraph 76 of the judgment). Even if the provisions of section 75 are properly to be so regarded as a matter of domestic law, the fact remains, as noted in the judgment of the Chamber (\u00a7 55), that the combined effect of the legislative provisions was both to deprive the applicants of their substantive property rights and to preclude them from lawfully repossessing the land, the beneficial title to which they had lost.",

Rather, they represented generally applicable rules designed to regulate questions of title in a system in which twelve years\u2019 adverse possession was sufficient to extinguish the former owner\u2019s right to re-enter or to recover possession of land. We can agree that the loss of beneficial title in such circumstances is to be seen as a \u201ccontrol of use\u201d of land rather than a \u201cdeprivation\u201d of possessions.

In these circumstances, we share the view of the majority that the extinction of the beneficial ownership of the registered title-holder following the expiry of twelve years of adverse possession cannot be said to be manifestly without reasonable foundation and that the system, as applied in the case of the present applicants, may therefore be said to have served a legitimate aim in the general interest.",

In the Consultative Document of the Law Commission (paragraph 30), four particularly cogent reasons were identified for maintaining a law of adverse possession \u2013 the prevention of uncertainty and injustice arising from stale claims; the avoidance of the risk that land becomes unmarketable when possession and ownership are out of kilter; the avoidance of hardship to an innocent but mistaken squatter, who may have incurred expenditure on the land; and the facilitation of the investigation of title to the land (and see, in this regard, The Holy Monasteries v. Greece (9 December 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 57-61, Series A no.\u00a0301A), in which acquisition by adverse possession was found to be of particular importance because there was no land survey in Greece, and because it had been impossible to have title deeds registered before 1856, and legacies and inheritances registered before 1946 (see \u00a7 60)).",

As pointed out by the Law Commission, the traditional reasons advanced to justify a law of adverse possession which resulted in the extinguishment of title on expiry of the limitation period had lost much of their cogency. This view was shared in the circumstances of the present case both by Lord\u00a0Bingham and by Mr Justice Neuberger, who found that the uncertainties which sometimes arose in relation to the ownership of land were very unlikely to arise in the context of a system of land ownership where the owner of the land was readily identifiable by inspecting the proprietorship register.",

In this regard, the position of the adverse possessor is entirely different from that of the long-leasehold tenants in James and Others, whose moral entitlement to acquire the freehold of houses they occupied at below market value under the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 was found to derive from the fact that they and their predecessors had not only paid a capital sum to acquire the leasehold interest but had over the years invested a considerable amount of money in the upkeep of houses which had been their homes.",

The legal owner is then granted two years within which to regularise the position as, for example, by evicting the adverse possessor. The effect of the 2002 Act was, as pointed out by Judge Strauss in the case of Beaulane Properties Ltd v.
