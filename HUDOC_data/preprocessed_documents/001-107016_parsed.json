[GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7 159, 9\u00a0April\u00a02009). Given the principle of legal certainty, the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction in this regard is nevertheless not open-ended (ibid, \u00a7\u00a0161).\u00a0Where the death occurred before ratification, only procedural acts or omissions occurring after that date can fall within the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction (ibid, \u00a7 162).\u00a0Furthermore, there must be a genuine connection between the death and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of that State for the procedural obligation to come into effect. In practice, this means that a significant proportion of the procedural steps required by this provision have been, or should have been, carried out after ratification. The Court has also held that circumstances may emerge which cast doubt on the effectiveness of the original investigation and an obligation may arise for further investigations to be pursued (see Hackett v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 34698/04, 10 May 2005). While it cannot be the case that any assertion can trigger a fresh obligation, where there is a new credible allegation, piece of evidence or item of information relevant to the identification, prosecution or punishment of the perpetrator of an unlawful killing, the authorities are under an obligation to take further investigative measures (see Brecknell v. the , no. 32457/04, \u00a7 71, 27\u00a0November\u00a02007). The principles regarding the procedural obligation to investigate under Article 2, outlined above, apply similarly to the procedural obligation to investigate under Article 3 (see Tuna v. , no. 22339/03, \u00a7\u00a7 58-63, 19 January 2010).",

The applicant was questioned for the first time about that incident in May 2004, in the context of the criminal trial against him, when he identified the alleged perpetrators. The criminal court then established in December 2004 that the applicant had indeed been ill-treated at Smederevo police station. The Court is of the opinion that this called into question the effectiveness of the original investigation and the obligation to investigate was revived (contrast \u00c7akir and Others v. Cyprus (dec.), no.\u00a07864/06, 29 April 2010, in which the names of those allegedly responsible provided in 2005 were already known in 1974). In order to demonstrate that there was no relevant new information after ratification, the Government maintained that the names of the alleged perpetrators could have easily been established already in 2001. However, this argument reinforces the doubts about the effectiveness of the original investigation, more than anything else. The Court therefore dismisses the Government\u2019s objection.",

What is more, in December 2004 the criminal court found that the applicant had indeed been a victim of police brutality (see paragraph 17 above). It is striking that the prosecutor nevertheless failed to take any action in that regard. It is true that with the passage of time the applicant must have become aware of the lack of an effective investigation; this is shown by the fact that he lodged a new criminal complaint in November 2006 (see paragraph 20 above). That being said, the relatively short period involved is not sufficient for the Court to conclude that the applicant should already have been aware more than six months before he lodged the application in May 2006 of the ineffectiveness of the investigation. It follows that this complaint is not out of time for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. This objection is therefore also to be dismissed.",

Whatever the method of investigation, the authorities must act as soon as an official complaint has been lodged. Even when strictly speaking no complaint has been made, an investigation must be started if there are sufficiently clear indications that ill-treatment has been used. The authorities must take into account the particularly vulnerable situation of victims and the fact that people who have been subjected to serious ill-treatment will often be less ready or willing to make a complaint (see Bat\u0131 and Others v.

While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law (Schenk v. Switzerland, 12 July 1988, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, Series A no. 140; Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal, 9 June 1998, \u00a7 34, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV; and Heglas v.\u00a0the Czech Republic, no. 5935/02, \u00a7 84, 1 March 2007). It is, therefore, not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence \u2013 for example, evidence obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law \u2013 may be admissible. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the unlawfulness in question and, where the violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2000V; P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR 2001-IX; and Allan v. the , no. 48539/99, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2002IX).",

This finding applies irrespective of the probative value of the statements and irrespective of whether their use has been decisive in securing a conviction (see G\u00e4fgen v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 166, 1 June 2010).",

However, they refused to bar the admission of the statements which the applicant had made before the investigating judge on 13, 14 and 19 February 2001. It is further noted that the medical reports confirmed that the applicant had indeed been brutally beaten up (his injuries included a broken rib) and that the Government did not contest the veracity of the applicant\u2019s allegation that he had also received electric shocks and been subjected to death threats and asphyxiation. In view of the seriousness of this ill-treatment as well as its proximity to the confession made before the investigating judge, the Court sees no reason to doubt that the applicant did indeed make that confession in fear of further ill-treatment by the police and therefore as a result of his ill-treatment at Smederevo police station. The fact that the police were able to secure the applicant\u2019s return to police custody and continue with his ill-treatment even after the applicant had been committed to a remand prison proves that his fears were reasonable (compare Harutyunyan v. , no. 36549/03, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2007VIII). Furthermore, the applicant was not able to consult properly (notably, in private) with his lawyer prior to making the confession before the investigating judge on 13 February 2001 and made statements before the investigating judge on 14 and 19 February 2001 in the absence of his lawyer (compare Hac\u0131 \u00d6zen v. , no. 46286/99, \u00a7 102, 12 April 2007). In these circumstances, the Court concludes that regardless of the impact those statements had on the outcome of the criminal trial, their use rendered the trial as a whole unfair. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
