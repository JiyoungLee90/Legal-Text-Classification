That provision specified that a court could extend a period of detention for up to ten days (or up to fifteen days at the request of the suspect or accused) in order to study all the information necessary to take a balanced decision on the person\u2019s detention (see paragraph 41 above). The Court has previously held that an extension under Article 165-2 of the CCP could be justified in particular circumstances where the court required time to establish the person\u2019s identity and collect other information crucial for taking a decision on his or her pre-trial detention. At the same time, the Court noted that the reasons not to release the person should be compelling (see Barilo v. Ukraine, no.\u00a0607/06, \u00a7 93, 16 May 2013). In the present case the reasons for such an extension advanced by the national court in its decision of 24 December 2010 were vague and concerned unspecified information about the applicant\u2019s health, family and financial situation, and his occupation (see paragraph 26 above). It therefore appears that the court authorised the further ten days\u2019 detention only in order to provide the investigating authorities with more time to substantiate their request, when there was no evidence that any circumstances had prevented them from doing so before submitting a request for detention. Moreover, it does not appear from the documents submitted by the parties that there were any compelling reasons for the applicant\u2019s continued detention (see and compare Barilo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a091-98; Gal v. Ukraine, no. 6759/11, \u00a7 32, 16 April 2015; and Kushch v. Ukraine, no. 53865/11, \u00a7\u00a7 113-15, 3 December 2015).",
