The case originated in an application (no. 54991/10) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Bulgarian nationals, Mr Krastyo Chonov Chorbadzhiyski (the first applicant) and Ms Desislava Krasteva Krasteva (the second applicant), on 3 September 2010.
The applicants were represented by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev and Ms S. Stefanova, lawyers practising in Plovdiv. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V. Obretenov, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicants alleged violations of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention on account of the excessive amount of court fees that they had been ordered to pay in relation to their claims for damages against the State. They also complained under Article 13 of the Convention of the lack of effective remedies in that respect.
On 27 May 2012 the first applicant died. On 30 November 2012 the second applicant, who is the first applicant’s daughter and only legal heir, expressed the wish to continue the proceedings not only in her own name, but also in his stead.
On 26 April 2017 notice of the complaints concerning the excessive amount of the court fees was given to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicants were born in 1914 and 1972 respectively. At the time of lodging the application they lived in Plovdiv.
On 29 August 1998 Ms Chorbadzhiyska, the first applicant’s wife and the second applicant’s mother, died as a result of a tree branch falling during a storm.
Several years later, on 6 August 2003 the applicants brought a civil claim under the State Liability for Damage Caused to Citizens Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”) jointly against the State, the Plovdiv Municipality and two individuals who had asked the municipal authorities to remove the tree. The applicants sought 2,000,000 Bulgarian levs (BGN – 1,022,584 euros (EUR)) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage and BGN 200,000 (EUR 102,258) in respect of pecuniary damage suffered as a result of the loss of their wife and mother. In the course of the proceedings the applicants were represented by the first applicant, who practised as a lawyer.
On 5 November 2004 the Plovdiv Regional Court dismissed the applicants’ claims. It noted that under the 1988 Act the State did not have any standing per se, and could only be held liable through its agents and bodies. In the case at hand, those were the municipal authorities. It, however, concluded that the Plovdiv Municipality could not be held responsible since Ms Chorbadzhiyska’s death had been accidental. It likewise dismissed the claim against the two individuals, whose actions had had no connection with the accident. It went on to say that the applicants’ claims for damages were rather excessive and were not supported by evidence. Referring to section 10(2) of the 1988 Act, the court ordered the applicants to pay BGN 88,000 (EUR 44,994) in court fees, amounting to 4% of BGN 2,200,000 – the total amount claimed by them in damages.
The applicants appealed against that judgment. On 21 March 2006 the Plovdiv Court of Appeal partly upheld and partly quashed the lower court’s judgment. It discontinued the proceedings against the State, finding that part of the claim inadmissible as a result of the State’s lack of standing, and upheld the ruling dismissing the claim against the two individuals. The court went on to say that the cutting down of trees did not amount to administrative activity and that the 1988 Act was not therefore applicable. It recharacterised the claim against the Plovdiv Municipality as an action under general tort law and remitted the case to the Plovdiv Regional Court for a fresh examination. It also quashed the order for the court fees to be paid.
The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law. On 10 January 2007 the Supreme Court of Cassation set aside the lower court’s judgment and referred the case back to the Plovdiv Court of Appeal. It found that the lower court had correctly characterised the claim against the municipality as falling under the general law of tort, but instead of referring the case back to the first-instance court, the Plovdiv Court of Appeal should have dealt with the claims itself.
On 24 July 2008 the Plovdiv Court of Appeal awarded each applicant BGN 50,000 (EUR 25,565) in non-pecuniary damage (BGN 100,000 (EUR 51,130) in total for the two applicants), plus interest, and dismissed the remainder of their claims. It said that they had failed to show that there had been special circumstances justifying the extremely high quantum of their claims. Noting that the statutory court fees had not been paid up front, the court ordered the applicants to jointly pay BGN 126,000 (EUR 64,423) in court fees. The amount, calculated as a pro rata percentage of BGN 2,100,000 – the part of their claims that had been dismissed – corresponded to a fee of 4% of the amount in question for the first-instance proceedings and 2% for the appeal proceedings.
The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law. They complained that the damages awarded had been too low to compensate them for the loss of their relative’s life. They further said that by imposing significant court fees, the courts had in fact sanctioned them and had taken away all that had been awarded. On 5 September 2008 the Sofia Court of Appeal returned their appeal on points of law, noting that it had been submitted after the statutory time-limit.
The municipality appealed on points of law. It argued that Ms Chorbadzhiyska’s death had been accidental. It also pointed out that the appellate court had wrongly proceeded with the examination of the claims instead of first instructing the applicants to pay the statutory court fees. On 10 March 2009 the municipality’s appeal on points of law was admitted in part for examination by the Supreme Court of Cassation. It noted that the municipality had raised two legal questions – one substantive and one procedural. It decided to admit the substantive question concerning the causal link in cases of vicarious liability for examination. It, however, stated that though the procedural question in relation to the payment of the court fees was, in principle, relevant, as the appellate court’s judgment on the rejected part of the applicants’ claims had become final and because that court had already ordered payment of the court fees, the examination of that question would not lead to a different outcome.
On 10 March 2010 the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the Plovdiv Court of Appeal’s ruling. It found that the municipality’s liability for the incident had been established and that the amount of the awarded compensation had been justified.
On 13 and 15 April 2010 respectively the applicants asked the Supreme Court of Cassation to vary its ruling in relation to the court fees on the ground of Article 248(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure 2007 (“the 2007 Code”, see paragraphs 37-39 below). Relying on the Court’s judgment in Stankov v. Bulgaria (no. 68490/01, 12 July 2007), the applicants argued that in reply to that judgment, the 1988 Act had been changed and no longer required the payment of court fees by claimants in case their claims against the State had been allowed in whole or in part by the courts (see paragraph 34 below). In the alternative, they submitted that even though their claim had been re-characterised under general tort law, in line with the applicable rules of procedure, before having examined the case on the merits, the Plovdiv Court of Appeal should have first instructed them to pay the court fees. Instead, that court had ordered the payment of the court fees, whose amount had significantly exceeded the awarded compensation, only at the close of the proceedings.
On 17 June 2010 a three-judge panel of the Supreme Court of Cassation turned down their request. The court noted that the Plovdiv Court of Appeal in gross violation (в грубо нарушение) of the rules of procedure had wrongly proceeded to examine the applicants’ claims without ordering them to first pay the statutory court fees. It however pointed out that the procedure for amending a judgment in relation to the costs of proceedings under Article 248(1) of the 2007 Code was only applicable to expenses, and did not cover court fees which were fixed by virtue of the statutory provisions and could not therefore be reduced at the courts’ discretion.
The applicants lodged a further appeal before another panel of the Supreme Court of Cassation. Again they referred to the Court’s judgment in Stankov (cited above) and the right of access to a court under Article 6 of the Convention. They argued that the first panel had wrongly limited the subject matter of Article 248 of the 2007 Code and that the costs of proceedings also covered the court fees which a party to the proceedings had been ordered to pay. The applicants further submitted that the court fees, even though fixed by law, had to be collected upon submission of the claim and not at the close of the proceedings as it had happened in their case.
On 14 January 2011 a three-judge panel of the same court upheld the decision. This panel went on to say on the substance of the applicants’ claim that it could not amend the appellate court’s costs order under the procedure laid down in Article 248 of the 2007 Code since that judgment had become final in respect of the rejected part of the applicants’ claim. It further explained that the court could not at its discretion change the amount of the court fees, which were fixed by the statutory provisions. Only in certain cases, a party to the proceedings could be exempted from the payment of the court fees. This was not the case here - the applicants’ claim, although submitted under the 1988 Act, had been re-characterised as falling under the general law of tort by the Supreme Court of Cassation in its judgment of 10 January 2007 (see paragraph 11 above). That legal characterisation was also upheld in the ensuing appellate and cassation proceedings.
On 25 March 2010 the Plovdiv Regional Court issued a writ of execution against the applicants for the amount of BGN 126,000 (EUR 64,423), as ordered by the Plovdiv Court of Appeal (see paragraph 12 above).
On 2 March 2011 the Plovdiv Municipality paid in total BGN 267,868.86 (EUR 136,960) or to each of the applicants the amount of BGN 133,934.43 (EUR 68,480), covering the awarded compensation (see paragraph 12 above), including interest running from 29 August 1998.
On 11 April 2011 the second applicant transferred to a bank account of the Plovdiv Directorate of the National Revenue Agency the amount of BGN 73,292.09 (EUR 37,474) due for the court fees, including interest.
On 28 April 2011 the first applicant also transferred to the Plovdiv Directorate of the National Revenue Agency the amount of BGN 73,451.13 (EUR 37,555) due for the court fees, including interest.
After payment of their debt to the State budget, the total net amount left to the applicants as a result of the judicial proceedings was BGN 121,125.64 (EUR 61,931), in other words, each applicant received BGN 60,562.82 (EUR 30,966).
The domestic provisions concerning State liability for damage were summarised in Zaharieva v. Bulgaria ((dec.), no. 6194/06, §§ 40-41, 20 November 2012).
In accordance with the established practice in civil proceedings in Bulgaria, the courts examine and determine the legal characterisation of claims submitted to them, without regard to the legal characterisation proposed by the claimant. The claimant must identify the disputed issue by clarifying the facts and the claim made but is under no duty to specify its characterisation in law. Even if the claimant indicates a legal characterisation of the claim, the courts are not bound by it. They must make their own independent assessment (решение № 1208 от 19.07.1998 г. по гр.д. № 915/98 г., V г.о ВКС, решение № 75 от 15.08.1988 г., по гр. д. № 26/88 г., ОСГК на ВС).
The general rules of the law of tort are set out in sections 45 to 54 of the Obligations and Contracts Act 1951 (“the 1951 Act”). Section 52 of the 1951 Act provides that the amount of compensation to be awarded in respect of nonpecuniary damage is to be determined by the court in equity.
In applying that provision, the former Supreme Court held that the notion of “equity” is not an abstract concept but requires the assessment of a number of specific, objectively existing circumstances which have to be considered by the courts when determining the amount of compensation. Such circumstances include the age of the victim, his or her social position, and the relationship between the victim and the relative who seeks compensation for non-pecuniary damage (Постановление № 4 от 23.XII.1968 г., Пленум на ВС) as well as the specific economic situation in the country (решение № 749 от 5.12.2008 г. на ВКС по т. д. № 387/2008 г., II т. о., ТК, решение № 83 от 6.07.2009 г. на ВКС по т. д. № 795/2008 г., II т. о., ТК).
In accordance with the practice of the domestic courts between 2000 and 2006, the compensation for non-pecuniary damage awarded to family members in connection with the unintentional death of their relatives varied between BGN 10,000 and BGN 20,000 (see, for instance, решение № 28 от 13.05.2004 г. на ВКС по н. д. № 634/2003 г., II н. о., in which the court awarded BGN 10,000 to the victim’s minor child in compensation for nonpecuniary damage and BGN 7,000 to her parents; решение № 1408 от 24.09.2004 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 874/2003 г., IV г. о., ГК, in which the court awarded BGN 20,000 to each parent for the death of their minor child; решение № 759 от 21.12.2004 г. на ВКС по н. д. № 381/2004 г., I н.o., in which the court awarded BGN 8,000 to the victim’s wife and BGN 6,000 to each of his children; решение № 965 от 6.01.2005 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 86/2004 г., I г. о, in which the court awarded BGN 10,000 to each parent for the death of their minor child; решение № 656 от 21.06.2005 г. на ВКС по н. д. № 1124/2004 г., II н.о., in which the court awarded BGN 20,000 to the victim’s wife and BGN 15,000 to each of his parents; and решение № 2876 от 20.02.2006 г. на ВКС по д. № 2240/2004 г. IV г. о., in which the court awarded BGN 40,000 to an adult child for the loss of her parents).
Later, the amount of compensation awarded as standard practice for non-pecuniary damage increased (see, for instance, решение № 83 от 6.07.2009 г. на ВКС по т. д. № 795/2008 г., II т. о., ТК, in which the court awarded BGN 90,000 to each of the parents for the loss of their eighteen year-old son; решение № 95 от 29.09.2009 г. на ВКС по т. д. № 355/2009 г., I т. о., ТК, in which the court awarded BGN 40,000 to the son of the victim; and решение № 205 от 26.11.2010 г. на ВКС по т. д. № 218/2010 г., II т. о., ТК, in which the court awarded BGN 60,000 to the victim’s wife and BGN 35,000 to each of his adult children).
The relevant provisions in the 1988 Act (see paragraph 8 above) concerning court fees were summarised in the case of Stankov v. Bulgaria (no. 68490/01, §§ 19-21, 12 July 2007) and more recently in the case of Zaharieva (cited above, §§ 43-48). The relevant provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure 1952 (“the 1952 Code”) and the 2007 Code (see paragraph 16 above) concerning court fees were summarised in the cases of Agromodel OOD v. Bulgaria (no. 68334/01, §§ 22-29, 24 September 2009) and Kirov and Others v. Bulgaria ((dec.), no. 57214/09, §§ 21-26, 9 January 2018). In particular, the general rule in civil proceedings is that the court fee is payable by the claimant up front, upon submission of the claim. The fee in respect of money claims is 4% of the amount claimed before a firstinstance court and 2% of the value of the claim when examined on appeal or in cassation. If the claim succeeds fully or partly, the defendant is ordered to reimburse the claimant’s costs, including court fees, in direct proportion to the successful part of the claim.
Under section 10(2) of the 1988 Act, as originally enacted, in proceedings under the Act, no court fees or costs were payable by the claimant up front, upon submission of the claim. However, if the claim was eventually wholly or partly dismissed, the court was to order the claimant to pay “the court fees and costs due”. The courts construed that provision as meaning that the claimant should pay fees calculated pro rata the dismissed part of the claim. As a result, where a court held that a claim for damages against the State was wellfounded but excessive as to quantum, it ordered the defendant State authority to pay damages to the claimant and at the same time ordered the claimant to pay court fees to the State budget. Where the claimant indicated too high an amount in the statement of claim, the fee could exceed the sum awarded in damages, the overall financial award being in favour of the State despite the finding that the claimant had suffered damage that called for compensation under the Act (решение № 1095 от 25.07.2000 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 139/2000 г.; решение № 805 от 1.08.2005 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 56/2004 г.). There was no provision for judicial discretion and considerations of equity played no role in fixing the fees’ amount; those fees were fixed by reference to the sums indicated in the statement of claim, even if in the course of the proceedings the claimant withdrew part of the claim (тълк. решение № 3 от 22.04.2004 г. по тълк. гр. д. № 3/2004 г., ВКС, ОСГК, точка 12).
Following the judgment in Stankov, as of 30 May 2008, the system of court fees under the 1988 Act was changed. At present, a flat fee for bringing a claim is due, which varies of either BGN 10 for individuals and non-governmental organisations or BGN 25 for other legal entities (approximately EUR 5 or EUR 13) in respect of firstinstance proceedings, BGN 5 or BGN 12,5 (approximately EUR 3 and EUR 6) in respect of appellate and cassation proceedings. Unlike the previous arrangement, the fee is payable up front.
Section 10(2) of the 1988 Act, as worded after 30 May 2008, provides that if the claim is rejected in full, the court must order the claimant to pay the costs of the proceedings. The claimant must also pay those costs if he or she withdraws the claim in its entirety. If a claim under the 1988 Act is allowed in whole or in part, the court is to order the defendant to pay the costs of the proceedings and to reimburse the court fee paid by the claimant. The defendant must also pay the claimant the fee of one counsel, if the claimant had retained counsel, pro rata the allowed part of the claim (section 10(3) of the 1988Act).
According to Article 63 § 1(b) of the 1952 Code, which was reproduced in Article 83 § 2 of the 2007 Code, individuals for whom the court established that they do not have sufficient means are exempt from the obligation to pay court fees and expenses. In establishing eligibility for this exemption, the court takes into account the person’s and his or her family income, the value of the estate, family and health circumstances, age, whether the person is employed or not as well as other relevant circumstances.
Under the 1952 Code a party could challenge the costs order by lodging an appeal against the lower court’s judgment. If the party does not wish to appeal against the ruling itself, the higher court would deal only with the costs order (Article 70 of the 1952 Code).
Article 81 of the 2007 Code provides that at each level the court has to rule on the costs claim in its decision ending the proceedings. The 2007 Code no longer provides for a possibility to challenge by way of appeal solely the costs order without challenging the judgment itself. If a party wishes to challenge the costs order only, it has to resort to the special procedure under Article 248 of the 2007 Code (see определение № 212 от 09.04.2009 по т.д. №189/2009 г., ТК на ВКС, опр. №57 от 03.02.2009 г. по т.д. № 632/2008, ТК II т.о. на ВКС; Сталев, Ж, А. Мингова, О.Стамболиев, В., Попова, Р. Иванова, Българско гражданско процесуално право, София, 2012 г., стр. 379).
Article 248 of the 2007 Code allows parties to seek an amendment of a judgment in relation to costs. The request has to be made within the timelimit for appeal or, if the judgment is not subject to appeal, within one month of its pronouncement. The court examines the costs order in camera and its decision can be appealed under the same procedure as the judgment.
In an interpretative decision of 2013, the plenary of the Supreme Court of Cassation’s Civil and Commercial Sections held that the costs incurred by the parties in relation to proceedings include both the court fees and the costs of the proceedings (see тълк. Решение № 6 от 6.11.2013 г. по тълк. д. № 6/2012 г., ВКС, ОСГТК). In a decision given on 16 September 2013 the Supreme Court of Cassation held that the procedure under Article 248 of the Code of Civil Procedure 2007 was likewise applicable to court fees which had been calculated wrongly by the courts (решение № 202 от 16.09.2013 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 1456/2013 г.).
The provisions concerning the statutory rate of interest were summarised in Zaharieva (cited above, § 42).
After the introduction of the currency board in 1997 in response to the financial crisis of 199697, inflation rates in Bulgaria were relatively stable. According to data of the World Bank, in 2003 – when the applicants brought their claims – the inflation rate was 2.35%, whereas in 2010, at the close of the proceedings, it was 2.44%.
