None of them had been elected to the City Council in the local elections. The court heard evidence from these persons and considered that the applicant\u2019s statements had been untrue. The article distributed by the applicant contained statements which lacked any factual basis. In addition, it could have caused the fact that H.O. and K.S. had not been elected to the city council and W.M. had received fewer votes. The court further stressed that the applicant had not mentioned that he had a criminal record. On 26\u00a0May\u00a01992 he had been convicted of participation in a hooligan scuffle and sentenced to one year\u2019s imprisonment, suspended for four years.

Relying on Article 10 of the Convention he maintained that he had been punished for criticising the local authority. However, as it emerged from the European Court of Human Rights\u2019 case-law the limitations of acceptable criticism were wider as regards politicians than as regards private individuals.

It further considered that the applicant\u2019s untrue statements could not be considered as part of \u201cacceptable criticism\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention. It considered that proceedings provided for under section\u00a072 of the Local Elections Act were aimed at ensuring the proper conduct of the electoral campaign by preventing infringements of the personal rights of those standing for election.

While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see Feldek cited above \u00a7 75). The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive (see, for example, Pedersen and Baadsgaard\u00a0v. Denmark [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2004-XI).",
