Having regard to the purchase price and the relationship between those who had signed the deed of sale, the court held that the pre-emption was manifestly unfair. It however rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint that the city had failed to duly inform him of its decision to pre-empt (sections 9 and 10 of the Pre-emption Act). Having noted that the buyer was not the applicant but a company to be set up later, it also rejected his complaint that the city could not pre-empt the property as the sellers and the buyer were close relatives (sections 1, 5 and 21a). The fact that the deed of sale had subsequently been altered to the effect that the applicant stated that he had taken the place of the company did not detract from this position. The alteration had been made only on 24 June 1997, that is, after the lower court had rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal.",

Furthermore, the fluctuations in the market value were reflected in the taxation value with a delay of several years. The drop in the relevant property\u2019s value followed the general price development.

Referring to the Government Bill on the enactment of the Pre-emption Act and on subsequent amendments thereto, the court noted that the aim of the said Act was, inter alia, to slow the increase in value of real property and to reduce the number of cases in which the parties to the purchase, in order to evade tax, did not state the full price in the deed of sale. It also noted that a considerably lower price than the market value could be relevant to the assessment of whether the conditions for pre-emption were fulfilled. The purchase price had, however, to be assessed in the light of the situation on the real estate market and the planning of the area at the time of the pre-emption. The court considered that the taxation value as such did not attest the property\u2019s market value and that the afore-mentioned appraisal document and draft preliminary agreement were in part based on wrong assumptions. It noted that no town plan had been drawn up and that the property consisted of vacant land, whose price was affected by the advantageous location as to traffic communication and the expectations as regards future lucrative use of the property. The assessment of the value, however, could not have been based on the price of the permitted building volume expected to be allocated by a town plan.",

The court found that no credible and undisputed evidence as to the relationship between the purchase price and the market value had been presented. It could not be concluded that the purchase price had been considerably lower than the market value simply on the basis of the location of the property and the existence of a master plan which lacked legal effect. Furthermore, manifest unfairness within the meaning of section 6 of the Pre-emption Act could not arise solely from an advantageous purchase price. Nor was a court required to make precise comparisons of purchase prices. The Supreme Administrative Court concluded that the use of the city\u2019s first call on the property was not manifestly unfair, having regard in addition to the content of section 6 and the aim of the Pre-emption Act, as explained in the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires, to improve the land situation of the municipality by guaranteeing the availability of vacant land to be used for building purposes and for forwarding, to check real property speculation and to reduce the number of cases in which, in order to evade tax, the full price was not stated in the deed of sale. The court also noted that there was no evidence to the effect that the parties to the purchase had a special bond with the property in question. As to the other complaints raised by the applicant, it confirmed the lower court\u2019s view. The decision ran to 21 pages, of which 9 pages contained reasons.",
