However, the court found on the basis of the forensic medical evidence that X had still been alive before he had been run over by the car and that the injuries to X\u2019s chest, spine and aorta, which had been the direct cause of his death, had been caused by the applicant having intentionally run him over with his car. It further found it proven on the basis of the evidence at the scene \u2013 such as (i) a piece of rubber tube belonging to the applicant\u2019s car, (ii) the applicant\u2019s biological traces found on X\u2019s body, (iii) X\u2019s biological traces found on, inter alia, the applicant\u2019s clothing (which was blood-stained) and on the outside of the applicant\u2019s car \u2013 that the applicant had been beyond doubt at the crime scene and had had contact with X. Referring, in particular, to the findings of the experts in vehicle science, who had performed reconstructions at the scene testing the applicant\u2019s versions of events, the court discounted the possibility that the applicant had run over X by accident. The court furthermore found that the applicant and X had known each other, which was confirmed by the applicant\u2019s statements as well as by telephone records and witness testimony. Lastly, the court referred to the telephone records, together with other evidence such as medical evidence and X\u2019s petrol bill, when elaborating on the time of death, finding that it had undoubtedly occurred on 4 November 2007 \u2013 probably sometime after 6.24 p.m., when the last (missed) call from X\u2019s telephone had been recorded on the applicant\u2019s telephone.",

It further noted that the examination of the applicant\u2019s telephone had amounted to a violation of the said provision but carried no evidentiary weight, as at that point the police had already obtained the necessary information from X\u2019s telephone.

Firstly, as regards the police examination of X\u2019s mobile telephone, the Supreme Court pointed out that the applicant had not even argued that the examination of X\u2019s telephone had directly violated his own right to privacy. While not excluding the possibility that the examination of a deceased\u2019s person\u2019s telephone might impinge upon the most intimate spheres of his or her dignity, it considered that in the case at hand it had not interfered with X\u2019s right to privacy, as personality rights ceased at death. Neither had, in the Supreme Court\u2019s view, the applicant\u2019s own constitutionally guaranteed privacy rights been interfered with, as the examination had not revealed his identity. Moreover, the district state prosecutor and the duty investigating judge had been present at the scene of the crime when the police had discovered the telephone in X\u2019s car, and the applicant had been arrested only after the court order for the examination of X\u2019s telephone had been issued. The Supreme Court concluded that the police\u2019s examination of X\u2019s mobile telephone had not interfered with the applicant\u2019s right to privacy and that the impugned examination had not been causally related to the incriminating evidence.",

However, in the Supreme Court\u2019s view, the information on whether the text message with sexual content had been sent from the applicant\u2019s telephone would have inevitably been discovered, either (i) by means of a simple call to the number from which the message had been sent, (ii) by checking the applicant\u2019s telephone\u2019s SIM card (for which, in the Supreme Court\u2019s view, no court order would have been necessary), or (iii) on the basis of a court order, which had in point of fact later been issued.

Relying on Article 15 of the Constitution (again, see paragraph\u00a032 below), the applicant argued that the lower courts should have excluded the evidence obtained unlawfully. In particular, as regards the examination of X\u2019s telephone, the applicant argued that he \u201chad not sought redress for the violation of X\u2019s right to privacy (mental integrity) and freedom of communication as he had not been entitled to do so [... but rather] had exclusively pointed out that the violation had occurred and the [trial] court had based its decision [to convict the applicant] on the consequences of that violation ...\u201d In this connection he, referring to X\u2019s \u201cright to piety\u201d (pravica do pietete), disputed the Supreme Court\u2019s view that X\u2019s right to privacy had ceased with his death and pointed out that a court order had been nevertheless subsequently issued. With regard to the Supreme Court\u2019s finding that the evidence in question would have been inevitably discovered, the applicant argued that the domestic law contained a strict rule requiring the exclusion of all evidence obtained by means violating human rights (\u201cthe domestic exclusionary rule\u201d). He furthermore argued that there had been a violation of Article 29 (see paragraph 32 below) of the Constitution because the first-instance court refused to obtain from the police their notes on the examination of his telephone.",

The applicant made no complaints in relation to the procedure by which the courts reached their decision concerning the admissibility of the evidence (see Bykov, cited above, \u00a7 95). Indeed the crux of his complaint lies in his disagreement with the domestic courts\u2019 legal assessment of the admissibility of evidence (see paragraph 40 above), which is essentially based on the view that evidence which resulted from an unlawful examination or search but would have inevitably been discovered even in the absence of such an examination could be admitted to the criminal file (see paragraph 29 above).

However, the present case is exceptional in this respect because the Koper District Court and the Koper Higher Court both acknowledged that the examination of the applicant\u2019s telephone without a court order had been unconstitutional and therefore not in accordance with the law \u2013 a finding which was not rebutted by the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 22, 26 and 29 above). It is true that the domestic courts, citing the insignificant impact that the unlawful examination had had on the outcome of the proceedings and the inevitability of the discovery of the impugned evidence (see paragraphs 22, 26 and 29 above), rejected the applicant\u2019s application for the exclusion of evidence (see paragraph 57 above). However, the Court has examined this issue under Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 and has found that the fairness of the criminal proceedings against the applicant was not undermined (see paragraph 53 above). As regards the alleged violation of Article 8, it notes that the domestic courts in the criminal proceedings found that the examination of the applicant\u2019s telephone had been unlawful but that they were not in a position to award the applicant compensation for any non-pecuniary damage he might have incurred on that account. If the applicant considered that he had incurred such damage, he should have thus claimed it in civil proceedings. In this connection the Court reiterates that the existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which is not obviously futile does not constitute a valid reason for failing to pursue it (see, among many other authorities, Gherghina v. Romania (dec.) [GC], no.\u00a042219/07, \u00a7 86, 9 July 2015).",

The police, however, skip the warrant and search the house directly, finding the prohibited substance. When the evidence is challenged in court, the prosecution may invoke the \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d doctrine and argue that, under the circumstances of the case, the warrant would have been asked for and obtained, and the evidence would have been found in any case. Even if one conceded that this were true, the seemingly automatic application of this doctrine in this type of cases deprives the police of any incentive to actually request a warrant. More generally: the surer the police are that in a routine procedure they will find what they are looking for, the more likely they are to halt the formal procedures and the less likely they are to behave in a lawful way.

However, this difficulty would be outweighed by the parallel difficulty in actually obtaining the evidence through lawful means later.

In Nix the Supreme Court argued that the body would have been found in any event since there was a large-scale search in the area. However, there is no discussion in the decision as to when the body would have been found, and therefore in what state of preservation. It may very well be the case that the body was bound to be found at some future time, but that, had the illegal act not occurred, it would have deteriorated to the point where it could not be used as evidence. Generalising the point, it is arguable that the urge to find the evidence before it has deteriorated or been destroyed poses another kind of \u201cnow or never\u201d situation. Once the evidence is found, again it would be easy for the police to create a story showing the inevitability of the finding, ignoring the fact that the evidence might have been destroyed in the meantime.

Unlike the \u201cpurged taint\u201d and the \u201cindependent source\u201d exceptions, the \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d exception implies condoning a breach of Convention rights that did in fact happen and admitting evidence that was in fact obtained through a violation of Convention rights on the basis of an alternative, speculative course of events. This inexorably damages the integrity of the proceedings and is unacceptable in and of itself. Thus, the Convention compatibility of the \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d exception is not measured by vagaries in the timing of the discovery of evidence, but by the observance by the State authorities, including the judicial authorities, of the limits of their own powers in bringing offenders to justice. In fact, as Nix and its progeny show ex abundantia, the close relationship between the \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d doctrine and the \u201charmless-error\u201d doctrine accords \u201cexcessive discretion in the manner in which breaches of basic procedural rights ... are weighed against other procedural interests\u201d and therefore subordinates fundamental guarantees of criminal procedure to prosecutorial interests.
