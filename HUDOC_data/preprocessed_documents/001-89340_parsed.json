The fact that the said date was mentioned in the district prosecutor\u2019s decision to institute the investigation in case no. 59263 (see paragraph 15 above) does not in itself render the applicants\u2019 submission fabricated or false and might be the result of a simple clerical error.

However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III, p. 1020, \u00a7 64).",
