In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on the report dated 30\u00a0December\u00a01996, comprising fifty-six pages, and the oral hearing on 7\u00a0February 1997 of the psychological expert T.S. The expert had questioned and examined F. on five occasions and each of her parents on eight occasions respectively. Given the refusal of both F. and G.S. to meet the applicant in the presence of the expert, the latter had questioned them all separately. Having regard to the findings of this expert, the court noted that F., then aged twelve, had a negative attitude towards her father. The court, like the expert, considered that the negative attitude of the child towards the applicant might have partly been caused by the mother\u2019s influence, though not to the extent believed by the applicant. The court noted that according to the expert, the parents\u2019 ongoing quarrels had placed a great strain on the child. The court acceded to the findings of the expert that, in view of F.\u2019s intensive resistance against any contact with her father, enforcing such contacts might cause her serious psychological harm. The court further found that the expert opinion on the question whether it was in F.\u2019s best interest to have contacts with her father was exhaustive and conclusive. Accordingly, it had not been necessary to appoint a second expert or a psychiatric expert as requested by the applicant.",

Sweden, judgment of 29\u00a0October 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0212, p.\u00a013, \u00a7\u00a025, and Sablon v. Belgium, no.\u00a036445/97, \u00a7\u00a099, 10\u00a0April 2001). In its decision on admissibility rendered on\u00a020\u00a0September\u00a02001 the Court declared inadmissible the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 about the length of the court proceedings concerning access. It found that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies in this respect, because the submissions presented by his lawyer to the Federal Constitutional Court \u2013 which alone had been lodged within the prescribed one-month time-limit \u2013 had not, expressly or in substance, included a complaint about the length of the court proceedings at issue. Consequently, the Court has no jurisdiction to deal with this complaint. The decision declaring the application inadmissible in this respect is final and not open to appeal (see Helmers, cited above, p.\u00a013, \u00a7\u00a025; Sablon, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0100; Pitk\u00e4nen v.

In particular, the District Court had regard to the firm wish of the then ten-year-old child not to meet her father, as expressed at a hearing before that court. The Court of Appeal had noted that following the parents\u2019 ongoing quarrels F., then aged twelve, intensively resisted having contacts with her father. The court, relying on the report of a psychological expert, had therefore taken the view that enforcing such contacts would cause serious psychological harm to F. In reasoning their decisions to suspend access, the national courts had parted from the assumption that in principle, it was in a child\u2019s best interest to have contacts with both parents. However, due to the persistent and serious conflicts between the applicant and G.S., which had put a great strain on their child and had resulted in her rejecting her father, it had been necessary for F.\u2019s well-being to deny the applicant access to her.",

Even though the Court agrees with the national courts and the applicant that the child\u2019s negative attitude towards her father was presumably partly caused by G.S.\u2019s influence, it had nevertheless been the child\u2019s firm wish not to see her father which had prevailed. The national courts did not limit in time the prohibition of access, but made it clear that G.S. was obliged to contribute to a change in F.\u2019s negative attitude towards her father. They had therefore been aware of their duty to preserve the uniting bonds between father and daughter (see, mutatis mutandis, Nekvedavicius v. Germany (dec.), no.\u00a046165/99, 19\u00a0June 2003), and had tried to overcome any obstacles to granting at least a limited access.

However, in the present case the Court finds that the applicant is merely repeating, in substance, complaints he already made under Article\u00a08. Having regard to its above findings in respect of these two complaints (see paragraphs\u00a093 and 96 above) the Court finds that no separate issue arises under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 in these respects.",

The Court recalls that the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 must be determined according to a subjective test, that is on the basis of the personal conviction of a particular judge in a given case, and also according to an objective test, that is ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see, inter alia, Hauschildt v. Denmark, judgment of 24\u00a0May 1989, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0154, p.\u00a021, \u00a7\u00a046; Fey v.

There is no indication in the present case that the personal conviction of the judges of the Court of Appeal raised doubts about their impartiality. Furthermore, there are no ascertainable facts giving rise to an objectively justified fear that any of the judges of the Court of Appeal lacked impartiality. In particular, the mere fact that the judges assessed the evidence in a different way than the applicant does not warrant such a conclusion.",

The Court is called to review whether the decisions on the costs of the proceedings adopted by the domestic courts were arbitrary or unreasonable, rendering the proceedings unfair in this respect (see, among others, Baumann, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a049-50).",

It\u00a0further observes that in both instances the applicant lost his action aimed at being granted access to his daughter, which was the subject matter of the expert reports.
