Those expressions were uttered while the applicant discussed alleged corruption within the prosecution and what he saw as efforts on his part to combat it. The applicant also discussed the work of the prosecution office he had headed, the working methods he had introduced and the office\u2019s increased productivity as a result, as well as the problems he had encountered and the revision of his work carried out by a commission which included prosecutors he had been in conflict with, such as B.K. and G.C. (see paragraphs 8-13 above). It is true that he used strong, in his own words \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cunpleasant\u201d language (see paragraph 27 above), and named and criticized some of his opponents. Nevertheless, the Court considers that, taken as a whole, his interview did form a part of a debate on issues of considerable public interest and did not amount, as claimed by the Government (see paragraph 28 above), to gratuitous insult against the complainants. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s statements required, in principle, a high degree of protection under Article 10 of the Convention (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, \u00a7 88, ECHR\u00a02005-II). The authorities were under an obligation to adduce particularly relevant and sufficient reasons to show that the interference with the applicant\u2019s rights was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued.",

In its judgment convicting the applicant, the Plovdiv Regional Court, after satisfying itself that the applicant had uttered the statements at issue, which had been published in a national newspaper, and that the complainants, B.K. and G.C., had become aware of them and had felt \u201chumiliation\u201d, concluded that the applicant had been guilty of an offence under Article 148 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph\u00a020 above). It thus failed to weigh the alleged gravity of his conduct against his right to freedom of expression and to provide specific reasons showing the necessity of imposing a penalty, and made no attempt to account for the fact that the impugned statements were in the main aimed at contributing to a debate of considerable public interest. It also failed to take into account the fact, mentioned above, that in respect of public officials, including prosecutors, the limits of acceptable criticism should be wider than in respect of private citizens; instead of that it applied domestic law, which treats the official capacity of the victim of alleged insult as an automatic aggravating circumstance (see paragraph 24 above; on this question see also, for example, Bozhkov, cited above, \u00a7 44). Finally, the domestic courts did not assess whether the contested statements were value judgments and if they were, whether there was a sufficient \u201cfactual basis\u201d for such value judgments (see, for example, Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0155157, ECHR\u00a02015).The Court has on a number of occasions said that in determining whether an interference with the right to freedom of expression was justified, it has to satisfy itself, inter alia, that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 of the Convention (see, for example, Jersild v.\u00a0Denmark, 23\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 298, and Uj v. Hungary, no.\u00a023954/10, \u00a7 19, 19 July 2011); for the reasons above it does not consider that this was the case here (see Cholakov v. Bulgaria, no. 20147/06, \u00a7 32, 1\u00a0October 2013).",

Thus, the total sum payable by him amounted to more than BGN 14,800, the equivalent of EUR 7,565 (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above). Even though the applicant has not shown what his financial situation was at the time and whether he struggled to pay that amount, the Court is of the view that, in the circumstances, it was excessive (see Bozhkov, cited above, \u00a7 55). As already noted, this disproportionate sanction was imposed on him without a sufficient justification or an appropriate analysis of the different interests at stake.",
