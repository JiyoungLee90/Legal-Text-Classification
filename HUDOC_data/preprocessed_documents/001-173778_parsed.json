The statements used by the applicant were formulated as questions and concerns to which he expected to obtain answers (see paragraph 8 above). The domestic courts failed to consider the particularity of the small village, clearly demonstrated in the proceedings, where the same person acted in two different capacities both crucial to the local community, that of local mayor and chairman of the VFB. For instance, the domestic courts agreed that the lease payments might have been accepted by the claimant in his capacity as chairman of the VFB, which owned the premises. They established that the claimant, in the same capacity, had negotiated the amount of rent payable under the lease of the shop. Moreover, although no grants were received by the village itself, the VFB received them in the form of amounts covering the costs of refurbishment of its premises, which included the village shop and community hall (see paragraph 14 above).",

The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article\u00a010\u00a0(see, for example, Lingens, cited above, \u00a7 46). The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26\u00a0April 1995, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 313). However, in the present case the domestic courts failed to make a clear distinction and clarify whether the impugned statements had been value judgments or statements of facts.",

Poland, no. 51744/99, \u00a7 51, 9 January 2007). The Court reiterates in this connection that free elections and freedom of expression, particularly freedom of political debate, together form the bedrock of any democratic system (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v.\u00a0Belgium, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 47, Series A no. 113, Andrushko v. Russia, no. 4260/04, \u00a7\u00a041, 14\u00a0October 2010, and Athanasios Makris v. Greece, no. 55135/10, \u00a7\u00a036, 9\u00a0March 2017). The two rights are interrelated and operate to reinforce each other. For this reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely (see Bowman v. the United Kingdom, 19\u00a0February 1998, \u00a7\u00a042, Reports 1998-I).",
