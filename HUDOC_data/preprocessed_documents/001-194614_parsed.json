After the data had been entered into that program, in order to be able to read the data with a program available free of charge online, the data had to be exported from the special forensic-data-analysis program and converted back into an image format.

It clarified, however, that this might be debatable if, as in this instance, the data obtained by the investigating authorities had been in a form readable using standard software and had subsequently been encrypted in a way that had made them readable using only special software (see paragraph 8 above). In sum, the court concluded that since the data had been available to the defence in a form that had been readable with standard software on 4 September 2012 (see paragraph 33 above), they had had sufficient time to examine the files. At this point, there had been three months left before judgment had been rendered.",

The term material evidence cannot be construed narrowly in the sense that it cannot be confined to evidence considered as relevant by the prosecution. Rather, it covers all material in the possession of the authorities with potential relevance, also if not at all considered, or not considered as relevant (compare Edwards, cited above, \u00a7 36; Bendenoun v.\u00a0France, 24\u00a0February 1994, \u00a7 52, Series A no. 284; and Rowe and Davis, cited above, \u00a7 60). Failure to disclose to the defence material evidence, which contains such particulars which could enable the accused to exonerate himself or have his sentence reduced would constitute a refusal of facilities necessary for the preparation of the defence (see Natunen v.

The Court has also held that the entitlement to such disclosure of material evidence is not an absolute right. In any criminal proceedings there may be competing interests, which must be weighed against the rights of the accused. In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 \u00a7 1. Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see Rowe and Davis, cited above, \u00a7 61, with further references).",

The Government were of the opinion that it had not been necessary to allow for the possibility to listen to each and every recording and read each and every text message. The Court is indeed satisfied that, in view of the complexity of the criminal proceedings at issue (see Grega\u010devi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 58331/09, \u00a7 53, 10 July 2012), it was not necessary to allow for the opportunity that the applicant\u2019s lawyer read through and listen to each and every single item of the telecommunicationsurveillance data. Rather, it was, in principle, sufficient to allow an effective opportunity for the applicant\u2019s lawyer to analyse the recordings and text messages in order to identify and then listen or read those which he considered to be of relevance. In this connection, the Court is mindful of the fact that modern investigation means may indeed produce, as in the present case, enormous amounts of data, the integration of which into the criminal proceedings should not cause unnecessary delays to those proceedings. It therefore considers that the applicant\u2019s right to disclosure must not be confused with his right of access to all material already considered as relevant by the authorities, which will generally require for the possibility to comprehend the material in its entirety (see, as an exception, Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 581-85).",

Initially, the police provided the applicant\u2019s lawyer with the data produced in respect of certain search parameters of his choosing (see paragraph 12 above). Subsequently, it provided him with lists containing substantial amounts of information on the retrieved telecommunication data (see paragraph 15 above). In so far as the applicant alleged that the lists had fallen short of what he had requested, he has not substantiated why it would not have been possible to identify relevant data by substantially reducing the amount to actually listen to on the basis of search parameters and the provided lists. In fact, it appears that it was possible to narrow down the search by looking for specific telephone lines, for connections between specific telephones lines, within a certain frame of time, overall allowing for substantial reduction of the data with potential relevance. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s lawyer, who could have been expected to arrange for at least some shift in the emphasis of his work (see Mattick v. Germany (dec.), no. 62116/00, ECHR 2005VII, with further references), even if appointments with the police and in prison were, in particular due to limited opening hours (see paragraphs 11 and 19), difficult to arrange, only managed to examine the data on twenty-two occasions within more than one year, apparently never together with the applicant on the prison premises and not after 31 October 2012. At the same time, he neither made use of the possibility to have a judicial employee replace him, as the court had suggested, nor can it be taken from the applicant\u2019s submissions that his two other lawyers engaged substantially in the analysing, listening and reading exercise. It also has to be taken into account that the applicant, who had been the one subjected to the surveillance measures, would have known best what specific telecommunicationsurveillance data to look for. The Court therefore cannot see that the authorities provided the defence only with an ineffective opportunity to identify the relevant files.",

The Court furthermore observes that, after the applicant had only on 3 April 2012 (see paragraph 21 above) requested disclosure of the entirety of the electronic files, the authorities did not object in principle, but were ready to allow for examination. In this connection, the Court notes that on 22 May 2012 the authorities provided the applicant\u2019s lawyer with a copy of the entirety of the electronic files. This copy was, however, readable only with an expensive software which lawyers and private individuals appear to not usually have at their disposal (see paragraphs 8, 25 above). Therefore, the events following the request of 3 April 2012, in particular the dispute concerning the question whether the state should bear the cost for the expensive special forensic-data-analysis program (see paragraphs 26, 32 above), disclose practical difficulties in view of the encryptment of an enormous amount of data. The Court moreover notes that only in July 2012, the defence asked to be provided with a copy in a format readable with freely available software, a request to which the authorities agreed on short notice (see paragraph 33 above).

Their nature must, however, have allowed for an initial identification of files with potential relevance to the criminal proceedings, allowing already for a substantial reduction of the files to be actually looked at. Moreover, the electronic files must have stemmed from different people \u2013 amongst them also the applicant, giving him the best knowledge of their content \u2013 and from over a long period of time, allowing for further reduction of the search parameters. The Court therefore considers it to have been sufficient that the applicant\u2019s lawyer, who could have been expected to arrange for at least some shift in the emphasis of his work (Mattick, cited above, with further references), had at least from 4\u00a0September 2012, the day on which he was provided a full copy readable with software available free of charge, to 21 December 2012, the day judgment was rendered, which amounts to three and a half months \u2013 that is to say sufficient time \u2013 to analyse the electronic files in order to identify those which he considered to be of relevance.",

The Court has already held that Article 6 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Convention does not require the preparation of a trial lasting over a certain period of time to be completed before the first hearing. The question rather is whether the amount of time actually available before the end of the hearing was sufficient (Mattick, cited above).",
