It recalls that where the personal space available to a detainee is less than 3 sq. m in multi-occupancy accommodation, the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 arises. The burden of proof is then on the respondent Government which could rebut that presumption by demonstrating that there were all of the following mitigating factors: short, occasional and minor duration of such periods; sufficient freedom of movement outside the cell and adequate out-of-cell activities; and the applicant is confined in an appropriate detention facility and there are no other aggravating aspects of the conditions of his or her detention (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 136-37).",

Having examined all the material submitted by the parties, the Court has not found any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion on the admissibility and merits of these complaints. The Government did not show that an acute lack of personal space, if only during the night, was sufficiently compensated for by any mitigating factors (compare Butko, cited above, \u00a7 60). Rather the contrary, in some cases the crammed conditions were exacerbated on account of a shortage of sanitary facilities or, in the case of Mr Romanenko, the absence of a functioning flush toilet which was replaced by a bucket.",

The Court later arrived at the same conclusion in a number of cases (see, for example, Butrin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a016179/14, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-45, 22\u00a0March 2016).
