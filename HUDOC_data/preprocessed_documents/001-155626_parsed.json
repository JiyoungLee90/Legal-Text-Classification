They argued that under Article 338 CPP the acceptance of the reopening of proceedings had invalidated the finality of their first conviction. They pointed out that in the event of an application for reopening of proceedings the law was silent on the issue of the execution of the initial sentence and on the conduct of the future proceedings. The applicants submitted that the absence of provisions in that regard did not mean that there was a legal vacuum provided that any proceedings reopened returned to the trial phase. They added that persons being retried no longer had the status of convicted persons, which meant that the restriction on their liberty could no longer be considered as being in \u201cexecution\u201d of the sentence initially imposed on them. Consequently, they concluded that the reopening of the proceedings had given them prisoner status, and that they had therefore lost their \u201cconvict\u201d status.",

In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed.

Nevertheless, the Court considers that in the framework of this application it is not called upon to resolve that apparent clash between the manners in which a lower court and a higher court, that is to say the Court of Cassation, applied a domestic provision.",

As is clear from the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure referred to in the judgment (cited in paragraph 3 above), where new proceedings have been instituted, the conditions for reopening being fulfilled, the original conviction nevertheless remains in force, having binding legal effect, until the court seised in the reopening proceedings decides to confirm or annul it. In our view, this reasonable interpretation of domestic law is confirmed by the Assize Court\u2019s judgment in the first applicant\u2019s case dealing with the dispute on his eligibility to stand as a candidate for the Parliamentary elections in 2007. In the judgment of the Assize Court of 15 May 2007, as described in paragraph 24 of the present judgment, it is clearly stated that the original domestic judgment, convicting the first applicant, had acquired res judicata, the binding nature of which was still in force, and the Assize Court did not make any allowances in this regard for the fact that the request for reopening had been granted.",

We note that it is a general and necessary element in the Court\u2019s development of its jurisprudence in this field that the presumption of innocence is meant to protect individuals from being proclaimed publicly, characterised or treated by the domestic authorities as guilty of criminal acts if they have not been found guilty in accordance with the law. We note that there is nothing in the case-law, as it stands, to preclude member States from setting up a system, like Turkey has, whereby the original conviction retains binding legal force pending the outcome of new proceedings after reopening. Of course, as correctly stated by the majority in paragraph 55 of the judgment, in the new proceedings the accused must be afforded all the relevant procedural safeguards of a fair trial and to be presumed innocent. However, and importantly, the fact that a person has initially been convicted of a criminal act may have a bearing on the assessment of his legal situation in other contexts, even though the proceedings have been reopened, for example as regards his eligibility to stand for elections, at least until the new proceedings have been concluded and the initial conviction set aside, if that is the case.",

The majority continue by stating that the Ankara Assize Court, which decided the issue anew after the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment of 2007, confirmed that the fresh proceedings were to be considered completely independent from the original proceedings. However, the Court proceeds to fault the Assize Court for using the words \u201caccused/convicted person\u201d in its judgment, when their guilt had not been finally established in the new proceedings. The majority find this use of words by the Assize Court to constitute a violation of the right to be presumed innocent.",

The majority apply Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention to the facts of the case without taking adequately into account the context of the new proceedings and the continued binding legal force of the original conviction in accordance with domestic law and practice. Firstly, the Assize Court found itself in a delicate situation whereby it attempted to balance the conflicting position of the applicants, who were still, as a matter of domestic law, regarded as having been convicted of a criminal act according to the conviction from 1995, but were, at the same time, accused persons in the new proceedings entitled to all the guarantees of a fair trial, including the presumption of innocence. The use of the words \u201caccused/convicted person\u201d must be assessed in this specific context. Secondly, and more importantly, the applicants do not, in any shape or form, make the claim that the use of this combination of words had any effect on the way the Assize Court applied the burden of proof, assessed the evidence or the way they were treated in the course of the proceedings. Nor is there any allegation made by the applicants that the terminology used in the judgment had any practical implications for them during the proceedings. On the contrary, as the majority themselves acknowledge (see paragraph 59 of the judgment and paragraph 9 above), the Assize Court clearly confirmed that the applicants had to be afforded procedural safeguards, as the new proceedings were completely independent of the initial proceedings, in conformity with the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment of 2004. In other words, no claim has been made by the applicants that the use of words \u201caccused/convicted person\u201d, which must, as previously mentioned, be understood in the light of the special features of the Turkish system of reopening of criminal proceedings, should in substance be understood to mean that the Assize Court did not presume them to be innocent.",

But in the particular circumstances of this case, and for the reasons set out above, we fail to see how this wording constituted a violation of the principle of the presumption of innocence.

Again, the majority rely almost exclusively on the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment of 13 July 2004 to answer that question in the affirmative. The majority consider that as the new proceedings were completely independent from the first, and as the applicants should have been presumed innocent in the course of the new proceedings, the retention of the information about the original conviction on the criminal record constituted, in and of itself, a violation of the right to be presumed innocent.",

We reiterate that irrespective of the decision to reopen the case, the original conviction remains in force under Turkish law until the new proceedings are concluded by a final decision either to confirm or to annul it. Although it is clear under the Court\u2019s case-law that full procedural safeguards must be afforded in the new proceedings, including the presumption of innocence, this does not mean that changes to a criminal record need to be made, thus erasing the existence of an original conviction that still retains binding legal force, immediately upon the reopening of a case. Nothing in the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment of 2004 suggests otherwise. Again, that court only dealt with the issue of what procedural safeguards should be afforded to the applicants in the new proceedings, as they were to be considered independent of the original proceedings. Thus, the Court of Cassation did not call into question the continued binding legal force of the original conviction or give an opinion on whether it could have legal significance in other contexts, for example as regards information being maintained on the applicants\u2019 criminal record. Lastly, on the facts of this case, no claim has been made by the applicants that the continued registration of the original conviction in the criminal register had any bearing on the conduct of the new criminal proceedings by the Assize Court. To conclude, we disagree with the majority that Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention required, in the circumstances of this case and taking into account the applicable Turkish law, the erasure from the criminal register of the applicants\u2019 original conviction before the new proceedings were concluded by a final decision.",

The majority observe in this regard that there is seemingly an inconsistency between the laws in force at the material time, dealing with the conditions of eligibility to stand for elections, and the application of these laws by the different domestic courts. We understand the majority here to be stating that the way the Ankara Assize Court interpreted the relevant provisions of the electoral laws (see paragraph 24) did not comply with the interpretation given by the Court of Cassation in 2004 as to the independent nature of the new proceedings after reopening. In sum, the majority\u2019s reasoning for its finding of a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 is intimately connected to its view of the application of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention to the facts of the case, in particular the retention of information about the original conviction in the criminal record after the reopening of the proceedings (see paragraph 86 of the judgment).",
