It noted that the relevant land register listed the State Treasury as the owner of the plot. The land register could only be amended on the basis of an administrative decision issued by the Governor on the basis of section 18(1) of the Local Self-Government Act of 10\u00a0May 1990 (\"the 1990 Act\") confirming the ex lege transfer of ownership from the State Treasury to the local municipality on the basis of that Act (see paragraph\u00a036 below). The Governor had never given a relevant administrative decision. The civil court had no jurisdiction to order administrative bodies to issue administrative decisions. In the absence of such a decision the ex lege transfer of ownership to the municipality provided for by law could not become operative. In the absence of such a\u00a0transfer certified by a decision, the State Treasury remained the land\u2019s owner. It was therefore impossible for the court to order the municipality to sell the plot to the claimant or to amend the land register in such a manner as to list the municipality as the owner.
