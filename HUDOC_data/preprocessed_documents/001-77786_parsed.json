Thus, this reproach of violating the rules on professional conduct required of a judge consisted in concrete facts, which were not proved true by the records of the trial. The second statement was not only a value judgment, but also insinuated that judge K.-P. B. had sided with the accused K.\u00a0D. and had, thus, been partial. As it was not mentioned in the article that judge K.-P. B. had impartially conducted the trial and that only certain passages of the judgment were subject to that criticism, the statements could not be considered as value judgments based on facts. Rather, in their context, they were disparaging statements of facts, falling outside the scope of protection of Article 10 of the Convention. Since certain passages of the above judgment proved to be legally superfluous, as affirmed by the private prosecutor's decision of 18 September 1998 taking them out, they could have been subject to (fair) comment.",

Further, the domestic courts as well as the Government had disregarded that the article was earmarked as a \u201ccommentary\u201d, thus, indicating to any knowledgeable reader that it contained a critical assessment by the author. In the applicants' view, the courts had also ignored that the impugned statement only concerned the judgment of the private prosecutor and not the way in which he had conducted the proceedings. Therefore the applicants did not share the argument of the Government and the findings of the domestic courts that they had reproached the judge with not having observed the principle of an adversarial hearing or with having been partial. Moreover, they considered the Government's view to be inconclusive and overstepping the requirements of this Court's case-law in respect of Article 10 of the Convention that their critical remarks should have contained the fact that the proceedings had been (otherwise) conducted in a fair manner.

Firstly, the reasoning of the judgment concerned had been harshly criticised in the public media, including in \u201cDer\u00a0Standard\u201d in two other articles, one published on a different page the same day as the commentary at issue and the other already the day before. Secondly, the statement \u201cthe judgment delivered by the private prosecutor would only differ somewhat from the traditions of medieval witch trials\u201d made sufficiently clear that the criticism concerned the judgment and not, as the domestic courts and the Government found, alleged deficiencies by the judge in conducting the proceedings.",

However, unlike the Government and the domestic courts, which balanced the interests of the involved parties in favour of the judge's interest in protecting his reputation and the standing of the judiciary in general, the Court considers that the applicants' interest in disseminating information on the subject-matter, admittedly formulated in a provocative and exaggerated tone, outweighed the interests of the former in the circumstances of the case. The facts that those passages of the judgment concerned had later on been taken out by the judge himself, and secondly, that a warning had been imposed on that judge in subsequent disciplinary proceedings prove that that judge had not discharged the heavy responsibilities in a manner that was in conformity with the aims entrusted to judges (see e contrario, Prager\u00a0and Oberschlick, cited above). The Court therefore finds that the applicants complied with their duties, responsibilities and diligence as a public \u201cwatch-dog\u201d and that the criticism did not amount to any unjustified destructive attacks against the judge concerned or the judiciary as such (ibidem).",

Having in mind that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest, the Court finds that the domestic courts overstepped the narrow margin of appreciation accorded to Member States, and that the interference was disproportionate to the aim pursued and was thus not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",

The same applies for the cost order issued against the first applicant in the amount of EUR 152.61. As regards the second applicant's claim for reimbursement of the costs of the publication of the judgment in its newspaper, the Court observes that the publication has actually taken place, that it was the consequence of the judgment in respect of which the Court has found a violation of Article 10 and that the second applicant has shown sufficiently how it calculated the amount which, in itself, does not appear unreasonable. Therefore, the Court also awards this claim in full. Accordingly, under the head of pecuniary damages it awards EUR 152.61 to the first applicant and EUR 10,324.96 to the second applicant.",

As regards the Convention proceedings, the Government argued that the basis for calculation was too high and that when the applicants submitted their claims under Article 41, they merely re-submitted a compilation of claims they had already submitted earlier.
