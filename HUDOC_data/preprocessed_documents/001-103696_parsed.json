However, in the instant case the Court finds that the exclusion of the public was necessary, having regard to the classified character of the evidence and the State\u2019s legitimate interest in prosecuting drug-related offences. The exclusion of the public was further warranted by the need to keep secret police methods of investigation that had been used in the applicants\u2019 case and to take evidence from police officers who had carried out the covert operations. Moreover, the exclusion of the public needs to be seen in the context of the fact that no evidence was withheld from the defence and the Court\u2019s finding that the fairness of the proceedings had not been infringed. The Court also notes that the applicants\u2019 counsel did not object to the decision to hold the hearing in camera.

The Court has, on previous occasions, emphasised that an accused\u2019s effective participation in a criminal trial must equally include the right to compile notes in order to facilitate the conduct of his defence, irrespective of whether or not he is represented by counsel (see, for example, Pullicino v. Malta (dec.), no. 45441/99, 15 June 2000; Matyjek v. Poland, no. 38184/03, \u00a7 59, ECHR\u00a02007/05).",

It is pointed out by the Government that, in contrast to the Matyjek case, in which the Commissioner of the Public Interest was found by the Court to have had privileged access to confidential documents in the lustration proceedings, the prosecution and defence in the present case were subject to the same restrictions as regards access to the case-file, including the lack of possibility of taking notes on its contents. Even accepting this to be the case, it is, in my view, no answer to the principal complaint of the applicants, which is not that the restrictions upset the equality of arms between the parties but that they were an impediment to the effective conduct of the defence in their criminal trial. As the Court observed, in the different context of lustration proceedings in the Matyjek case, when regard is had to what is at stake for defendants in a criminal trial, it is in principle important for the defendant to have unrestricted access to the files and unrestricted use of any notes which they made, including the possibility of obtaining copies of relevant documents.",

The concerns to which this case gives rise are such that in my view the current system of classification of documents, and the measures restricting effective access to classified material by defendants and their counsel in a criminal trial, should be urgently reviewed to ensure their full compliance with the requirements of a fair trial in Article 6 of the Convention.",
