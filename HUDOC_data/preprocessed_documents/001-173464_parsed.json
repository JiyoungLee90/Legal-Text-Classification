The Court also found in subsequent cases concerning the Transdniestrian region that up until July 2010, the \u201cMRT\u201d was only able to continue to exist, and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region, because of Russian military, economic and political support (see Ivan\u0163oc and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 116-20; Catan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012122; and Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110).

Ireland [GC], no. 45036/98, \u00a7\u00a0142, ECHR 2005VI), such interference constitutes a measure of control of the use of property which falls to be examined under the second paragraph of that Article. For a measure constituting control of use to be justified, it must be lawful (see Katsaros v. Greece, no. 51473/99, \u00a7 43, 6 June 2002; Herrmann v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 9300/07, \u00a7 74, 26 June 2012; and Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v.

In the present case, the parties did not submit any argument which would indicate that the Moldovan Government had changed their position in respect of Transdniestria in the few months that followed until the decision of the \u201cMRT\u201d customs authority of 7 October 2010.
