Again, we are researching this, testing on the simulators and undertaking risk assessments, but it is likely that we will be looking to undertake some dredging to widen the shipping channel to the South so that some vessels, including the ferry, will be able to pass the South Hook Jetty with an LNG ship alongside at a further distance than would be the case otherwise.

He accepted that there was a mass of material, but considered that this was because the claim form had adopted a \u201cscatter gun\u201d approach and sought permission to challenge not merely the decision on 7 December 2004 in respect of the Dragon site, but also the earlier decisions in respect of that site going back some 18 months, and the decisions going back some 12 months in respect of the South Hook site. He noted that, in so far as the applicants complained of the absence of a comprehensive environmental impact assessment or its failure to take account of marine risks, the complaints were directed towards the grant of planning permission itself, rather than hazardous substances consent. In relation to both sites, relevant planning permissions had been granted more than three months before the judicial review proceedings were brought. Sullivan J was satisfied that the applicants had known of the relevant decisions they wished to challenge by August to October 2004.",

This is exactly the sort of endeavour which the court ought not to support. This appellant has had the opportunity to seek these documents at the time of the earlier proceedings, and it seems to me that the conclusion arrived at by Beatson J was entirely apposite: that this is indeed a reformulation of what was being sought in those proceedings. Those proceedings have already occupied the time of the  for a lengthy leave hearing, followed by two considerations by the Court of Appeal and it would be wholly wrong that permission should now be granted to bring judicial review in the present form.\u201d",

It was clear from the Court\u2019s case-law that Article 8 only applied to cases where severe environmental pollution was in fact occurring (citing L\u00f3pez Ostra, cited above, \u00a7 51) or where it had been determined that individuals were likely to be exposed to the dangerous effects of an activity in such a way as to establish a sufficiently close link with private and family life (Ta\u015fk\u0131n and Others v. , no. 46117/99, \u00a7\u00a0113, ECHR 2004X). In the applicants\u2019 case, no severe environmental pollution had actually occurred, nor was there any likelihood of exposure to such pollution through the operation of the terminals. Their allegations were confined to the potential marine risks posed by the operation of the LNG terminals. In such a case, in order to show that Article 8 was applicable, the Government contended that the applicants had to be able to assert arguably, and in a detailed manner, that for lack of adequate precautions taken by the authorities, the degree of probability of the occurrence of damage was such that it could be considered to constitute a violation (citing Asselbourg v.\u00a0Luxembourg (dec.), no. 29121/95, 29 June 1999). The applicants were not in that situation: the degree of probability of marine risks occurring and resulting in adverse consequences for the applicants was inevitably extremely small. In the Government\u2019s view, the mere possibility of harm was not sufficient for Article 8 to be applicable.",

They distinguished the case of Asselbourg, to which the Government referred, on the ground that in that case the applicants complained of a continuing nuisance without providing convincing evidence of that nuisance. The present case, by contrast, concerned a continuing threat, and there was copious evidence that fears as to the consequences of an LNG spill were real. In particular, industry reports demonstrated that there was a risk arising from LNG operations. In the applicants\u2019 view, Article 8 had to be applied in a precautionary way, and it would render that Article devoid of any purpose if it only applied after an accident which directly affected the applicants\u2019 private and family lives had occurred.",

In that case the absence of any internal decision or other official document indicating, in a sufficiently clear manner, the degree of risk which the hazardous activities posed to human health and the environment was held not to be fatal to the claim, given that the applicant had attempted to pursue domestic remedies, and that a previous incident involving an accidental spillage had resulted in a higher than usual reading of certain toxic products in the vicinity (at \u00a7\u00a7\u00a093-97 of the Court\u2019s judgment).",

The legislation obliges the planning authorities to take into account relevant environmental information and to this end, the developers were required to prepare and submit an environmental impact assessment of the project, identifying, inter alia, matters of concern in respect of public safety and the environment (see paragraphs 130-132 above). A process of assessment by relevant bodies and examination of the application by the planning authorities followed. A separate application was required in respect of hazardous substances consent (see paragraphs 10-11 and 138-139 above), with a similarly detailed examination by the relevant authority and an assessment by statutory consultees, which included the HSE and MHPA. The COMAH Regulations imposed further stringent requirements on the operators of the Dragon and South Hook sites to take all measures necessary to prevent major accidents and to limit their consequences (see paragraphs 144-148 and 152 above). MHPA itself has powers to regulate the use of the port and to issue instructions and directions to users to ensure safety within the haven (see paragraphs 154-155 above). It has voluntarily complied with the Code, which provides further guidance to improve safety with port areas (see paragraphs 157-158 above). Vessels entering the haven are subject to a regime of certification to ensure that they are capable of carrying dangerous liquids (see paragraph 156 above). Industry reports prepared by SIGTTO provide additional guidelines on selecting sites for LNG terminals and promoting best practice in the field (see paragraphs 161-170 above). The Court is accordingly satisfied that an extensive legislative and regulatory framework is in place in the United Kingdom, and more specifically at Milford Haven port, to promote safety and to limit the risks posed by the transfer and processing of LNG in the area.",

In respect of the more specific allegation that there had been no assessment of the consequences of a release of LNG for the local population, the judge did not accept that the evidence before the court supported the argument that there had been a failure in this regard. He observed that the HSE had assessed both the consequences and likelihood of an escape of LNG for all land-based and jetty-based activities. Although he mistakenly believed at that time that this included a major release from a delivery ship while tied up at the jetty, he later explained that this error did not affect his conclusions that the risk assessments had been adequate. He noted that the HSE had carried out an assessment of the possibility of an LNG release on the shore, a location not obviously more distant from the areas of population then the proposed jetties (see paragraph 101 above). The judge also referred to the assessment process in which MHPA had participated and to the various reports and exercises carried out so that it could fulfil its statutory responsibilities for safety, cited in its summary grounds. He noted that MHPA had been required to concentrate on the risk of a collision, and that it appeared to have done this. Taking into account the studies undertaken by the HSE, together with the assessments and exercises conducted by MHPA, the judge was satisfied that the relevant matters had been considered by the authorities (see paragraph 93 above).",

He noted that there was evidence before the court that there had never been an incident involving a major release from a ship to the external atmosphere. He emphasised that it was principally for MHPA to decide what research was necessary for it to be satisfied as to the level of risk to public safety from the operation of the LNG terminals, and considered that the evidence fell \u201cfar short\u201d of demonstrating that MHPA had neglected its statutory duties. Finally, he made reference to the power of the authorities to revoke the consents if evidence emerged that the risks posed by the unloading of LNG at the jetties were greater than they then appeared (see paragraph 101 above).",

In respect of the Dragon terminal, the Statement referred to MHPA\u2019s role in assisting Petroplus in planning the marine aspects of the project to ensure the safety of the proposal. It made reference to exercises to be conducted and to the need for consultation in respect of an assessment of the marine risks and during the design, construction and operational stages of the project (see paragraph 21 above). A real-time simulation exercise was carried out, and conclusions regarding wind conditions were drawn from it (see paragraph 22 above). Consideration was given to the effects of the increase in traffic within the haven (see paragraphs 23 and 31 above). Mitigation measures identified included continuing consultation and further simulation exercises (see paragraph 23 above). In the context of the assessment for the South Hook site, reference was made to a formal marine hazard exercise which identified potential mitigation measures which could be incorporated into the design of the terminal (see paragraph 47 above). Specific hazards with the potential to extend beyond the boundaries of the site itself were also identified and safeguards were proposed (see paragraph 48 above). In its submissions to the planning authorities and through correspondence and interviews in the media, MHPA explained that it was working with specialists to ensure the safe and effective management of large LNG vessels in the haven (see paragraphs 26-27, 40, 49, 55-56, 64-66 and 68-70 above). In particular the Chief Executive of MHPA identified possible measures which could reduce risks and explained that MHPA had been working with the developers to ensure that the possibility of a shipping incident was extremely low (see paragraphs 55-56 above). He emphasised that MHPA had the power to control the passage of LNG vessels through the haven by laying down conditions regarding, for example, the time of entry, state of the tide, the number of pilots and the number of tugs (see paragraph 64 above). He and the Harbourmaster of the haven consistently referred to the risk assessment work undertaken by the developers, MHPA and other specialists (see paragraphs 55-56, 65-66 and 68-69 above). In its summary grounds in the later judicial review proceedings, reference was made to a number of different reports and studies which had informed MHPA\u2019s view on the safety of the proposals and its strategy for managing the LNG vessels in the haven (see paragraphs 71-72 above).",
