Whether the casefile had been destroyed in accordance with the relevant rules was immaterial, the fact remained that as a result, a rehearing was impossible in practice. Insofar as the applicant could be understood as requesting reopening, quashing of the conviction and suspension or discontinuation of the proceedings, that request was illfounded, as it had not been established that at the time of the trial there had existed grounds for suspension or discontinuation of the proceedings. As to the applicant's request for the application of the statute of limitations, it was inadmissible, as the Supreme Court of Cassation had no primary jurisdiction in such matters.",

France ((dec.), no. 71555/01, ECHR 2001XI) the Court had an occasion to address the issue whether criminal proceedings conducted in absentia represent a \u201cdenial of justice\u201d. In that case the  were seeking the extradition from  of a person convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia. The Court held that \u201ca denial of justice undoubtedly occurs where a person convicted in absentia is unable subsequently to obtain from a court which has heard him a fresh determination of the merits of the charge, in respect of both law and fact, where it has not been unequivocally established that he has waived his right to appear and to defend himself\u201d (see \u00a7 33 of the decision). This conclusion is in line with the established case-law confirming that the right of an accused to participate in person in the proceedings is a fundamental element of a fair trial (see Colozza v. Italy, judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89, p. 14, \u00a7 27, F.C.B. v. Italy, judgment of 28 August 1991, Series A no. 208B, p. 21, \u00a7 33, T. v. Italy, judgment of 12 October 1992, Series A no. 245C, p. 41, \u00a7 26, Yavuz v.\u00a0Austria, no. 46549/99, \u00a7 45, 27 May 2004, and Novoselov v. Russia (dec.), no. 66460/01, 8 July 2004). It is of capital importance that a criminal defendant should appear, both because of his or her right to a hearing and because of the need to verify the accuracy of his or her statements and compare them with those of the victim \u2013 whose interests need to be protected \u2013 and of the witnesses (see Poitrimol v. France, judgment of 23\u00a0November 1993, Series A no. 277A, p. 15, \u00a7 35, and Krombach v.\u00a0France, no. 29731/96, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2001II). For these reasons the Court has consistently held that when domestic law permits a trial to be held notwithstanding the absence of a person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d that person should, once he or she becomes aware of the proceedings, be able to obtain from a court which has heard him or her a fresh determination of the merits of the charge (see Colozza, cited above, p. 15, \u00a7 29, Poitrimol, cited above, pp. 13-14, \u00a7 31, Medenica v. Switzerland, no. 20491/92, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2001VI, and Krombach, cited above, \u00a7 85). The only situation where it is open to question whether this requirement applies is when the accused has waived his or her right to appear and to defend himself or herself, but at all events such a waiver must, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see Poitrimol, cited above, ibid.).",

Therefore, criminal proceedings which have been held in absentia and whose reopening has been subsequently refused, without any indication that the accused has waived his or her right to be present during the trial, may fairly be described as \u201cmanifestly contrary to the provisions of Article\u00a06 or the principles embodied therein\u201d.",

Therefore, in order for the proceedings leading to his conviction to not represent a \u201cdenial of justice\u201d, he should have had the opportunity to have them reopened and the merits of the rape charges against him determined in his presence. Since 1 January 2000 Bulgarian law expressly provides for such a possibility (see paragraph 36 above). However, when the applicant requested reopening on the basis of the new Article 362a of the CCP in February 2001 \u2013 approximately one year after his arrest \u2013, the Supreme Court of Cassation refused, essentially on the ground that the casefile of the original proceedings had been destroyed in 1997, which, in its view, rendered a rehearing impossible in practice (see paragraph 33 above). In this connection, it is noteworthy that the applicant subsequently requested the restoration of the casefile by the Pernik District Court, but has apparently received no reply to his request (see paragraph 34 above). The applicant was thus deprived of the possibility to obtain from a court, which has heard him, a fresh determination of the merits of the charges on which he was convicted.",

Bulgarian law contains a statute of limitations for the enforcement of sentences, which in the applicant's case is ten years (see paragraph 37 above). Thus, after the expiry of the limitation period imprisonment is no longer possible, unless the running of the period has been interrupted. The applicant's objection was met exactly with that argument (see paragraphs 25, 27, 29 and 31 above). There was, therefore, an issue of fact determinative of the legality of his detention, which was independent of, and distinct from, the subjectmatter of his 1989 conviction and sentence. Accordingly, the applicant should have been able to have it resolved by a court meeting the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4. However, under Bulgarian law all issues affecting the legality of execution of sentences of imprisonment are entrusted to the competent prosecutor (see paragraph 38 above). There is no provision expressly providing for judicial review of these issues (ibid.) and there exists no general habeas corpus procedure applying to all kinds of deprivation of liberty. The Government argued that the applicant could have relied on Article 373 \u00a7 1 (1) of the CCP to obtain a judicial determination of the legality of his imprisonment. They submitted that this provision empowered the court which had delivered the sentence to review the legality of the applicant's detention imposed allegedly in spite of the expiry of the limitation period. However, the Court is not persuaded that this is indeed the case, for the following reasons: (i) Article 373 \u00a7 1 (1) of the CCP deals with the interpretation of the trial court's judgment if it is for some reason unclear, not with issues affecting the subsequent legality of the deprivation of liberty (see paragraph 38 above); (ii) the Government have not identified and, indeed, there is, to the Court's knowledge, no reported caselaw or doctrine opinions supporting the Government's averment. The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see Vachev v. Bulgaria, no. 42987/98, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2004VIII (extracts)).",
