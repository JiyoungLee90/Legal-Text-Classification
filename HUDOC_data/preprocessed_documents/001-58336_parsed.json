That Article is not applicable unless there is a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d against a particular person (see the Neumeister v. Austria judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, p. 43, \u00a7 23, and the AGOSI v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 October 1986, Series A no. 108, p. 22, \u00a7 65), that is, after the individual has received the \u201cofficial notification by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence\u201d (see the Deweer v.\u00a0Belgium judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 24, \u00a7 46) or has been the subject of \u201cmeasures which carry the implication of such an allegation and which likewise substantially affect the situation of the suspect\u201d (see the Foti and Others v.

The Court reiterates, however, that the concept of a \u201cpenalty\u201d in Article 7 of the Convention is, like the concept of \u201ccriminal charge\u201d in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, an autonomous one. In assessing this issue, the Court is not bound by the indications furnished by domestic law, which have only a relative value (see the following judgments: Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 34, \u00a7 81; \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v.

The immediate withdrawal of a driving licence appears to be a preventive measure for the safety of road-users, designed to take a driver who is potentially dangerous to other road-users temporarily off the roads. It should be compared with the procedure of issuing a licence, which is undoubtedly an administrative procedure and is aimed at ensuring that a driver is fit and qualified to drive on the public highway. The immediate withdrawal of a driving licence is a precautionary measure; the fact that it is an emergency measure justifies its being applied immediately and there is nothing to indicate that its purpose is punitive. Withdrawal of a driving licence is distinguishable from disqualification from driving, a measure ordered by the criminal courts at the end of criminal proceedings. In such a case, the criminal court assesses and classifies the facts constituting the offence which may give rise to disqualification, before imposing disqualification for a period it deems appropriate, as a principal or secondary penalty (see the Malige v. France judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, pp. 2935-36, \u00a7 38). There is, moreover, a notable difference between the maximum period for which disqualification can in normal circumstances be ordered and that for which a driving licence can be withheld after immediate withdrawal: five years (or even permanent disqualification in certain circumstances) in the former case; fifteen days (which may be increased to forty-five in special circumstances) in the latter case (see paragraphs 19 and 23 above).",

In that connection it is apparent from a number of judgments of the Court that while the determination of the legal classification of the \u201cpenalties\u201d provided for in domestic law remains a matter for the sovereign will of the State, the Court reserves the power to review that classification in order to avoid it leading to results incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention (see, among other authorities, the \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v. Germany judgment of 21 February 1984, Series A no. 73, pp. 17-18, \u00a7 49). The result of this is that certain penalties which were not classified as criminal under the domestic law have been considered to be \u201ccriminal\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention (see the Lutz v. Germany judgment of 25 August 1987, Series\u00a0A no. 123; the Weber v. Switzerland judgment of 22 May 1990, Series\u00a0A no. 177; and the Demicoli v.

The purpose of an autonomous interpretation is to secure procedural guarantees to those subject to the jurisdiction of the courts where the classification under the domestic law might restrict the scope of the Convention. Where there are sufficient factors in the national law to indicate that the measure in question belongs to the criminal sphere, it is paradoxical to take the opposite view and rule out the application of Article 6 of the Convention.",

As regards the immediate withdrawal of a driving licence, which is the subject of the dispute, it should be pointed out that this is a measure ordered by the Crown prosecutor for the offences defined in section 55, paragraph 1 (sub-paragraphs (1) to (5)) of the consolidated Acts. Furthermore, if a person is temporarily disqualified from driving, the period for which the driving licence has been withdrawn under section 55 is set off against the period of disqualification (section\u00a057, paragraph 2).",

Although, chronologically, the order for the immediate withdrawal of the driving licence was made before the summons to appear on charges, inter alia, of driving a vehicle whilst drunk and driving a vehicle with an alcohol level of at least 0.8 grams per litre of blood, the measure ordered \u201ccarried the implication of such an allegation\u201d and therefore fell within the scope of a criminal \u201ccharge\u201d (see the Foti and Others v.
