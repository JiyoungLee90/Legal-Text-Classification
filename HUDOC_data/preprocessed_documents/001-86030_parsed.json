In guaranteeing to persons arrested or detained a right to take proceedings to challenge the lawfulness of their detention, Article 5 \u00a7 4 also enshrines their right to a speedy judicial decision concerning the lawfulness of detention and ordering its termination if it proves unlawful (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7\u00a074, 7\u00a0April\u00a02005). The question whether a person\u2019s right under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention to obtain a speedy court decision on the lawfulness of his detention has been respected has to be determined in the light of the circumstances of each case (see R.M.D.\u00a0v.

The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee; while one year per level of jurisdiction may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 \u00a7 1 cases, Article 5 \u00a7\u00a04, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR\u00a02003IV).",

Special considerations may apply in exceptional cases where an applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the circumstances which make that remedy ineffective. In such a situation, the six-month period may be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware, or should have become aware, of those circumstances (see Bulut and Yavuz v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no. 73065/01, 28 May 2002).",

It marks out the temporal limits of the supervision carried out by the organs of the Convention and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a034979/97, ECHR 2000-I).",

The Court further observes that since the applicant\u2019s mother was accepted by the Court as his successor in the present proceedings, she is entitled to receive the compensation for non-pecuniary damage which otherwise would be awarded to the applicant. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant\u2019s mother EUR 5,000 in respect of nonpecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
