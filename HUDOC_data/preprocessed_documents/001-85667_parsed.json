The Court has already considered that there is no such \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d in cases of this type, since a widower cannot claim to be a victim of discrimination until he has applied for benefits and been refused. It has therefore been the Court\u2019s consistent practice in such cases to hold that the six months time-limit in Article 35 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention begins to run from the date of the final refusal by the domestic authorities of such benefits (see, for example, Barrow and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 68175/01, 68928/01, 69327/01, 13944/02, 13 December 2005). It further recalls that in cases were a decision is not pronounced publicly, the time starts to run on the day following the date on which the applicant or his representative was informed of this final decision (see K.\u00a0C.\u00a0M. v. the Netherlands, Commission decision of 9\u00a0January 1995, no.\u00a021034/92, Decisions and Reports (DR) 80-A, p. 88).",
