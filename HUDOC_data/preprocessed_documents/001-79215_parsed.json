M. had subsequently suffered from anxiety, sleep disturbances, gastro-intestinal problems and pneumonia. The court further noted that even before the visiting agreement had been concluded, the arrangements for and exercise of the applicant's visiting rights had been complicated by the applicant's constant aggression towards J.W. The court found that the repeated threats against her mother were seriously jeopardising M.'s mental development. Accordingly, the applicant's visiting rights were not in the best interest of the child; on the contrary, they were harmful to her mental and physical well-being.",

On 16 October 2002 the court, with the approval of the Youth Welfare Office attached to the Linz-Land District Administrative Authority, overruled the applicant's refusal to give consent and granted A.F. permission to adopt M. It noted that A.F. had developed a close relationship with M., who had said she was in favour of the adoption as she regarded A.F. as her father. The adoption would secure M.'s position within the family and also act as a material safeguard, as A.F. was able to support her financially. With regard to the applicant, the court found that his allegedly close relationship with M. did not correspond to reality. The last contact visit, during Christmas 2000, had been disappointing for the child, as the applicant had taken no initiatives, had not complied with the child's wishes for a special Christmas present and, during dinner, had not spoken with the child for three quarters of an hour. In the past the applicant had repeatedly tried to interfere in the relationship between M. and her mother, causing M. to develop physical and psychological problems. He had not made any effort to prove his feelings for M. in practice. Furthermore, he had not made maintenance payments for the past five years. The court therefore considered that the applicant's objection to the adoption was unjustified.",

He complained that the lack of a public oral hearing in the presence of his daughter, A.F. and J.W. was contrary to Article 6 of the Convention. He had not been able to put questions to A.F. and J.W. or challenge the criticism made of him in several reports by the social-welfare authorities. In particular, no evidence had been heard from him concerning the accusation that he had told M. that her mother was an evil witch and a whore. He further complained that the court had not instructed him to request an opinion from an expert in child psychology. He was of Turkish origin, and adoption in these circumstances was tantamount to a denial of half of the child's genetic background. Furthermore, without an expert opinion there was nothing to substantiate the courts' findings that he had caused M.'s physical and psychological problems. The court should also have instructed him to request that evidence be heard from the social workers who had submitted negative reports about him. Instead, it had based its findings on their written submissions. Finally, the applicant contended that there were not sufficient reasons for M.'s adoption. A.F. could instead request joint custody with the child's mother and undertake to make maintenance payments on a contractual basis. The applicant's visiting rights had been withdrawn only temporarily and he had not failed to make efforts to keep in contact with M. He had been paying maintenance for M. for the past two years.",

It found that, even in the absence of an oral hearing in the presence of all the parties, which in the proceedings at issue was not obligatory, the applicant had been given a proper hearing for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention. In that regard it noted in particular that the Linz-Land District Court had made several attempts to hear evidence from the applicant; this had eventually been possible only by issuing letters rogatory to another court. The applicant had declared at the beginning of the adoption proceedings that he did not wish to participate further in the proceedings, that his personal appearance before the district court was not necessary and that the letter to that effect should be regarded as his personal statement. Moreover, the applicant had had sufficient opportunity to comment in written submissions, namely in the appeal proceedings, on the accusations made against him. The court further considered that it had not been necessary to seek an expert opinion or to hear evidence from the social workers concerned. In this regard it noted that the regional court had already confirmed the applicant's aggressive behaviour and its consequences in its decision of 14\u00a0January 1999, and had rejected the applicant's arguments to the contrary. Nor had the applicant, in his present appeal, been able satisfactorily to show that his conduct had not been the reason for the child's problems. The district court had given sufficient and extensive reasons why the adoption should be authorised, namely by referring to the applicant's conduct. Finally, the regional court noted that the fact that A.F. was in a better financial position than the applicant had not been a reason for granting the adoption. Accordingly, it did not go into the applicant's arguments regarding the maintenance payments. It refused the applicant leave to lodge an ordinary appeal with the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof). This decision was served on the applicant's counsel on 18\u00a0April\u00a02003.",

It had a legal basis, namely Article 181 \u00a7 3 of the Civil Code, and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of the applicant's minor daughter, by protecting her health, including her psychological well-being, and her legal interest in consolidating and formalising de facto family ties with her adoptive father. According to the case-law of the Austrian courts, the well-being of the child concerned was in itself not sufficient to justify overruling a parent's refusal of consent under Article\u00a0181 \u00a7\u00a03. Only persistent conduct absolutely contrary to family values on the part of a parent could justify such a decision. In the present case, the applicant had demonstrated such conduct by repeatedly threatening and grossly insulting the child's mother in the presence of the child, at that time very young, during previous contact visits. As result, the child had suffered from anxiety and severe somatic disorders. The applicant had acted as the child's father only in the first months of her life. After the breakdown of his relationship the applicant, by his conduct towards the child's mother who had custody of the child, had made the exercise of his rights and duties as a father impossible. His refusal to consent to the adoption prevented the husband of the child's mother from taking on a role which he himself could no longer fulfil. Furthermore, he had discontinued maintenance payments for the child five years prior to the adoption being granted, thereby leaving it to others to care for his daughter. When questioned about the reasons for his refusal to give consent, the applicant had merely stated that he wished to visit his daughter and that her mother was preventing him from doing so. Such submissions could not be regarded as decisive reasons. Furthermore, the applicant had insisted on evidence being heard from the child in his own and the other parties' presence, apparently without caring much about the stress that would inevitably be caused to the child. The applicant had been sufficiently involved in the decision-making process. As it had transpired after several unsuccessful attempts that the applicant, for personal reasons, was unable to attend a hearing by the court competent to deal with the case, he had given evidence before another court under letters rogatory. Moreover, he had expressly stated at the beginning of the proceedings that he did not wish to be further involved in the proceedings and that his written submissions should be regarded as his statements.",

However, the margin of appreciation to be accorded to the competent national authorities will vary in accordance with the nature of the issues and the importance of the interests at stake. While the Court has recognised that the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in particular when deciding on custody, a stricter scrutiny is called for as regards any further limitations and as regards any legal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Article\u00a08 requires that the domestic authorities strike a fair balance between the interests involved and that, in the balancing process, particular importance should be attached to the best interests of the child, which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parents (see, mutatis mutandis, Sommerfeld v. Germany [GC], no. 31871/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a062-64, ECHR 2003VIII (extracts))",

The Court reiterates that legislation permitting the placing for adoption of a child by a mother shortly after the child's birth without the natural father's knowledge or consent may be in breach of Article 8 of the Convention (see Keegan v. Ireland, judgment of 26 May 1994, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0290, p. 16). In another case, concerning the deprivation of a mother's parental rights and access in the context of compulsory and permanent placement of her daughter in a foster home with a view to adoption by foster parents, the Court stressed that such a particularly far-reaching measure should only be applied in exceptional circumstances and be motivated by an overriding requirement pertaining to the child's best interests (see Johansen\u00a0v.\u00a0Norway, judgment of 7 August 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, p. 30). In two more recent cases (S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck\u00a0v.\u00a0Sweden, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VII and Kuijper v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, cited above), the Court, in finding no violation of the Convention, noted in particular that the natural parent concerned had not had custody of the child and that contacts with the child were very limited. The adoptions had served to consolidate and formalise de facto family ties and the natural parent opposing adoption had been given the opportunity to state his or her case. In the Kuijper case the Court had regard also to the fact that the request for adoption was fully supported by the child, who had almost come of age.",

The Court notes that the child, who was about nine and a half years old at the time of the adoption, had been living exclusively with her mother since she was two years old. The applicant had not had custody, nor had he apparently assisted in any other capacity in the upbringing of the child. Furthermore, his contacts which the child were, at least from 25\u00a0December\u00a01996 onwards, infrequent and limited in character. In June\u00a01998 the district court withdrew his visiting rights as it found that the applicant's aggression towards the child's mother was harmful to the child's health and well-being. Thereafter, only one further contact visit took place, during Christmas\u00a02000. The child, meanwhile, had been living with her adoptive father since she was six years old. Thus, when the adoption was granted, de facto family ties had existed between the adoptive parent and the child for more than three years. The adoption, therefore, did not set in motion the bonding of the child with the adoptive parent (see, mutatis mutandis, Keegan\u00a0v.\u00a0Ireland, cited above, \u00a7 55) but, on the contrary, consolidated and formalised already existing ties, as in the cases of S\u00f6derb\u00e4ck and Kuijper, cited above.",

It follows that the adoption of a child without the consent of one of his or her biological parents may occur only in exceptional circumstances. The international law texts cited in the judgment are clear on this point and, in our opinion, it is important to draw the appropriate conclusions from them. Thus, the European Convention on the Adoption of Children of 24 April 1967 specifically states that the competent authority may not dispense with consent \u201csave on exceptional grounds determined by law\u201d (Art. 5 \u00a7 2, (b)). Equally, principle 15 of the White Paper on principles relating to the establishment and legal consequences of parentage, dated 15\u00a0January 2002 and drawn up by the Committee of Experts on Family Law, specifies that \u201cthe competent authority may overrule the refusal to consent only on exceptional grounds determined by law\u201d (\u00a7 3). In domestic law, the legislation of the Council of Europe's member States also provides, in exceptional circumstances, for the possibility of a child being adopted without the consent of at least one of his or her biological parents. Whilst, in the majority of countries, waiving of the consent requirement is determined on the basis of objective circumstances (death, uncertain paternity, deprivation of parental authority, etc.), in other countries subjective circumstances are also taken into consideration when permitting the authorities to overrule a refusal to grant consent. This is the situation in the instant case in so far as Article 181 \u00a7 3 of the Austrian Civil Code (Allgemeines b\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch) provides that \u201cat the request of one of the parties, the court may overrule the refusal of consent by the parent of a minor child, where the person concerned has not given justifiable reasons for his or her refusal\u201d. Thus, it is the scenario of an unjustified refusal which is at issue here and constitutes a reason for depriving the father and mother of the right to consent to the adoption.",

Admittedly, this right is not absolute and is subject to limitations. In accordance with Article 8 \u00a7 2, there may be interference by a public authority justified, inter alia, by the protection of health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The Court must therefore engage in a careful examination of the interests at stake in order to determine whether, exceptionally, a decision on adoption taken without the consent of the biological parent may be justified under the Convention.",

On the one hand, the district court noted that the child had developed a close relationship with her mother's new partner and that adoption would secure her position in the family and be a material safeguard. At the same time, it considered that the applicant's allegedly close relationship with his daughter did not correspond to reality. In those circumstances, the refusal of consent was considered unjustified (paragraph\u00a021). The  dismissed the applicant's appeal on 25\u00a0February 2003. The regional court held that it was not necessary to request an expert opinion or to hear evidence from the social workers concerned. It considered that the reasons given by the lower court were sufficient, particularly in relation to the applicant's conduct; nonetheless, it minimised the argument concerning the adoptive father's financially more advantageous position, stating that the fact that A.F. was in a better financial position than the applicant had not been a reason for granting the adoption (paragraph 23 in fine).",

The applicant had threatened and injured the child's mother in December 1996. Some two years later, in March 1998, he had insulted the child's mother and informed the child that her mother was an evil witch and a whore, thus causing distress to the child. Whilst we agree with the domestic courts' finding that in behaving in such a manner the applicant had acted contrary to family values, we nevertheless find it difficult to accept that this conduct must be considered of such seriousness as to justify the severing of the applicant's bonds with his child against his will. This opinion is strengthened if we note that, at the time of the adoption, the impugned events dated back more than four years and three years respectively and that a later contact visit in December 2000 had passed without similar incident.",
