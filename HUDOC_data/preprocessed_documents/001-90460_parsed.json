They stressed that no eyewitnesses had testified that Mr Dzhabayev had been taken away by the armed men, but rather that he had last been seen in the courtyard of his house in the presence of armed men. In such circumstances, the Government suggested, it could not be excluded that Mr Dzhabayev had gone away on his own or escaped, as might be suggested by the information referred to by some witnesses with reference to security forces. The Government argued that kidnapping remained only one version of the events under investigation, albeit the principal one. They concluded that since there was no proof that Mr Dzhabayev had been kidnapped, there were no grounds to suspect that State agents had been involved in the crime. They further argued that there was no convincing evidence that the applicants\u2019 relative was dead, given that his whereabouts had not been established and his body had not been found.",

The Court has already noted above that it has been unable to benefit from the results of the domestic investigation, owing to the Government\u2019s failure to disclose most of the documents from the file. Nevertheless, it is clear that the investigation did not identify the perpetrators of the kidnapping. The Court reiterates that in a case involving disappearance, it is particularly regrettable that there should have been no thorough investigation of the relevant facts by the domestic prosecutors or courts. The few documents submitted by the Government from the investigation file do not suggest any progress in five and a half years and, if anything, show the incomplete and inadequate nature of those proceedings. Moreover, the stance of the prosecutor\u2019s office and the other law-enforcement authorities after the news of the relative\u2019s detention had been communicated to them by the applicants contributed significantly to the likelihood of the disappearance, as no necessary steps were taken in the crucial first days and weeks after the arrest. The authorities\u2019 conduct in the face of the applicants\u2019 well-substantiated complaints gives rise to a strong presumption of at least acquiescence in the situation and raises strong doubts as to the objectivity of the investigation.",
