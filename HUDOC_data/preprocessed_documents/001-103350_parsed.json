The existence of positive relations between staff and prisoners, based on the notions of secure custody and care, is a decisive factor in this context; this will depend in large measure on staff possessing appropriate interpersonal communication skills. Further, management must be prepared fully to support staff in the exercise of their authority. Specific security measures adapted to the particular characteristics of the situation encountered (including effective search procedures) may well be required; however, such measures can never be more than an adjunct to the above-mentioned basic imperatives.

Furthermore, forensic medical experts, while assessing the state of the first applicant\u2019s mental health in July 2002, also accepted that systematic ill-treatment of the first applicant in the detention facility had been the underlying cause of the deterioration of his mental health.

France, 19\u00a0March 1991, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 200).",

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v.

The decision was served on the first applicant and then sent to the Sverdlovsk Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office for supervision (see paragraph 36 above). It was not until 16 August 2004, that is, more than two years after the events in question, that the Regional Prosecutor quashed the decision of 11 June 2002 and authorised an additional investigation into the events (see paragraph 38 above). The Court accepts the Government\u2019s argument that there is no evidence that the first applicant has ever raised a complaint of illtreatment before any domestic authority. However, it does not find this situation surprising given the manner in which the ensuing events developed. In particular, the Court observes that merely days after the decision of 11 June 2002 the medical personnel of the detention facility made a record of the first applicant\u2019s strange behaviour, noting his anxious state, disorientation and inertness, as well as his inability to concentrate, respond to questions or formulate sentences in an organised manner (see paragraph 44 above). Similar comments regarding the first applicant\u2019s ability to express his opinion were made by the director of the detention facility when he had attempted to question the first applicant about the events of 14 June 2002 (see paragraph 45 above). Following a psychiatric examination of the first applicant on 25 July 2002, which diagnosed a serious mental disorder, the first applicant was declared legally incompetent. The Court attributes particular weight to the fact that the psychiatrists considered the first applicant to be mentally incapable of taking part in investigative or judicial activities (see paragraph 14 above). In these circumstances the Court is convinced that there exists clear and conclusive evidence that the first applicant\u2019s state of mental health hindered his ability to steer his way through the complaints procedure and prevented him from applying to the competent domestic authorities with a complaint of ill-treatment (see, by contrast, Peters v. Germany, no. 25435/94, Commission decision of 20 February 1995). Having found that the first applicant could not have been reasonably expected to exhaust the national channels of redress, the Court dismisses this part of the Government\u2019s objection.",

In this connection the Court observes that, as it can be seen from the parties\u2019 submissions, the second applicant applied to the prosecutor\u2019s office with a complaint of ill-treatment as soon as he had acquired legal status as the first applicant\u2019s representative, received access to the case file and had grounds to make a complaint (see paragraph 37 above). As a result, the decision of 11 June 2002 is no longer in force, having been quashed on 16 August 2004 by a decision of the Sverdlovsk Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office which authorised a fresh investigation. That investigation is still pending, having been closed and reopened on a number of occasions following the second applicant\u2019s successful complaints to higher-ranking prosecutors. The domestic authorities were therefore afforded ample opportunity to remedy the alleged violation of the first applicant\u2019s rights. In these circumstances the Court is unable to accept the Government\u2019s objection that the second applicant\u2019s alleged failure to appeal for two years against the decision of 11 June 2002 rendered the first applicant\u2019s Article 3 complaint inadmissible (see, for similar reasoning, Samoylov v. , no. 64398/01, \u00a7 45, 2 October 2008).",

Thus, in A.\u00a0v. the United Kingdom (23 September 1998, \u00a7 22, Reports 1998-VI) the Court held that, by virtue of these two provisions, States are required to take certain measures to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see, for similar reasoning, Moldovan and Others v.\u00a0Romania (no. 2), nos. 41138/98 and\u00a064320/01, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2005-VII (extracts), and M.C. v.

Bulgaria (28\u00a0October 1998, \u00a7 102, Reports 1998VIII), the Court held that where an individual raises an arguable claim that he has been seriously ill-treated by the police or other such agents of the State unlawfully and in breach of Article 3, that provision, read in conjunction with the State\u2019s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to \u201csecure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in ... [the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation.

However, it has been the Court\u2019s constant approach that Article 3 imposes on States a duty to protect the physical well-being of persons who find themselves in a vulnerable position by virtue of being within the control of the authorities, such as, for instance, detainees or conscripted servicemen (see Chember v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7188/03, \u00a7 50, 3 July 2008; Sarban v.

Even though the scope of a State\u2019s positive obligations might differ between cases where treatment contrary to Article 3 has been inflicted through the involvement of State agents and cases where violence is inflicted by private individuals (see Beganovi\u0107 v. , no. 46423/06, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2009... (extracts)), the requirements for an official investigation are similar. For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. Authorities must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many other authorities, Mikheyev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 77617/01, \u00a7 107 et seq., 26 January 2006, and Assenov and Others v.

In cases under Articles 2 and\u00a03 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation has been at issue, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0133 et seq., ECHR 2000IV). Consideration has been given to the opening of investigations, delays in taking statements (see Timurta\u015f v.

The parties do not dispute that those injuries as recorded in medical certificate no. 226 were sustained by the first applicant during his detention, that is, when he was under the full control of the administration of Yekaterinburg no.1 detention facility.",

It observes that the first applicant alleged that he had suffered physical and psychological abuse at the hands of his cellmates in cell no. 131 for over a week. It appears that attacks on the first applicant were initiated almost immediately after his transfer to that cell (see paragraph  above). The Court notes that the Government contested the first applicant\u2019s allegations and argued that they were false and unsubstantiated. They submitted that the first applicant\u2019s injuries as recorded in medical certificate no. 226 had resulted from a blow to the stomach he had received from cellmate K. and the subsequent fall he had taken after hitting his head and back against a wall. The Court considers that the Government\u2019s explanation sits ill with the nature and location of the first applicant\u2019s injuries. It does not lose sight of the prison doctor\u2019s finding that the first applicant had numerous injuries covering a substantial surface of his body, although no injuries to his stomach were recorded (see paragraph 34 above). The Court finds, and this finding is also supported by the prison doctor\u2019s opinion (see paragraph 34 above), that the description of the first applicant\u2019s injuries corresponds to physical sequelae from systematic beatings rather than to injuries sustained as a result of a single blow and the subsequent collision of the first applicant with a concrete wall. The Court further observes that a forensic psychiatric examination of the first applicant carried out on 25 July 2002 revealed a strong link between the deterioration of his mental health and a psychologically traumatic experience encountered by the first applicant through systematic ill-treatment and physical and psychological abuse in detention. The Court is therefore bound to conclude that the first applicant was a victim of systematic ill-treatment at the hands of his cellmates which lasted for at least a week.",

The acts complained of were such as to arouse in the first applicant feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing him and possibly breaking his physical and emotional resistance. This conclusion is supported by the experts\u2019 finding that physical and psychological abuse led to the first applicant feeling afraid, depressed and hopeless (see paragraph 14 above). An important element to be taken into consideration is also the long-term consequences of the ill-treatment on the first applicant\u2019s mental health (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). The Court also attaches great importance to the first applicant\u2019s young age at the time of the events, which made him particularly vulnerable at the hands of his aggressors. Having regard to the nature and degree of the ill-treatment and its effect on the first applicant\u2019s mental health, the Court finds that there are elements which are sufficiently serious to render such treatment inhuman and degrading contrary to the guarantees of Article 3 of the Convention. It therefore remains to determine whether the State authorities can be held accountable for the ill-treatment of which the first applicant was a victim.",

It imposes an obligation on the Contracting States not only to refrain from provoking ill-treatment, but also to take the necessary preventive measures to preserve the physical and psychological integrity and well-being of persons deprived of their liberty (see Mouisel v. , no. 67263/01, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2002IX, and Keenan v. the , no. 27229/95, \u00a7 111, ECHR 2001III). At the same time the Court has consistently interpreted that obligation in such a manner as not to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (see Pantea v. Romania, no.\u00a033343/96, \u00a7 189, ECHR 2003VI (extracts)).

In particular, it has held that to successfully argue a violation of his Article 3 right it would be sufficient for an applicant to demonstrate that the authorities had not taken all steps which could have been reasonably expected of them to prevent real and immediate risks to the applicant\u2019s physical integrity, of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge. The test does not, however, require it to be shown that \u201cbut for\u201d the failing or omission of the public authority the ill-treatment would not have occurred. The answer to the question whether the authorities fulfilled their positive obligation under Article 3 will depend on all the circumstances of the case under examination (see Pantea, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 191-96). The Court also reiterates that State responsibility is engaged by a failure to take reasonably available measures which could have had a real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm to the applicant (see E. and Others v. the , no. 33218/96, \u00a7\u00a7 89-101, 26 November 2002). The Court therefore has to establish whether, in the circumstances of the present case, the authorities knew or ought to have known that the first applicant was suffering or at risk of being subjected to ill-treatment at the hands of his cellmates, and if so, whether the administration of the detention facility, within the limits of their official powers, took reasonable steps to eliminate those risks and to protect the first applicant from that abuse.",

The acts of violence against the first applicant continued for at least a week (see paragraph 80 above). The materials before the Court also disclose the authorities\u2019 knowledge of the situation. In particular, as can be seen from the decision of 24 December 2004 given by the assistant prosecutor of the Sverdlovsk Region, the administration of the detention facility was aware of the acts of violence against the first applicant, which they considered to be a response to his own aggressive behaviour (see paragraph 49 above). Irrespective of the cause of the abuse which the first applicant suffered, the Court is of the opinion that the authorities, apprised of the first applicant\u2019s allegedly provocative behaviour, could have reasonably foreseen that such behaviour rendered him more vulnerable than an average detainee. The authorities should have enquired into the first applicant\u2019s psychological state, having considered that, in view of his relatively young age, background and no previous experience of the criminal justice system, the detention could have exacerbated his feeling of distress, already inherent in any measure of deprivation of liberty, making him more prone to episodes of anger and irascibility, which he allegedly manifested against other inmates (see, for similar reasoning, Pantea, cited above, \u00a7 192). Moreover, apart from a general knowledge that the first applicant was at risk of violence as a consequence of his unconventional behaviour, the administration of the detention facility could not but have noticed actual signs of abuse, as it was not disputed by the parties that at least part of the first applicant\u2019s injuries were visible. In this situation the Court takes the view that even if the facility administration was not immediately aware of the first attack inflicted on the first applicant, within a few days they should have been alerted to the fact that the first applicant had been subjected to ill-treatment and that there was cause to introduce specific security and surveillance measures to prevent him being the subject of continual verbal and physical aggression.",

Such response should include the coordination of security staff, forensic, medical, and mental health practitioners and facility management. However, in the present case, notwithstanding the existence of a serious risk to the first applicant\u2019s well-being, no specific and prompt security or surveillance measures were introduced at the detention facility. In particular, there is no evidence in the materials submitted by the parties that the administration of the detention facility had ever considered the specific details of the first applicant\u2019s personal situation in their choice of co-detainees to place in his cell (see, for similar reasoning, Rodi\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 22893/05, \u00a7 71, 27 May 2008). In fact, it appears that the management of the detention facility lacked a clear policy on the classification and housing of detainees, key to promoting internal prison security and preventing prison violence. The Court reiterates that a proper classification system which includes screening for the risk of victimisation and abusiveness, consideration of the traits known to place someone at risk and of an individual\u2019s own perception of vulnerability is critical to ensuring that potential predators and potential victims are not housed together (see, also for guidance, paragraph 54 above).",

As to the monitoring, the Court is not satisfied that keeping the lights on at night and having cells occasionally checked on by warders were sufficient measures to enhance inmate security, and, in particular, to protect the first applicant from continual abuse. The Government, however, did not suggest any other protective measures which could have prevented further attacks on the first applicant. In respect of the disciplinary action, the Court is not convinced that the facility administration adhered to a standardised policy of punishments for inmates who perpetrated abuse. The absence of such a policy shows that prison violence was not taken as seriously as other crimes and that the facility administration allowed detainees to act with impunity to the detriment of the rights of other inmates, including the right guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention.",

The Court attributes particular weight to this fact in view of the absence of any other mechanisms for promoting inmates\u2019 security in the detention facility.

The initial one-day investigation was closed on the basis of the unreasonable finding that the first applicant had had a sporadic fight with his cellmate K. and that the first applicant had had no intention of pressing charges. That decision was sent to the Sverdlovsk Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office in compliance with the established procedure. It was more than two years later that the prosecution authorities responded, having quashed the decision of 11 June 2002 as premature. An additional investigation into the events of June 2002 was authorised.

The authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention, and they cannot leave it to the initiative of the victims or their relatives (see paragraphs 52 and 53 above). It appears that by not linking the obligation to investigate to the presence of a complaint, that legal provision has been designed to protect the interests of detainees, individuals in a vulnerable situation who, owing to intimidation and fear of reprisal, are not inclined to complain of unlawful actions committed against them in detention. The fact that the investigation was only initiated after the second applicant\u2019s complaint that the decision of 11 June 2002 was unlawful is evidence of a manifest breach of the applicable procedures by the prosecution authorities in the present case.",

The Court observes that the medical evidence before it does not allow either version of events to be excluded.

While noting the inconclusive character of the first applicant\u2019s injury, the Court further observes that there was no other evidence of ill-treatment, such as testimony by an independent witness, which could have provided support to the applicant\u2019s version of events on 14 June 2002. At the same time the Court attributes particular weight to the fact that the Government\u2019s submissions were corroborated by statements by the three inmates detained together with the applicant in the facility medical unit (see paragraph 45 above).",

The first applicant\u2019s complaint in this regard is therefore \u201carguable\u201d. The authorities thus had an obligation to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances in which the first applicant sustained that injury (see Krastanov v.

In particular, it observes that following the refusal of the facility director to initiate criminal proceedings on 21 June 2002, the prosecution authorities launched the investigation almost two years later when the chance of collecting any evidence of alleged ill-treatment was almost illusory. As to the very fact of internal investigation by the management of the detention facility, the Court acknowledges the need for internal investigation with a view to possible disciplinary action in cases of abuse by warders. However, it finds it striking that in the present case the initial investigative steps, which usually prove to be crucial for establishing the truth in cases of brutality committed by State officials, were conducted by the same State authority whose employees were allegedly implicated in the events which were to be investigated (see, for similar reasoning, Vladimir Fedorov v. Russia, no.\u00a019223/04, \u00a7 69, 30 July 2009, and Maksimov v. , no. 43233/02, \u00a7\u00a087, 18 March 2010). In this connection the Court reiterates its finding made on a number of occasions that the investigation should be carried out by competent, qualified and impartial experts who are independent of the suspected perpetrators and the agency they serve (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 325, ECHR 2007-..., and O\u011fur v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, ECHR 1999-III). Furthermore, the Court would like to stress at this juncture that it is struck by the fact that, despite relying on the warders\u2019 and inmates\u2019 statements in the decision of 30\u00a0April 2004, the investigator did not hear evidence from them in person and merely recounted the witnesses\u2019 statements made during the internal investigation. The Court, however, is mindful of the important role which investigative interviews play in obtaining accurate and reliable information from suspects, witnesses and victims and, in the end, the discovery of the truth of the matter under investigation. Observing the suspects\u2019, witnesses\u2019 and victims\u2019 demeanour during questioning and assessing the probative value of their testimony forms a substantial part of the investigative process.",

The excerpts from the cellmate\u2019s testimony were included for the first time in the decision of 24 December 2004. Owing to the significant length of the investigation the authorities could no longer locate other former inmates who had been detained with the first applicant in the medical unit of the detention facility. The Court also finds it inexplicable that in disregard of direct orders from the Sverdlovsk Regional Prosecutor the investigator did not make any attempt to question the warders, save for one, who could have witnessed the events of 14 June 2002. In this connection, the Court notes that while the investigating authorities may not have been provided with the names of individuals who could have witnessed the first applicant\u2019s alleged beatings or provided other valuable information, they were expected to take steps on their own initiative to identify possible eyewitnesses.",

The Court reiterates in this connection that proper medical examinations are an essential safeguard against ill-treatment. The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and have a mandate which is broad in scope (see Akko\u00e7 v. Turkey, nos. 22947/93 and\u00a022948/93, \u00a7 55 and \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000X). When a doctor writes a report after examining a person who has alleged ill-treatment, it is extremely important that the doctor states the degree of consistency with the allegations of ill-treatment. A conclusion indicating the degree of support for the allegations of ill-treatment should be based on a discussion of different possible diagnoses (injuries not relating to ill-treatment including self-inflicted injuries and diseases) (see Barabanshchikov v. , no. 36220/02, \u00a7 59, 8\u00a0January 2009). The forensic medical examination performed in April 2004 did not comply with the above-mentioned requirements. The experts only studied medical evidence drawn up in the aftermath of the events of 14 June 2002 and made conclusions without observing the first applicant. In this connection, the Court has doubts that an expert examination carried out almost two years after the events in question could have provided valid and valuable findings as to the origin and nature of the first applicant\u2019s injuries. The indecisive character of the experts\u2019 conclusions supports this finding by the Court.",

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v. France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 273-B, and Toth v. Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series A no. 224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee and Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 50272/99, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2003-IV). In that context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v. Poland, no. 27504/95, \u00a7 76, 4\u00a0October 2001).",
