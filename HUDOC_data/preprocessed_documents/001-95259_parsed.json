However, it found that it could not rely on the CPT report because, under procedural rules, only medical reports by specialist doctors could serve as a basis for a criminal conviction. Since the CPT report had not been made during the criminal investigation but was annexed to the file by the victims, it could not be relied on. The same could be said of the reports by P.D.

He referred to the statements of several fellow detainees in Ialoveni Police Station who confirmed that they had seen V.R. being taken in good health out of the cell only to return later with clear signs of ill-treatment. These witnesses denied seeing anybody in the cell hurt themselves. N.R. referred to the absence, in the criminal file against both applicants, of any reference to the applicants' participation in procedural steps at Ialoveni Police Station. This confirmed, in his view, that they had not been taken to that station for any lawful purpose. He finally referred to the civil action lodged by him and V.R. within the criminal proceedings. He questioned the application of the amnesty law to accused persons who had not compensated the victims of their crime, a state of affairs which he submitted was contrary to the law. V.R. lodged a similar appeal. In the prosecutor's appeal it was mentioned that each applicant had been offered photographs of the entire staff of Ialoveni Police Station for identification purposes and both had identified the police officers who had ill-treated them.",

Moreover, the CPT noted in its report that during its visit to Ialoveni Police Station on 13 June 2001 it had found no traces of violence on the person whom it had visited again the following day (see paragraph 41 above). In the light of the report by Colonel P.D. (see paragraph 17 above), the Government's reply to the CPT report (see paragraph 42 above) and the reference to that report in the domestic court judgments convicting the three police officers (see paragraphs 26, 29 and 33 above), the Court concludes that paragraphs 24 and 25 of the 2001 CPT report concerned the applicants. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the complaint concerning ill-treatment before 13 June 2001 is manifestly ill-founded and therefore inadmissible within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

The kind of investigation that will achieve those purposes may vary according to the circumstances. However, whatever the method of investigation, the authorities must act as soon as an official complaint has been lodged. Even when strictly speaking no complaint has been made, an investigation must be started if there are sufficiently clear indications that torture or ill-treatment has been used (see, among other authorities, \u00d6zbey v. Turkey (dec.), no. 31883/96, 8 March 2001; see also the Istanbul Protocol, paragraph [43] above).

It is for the domestic courts passing sentence to set the penalty which they consider is most appropriate to ensure the educational and preventive effect of the conviction. The courts did so in the present case, and explained the reason for the leniency of the sentence by reference to the accused's relatively young age, lack of previous convictions, and the fact that they had families and were viewed positively in society (see paragraph 32 above). Under the domestic law the courts had to take into account both mitigating and aggravating circumstances. However, the courts were silent about a number of apparently applicable aggravating circumstances (expressly mentioned in Article 38 of the Criminal Code \u2013 see paragraph 37 above). In particular, none of the officers showed any signs of remorse, having denied throughout the proceedings any ill-treatment on their part.",

In the present case, the CPT found (see paragraph 24 of the 2001 CPT report, cited in paragraph 41 above) that the person examined on 14 June 2001 had been beaten on the soles of his feet (falaka), and noted that another person had also been ill-treated there at the same time. The Court already established that those two persons were the applicants (see paragraph 54 above). The Court recalls that beating a person's soles, or falaka, is a practice which is always intentional and can only be regarded as torture (see Corsacov cited above, \u00a7 65, and Levin\u0163a cited above, \u00a7\u00a071). In such circumstances, the failure to initiate criminal proceedings under Article 101/1 of the Criminal Code (torture), without any explanation as to the choice of another type of offence (abuse of power), is insufficient to ensure the preventive effect of the legislation passed specifically to address the problem of ill-treatment.",

It further observes the acknowledged absence of efforts to develop modern methods of investigation (see paragraph 42 above) and a substantial delay in adopting a Code of Ethics for the police (which was adopted almost four years after the CPT inquired about it, see paragraphs 38 and 41 above). This confirms the failure of the Moldovan authorities to fully denounce the practice of ill-treatment by the law-enforcement agencies and adds to the impression that the legislation adopted to prevent and punish acts of ill-treatment is not given full preventive effect.",
