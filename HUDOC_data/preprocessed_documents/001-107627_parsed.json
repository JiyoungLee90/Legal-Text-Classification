The court referred to Article 108 of the Code of Administrative Procedure and to section 122 of the Land Administration and Expropriation Act 1997. Expropriation and requisition orders were two different legal institutions. They conferred different rights on the public authorities. A requisition order was clearly of a temporary character. It was obvious that its legal effects differed from those produced by a decision on expropriation. However, it conferred on the authorities a right to take possession of the land and to use it for public-benefit purposes. By introducing a requisition order into the Land Administration and Expropriation Act 1997 the legislature had intended to avoid situations where expropriation could be blocked as a result of appeals lodged by the affected parties.",

However, the administrative authorities are empowered to order that a decision be immediately enforceable pending the appeal in the situations specified in Article 108 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, namely when it is necessary for the protection of life or limb, or to protect the national economy against serious damage.

So the requisition order had a legal basis in domestic law.

The authorities continued to examine the applicant\u2019s successive appeals. Neither the requisition order nor the building permit affected in any way the amount of compensation which was ultimately paid to the applicant.

Therefore, she had already obtained most of the compensation in the amount of PLN 725,232 to which she was ultimately entitled under the final expropriation and compensation decision of 4 July 2006. Hence, the applicant\u2019s case differs from cases where applicants were deprived of their ownership and subsequently had to wait a long time before compensation was fixed or paid to them (compare and contrast, Malama v. Greece, no.\u00a043622/98, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2001II). Moreover, the passage of time and the resulting increase in land prices was taken into account by the authorities when the final compensation figure was calculated.",
