In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.  [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, \nECHR 1999I). In the present case, the Court is satisfied that the applicant\u2019s submissions do not disclose any appearance that the courts lacked impartiality, or that the proceedings were otherwise unfair or arbitrary. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) and must be rejected, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention.",
