On 17 July a van containing an explosive device had been found near the Carlini stadium, where accommodation was to be provided for the persons taking part in the large demonstration on 20 July (the Tute bianche march). On 18 July law-enforcement officers went to the stadium to carry out checks. Approximately 500 demonstrators were there. The search lasted for about an hour and was conducted in the presence of journalists.

At around 1.30 p.m. the Tute bianche march was ready to set off from the Carlini stadium. This was a demonstration involving several organisations: representatives of the \u201cNo Global\u201d movement and of community centres, and young communists from the Rifondazione comunista party. While they believed in non-violent protest (civil disobedience), they had announced a strategic objective, namely to try to penetrate the red zone. For that reason the  police chief (questore) had decided on 19 July 2001 to prohibit the Tute bianche procession from entering the red zone or the zone adjacent to it, and had deployed lawenforcement officers to halt the procession at Piazza Verdi. Consequently, the demonstrators were able to march from the Carlini stadium and all the way along Via Tolemaide to Piazza Verdi, that is to say, well beyond the junction of Via Tolemaide and Corso Torino, where the events dealt with below took place. At around 1.30\u00a0p.m. the procession set off and headed slowly westwards. As they proceeded, the demonstrators appeared calm and in good spirits, at least until they saw columns of smoke coming from the direction of Via Canevari and a burnt-out car on Via Montevideo, at which point some tension set in. There were signs of earlier disorder in the area around Via Tolemaide. The procession was headed by a contact group made up of politicians and a group of journalists carrying video recorders and cameras. The procession slowed down and made a number of stops. Further down, around Via Tolemaide, there were incidents involving persons wearing masks and balaclavas and law-enforcement officers. The procession reached the railway tunnel at the junction with Corso Torino. Suddenly, tear gas was fired on the demonstrators by carabinieri under the command of Mr Mondelli.",

He was on Piazza Tommaseo with 200 carabinieri who were equipped with the new Tonfa truncheons, shields, new CS gas grenades and guns for firing them, as well as flame-resistant suits and fire-fighting equipment. At 2.29 p.m. the communications centre ordered Mondelli to go quickly to Piazza Giusti, as the Tute bianche procession was on its way down Corso Gastaldi. Mondelli agreed. Although there were three possible routes to his destination, he chose the route which put the company at risk of crossing the path of the Tute bianche, taking them along Via Invrea to the intersection with Corso Torino. A few minutes before 3 p.m. the carabinieri, finding themselves in the path of the demonstrators, attacked the Tute bianche, first using tear gas, then advancing and using their truncheons. The procession was pushed back towards the east (to the junction with Via Casaregis). The attack lasted for about two minutes. It had not been ordered either by the carabinieri control room or by the person authorised to do so. The carabinieri pushed the demonstrators back to the junction with Via Invrea. Once there, the demonstrators split up: some headed towards the seafront, while others sought refuge in Via Invrea and then in the area around Piazza Alimonda. Some demonstrators retaliated, finding hard objects such as glass bottles or rubbish bins and starting to throw them at the law-enforcement officers. Armoured vehicles belonging to the carabinieri drove up Via Casaregis and Via Invrea at high speed, knocking down the barriers erected by the demonstrators using containers, and forcing the demonstrators at the scene to leave. At 3.22\"52' p.m. the control room ordered Mondelli to move away and allow the Tute bianche to pass. Once the attack was over, the carabinieri withdrew to Via Casaregis and then Via Invrea, to the north, before heading west along Via Tolemaide.",

The victim's face had been bare, as his balaclava was behind his head. Evidence had been taken from police officers Fiorillo and Martino (see paragraphs 41-42 below).",

Captain Cappello stated that he had given M.P. permission to get into the jeep and had taken his tear-gas gun as M.P. was experiencing difficulties. He stated subsequently (at the \u201ctrial of the twentyfive\u201d, hearing of 20 September 2005) that M.P. had been physically unfit to continue on account of his mental state and nervous tension.

Cappello stated that he was requested by police officer Lauro to proceed up Via Caffa in the direction of Via Tolemaide to assist the men engaged there in trying to push back the demonstrators. He said he had been puzzled by the request, given the number of men with him and their state of tiredness. Nevertheless, Cappello and his men had taken up positions on Via Caffa. The carabinieri were forced back by the demonstrators coming from Via Tolemaide; they initially withdrew in an orderly manner, and then in disorderly fashion. Cappello stated that he had not realised that, when the carabinieri withdrew, they were being followed by two Defender jeeps, as there had been no \u201coperational reason\u201d for the vehicles to be there. He further stated that the demonstrators had dispersed only when the mobile police units stationed on the other side of Piazza Alimonda had intervened, and that only then had he observed a man wearing a balaclava lying on the ground, apparently seriously injured.

He stated that on 20 July 2001 he had reported at 6 a.m. to the location where he was due to commence duty in charge of two hundred men. Two hours later, as no one had turned up, he made inquiries of the questura and was told that the service orders had been changed. Mr Lauro later stated (during the \u201ctrial of the twenty-five\u201d, hearing of 26 April 2005) that he had been informed on 19 July that no march was authorised for the following day. On 20 July he had been unaware that an authorised march was due to take place. He was requested to go to near the fairground and join a contingent of a hundred carabinieri in order to patrol the area. Lauro was not able to make contact with the contingent and its captain \u2013 Captain Cappello \u2013 until 12.30 p.m. He went to Piazza Tommaseo, where clashes were taking place with demonstrators. At 3.30 p.m., in a moment of calm, Lieutenant-Colonel Truglio and the two jeeps joined the contingent. Lunch was eaten. The contingent was involved in clashes on Corso Torino between 4 p.m. and 4.45 p.m. It then arrived at Piazza Tommaseo and Piazza Alimonda. Lieutenant-Colonel Truglio and the two jeeps came back. The contingent was reorganised. Lauro stated that he had observed a group of demonstrators at the end of Via Caffa who had formed a barrier using wheeled waste containers and were advancing towards the lawenforcement officers. He said that he had asked Captain Cappello whether his men were in a position to deal with the situation and that Cappello had replied in the affirmative. Lauro and the contingent therefore took up positions close to Via Caffa. He heard an order to withdraw and took part in the disorderly withdrawal of the contingent.",

They further found that the bullet had not exited whole from Carlo Giuliani's head; the scan performed before the autopsy showed an opaque piece of metal which looked like a fragment of bullet casing. As to the entry wound on the face, its appearance did not permit an unequivocal interpretation; its irregular shape was explained chiefly by the type of tissue in that part of the body. However, one possible explanation was that the bullet had not struck Carlo Giuliani directly, but had encountered an intermediate object which could have distorted it and slowed it down before it reached the victim's body. That hypothesis tallied with the small dimensions of the exit wound and the fact that the bullet had fragmented inside Carlo Giuliani's skull.",

People grabbed all the missiles lying on the ground. Every twenty metres, the things thrown at the cops were picked up and reused straight away. The stone throwers were now moving forward strongly and quickly. A little way behind, dozens of people were running along carrying bins, containers, railings, etc., so that they were moving the barricade while charging forward in a series of short bursts. The atmosphere was frenetic. The level of violence was really high. Tear gas was being fired frantically from the back of what was left of the police lines. That slowed us down. The vehicles managed to find a way out. The cops started to re-form their lines. I think we pushed them back about 200 metres. It must have taken them a long time to gain that much ground, and we made them lose it again in ten minutes. People started to gather ammunition for a fresh attack (picking up and making piles of missiles and parts for mobile barricades, forming large groups behind the front lines...). The cops had just taken a hammering and were destabilised, on the defensive. That must have been why they sent thirty or forty cops down the small side street, to the left of the front lines of demonstrators. They must have thought that the front lines would be afraid of a charge from the side that would cut them off from the rest of the demo (and which would have been followed immediately by a head-on charge) and were going to withdraw slightly to ease the pressure on the police in the Via Tolemaide. Or maybe they were trying to deter us from spreading out into the little streets on the left and widening the circle of the clashes. I don't know why they did it but, in any case, it wasn't a good idea because there were a lot of overexcited people arriving to support the front lines and fill the space gained during the charge of demonstrators, and the few dozen cops were very quickly charged by at least sixty or seventy people. The cops withdrew to a small street at right angles. The charge continued. The more they pulled back, the more we charged. We followed them into the street at right angles and caught up with them where the street runs into a small square with a church. The cops were still retreating under the hail of missiles. Quite a few demonstrators had iron bars or axe handles. There were more of us than them and they were trying to avoid contact. The cops entered a street off the square to re-form their lines. When they withdrew, they left two small carabinieri jeeps twenty to thirty metres behind them. The situation was violent and confused, things were happening quickly, so I'll be careful what I say. The two jeeps tried to reverse but, for some reason I don't understand, the second one at least wasn't able to. It then found itself cut off from the rest of the police and in direct contact with the demonstrators, who started to throw stones at it and to hit it with bars and wooden handles. The back window of the jeep was smashed, I don't know how it happened but it was missing. I was about ten metres from the jeep, slightly higher than it (it was to my left) because I was on the steps of the little church. That's when I heard the first shot, quite loud, sharp and close by. I instinctively bent down, thinking that it was a gunshot. I looked straight ahead at the police ranks at the entrance to the side street to see what was happening, whether they had fired the shot and if they were charging. They were about thirty metres away, there was gas, I couldn't see much. I think there was another shot. I turned round, still bent, and went back down two or three steps, went a few paces and crouched down for cover behind something or other. I raised myself up slightly. Straight in front of me, still about ten metres away I'd say, was the back of the carabinieri jeep with its back window smashed in. I could see some movement inside. I lowered myself again and almost immediately got up again slightly. I think (but I can't be certain, it's all a bit confused) that I saw, through the smashed rear window, fairly clearly, two cops wearing helmets, bent over or crouching, holding on to each other. I saw the outline of a hand, at chest height, and extending from it, a glinting black shape. I realised at once that it could only be a hand weapon and that it had been the source of the shots. I thought they had fired into the air in order to extricate themselves. The cops (I think there were two of them) seemed nervous and had turned round slightly to look through the broken window for any demonstrators approaching. I couldn't see what was happening on the ground. Then I looked behind me to see what was going on, whether the demonstrators were going forward or retreating. When I looked in front of me again, the carabinieri jeep had gone. I got up and moved forward. There were very few people in front of me. I had the feeling that it was much quieter for a few seconds. Then there were some shouts. I thought to myself that there was a problem and that something serious had happened. I saw a few people running and stopping about six or seven metres to my left. I went over. There were four or five people in a circle. I walked round them. I saw someone on the ground. A tear-gas grenade had rolled over to near the group of people. I kicked it back towards the cops, who were not moving and were still thirty metres or so away ... His feet were close to mine. I remember his white t-shirt and his black balaclava, which was sticky and glistening with blood. I saw a pool of blood spreading out from his head. I noticed blood spurting out of his left eye. I realised it was a bullet that had done that and that the shots hadn't been fired into the air. I took a few steps backwards holding my head. When I turned round I saw two or three journalists with videos and cameras taking close-ups of the guy on the ground. The cops started to come over slowly. A group of six or seven cops moved away from their ranks and, staying behind three or four riot shields, they walked straight up to us, quite slowly and calmly it seemed to me. Two youths began to lift up the guy on the ground. I moved closer to help them but another demonstrator came up saying that the guy was seriously injured and shouldn't be moved. The two youths put him down again. Actually, no one thought he was dead. The little group of six or seven cops had moved closer. They were perhaps ten metres away from us. We moved back and the line of cops following the leading group at a distance began to charge, so we cleared off altogether. We didn't know what to do because we thought the guy on the ground was badly hurt, but not dead. We didn't check his heart or his pulse. If we'd realised he was already dead, obviously we'd never have left his body to the cops; we would have taken it to Via Tolemaide and found an ambulance there (I dread to think what effect that would have had on the hundreds and hundreds of people there.) Anyway, the cops charged and the square emptied, the last of the demonstrators caught up with the rest and said that a guy had been shot and might be dead. People started shouting angrily. The cops, after clearing the square, started off down the side street along which people had started to head back towards Via Tolemaide. When they saw the cops coming, the people hurled themselves at them, shouting \u201cAssassini\u201d and forced them back on to the little square. Opposite me was the street where people were charging towards the square and, on my right, the street leading to Via Tolemaide. At the end of that street I noticed a light armoured vehicle which was heading up Via Tolemaide at speed, sweeping aside all obstacles. I hope there was no one in its way because the vehicle was driving straight through at full throttle. I bumped into one of the journalists who had been there when the demonstrator died. He spoke French and said to me and another French guy who was hanging around that we shouldn't get our hopes up, because the guy was dead. He said he was dashing off to send the pictures. I went back to Via Tolemaide by a side street, further up from the one where I had seen the armoured vehicle pass by. The news was starting to get round in the front lines of the demonstrators and people were attacking the cops frantically. I started to head back slowly in the opposite direction. The bad news was spreading through the demonstrators. Then I sped up and kept shouting out in several languages, while I walked quickly along, that someone had been killed by a bullet to the head. I told the news to the SO of the LCR. Then I walked back up the lines of demonstrators for a while announcing it ... The rioters in the front lines were very angry at the news, whereas most of the demonstrators were sickened and left. End of account. An anarchist somewhere in , late July 2001.\u201d",

In particular, the film made by Luna Rossa Cinematografica clearly shows that the attack on the jeep hemmed in at the corner of Piazza Alimonda was extremely violent, with demonstrators hurling themselves at the vehicle and smashing the windows with stones, iron bars and sticks. The film extracts and photographs taken during the events and assembled in the album of the mobile unit, which contains thirty-four images indicating the precise sequence of events, show the foot patrol of carabinieri on the part of Via Caffa which links Piazza Alimonda and Via Tolemaide, confronted by large numbers of demonstrators brandishing iron bars and sticks and throwing stones from behind a barricade erected at the junction with Via Tolemaide. Behind the barrier, on photograph 1, we can see Carlo Giuliani himself throwing a stone at the carabinieri.",

This is not the same as self-defence, but confers wider powers whereby the legitimacy of the response is not dependent on its proportionality to the threat, provided it does not exceed the bounds of 'necessity'; should this be the case, Article 55 of the Criminal Code, which makes unintentional excess punishable, is applicable, it being understood that even for State agents the use of a weapon is an extreme measure and that the least harmful option must therefore always be chosen. But where the use of a weapon is considered legitimate, provided the proportionality principle has been complied with, the State agent concerned cannot be held responsible for the fact that something more serious occurs unintentionally, in so far as the foreseeability of such an event is intrinsically linked to the risk inherent in the use of a firearm issued to a State agent, and that risk could be eliminated only by his refraining from using the firearm, the use of which is authorised by law (see case-law acknowledging the legitimate use by carabinieri of their weapons: as the officers had aimed at the tyres of a car in order to stop it escaping, they could not be held responsible under Article 55 of the Criminal Code for the unintentional killing of the vehicle's occupants \u2013 Court of Cassation, 22 September 2000, Brancatelli).

I heard him shout \u201cPigs, bastards, I'll kill the lot of you!\u201d. I turned round and called out that he had a gun, trying to warn the others of the danger. At that moment Carlo Giuliani, whom I didn't know at the time, was near me and looking down at the ground. As I ran towards the street where I wanted to go, I heard shots. I turned round and saw the body of a young man on the ground, the others who had been next to the vehicle stopped and moved away ... I think that several seconds went by between the moment when I saw the pistol and when I heard the shots, during which the carabiniere kept shouting \u201cI'll kill the lot of you!\u201d. I would add that, before shooting at the man I later knew to be Carlo Giuliani, the carabiniere had pointed the weapon at other people, in particular at the young man wearing a scarf and a black helmet who, realising like me that there was a gun, ran away out of the line of fire'. Later on, during the same interview, he changed his story, saying that 'we were trying to get to a place where some people said there was no one; in Via Caffa, in fact, there were forty carabinieri, it was strange, they seemed to be lost ... It must have been fifty metres to Piazza Alimonda; there were forty of them, between 400 and 500 of us. Almost as soon as they saw us they sprayed us with tear gas, firing in threes into the air ... At that moment they fled, we were fifteen or twenty metres away ... I didn't throw any stones or hit the jeep ... I fired a pebble from about fifty metres ... I might have kicked the jeep a few times, but to say that I picked up something, a piece of iron, and hit the jeep, I didn't do that ... I might have thrown a stone, I don't know, in any case without intending to hurt anyone, more than anything I was afraid ... You know, if someone came at me pointing a gun, I could imagine that I'd pick up the fire extinguisher to get the weapon off him, for instance, I can understand it, I can imagine ... I didn't go there with the intention of attacking a jeep ... I don't think I stayed around the jeep for more than fifteen or twenty seconds, just long enough to see this carabiniere on the side who then turned, yes, before this photo, he turned, I was looking in the direction of this young guy with the purple scarf who spoke English. While I was looking I took off my scarf and started calling out that we should run, and fifteen seconds after the photo was taken I heard the shots ... Fifteen or so people ran with me, the others stayed around ... The jeep collided front-on with a rubbish bin, with a window already smashed in and this person stretched out inside with his arm holding up the shield against the side window \u2013 as we're looking at the jeep, it's the left window \u2013 and with the gun in his hand ... I'm telling you that we saw the jeep and probably, I say probably because I can't remember what went through my head at that moment, I can't remember. Today, I say 'I was running away', in my state of mind at that moment, probably \u2013 also because all the others were there \u2013 I thought there were far fewer people, I saw the enemy in the jeep, in the carabinieri jeep, and I may have thrown two stones at it ... If I'd wanted to hurt someone, I would have used the wooden beams I found, sticks, a sledgehammer, whatever, and I'd have gone behind to hit the jeep where the carabiniere was at the window, like the guy who tried to throw a stone at his face, and I didn't do that ... If I'd been planning, since I arrived in the street at one o'clock, to hurt someone, in this case one of the law-enforcement officers, I'd have had a very good opportunity, I'd have had a fantastic opportunity to hurt someone, and I didn't ...'.

I was trying to do something, to retreat backwards or go forwards, but I couldn't go anywhere: they were in front of us. Behind, there was a crowd of people throwing stones. At that point, something was happening, we were all there with a few people I don't know, some of them had balaclavas, some were like me, others had headscarves, we saw the carabinieri retreating ... I saw some people throwing small stones at the carabinieri. The carabinieri were running back; there was one group moving forward and a group trying to surround them; we pulled back, throwing stones ... The carabinieri were running back and people were throwing stones at them ... Well, they definitely got closer to us, we were running away ... At that moment the carabinieri left, we stopped and these two jeeps arrived at top speed, I don't know why. Anyway, they drove towards us, so obviously we ran off; of the two jeeps, one reversed from the church and managed to get away, the other did a U-turn and got stuck. We all threw ourselves on it, as you can see; there, twenty metres away, I saw this wooden beam, I picked it up and hit the jeep three times, but not the window, because it was already smashed when I arrived. I hit the arriving jeep three times, then I took the stick, the window was already broken and the carabiniere was there looking at me ... The one who didn't shoot, the one who saw me with the beam ... I didn't see anything, not even the gun, nothing, then, leaving the stick and turning round, I heard someone say 'Come on, we might be able to save him, come on' and 'Murderers, murderers, they've killed him'. I hit the van three times, I pulled back, there were two carabinieri, the one who hadn't fired who was looking at me, I swiped at him with the beam, I don't even know if I got him, I might have hit him in the side. He ducked down to take cover, I stopped, I let go of the beam; in the meantime, people carried on throwing stones. He fired and I was still there, when I threw the beam, I didn't run away ... When I threw myself against him, that's when the guy fired ... It was they who attacked us with the Land Rovers, that's different. The security forces were retreating on foot and we were running, we were practically nose to nose, they went back as far as possible, we stopped and the two jeeps came towards us. Then they reversed and the jeep stopped, next we had the ten seconds of madness, with all the people who were there. I wouldn't have killed anyone, I'm not a criminal ... With all the stones that were being thrown, I didn't hear the shots being fired ... Someone shouted 'Bastards, go away!\u201d for about ten seconds...' When asked how many people had been close to the jeep, he replied 'Lots'.",

Hence, he could legitimately have aimed his weapon at the attackers in order to prevent them from continuing their actions, and even sought to inflict limited injury (for instance, by firing shots designed not to hit any vital organs), since it was not a case of passive resistance, nor had the assailant taken a hostage as a human shield \u2013 the only cases in which legal commentators and the case-law are united in excluding the legitimate use of a weapon directly against the aggressor.",

The factual circumstances and the context in which Placanica had to act have been described at length. There can be no doubt that in such a situation, comparable to the situation in the nearby Corso Torino which had led shortly beforehand to an armoured vehicle being set on fire after a Molotov cocktail was thrown inside it, Placanica was under the firm impression that there was a threat to his safety and that of his colleagues, a threat which had already materialised in the form of injuries (as revealed by the documents in the file and the injuries reported by the jeep's occupants), and that the danger continued despite his having issued repeated warnings while displaying his weapon. One has only to observe the numerous photographs showing the jeep still surrounded by demonstrators smashing in the windows with sticks and iron bars which they are thrusting inside the vehicle with the clear aim not just of damaging the vehicle by way of protest, but of hurting the crew, and throwing a huge number of stones at the vehicle, most of which reached the inside and hit the occupants, in order to gain some idea of the very real violence being unleashed and the subsequent injury which could have been caused to the vehicle's occupants. It is not possible either to support the hypothesis, put forward by the injured party's lawyers during the hearing, that Placanica's head injuries could have been caused by his having knocked against the internal levers of the flashing light on top of the jeep rather than by the demonstrators' actions. Quite apart from the objective fact that numerous bloodstained stones were found inside the jeep, the lever of the flashing light on the roof is covered in plastic and inserted in a ball-and-socket joint covered with a protective cap which is used to direct the light. The very fact that the lever is connected to a ball-and-socket joint means that the whole structure lacks the necessary rigidity to cause injuries to passengers' heads, still less injuries with abrasions of the kind reported by Placanica. Coming back to the actual situation, there can be no doubt that the response was necessary in view of all the surrounding circumstances and in particular the number of assailants, the means they were using to attack individuals, the length of time for which the violence continued despite repeated warnings from the carabinieri, the injuries already sustained by the latter and, lastly, the difficulty of leaving the scene given that the jeep's engine had stalled (a move that was not required but was nevertheless attempted). It follows that even if we assess whether the defensive reaction was commensurate with the attack being perpetrated in terms of the substantial equivalence of the interests under threat, our conclusion cannot but be positive, as the attack on the carabinieri jeep took the form of actions which were not only dangerous, but in themselves amounted to a violation of the rights and, in particular, the physical integrity of the vehicle's occupants. Furthermore, it is beyond dispute, in the light of the factual circumstances, that had Placanica not drawn his weapon, threatening the demonstrators and then firing the two shots, the attack would have continued and would have had further, undoubtedly more serious, consequences; similarly, if the fire extinguisher which Placanica had already kicked away once had landed inside the jeep and hit the already injured carabinieri, it would have caused very serious injury, or worse. The presence of real danger and of an unjust attack was therefore borne out not just by the level of risk but by the fact that the attack was already in progress, and it must next be ascertained whether the requirement of proportionality was met, in terms also of the means available to the person under attack and the manner in which those means were deployed. As to whether the means of defence were proportionate to the attack, the Court of Cassation has specified on a number of occasions that, for the purposes of determining whether an individual acted in self-defence, the decision as to proportionality, which must be taken by reference to the means available to the person under attack and the interests being protected, cannot be qualitative and is by its nature relative. It is invariably a question of balancing the interests of the assailant and those of the person under attack who, in defending himself, is not in a position, in the specific situation, to make a precise assessment of the real danger and the effects of his response, with the result that the principle of proportionality is not infringed even if the harm to the assailant would be slightly in excess of the threatened harm to the person being attacked. (In the case in question, with regard to the plea that was accepted, the accused had defended himself using a shotgun, the only instrument to hand at that moment, in order to counter the unexpected attack which the victim, armed with an iron bar approximately one metre in length, had previously unleashed on the accused's father and then on the accused himself, inflicting various injuries. Court of Cassation, First Section, judgment no. 08204 of 13 April 1987 \u2013 Catane). The Court of Cassation further found that, as regards the notion of self-defence, the expressions 'need to defend' and 'provided that the defensive response is proportionate to the attack', contained in Article 52 of the Criminal Code, should be taken to mean that the response must be, in the circumstances, the only one possible in the sense that it could not be replaced by another, less damaging response equally capable of protecting the right under attack (whether of the person in question or another person) (Court of Cassation, First Section, judgment no. 02554 of 1 December 1995 \u2013 M.P. and Vellino). These principles, on which the established case-law and most legal commentators are in agreement, when applied to the factual circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Carlo Giuliani, also enable us to conclude that the requirement of proportionality between the means of attack available to the assailants and the means available to the persons under attack was met. This conclusion is justified in view of the fact that the concept of proportionality must make reference not just to the competing interests at stake, as already mentioned, but also to the means used to defend them. Mario Placanica had only one means of dealing with the violence against him and the attack on his physical integrity, not to say his life, and that of his colleagues: his weapon. In this respect also the factual findings suggest that in using that means of defence, he adapted it in order to cause the minimum harm to his assailants while attempting to deter them from taking action and make them desist. The Court of Cassation has even stated that, 'for the purposes of determining whether the individual acted in self-defence, an assessment must be made of the proportionality between the defensive means available to the person under attack and the means actually deployed \u2013 where only one means is available but it can be used in a varying and calibrated manner \u2013 in order to compare the different deployment options available and the option actually chosen in the light of the method of attack or its foreseeable consequences. Such a situation is in every respect identical to a situation in which a comparison has to be made between a variety of means available and the means actually deployed. That is why the use of a firearm as a means of defence should be confined, where the attack is aimed at causing maximum harm to the person's physical integrity, to displaying the weapon and one's resolve to make use of it, while firing only into the air and on the ground, or in the direction of the assailant but taking care not to hit him or, at most, to hit him only in parts of the body not containing vital organs, and hence with the sole aim of deterring or wounding, but not of causing death' or, to put it another way, 'with the sole aim of offering resistance or damaging the assailant's physical integrity' (Cass. 20 September 1982 \u2013 Tosani). Notwithstanding the fact that numerous photographs show the jeep surrounded by demonstrators, with Placanica's arm sticking out and brandishing the weapon, and the fact that the statements in the file made by the person under investigation and also by the assailants themselves testify to the carabiniere's repeated warnings to the demonstrators to disperse, the same photographic material clearly shows that these attempts to deter the assailants had no effect on the demonstrators, who continued to display extreme violence, eventually prompting Placanica to make use of his weapon, his only available means of countering the violence. What is more, Placanica's conduct appears to have complied fully with the proportionality requirement as regards the manner in which he deployed the means at his disposal bearing in mind that, had he wished to be sure of injuring one or other of his assailants, he could have pointed the weapon at the side windows outside which numerous demonstrators had gathered, whereas the complex technical findings show that the shots were certainly fired upwards; only as the result of a tragic turn of events did the first shot cause the death of the young Mr Giuliani. Consequently, whether Placanica had a partial view of Giuliani, as the injured party's lawyers maintain (a hypothesis also entertained by the prosecution authorities' experts), or whether, as seems more likely, he really did not see him and fired from the highest point which his position would allow, possibly accepting the risk that the shot might hit somebody, his action appears justified on grounds of self-defence, given that the intentional element of what occurred, whether it was planned or simply anticipated, was undoubtedly determined by the need to defend rights that were being unjustly violated, and that the defensive response remained within the bounds of proportionality, in terms of both the value of the interests at stake and the means available to protect them.\u201d",

When the shot was fired, he had been lying down with his feet pointing towards the rear door of the vehicle. He had pulled Raffone down on top of him and could not see his own hand; he was unable to say whether it had been inside or outside the jeep. In any event, he had fired upwards.

He had never claimed to have fired upwards and had said that he could not see Carlo Giuliani when he had fired the shot. In the applicants' submission, that meant that he had admitted firing at chest height and that he had not fired in order to counter an unlawful attack by Carlo Giuliani. Furthermore, M.P. had not issued a clear warning of his intention to use the firearm. The images in the file showed that the pistol was being held horizontally and pointing downwards. The applicants next observed that some of the photographs taken at the time of the events showed a carabinieri shield being used as protection in place of one of the jeep's broken windows. Lastly, the fact that the carabinieri had been issued with live ammunition lent support to the argument that excessive force had been used.

The domestic law had made the use of a firearm inevitable, as demonstrated by the fact that the proceedings had been discontinued because M.P.'s actions came within the scope of Articles 52 and 53 of the Criminal Code. The applicants alleged that the domestic law on the use of weapons by the lawenforcement agencies was inappropriate and outdated and did not conform to international standards. They argued that, in the light of the Court's caselaw (they referred to Erdogan and Others, cited above; Tzekov v. Bulgaria, no. 45500/99, 23 February 2006; Nachova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, ECHR 2005VII; and Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], no. 50385/99, ECHR 2004XI), an inadequate set of rules (both legislative and administrative) lowered the level of statutory protection of the right to life afforded as a requirement of a democratic society; in the instant case, there had been insufficient preventive measures and neither a clear policy nor criteria governing the use of force and firearms. With regard to the domestic-law provisions, the applicants observed that Article\u00a053 of the Criminal Code and Article 24 of the Public Safety Code were incompatible with Article 2 of the Convention and with international standards, given that they had been adopted during the Fascist era and also on account of their content, which reflected that context. In that connection the applicants were of the opinion that the concept of \u201cnecessity\u201d as a justification for the use of weapons and that of \u201cuse of force\u201d did not correspond to the principles established by the Court's case-law regarding the use of weapons, which had to be \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d. Furthermore, Article 52 of the Criminal Code stated that selfdefence came into play when \u201cthe defensive response [was] proportionate to the attack\u201d. This was not equivalent to the terms \u201cstrictly unavoidable in order to protect life\u201d and \u201cstrictly proportionate [in the circumstances]\u201d used in the Court's case-law.",

They referred in particular to the obligation for governments and law enforcement agencies to adopt and implement rules and regulations on the use of force and firearms by law enforcement officials (paragraph 1). They further referred to paragraph 11, which stated that rules and regulations on the use of firearms by law enforcement officials should include guidelines that specified the circumstances under which law enforcement officials were authorised to carry firearms and prescribed the types of firearms and ammunition permitted, ensured that firearms were used only in appropriate circumstances and in a manner likely to decrease the risk of unnecessary harm, and prohibited the use of those firearms and ammunition that caused unwarranted injury or presented an unwarranted risk.",

In that connection the applicants alleged that the CCIR company of carabinieri had been led by persons experienced in conducting international military police operations abroad, but who had no experience in maintaining and restoring public order. The officers Leso, Truglio and Cappello had previously served abroad (for instance, in ). As to the experience of the personnel in general, the applicants observed that at the material time there had been no regulations laying down criteria for recruiting and selecting personnel to work on public-order operations, in breach of paragraphs 18 and 19 of the UN Principles. Moreover, the Government had not specified the minimum requirements to be met by carabinieri being deployed on large-scale public-order operations. As to the experience of the troops deployed in , the applicants argued that three quarters of them had been young officers performing military service in the carabinieri or had just been appointed as auxiliary officers (carabinieri di leva, carabinieri ausiliari). That gave some idea of their inexperience. With particular reference to the three carabinieri in the jeep: D.R. had been nineteen and a half at the material time and had been performing military service for four months; M.P. had been under twenty and had been serving for less than ten months; and F.C. had been under twenty-four and had been serving for twenty-two months. As to the week-long training course in Velletri mentioned by the Government, the applicants observed that it had not been aimed at familiarising personnel with international standards with a view to minimising the risk to demonstrators' lives, but had been more akin to combat training, given that the instructors \u2013 for instance, Captain Cappello \u2013 had an international military background. This was incompatible with paragraph 20 of the UN Principles. Lastly, the applicants pointed to the observations made by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) in the report on its visit to  published on 17 April 2006 (see \u201cRelevant international materials\u201d above).",

In addition, the service order of 19 July had authorised the Tute bianche march as well as stationary demonstrations. Moreover, the service order had not been circulated properly. This was clear from the statements made during the \u201ctrial of the twenty-five\u201d by police officer Lauro and carabinieri officer Zappia; the former stated that he had been informed of the changes by radio on the morning of 20\u00a0July, while the latter said that the service order had reached him at 3 a.m. that day. Mr\u00a0Lauro also stated that on 19 July he had been told that no march had been authorised for the following day, and that he was to commence duty at 6\u00a0a.m. in a specified location; on 20 July he had received different instructions by radio during the course of the morning, telling him to report for duty at 10 a.m. in another location.

In that connection they pointed out that the decision to discontinue the proceedings had been based not on a finding that M.P. had not been objectively responsible (it had been beyond doubt, from a very early stage in the investigation, that Carlo Giuliani had been killed by a bullet fired by M.P.), but on legal grounds (self-defence) combined with certain factual elements relating to the direction in which the shot had been fired, the degree of visibility and the abnormal trajectory of the bullet. While it was true that the investigating judge had applied the rules which excluded responsibility in the cases of legitimate use of a weapon and selfdefence, she had not overlooked the unusual and unforeseeable circumstance that the shot had been deflected after colliding with a stone, a circumstance which she had assessed from the standpoint of proportionality. The Government inferred from this that the decision to discontinue the proceedings had ruled out any responsibility on M.P.'s part on the ground that the causal link between the shot fired and Carlo Giuliani's death had been severed as a result of the bullet's collision with the stone and its deflection. This \u201calso formed part of the reasons for his acquittal, but ultimately this procedural detail was of little significance\u201d.",

Furthermore, M.P. had not aimed at Carlo Giuliani or at anyone else. He had fired upwards, in a direction that entailed no risk of striking someone. It would therefore be inappropriate to hold M.P. responsible for the death of Carlo Giuliani, as the causal link between his action and its effects had been severed by the intervention of an unforeseeable and uncontrollable external factor. Carlo Giuliani's death had not been the intended and direct consequence of the use of force, and the force used had not been potentially lethal (the Government referred to Scavuzzo-Hager and Others v. Switzerland, no. 41773/98, \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 60, 7 February 2006, and Kathleen Stewart v. the United Kingdom, Commission decision of 10 July 1984, Decisions and Reports (DR) 39, p. 162). As to the trajectory of the bullet, the Government stressed \u201cthe low probability and unforeseeability of the bullet colliding with a solid object and being deflected by it\u201d. The applicants had subscribed to this theory of \u201cdeflection of the bullet\u201d, as indicated by the public prosecutor in the request for the proceedings to be discontinued, since the experts of both parties had agreed that the bullet had already fragmented before striking the victim's body, implying that they had also been in agreement as to the causes of fragmentation. The other possibilities advanced by the applicants to explain why the bullet had fragmented \u2013 such as its having been manipulated in order to make it more likely to fragment, or the presence of a manufacturing defect \u2013 had been said by the applicants themselves to be \u201cmuch less likely\u201d. Given their lower degree of probability, these hypotheses could not be regarded as valid explanations. Finally, as to the impossibility of identifying the object which might have collided with the bullet, damaging it and deflecting it, the Government \u2013 like the public prosecutor \u2013 considered this to be a detail which did not appear capable of having a decisive impact on the investigation's findings.",

In support of their argument, the Government proceeded to analyse the decision to discontinue the proceedings, taking into consideration the following elements arising from it: the level and widespread nature of the violence which had marked the demonstrations from the outset; the force of the assault by demonstrators on the contingent of carabinieri immediately prior to the events in question and the peak of violence at that moment; the physical and mental state of the individual carabinieri concerned, especially M.P.; the extremely brief period in which the events had occurred, from the assault on the vehicle until the fatal shot was fired (on this point the Government referred to two video cassettes they had submitted); the fact that M.P. had fired only two shots and had directed them upwards; the likelihood that M.P. had been unable to see the victim when he fired the shot or, at most, could see him only indistinctly within the limits of his field of vision; the injuries sustained by M.P. and D.R. while on duty on 20 July.",

It should be borne in mind that M.P. had drawn his weapon a few seconds at least before shooting, and that only a fraction of a second was needed in order to move the hand by a few centimetres or alter its angle by a few degrees. The photograph in question, therefore, did not provide proof of M.P.'s responsibility in relation to the death of Carlo Giuliani and did not serve to refute the hypothesis of an unforeseeable accident.",

A reconstruction of the events and test shootings had been carried out at the scene. A large body of audiovisual material had been included in the case file. In addition to the images filmed by the law-enforcement agencies (which, it was pointed out, could not be deemed to be unreliable merely on that account), this also included material recorded by individuals (journalists in particular).

They could also have participated in the technical procedures by sending experts. The applicants had taken part, via their own experts, in the third ballistics expert examination and in the reconstruction of the events. This had been made possible by the public prosecutor's office, which had \u201ceven strained the interpretation and application of Article 360 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\u201d. Furthermore, the applicants had not taken advantage of the opportunity to participate in the autopsy. In that connection the Government observed that notice of the autopsy had been served on the first applicant at 12.10 p.m. on 21 July 2001, that is, three hours before it began. In view of the need for promptness in cases of this kind that period could not be said to have been too short. Finally, the Government remarked that the applicants had been able to make criticisms and requests when objecting to the request for the proceedings to be discontinued; the decision by the judge to discontinue the proceedings had provided them with sufficiently detailed reasons why their requests for further investigation had been refused. While it was true that the applicants had not had an opportunity of requesting the immediate production of evidence under Article 394 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in relation to the first steps in the investigation, checks of that kind were a matter exclusively for the police. As to the possibility of applying to the public prosecutor's office for the immediate production of evidence in relation to the autopsy and the expert panel's reconstruction of events, the Government maintained that the law provided for such a possibility, even though it was not enshrined in Article 360 of the CCP. However, the public prosecutor's office would not have been obliged to comply with such a request. In any event, when it came to the panel's expert examination, the public prosecutor had asked the parties whether they had any objections to the use of the procedure under Article 360, and there had been no objections. As to the two ballistics expert examinations conducted prior to the panel's examination, the Government conceded that they had been carried out unilaterally. However, they had been aimed solely at establishing whether the two spent cartridges found belonged to M.P.'s weapon. Given that the latter had already admitted firing two shots, they had not had a decisive impact on the reconstruction of the events and the subsequent course of the investigation. They had been no more than routine checks. In any case the weapon had been examined again by the panel of experts.",

Furthermore, the fact that such a suggestion belongs in the realm of pure fantasy is confirmed by two circumstantial factors. At an internal level, it is confirmed by the findings of the investigation, which gave no reason to suppose that attempts were being made to hide anything, and by the reasons given for the decision to discontinue the proceedings; externally, it is confirmed by the results of a different investigation \u2013 relating to certain incidents which occurred after the episode on Piazza Alimonda \u2013 at the conclusion of which several lawenforcement officers accused of raiding a school where some demonstrators were staying overnight were committed for trial\u201d.",

The Government maintained that the aim of the article in question had been simply to propound a political theory based on a comparison between the episode in question and a previous tragedy in Naples which Mr Romanini considered to be more serious in objective terms, but which in his view had caused much less stir in the media because it had not lent itself to exploitation for political ends. In the Government's view, the fact that he had written the article did not render Mr Romanini unfit to carry out his task as an expert in an objective and impartial manner, given that he had not been asked to examine whether M.P. had acted in selfdefence or to ascertain whether the events supported the thesis of selfdefence. The panel of experts had been asked in particular to give its views on the trajectory of the bullet. Mr Romanini's specific role had been confined to carrying out test shootings in the presence of the other experts, the applicants and their experts.

Together with Article 3, it enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27\u00a0September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 146147, Series A no.\u00a0324). The text of Article 2, read as a whole, demonstrates that it covers not only intentional killing but also situations where it is permitted to \u201cuse force\u201d which may result, as an unintended outcome, in the deprivation of life. The deliberate or intended use of lethal force is only one factor, however, to be taken into account in assessing its necessity. Any use of force must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) of the second paragraph of Article 2. This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. In particular, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims (see McCann and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 148-149). In that connection the Court reiterates that the use of force by agents of the State in pursuit of one of the aims delineated in paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Convention may be justified under this provision where it is based on an honest belief which is perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time but which subsequently turns out to be mistaken. To hold otherwise would be to impose an unrealistic burden on the State and its lawenforcement personnel in the execution of their duty, perhaps to the detriment of their lives and those of others (ibid., \u00a7 200).",

Turkey, no. 22492/93, \u00a7 62, ECHR\u00a02000III). This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place an appropriate legal and administrative framework to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by lawenforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. As the text of Article 2 itself shows, the use of lethal force by police officers may be justified in certain circumstances. Nonetheless, Article 2 does not grant a carte blanche. Unregulated and arbitrary action by State agents is incompatible with effective respect for human rights. This means that, as well as being authorised under national law, policing operations must be sufficiently regulated by it, within the framework of a system of adequate and effective safeguards against arbitrariness and abuse of force (see Makaratzis, cited above, \u00a7 58).",

Before firing, M.P. shouted out and held the loaded Beretta in his hand in such a way that it was visible from the outside (the pistol can be seen on the pictures in the file). M.P. found himself facing a group of demonstrators who were engaged in a violent attack on the vehicle in which he was travelling and had ignored warnings to leave. The Court considers that, in the circumstances of the case, the use of lethal force, although highly regrettable, did not exceed the limits of what was absolutely necessary in order to avert what M.P. honestly perceived to be a real and imminent danger to his life and the lives of his colleagues.",

I would supplement that summary by underlining two points. First, Article 2 contains, in addition to the prohibition on the use of force which is not absolutely necessary for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 2 of the Article, a positive obligation on the part of the State under the first sentence of that Article to safeguard life. Where lethal force is used in the course of a police or military operation, it is necessary to examine not merely whether the use of force was legitimate but also whether the operation was regulated and organised in such a way as to minimise to the greatest extent possible any risk to the life of the persons involved (see eg, \u015eim\u015fek and Others v. Turkey, nos. 35072/97 and 37194/97, \u00a7 106, 26 July 2005). Secondly, the Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its function and must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case. Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court's task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them. Though the Court is not bound by the findings of the domestic courts, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those courts. Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place (\u015eim\u015fek and Others v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 102).",

It is argued in the first place that there was no causal connection between the shot fired by M.P. and the death of Carlo Giuliani since it was as a result of a wholly exceptional and unforeseeable circumstance that the bullet struck the victim. The death, it is said, was not the result of an intentional and direct use of potentially lethal force on the part of M.P.: M.P. had fired in the air and the chain of causation between the act and the effect was broken by the unforeseeable and uncontrollable impact of the bullet with a stone, which altered the trajectory of the bullet. It is argued, secondly, that even if there existed any causal link and the responsibility of the State was accordingly engaged, the use of lethal force was \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d and \u201cproportionate\u201d in the defence of the occupants of the jeep from unlawful violence. Thirdly, it is contended that there was no failure on the part of the national authorities to safeguard the right to life of Carlo Giuliani in consequence of a lack of adequate planning of the operations which culminated in his death, the authorities having done everything in their power to prevent the peaceful demonstration from degenerating into violence.",

The investigating judge did not address herself to this theory. Although she referred in her decision to the deflection of the bullet as being a \u201cwholly unforeseeable event\u201d and to the death of Carlo Giuliani as resulting from \u201ca tragic turn of events\u201d, it is clear from the context that the judge was not suggesting any break in the chain of causation but was rather addressing herself to the questions whether the requirements of Article 53 of the Criminal Code had been complied with and whether M.P.'s use of the firearm was in the particular circumstances of the case a necessary and proportionate response.",

In order to break a chain of causation, the intervening cause must in my view be so powerful and so unexpected that the conduct of the person concerned cannot be seen as a cause at all but at most as part of the surrounding circumstances. Where the intervening factor could reasonably be foreseen, it cannot of itself be regarded as a novus actus interveniens breaking the chain of causation and isolating the initial act from the final result.",

The act of M.P. in drawing and firing a loaded pistol was an inherently dangerous act. M.P. was crouched on the floor of the jeep; the jeep was encircled by a mob of protesters who were pelting the vehicle with stones and other missiles and who were sufficiently close to the jeep to be able to thrust a plank and a fire-extinguisher through the broken rear window and to injure M.P.; M.P.'s visibility from the back of the jeep was obscured: according to his own account, M.P. was aware that \u201chundreds of protesters\u201d were encircling the jeep but at the moment when he fired he had no one in sight and had not noticed the presence of Carlo Giuliani behind the jeep, either before or after firing; it is also clear from the contemporary photographs that at some stage M.P. was pointing the pistol horizontally towards the protesters to ward off the aggressors. Even if, as was found by the domestic tribunals, the gun was pointing upwards at the point when M.P. fired, there was as the investigating judge found at least a risk that the bullet would hit someone present at the scene. It was also in my view clearly foreseeable that, even if the bullet did not strike one of the protesters directly, it could ricochet off one of the missiles being thrown or brandished by the protesters and cause death or serious injury. The applicants continue to maintain that the bullet never struck a stone and that the photographic and other evidence shows that, so far from firing in the air, M.P. fired directly towards Carlo Giuliani and in a downward direction. However, even accepting the facts as found by the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, the deflection of the bullet as a result of striking a stone cannot in the circumstances be regarded as such an extraordinary and unforeseeable an event as to break the chain of causation.",

The applicants argue that the findings of the investigating judge provide no solid basis on which to conclude that the requirements of Article 2 \u00a7 2 of the Convention were complied with: it is argued that the standards set for the use of firearms by Article 53 of the Criminal Code - a provision which dates back to the 1930s - do not correspond to the accepted modern international standards, in particular the United Nations Basic Principles on the use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials to which the Court has referred in its previous case-law; nor, it is said, do the concepts of \u201cnecessity\u201d and \u201cproportionality\u201d in Article 52 of the Code correspond to that of \u201cno more than absolutely necessary\u201d in Article 2 \u00a7 2 itself or to the terms \u201cstrictly unavoidable in order to protect life\u201d or \u201cstrictly proportionate\u201d used in the Court's case-law under that Article. Reliance is also placed on the deficiencies in the investigation itself which have been examined in the context of the procedural obligations of the State under Article 2. The applicants further challenge, in any event, the conclusion of the investigating judge that the action of M.P. was a legitimate act of self-defence, arguing that in the circumstances of the case the occupants of the jeep were not in mortal danger so as to justify the use of lethal force. It is said that the occupants were in a sturdy vehicle and had the protection of a shield, bullet-proof vests and protective helmets, that there was a relatively small number of demonstrators who were not armed with lethal weapons, that the injuries to M.P. and D.R. were not serious and that numerous other police and carabinieri were in the immediate vicinity of the jeep and able to provide assistance if necessary.",

While the relevant Convention standard of \u201cno more than absolutely necessary\u201d in Article 2 \u00a7 2 appears on its face to be stricter than the relevant national standard, I do not find the difference between the standards to be of significance in the present case. On a fair reading of the decision of the investigating judge, it is clear that a strict test of necessity was applied, the judge concluding not only that the use of a firearm was on the facts of the case \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d but that firing the gun was proportionate in the circumstances of the case, being the only means available to M.P. to defend himself and his colleague against the acts of extreme violence directed against them and that, by firing in the air, he had endeavoured to reduce to the minimum any harm caused to the aggressors.",

Despite these deficiencies, the examination by the public prosecutor and the investigating judge of the circumstances in which M.P. fired the gun appears to have been thorough. In particular, both the prosecutor and the judge examined in detail the evidence before them, both eyewitness and expert, before concluding that M.P. had acted in legitimate self-defence.

The applicants' argument that it has not been objectively shown that the occupants of the jeep were in mortal danger from the protesters, and that consequently M.P. cannot be said to have acted in legitimate self-defence, is in my view to impose too strict a standard. It is well-established by the Court's case-law that the question whether the use of force was no more than absolutely necessary in defence of any person from unlawful violence must be judged in the light not just of the situation as a whole but of the subjective perception of the person using the lethal force at the time of its use. Thus, the use of force in pursuit of one of the aims delineated in Article 2 \u00a7 2 of the Convention may be justified under this provision where it is based on an honest belief, which is perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time but which subsequently turns out to be mistaken. To hold otherwise \u201cwould be to impose an unrealistic burden on the State and its law enforcement personnel in the execution of their duty, perhaps to the detriment of their lives and those of others\u201d (McCann and Others, cited above, \u00a7 200; Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, no. 50196/99, \u00a7 138 to 140, ECHR 2005II). In the same vein, the Court has held that it cannot substitute its own assessment of the situation for that of a law-enforcement officer who is required to react in the heat of the moment to avert a danger to his own life or the lives of others.",

I can also accept the view of both the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, reached on the basis of the material before them, including the autopsy report, that the reversal of the jeep by F.C. over Carlo Giuliani's body did not cause any internal injuries and was not a factor in his death, which resulted exclusively from the bullet wound to his head.",

It is on this question that I part company with the majority of the Court. It is also a question on which the investigations by the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, confined as they were to an examination of the criminal liability of M.P. and F.C., offer little assistance. Neither examined in any detail either the overall planning of the security operations or the particular operation which more immediately led up to the stranding of M.P.'s jeep in the Piazza Alimonda which resulted in Carlo Giuliani's death. The applicants make strong criticisms of both aspects. Of the overall planning, particular criticism is directed at a number of elements: the modification of the plans made on 19\u00a0July 2001, the eve of the events, which appear to have replaced an essentially static role for the carabinieri with a dynamic role and which were only communicated orally to the senior officers, including Mr Lauro, who only learned of the change on the morning of 20 July; the fact that the carabinieri had not been adequately informed of the further change in the service order of 19 July 2001 to authorise the procession of the Tute bianche; the selection and training of the personnel, it being argued that the carabinieri were commanded by persons experienced as international military police in foreign locations but with no experience of maintaining and restoring public order; the choice of weapons for the carabinieri, who were armed with firearms containing lead rather than rubber bullets; and the communication system chosen, which allowed communication only with the command centres of the police and the carabinieri and did not permit direct radio contact between the police and the carabinieri themselves. The Government argue that any errors or malfunctions which might have existed in the planning, direction or conduct of the security operations could not be regarded as having any direct effect on the origin of the dramatic events which unfolded in the Piazza Alimonda. I have considerable doubt whether this is so, at least as regards the failure adequately to inform the carabinieri on the ground of the authorisation of the Tute bianche procession. But even if it could be said that the overall planning of the security operation as a whole had no direct impact on the events leading to the death of Carlo Giuliani, the same cannot in my view be said of the direction and control of the events which immediately preceded the stranding of the jeep in the Piazza.",

The protesters reacted to the attack and began to throw glass bottles and refuse bins at the security forces. Armoured cars were driven at speed by the carabinieri, smashing down the barricades which had been erected by the protesters. Shortly before 15.30, the centre of operations ordered the carabinieri to withdraw and to let the Tute bianche procession pass. Certain protesters organised a violent counter-attack, setting fire to one of the armoured cars. In the judgment of the  court, the conduct of the carabinieri until 15.30 had been both illegal and arbitrary and had justified the resistance shown by the protesters. However, once the carabinieri had withdrawn, the court found that the behaviour of the protesters could not be justified since the illegal and arbitrary attack by the carabinieri had ceased. Consequently, even if the protesters retained a sense of grievance at having been victims of abuse and injustice, their behaviour could in the view of the court no longer be regarded as defensive but was to be seen as motivated by a desire for revenge.",

The contingent was at some stage joined by the two Defender jeeps, one assigned to the Echo Unit and one to Lieutenant-Colonel Truglio. Neither jeep was armour-plated or had a protective grille over the rear side windows or the rear windscreen. According to the Government, the Echo Unit jeep driven by F.C. was not employed in public order operations for which armoured cars of a different type were used but was employed solely to provide logistical support and, according to the submissions of the Government, had been sent to the Piazza to remove M.P. and D.R., who had become ill owing to their prolonged exposure to tear-gas fumes. Captain Cappello authorised M.P. and D.R. to climb into the Echo Unit jeep. According to the uncontested evidence, M.P. was not only young and inexperienced, having seen some 10 months of service as an auxiliary carabiniere but he was suffering from the effects of tear-gas, showed signs of intolerance of the tear-gas mask, had difficulty in breathing and was in a highly nervous state. He was, in the view of Captain Cappello, no longer in a fit state to carry on, \u201cat rock bottom\u201d psychologically and \u201cburnt out\u201d. Captain Cappello removed the tear-gas launcher and bag of tear-gas canisters from MP but did not remove his firearm or his ammunition. Despite his breathing difficulties and nervous state, M.P. was not taken for medical treatment even though, in the Government's submissions, this was the avowed purpose of sending the jeep to the Piazza. M.P. himself said that he could not understand why he had not been taken to hospital. Instead, he remained in the rear of the jeep with D.R., who was also found to be suffering from nervous tension and the effects of tear-gas.",

Captain Cappello subsequently stated that he had been perplexed by this order, having regard to the number and state of exhaustion of the men at his disposal and the total lack of armoured cars to provide protection for his men.

The contingent was forced to retreat in a disorderly manner to Piazza Alimonda leaving the two jeeps exposed and without protection. The jeeps reversed and, when trying to effect a U-turn and make an escape, the jeep driven by F.C. collided with, and became trapped by, an overturned refuse container and the engine stalled. The jeep was immediately followed and surrounded by protesters who attacked the two occupants in the rear, armed with stones, sticks, iron bars and other implements. It is unclear where the remainder of members of the contingent were while the assault on the jeep which led to the death of Carlo Giuliani was taking place. The Government assert that at the time of the events in question there were approximately 50 carabinieri at a distance of some 150 metres from the jeep and a \u201cflying squad\u201d of the Polizia dello Stato positioned in Piazza Tommaseo at a distance of about 250 metres. It is also said that no calls for assistance had been made to the operations room. This information is disputed by the applicants, who claim that, according to the photographic evidence and the summary information report, Lieutenant Truglio was about 10 metres from Piazza Alimonda and the rest of the Echo Unit of about 100 men was slightly further away, a view supported by Lieutenant Mirante and Sub-Lieutenant Zappia at the trial of the twenty-five who estimated that the Defenders were 30 and 20 metres respectively away from them. What is clear and undisputed is that no steps were taken by the members of the Echo Unit or by the police to come to the aid of the Defender which was under a violent attack and which contained two disabled and vulnerable persons crouched in the rear and where there was a real risk of loss of life to the carabinieri themselves, or to the protesters if the carabinieri were compelled to have recourse to firearms in self-defence.",

Nevertheless, making every allowance for the problems faced by the authorities, the circumstances described reveal in my view a serious and disturbing lack of coordination and effective control over the security operations in the afternoon of 20 July 2001 which were the direct cause of the situation where M.P., a young and inexperienced carabinieri, who was injured, unprotected and in a state of panic, had resort to lethal force resulting in the tragic loss of life.

For the reasons given above, I am not persuaded that the errors and deficiencies in the conduct of the operations were not closely connected with the events which resulted in the death of Carlo Giuliani. The procedural obligations of the State under Article 2 require that the actions of agents of the State which have resulted in the use of lethal force should be subjected to some form of independent and public scrutiny capable of determining whether the force used was justified in a particular set of circumstances. Where necessary, the investigation must also be capable of considering any systemic failures that might have led to the death as, for example, in the planning of police operations (see McCann and Others and \u015eim\u015fek and Others, both cited above). In the particular context of the present case, I consider that Article 2 required an effective investigation not merely into the potential criminal responsibility of M.P. or F.C. but into the planning and conduct of the operations leading up to the death, thereby ensuring the full accountability of the State officials for the circumstances which resulted in the loss of life.

It describes and assesses events which are highly controversial at the national level and on which the domestic courts have not yet given final judgment. The risk that the Court's judgment will be read in a partisan manner in order to fuel the tensions which still surround the events in question in Italy cannot be ruled out, and is indeed heightened by the delayed delivery of the Court's ruling (seven years after the application was lodged).",

The public prosecutor mentioned this in his request, without giving further details, in order to explain the time taken by the investigation (since the public prosecutor's office had to order another expert report by a panel of experts); it is clearly a reference to the fact that the experts had not recovered the piece of bullet casing which showed up on the scan, lodged in the victim's skull. The expert Mr Salvi provided an explanation in that regard, and the judgment of the Genoa District Court in the \u201ctrial of the twenty-five\u201d took note of it (see p. 389). The expert saw the metal fragment on the scanned images and took the view that it was not the bullet itself but a very small fragment, which he considered would be very difficult to extract from the brain tissue and would serve no purpose in terms of the ballistic analysis. This explanation may appear unsatisfactory with hindsight, in view of the importance of the fact that the bullet's casing had fragmented and that some of the debris of the casing, found in the victim's balaclava, showed traces of a collision with an intermediate object, giving rise to the theory that the shot had been deflected. One can understand why the different sets of experts may have taken a cautious stance and expressed regret that the corpse had not been available for their examination; however, that does not mean that the investigation as a whole was impaired as a result. The piece of casing that was not recovered could merely have confirmed the theory that the bullet had collided with an intermediate object (had traces of such a collision been present); in no circumstances could it have disproved the theory (had no such traces been found).",
