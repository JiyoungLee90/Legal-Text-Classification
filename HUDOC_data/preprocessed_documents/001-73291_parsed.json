In the applicant\u2019s submission, the Government failed to differentiate between aims and means to achieve these aims. The party\u2019s constitution did not contain even a hint at violence.

The Court accepts that initially there may have been certain shortcomings in the documents submitted to the Sofia City Court. However, it seems that after they were noted by it during the first hearing, the applicant and the other founders resubmitted fresh documents with a view to rectifying them (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). The later holdings of the courts that the minutes of the general meeting held on 26 January 1997 had not been duly signed, that the powers of the party\u2019s organs and its organisational structure were not clearly set out in its constitution, and that the constitution did not set out the manner of terminating membership in the party (see paragraphs 18, 21 and 24 above) did not make clear, as is apparent from their wording, what was the exact import of the formal requirements for allowing registration. It must be noted in this connection that section 8(1) of the Political Parties Act of 1990 did not specify the exact manner in which the party\u2019s constitution had to be drafted. Nor did it lay down any guidelines as to how its organs and their powers, or the procedure or grounds for terminating membership in the party should be described therein. It merely provided that the constitution had to set forth the party\u2019s organs and the manner of terminating membership in it. In a similar vein, section 7 of that Act did not indicate the technical manner in which the registration documents had to be signed, it merely provided that a political party was formed at a founding meeting upon the agreement of at least fifty enfranchised citizens, and that the founding meeting adopted its constitution and elected its management organs (see paragraph 28 above). It was the national courts\u2019 task to elucidate the true tenor of these provisions and thus give the party\u2019s founders clear notice how to draft the relevant documents in order to be able to obtain registration. In view of this and of the insufficient clarity of these courts\u2019 holdings on the formal shortcomings which they identified in the party\u2019s registration documents, the Court considers that this ground for refusing registration has not been made out.",

However, it seems that several parties exist in Bulgaria whose names include the word \u201ccommunist\u201d (see paragraph 25 above) and that later, in 2000, the Sofia City Court accepted to amend the registration of a party called Communist Party of Bulgaria \u2013 a name exactly matching that of the applicant\u2019s party (see paragraph 26 above). In view of this, the Court is unable to subscribe to the domestic courts\u2019 holding that the applicant\u2019s party\u2019s name was in fact an obstacle to its registration because of its similarity to that of another registered party and to that of the former ruling Bulgarian Communist Party (see, on this latter point, Partidul Comunistilor (Nepeceristi) and Ungureanu, cited above, \u00a7 55 in fine).",

Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution prohibits organisations whose \u201cactivity is directed against the sovereignty [or] the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation, towards the incitement of racial, national, ethnical or religious enmity ..., as well as organisations which seek to achieve their goals through violence\u201d. Section 3(2) of the Political Parties Act of 1990 prohibited parties which were aimed against the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the country, or the rights and freedoms of its citizens, whose aims were contrary to the Constitution and the laws of the country, or which advocated a fascist ideology or tried to achieve their goals through violence or other unlawful means (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above). According to the Supreme Court, the word \u201crevolutionary\u201d in the party\u2019s constitution was alone sufficient to deem that its aims fell within the ambit of the above prohibitions (see paragraph 24 above). The Court, for its part, finds no indication that the party was seeking, despite its name, to establish the domination of one social class over the others (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others, cited above, p. 26, \u00a7 54). Nor is there any evidence that in choosing to include that word in the preamble to its constitution, it had opted for a policy that represented a real threat to the Bulgarian society or State (ibid.). Moreover, there are other parties in  which use the same word in their names and manifestoes and where it is apparently not interpreted as meaning that they are likely to resort to violence if allowed to exist and participate in the political process (see paragraph 25 above). Nor is there anything in the party\u2019s declarations, as set out in the preamble to its constitution, which could lead to the conclusion that its aims were undemocratic or that it intended to use violence to attain them (see paragraph 10 above).",

Their holdings and the wording of the relevant legal provisions, while succinct, set out in enough detail the requirements which needed to be fulfilled for the party to obtain registration. It is reasonable for a State to expect political parties or other entities seeking registration to comply with certain legitimate formal conditions relating in particular to the manner in which their registration documents are drafted. Therefore, the courts\u2019 refusal, in accordance with their practice, to register the party on account of its founders\u2019 failure to fulfil them does not appear arbitrary or an onerous obstacle (see, mutatis mutandis, Movement for Democratic Kingdom v.

That being so, we accept that the courts\u2019 desire to avoid confusion in the names of different parties was reasonable.
