He moreover applied for the summons to be declared null and void and contested the jurisdiction of the Bianco Magistrate. This contributed to a certain extent to a slowing down of the proceedings, as, on two occasions (27\u00a0April 1993 and 24 October 1995), the authorities dealing with the case ordered a fresh summons to be served and the Bianco Magistrate declined jurisdiction. However, the Court recalls that Article 6 does not require accused persons actively to co-operate with the judicial authorities. Neither can any reproach be levelled against them for making full use of the remedies available under domestic law. Nonetheless, such conduct constitutes an objective fact, not capable of being attributed to the respondent State, which is to be taken into account when determining whether or not the proceedings exceeded a \u201creasonable time\u201d (see the I.A. v.\u00a0France judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, pp.\u00a02984-2985, \u00a7 121, and the Eckle v.\u00a0Germany  judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, p. 36, \u00a7 82). In the present case, even if the applicant may be considered on that account to be responsible for some of the delays, this cannot justify the length of the periods in between individual hearings and certainly not the total duration of the proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, the Portington v. Greece judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports, 1998-VI, p.\u00a02632, \u00a7 29, and the Zana v. Turkey judgment of 25 November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p. 2552, \u00a7 79).",
