On 28\u00a0August 2006 the internal control department of the Police Board informed Mr J\u00e4rve that no criminal proceedings had been initiated. In respect of the alleged misuse by M. of his official position, it was found that the applicant had terminated Mr J\u00e4rve\u2019s services as counsel and had wanted to be defended by R.; thus, his defence rights had not been violated by M. As to the question whether S. had committed an abuse of authority, it was noted that that offence presupposed the unlawful use of a weapon, special equipment or violence. Violence in this context meant a threat to kill, cause health damage, or cause significant damage to or destroy property; causing damage to the health of another person, or beating, battery or other physical abuse; or continuous physical abuse or abuse which caused great pain. It was found that the alleged threat by S. to handcuff the applicant, take him to P\u00e4rnu-Jaagupi and make him confess to the murder did not fall under Article 291 of the Penal Code. An appeal to a district prosecutor\u2019s office could have been lodged against the refusal to initiate criminal proceedings.",

In a reply of 22 September 2006, R. explained that in the evening of 7 August 2006 he had been called by an investigator and asked to be present during the applicant\u2019s interrogation, as the applicant had requested in writing. R. had gone to the police facility and examined the request, in which it had also been asked that no one be informed. The applicant had confirmed orally that he wished to terminate Mr J\u00e4rve\u2019s services as counsel, since he had also been defending other suspects in the case. It stated that he wished instead to be defended by R. and that no one, including Mr J\u00e4rve, be informed of the procedural measures. R. had not informed Mr J\u00e4rve about the termination of his function of the applicant\u2019s counsel because, firstly, that had been the applicant\u2019s wish, and secondly, the investigator had undertaken to inform Mr J\u00e4rve the next morning.

According to the decision, the applicant had initially accepted Mr J\u00e4rve as counsel, chosen by his parents, and had gone along with the tactics proposed by Mr J\u00e4rve of denying the charges. However, during the evening of 7 August 2006 he had decided to tell the truth. It had been explained to him that his statements had contradicted those given by A. and K., who were also suspects at that stage of the proceedings. There might have been the need to arrange a confrontation with A. and K., whose counsel of choice was Mr J\u00e4rve. Thus, the question of whether Mr J\u00e4rve could properly act as the applicant\u2019s counsel had arisen. The applicant had understood the problem and had decided to continue with R. acting as his counsel. He had submitted a written request terminating Mr J\u00e4rve\u2019s services as counsel and advising that he wanted R. to act on his behalf. He had also requested that Mr J\u00e4rve and his parents not be informed about the crime he had committed before he had had an opportunity to talk to his mother in person. The state prosecutor considered that Mr J\u00e4rve should have been informed about the termination sooner, and should have been given the documents indicating the applicant\u2019s wishes. The state prosecutor noted that the applicant had asked to have G. as his counsel and R. as his substitute, and that he had dispensed with Mr J\u00e4rve\u2019s services. On 29\u00a0September 2006 a similar response was given by the State Prosecutor\u2019s Office to the Board of the Bar Association.",

The court relied, inter alia, on an inspection report of the crime scene, forensic expert opinions, and a record of mobile phone calls from a phone company, according to which the last incoming call to J. had been made by the applicant. The court also examined the report on the crime scene reconstruction which also contained the applicant\u2019s on-site testimony.

The video recording of the applicant\u2019s questioning and confession on 10 August 2008 had also been shown.

Moreover, some of J.\u2019s personal belongings, such as a wallet and a key, had been found near the murder scene in places indicated by the applicant.

He had not wished to write such a letter but had complied with the order given to him. He repeated his allegations that the investigators had threatened to send him to another detention facility where he would be placed in a cell with violent detainees.

The body of [J.] is found in a forest; it becomes evident that several of his belongings are missing. In the course of the proceedings it is established that [the applicant] was the last person to call [J.]. A car was also seen at the scene and its passengers are initially associated with the murder; as a result of a thorough investigation, first, the persons who were in the car are identified and then, it is established that those persons had no connection whatsoever with the murder. At the same time [and] in parallel, proceedings were carried out in respect of [the applicant] who, at a certain point in time, confessed to having committed the murder, but during the trial in court he abandoned that [position]. Although the Court of Appeal has ruled that the statements made in the pre-trial proceedings had to be excluded from the body of evidence, there is nothing to prevent the use of such general knowledge; the confession of murder was to a large extent the reason why [the applicant] was committed to trial charged with murder, and the investigations were carried out on the basis of that knowledge. Even the defendant himself did not deny at the Court of Appeal hearing that he had earlier confessed to committing the murder; it is the question of further proceedings and the assessment of the evidence as a whole, whether or not [the applicant\u2019s] statements given in court and his version of the events were to be considered truthful and what evidence directly refers to [the applicant] as the author of the offence, regardless of the setting aside of the statements made during the pre-trial proceedings.\u201d",

That explanation is in line with the information provided in the decision of the State Prosecutor\u2019s Office in response to Mr J\u00e4rve\u2019s complaint, which stated that it had been explained to the applicant that there was a contradiction between his statements and those of the other suspects, and the question had arisen whether Mr J\u00e4rve could properly act as the applicant\u2019s counsel. The applicant had then decided to continue with R. as counsel (see paragraph 30 above). According to Mr J\u00e4rve, G.

Regardless of the interpretation to be attributed to the text of the waiver, the fact remains that Mr\u00a0J\u00e4rve was not informed of the termination of his services and was unable to ascertain whether it had been of the applicant\u2019s own volition.",

While it is true that the right to be defended by counsel of one\u2019s own choosing is not an absolute one and the defendant\u2019s wishes can be overridden when there are relevant and sufficient grounds for holding this necessary in the interests of justice (see Croissant v. Germany, 25\u00a0September 1992, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 237B), the Court notes that in the present case, even if Mr J\u00e4rve\u2019s presumed conflict of interests would have served as grounds for replacing him, no use was made of the formal procedure for removal of counsel applicable in the event of a conflict of interests and provided for in Articles 54 and 55 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 53 above). In such procedure, counsel could have presented his position and made sure that no pressure had been exerted on the applicant and a court would have independently and impartially examined the matter and ruled on whether or not counsel was to be removed owing to a conflict of interests. Any procedures used and decisions taken could also have been properly documented in such an instance so as to avoid any doubts raised about undue pressure. The Court considers that reliance, instead, on an informal practice, as happened in the present case, gives rise to concern about the respect of the applicant\u2019s rights of defence and freedom from self-incrimination (in respect of unrecorded discussions or informal questioning, see also, for comparison, Titarenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a031720/02, \u00a7 87, 20 September 2012, and Pavlenko, loc. cit.).

In its case-law on Article 6 the Court has held that when criminal charges are brought against a child, it is essential that he be dealt with in a manner which takes full account of his age, level of maturity and intellectual and emotional capacities, and that steps are taken to promote his ability to understand and participate in the proceedings (see Panovits v. , no. 4268/04, \u00a7 67, 11\u00a0December 2008, and T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a024724/94, 16\u00a0December 1999, \u00a7\u00a084). The right of an accused minor to effective participation in his criminal trial requires that the authorities deal with him with due regard to his vulnerability and capacities from the first stages of his involvement in a criminal investigation and, in particular, during any questioning by the police. The authorities must take steps to reduce as far as possible his feelings of intimidation and inhibition (see, Panovits, loc. cit., and, mutatis mutandis, T. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a085) and ensure that the accused minor has a broad understanding of the nature of the investigation, of what is at stake for him, including the significance of any penalty which may be imposed as well as of his rights of defence and, in particular, of his right to remain silent (see, Panovits, loc. cit., and, mutatis mutandis, S.C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 60958/00, \u00a7 29, ECHR\u00a02004IV). Although in the present case the applicant reached the age of eighteen three weeks before his arrest, the Court considers that the reasons for which the special treatment of minors is required \u2013 such as the person\u2019s level of maturity and intellectual and emotional capacities \u2013 do not cease immediately once the legal age is reached. Therefore, the considerations based on those factors could maintain some of their relevance, although their importance decreased as time passed. This approach was acquiesced by the Estonian law according to which the participation of counsel throughout criminal proceeding was mandatory if at the time of commission of the criminal offence the person concerned was a minor (see paragraph 52 above), even if that person during the subsequent proceedings reached the legal age.",

It considers that there was an infringement of the applicant\u2019s right to defend himself through legal assistance of his own choosing. Having made that finding, the Court considers it unnecessary to further deal with the issue that at a later stage of the pre-trial proceedings the applicant was interrogated twice without the presence of counsel.",

In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a026766/05 and 22228/06, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2011, and Taxquet v.
