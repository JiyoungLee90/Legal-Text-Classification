In these circumstances, the Court agrees with the applicant that he did not have a legal interest in lodging an extraordinary appeal on points of law since his pecuniary claim arising from the Court of Arbitration\u2019s decision was not placed in doubt. Moreover, following that decision, it was not unreasonable for the applicant to resort to enforcement proceedings in order to satisfy his claim. Accordingly, the Court does not consider that he was required to lodge an appeal on points of law. It therefore rejects the Government\u2019s objection in this respect.",

It had also been held that he should seek the enforcement of the arbitration award through enforcement proceedings. The applicant pointed out that he had accordingly instituted enforcement proceedings. However, after he had obtained a decision on enforcement from the County Court, the Supreme Court, following an appeal lodged by the club, had quashed that enforcement order, holding that the Court of Arbitration\u2019s decision had not constituted a valid basis for enforcement and could not be directly enforced. In the applicant\u2019s view, he had thereafter not been required (and nor would he have been able to) institute fresh civil proceedings. Moreover, in the meantime his claim had become time-barred. In sum, the conduct of the domestic courts had prevented him from realising his claim against the club.",
