Turkey judgment of 22\u00a0December\u00a02005, required the respondent State to provide a remedy guaranteeing the effective protection of the rights set forth in Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the context of all the similar cases pending before it. The State has a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention, but also to select the general or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress so far as possible the effects. The Government submitted that by enacting the Law on Compensation for Immovable Properties (Law no. 67/2005) and setting up a Commission to deal with compensation claims it had discharged that obligation (see also XenidesArestis v. Turkey (just satisfaction), no.\u00a046347/99, \u00a7\u00a037, 7\u00a0December 2006). It is that domestic remedy which, in their submission, the applicant failed to exercise in the present case.",
