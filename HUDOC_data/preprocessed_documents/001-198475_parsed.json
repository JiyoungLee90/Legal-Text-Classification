The court acknowledged that the applicant had sustained certain injuries during his arrest (see paragraph 11 above) but emphasised that police officers had the right to use physical force against persons who refused to obey their lawful orders. The court observed that administrative proceedings had been opened against the applicant for insulting police officers and disobeying their lawful orders at his home and in the police car (see paragraphs\u00a020-30 below).

It considered that the lower court had correctly established the relevant factual circumstances and made well-founded conclusions. It stated that the video recording made at the applicant\u2019s home (see paragraph 27 above) had shown that he had refused the officers\u2019 request to get dressed, had stayed in bed only in his underwear and had not provided any explanation about the conflict between him and his wife, which demonstrated his intention to insult the officers and his refusal to obey their lawful orders. In the court\u2019s view, the applicant\u2019s inappropriate behaviour had been further proved by the fact that the officers had had to handcuff him and take him to the police station. It also held that the lawfulness of the measures which the officers had used against the applicant had been confirmed by the prosecutor\u2019s and courts\u2019 refusal to open a pretrial investigation against R.N. (see paragraphs 13-19 above). The court also noted that it was not examining whether the applicant had used violence against his wife, because that question had been the subject of different proceedings (see paragraph 12 above). However, in the court\u2019s view, the fact that the applicant\u2019s wife had changed her testimony with regard to domestic violence gave it grounds to consider her testimony in the applicant\u2019s favour, given in the present proceedings, as unreliable.

Electrical discharge weapons are increasingly being used when effecting arrests, and there have been well-publicised examples of their misuse in this context (e.g. the repeated administration of electric shocks to persons lying on the ground). Clearly, the resort to EDW in such situations must be strictly circumscribed. The guidance found by the CPT in some countries, to the effect that these weapons may be used when law enforcement officials are facing violence \u2013 or a threat of violence \u2013 of such a level that they would need to use force to protect themselves or others, is so broad as to leave the door open to a disproportionate response. If EDW gradually become the weapon of choice whenever faced with a recalcitrant attitude at the time of arrest, this could have a profoundly negative effect on the public\u2019s perception of law enforcement officials.",

At the outset, it notes that none of the domestic proceedings established how many times officer R.N. had used the electroshock weapon against the applicant. It reiterates that where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim (ibid., \u00a7\u00a083, and the cases cited therein). In the circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that the authorities failed to cast doubt on the applicant\u2019s statement that the electroshock weapon had been used against him three or four times (see paragraphs\u00a07 and 37 above). Furthermore, that statement appears to be consistent with the findings of the court medical expert, who detected bruises resembling traces of electricity on the applicant\u2019s chest and back (see paragraph 11 above), thereby indicating that the electroshock weapon could have been used more than once (see, for a similar situation, Kancia\u0142 v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a037023/13, \u00a7\u00a077, 23 May 2019).",

The Court observes that there is no objective proof in support of either the applicant\u2019s or the officers\u2019 account of exactly what took place in the police car. However, even if the Court were to accept that the applicant did indeed grab officer R.N.\u2019s jacket and tried to grab the steering wheel, it nonetheless considers that, in the circumstances of the present case, that could not have justified the use of an electroshock weapon against him, for the reasons presented below.",

Such a warning was explicitly required by domestic law, except for cases where a delay might cause danger to the life or limb of the officer or another person, or where a warning was not possible (see paragraph 31 above; see also the relevant CPT standards cited in paragraph 33 above). Officer R.N. argued that he had been unable to warn the applicant because he had had to act \u201cwithin seconds\u201d (see paragraph 23 above). However, the Court cannot fail to notice that after the applicant\u2019s alleged attempt to grab the steering wheel, the officers were able to safely stop the car and get out of it (see paragraphs\u00a0810 above). It points out that the feasibility of an advance warning was not thoroughly assessed in the domestic proceedings and the officers were never asked to explain in more detail what danger might have been caused by any delay in the use of the electroshock weapon after the car had been stopped and there was no longer a danger of causing a traffic accident (see paragraph 58 below).",

In the present case, there are no indications that the officers considered using less coercive measures against the applicant in the police car (see Anzhelo Georgiev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 76). In fact, from the statement given by R.N. in the administrative proceedings it transpires that he only considered measures which were potentially even more harmful than the electroshock weapon (see paragraph 23 above). The Court notes that at that time the applicant was sixty-one years old (see paragraph 4 above); he was unarmed, which must have been clear to the police officers, as he was wearing only underwear; he was handcuffed; and he was alone against two officers (see, mutatis mutandis, Gedrimas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a021048/12, \u00a7 73, 12 July 2016). However, at no stage of the domestic proceedings did the officers provide any explanation as to why the use of less coercive measures \u2013 for example, handcuffing the applicant\u2019s hands behind his back so that he could not reach the steering wheel, or having one of the officers stay with him on the back seat of the car (see paragraph 36 above) \u2013 would not have been sufficient to restrain him.",
