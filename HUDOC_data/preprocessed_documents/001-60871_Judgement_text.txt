The case originated in an application (no. 35088/97) against the Italian Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Emanuele Marini, Mr Carlo Marini, Mrs Anna Maria Marini, Mrs Rosanna Marini and Mr Silvano Marini (“the applicants”), Italian nationals, on 3 January 1997.
The applicants were represented by Mr F. Abbate and Mr A. Fantera, lawyers practising in Orte. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, and by their co-Agent, Mr F. Crisafulli.
The applicants complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that they had been unable to recover possession of their flat within a reasonable time. Invoking Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, they further complained about the length of the eviction proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr V. Zagrebelsky, the judge elected in respect of Italy, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government appointed Ms M. Del Tufo as ad hoc judge to sit in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 2).
On 4 October 2001 the Court declared the application  admissible.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.
The applicants are the owners of a flat in Riano, which they had let to F.M.
In a writ served on the tenant on 31 July 1986, the applicants communicated their intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Castelnuovo di Porto Magistrate.
By a decision of 3 November 1987, which was made enforceable on the same day, the Castelnuovo di Porto Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises must be vacated by 30 April 1989.
On 17 May 1989, the applicants served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises.
On 1 August 1989, they served notice on the tenant informing him that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 11 August 1989.
Between 11 August 1989 and 27 May 1996, the bailiff made thirty-seven attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as under the statutory provisions providing for the suspension or the staggering of evictions, the applicants were not entitled to police assistance in enforcing the order for possession.
Pursuant to Section 6 of Law no. 431/1998, the enforcement proceedings were suspended for nine months.
The applicant decided, therefore, not to pursue the enforcement proceedings given the lack of prospects of obtaining the assistance of the police.
According to the latest information provided by the applicants in their letter of 18 February 2002, they have not recovered possession of the flat.
The relevant domestic law is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V.
