They have therefore lasted more than fifteen years for three levels of jurisdiction. However, the Court observes that the second applicant left the country during 1998 while his trial was still pending and failed to return when the proceedings resumed. It recalls that the flight of an accused person has in itself certain repercussions on the scope of the guarantee provided by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards the duration of proceedings. When an accused person absconds, it may be assumed that he or she is not entitled to complain of the unreasonable duration of proceedings following that flight, unless sufficient reason can be shown to rebut this assumption (see Ventura v. Italy, no. 7438/76, Commission's report of 15\u00a0December 1980, Decisions and Reports (DR) 23, p. 91, \u00a7 197). However, in the absence of any concrete indication that the applicant was avoiding being brought to justice in his own country in the initial stages of his absence, the relevant period must be regarded as having ended on 30 December 1999, the day on which the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court summoned the second applicant to the next hearing to submit his views on the Court of Cassation's decision and following which the applicant failed to appear (see Vayi\u00e7\u00a0v. , no.\u00a018078/02, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 2006... (extracts)). The relevant period to be taken into account is therefore over seven years and six months for two levels of jurisdiction.",
