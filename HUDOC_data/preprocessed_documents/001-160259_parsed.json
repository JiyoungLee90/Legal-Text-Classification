It shows that the applicant was kept in a room on a mattress, the top of which is placed on two chairs. The applicant is seen lying down on the mattress with his arms straight out to the sides and attached to the chair legs. He is also blindfolded with a piece of black cloth. On the other side of the room, there are four or five plainclothes police officers standing around a desk and a chair. The applicant begins moving with a view to standing up. Four officers approach the applicant, detach him from the chairs, put him on the floor, kneel around him and for about one and a half minutes keep the applicant under physical restraint on the floor. During this period, the applicant cannot be seen by the camera. Thereafter, another plainclothes officer arrives in the room and instructs the other officers to arrange the mattress and the chairs in a certain way. Subsequently, the applicant is seen without the blindfold and with his arms held behind his back by two officers who are also holding him around his neck. They make the applicant stand in front of the newly-arrived officer, who douses the applicant\u2019s face with water from a plastic bottle. He then hits the applicant on the head with the same bottle. Afterwards, six officers place the top of the mattress on the chairs, force the applicant to lie down on the mattress on his back, handcuff him to the chair legs and blindfold him.",

This telephone had originally been used by other inmates in prison and had been tapped by the police. The police had found out that the applicant had also used it in order to give instructions to the members of his criminal organisation and had subsequently conducted an investigation into the applicant and his coaccused. The first-instance court further noted that, after having assessed all the evidence in the case file, taking into account the legislation and the Court of Cassation\u2019s case-law, it had come to the conclusion that the applicant and his co-accused had already formed a criminal organisation prior to the attempted abduction. The State Security Court therefore found, once again referring to the content of the case file, which included the applicant\u2019s police statements, that the applicant was the leader of the criminal organisation in question and six other co-accused were members of that organisation.",

The Court had regard to the powers attaching to the public prosecutor and the judge and to their central role in Turkish criminal proceedings and found that an appeal to the Court of Cassation \u2012 which would only have had the power to remit the case for reconsideration by the first-instance court \u2012 would have no effective prospect of clarifying or improving the evidence available. The Court therefore held that the appeal nominally available to the applicants in the criminal proceedings would not have been capable of altering to any significant extent the nature of the investigations that were made. As a result, the Court considered that the applicants should be deemed to have complied with the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies (see, for example, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 108, ECHR 2000VII\u00a0; Suna Parlak, Rahime Akt\u00fcrk et Hatice Tay v.

Turkey, no. 21790/04, \u00a7\u00a027, 1\u00a0December 2009). The Court applied the same criteria in cases where the Government alleged that the applicants should have become intervening parties and lodged appeals with the Court of Cassation against acquittals of police officers on account of insufficiency of evidence of illtreatment (see, for example, Baki \u015eenses v Turkey (dec.), no. 24991/94, 14 November 2000; Erat and Sa\u011flam, cited above; Hasan K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v.

In that case, criminal proceedings had initially been brought against the police officers for having tortured the applicant (Article 243 of the former Criminal Code). The first-instance court found that the treatment meted out to the applicant did not have the purpose of extracting a confession of guilt. It therefore convicted the officers only of ill-treatment under Article 245 of the former Criminal Code and suspended the execution of the sentence. In its decision, the Court noted that the circumstances of this case were different from those of previous cases in that the Kayg\u0131s\u0131z case did not involve an acquittal of the accused on the basis of insufficient evidence. Having regard to Article 307 of the former Code on Criminal Procedure (Law no. 1412), according to which the Court of Cassation had jurisdiction to examine breaches of law and the legal classification of the acts of the accused, the Court considered that the applicant should have joined the proceedings as an intervening party and should have lodged an appeal. The Court declared the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the effectiveness of the investigation and the criminal proceedings likewise inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded because the applicant had failed to avail himself of the possibility of using the remedies offered in domestic law.",

The Court observed that, since the applicant had joined the criminal proceedings as an intervening party, he would in theory have been able to challenge the judgment of the first-instance court before the Court of Cassation. However, as the case had been terminated for being time-barred, and since the legal provision regulating the statutory time-limit for the offence in issue was clear, the Court concluded that the applicant had not been required to lodge an appeal.",

The Court observes that among the documents submitted by the Government there is an authority form showing that C.A. was authorised to represent the applicant. Moreover, according to the hearing minutes, C.A. attended at least two hearings in his capacity as the applicant\u2019s lawyer. Finally, there is nothing in the case file to show that the applicant had revoked the authority form issued for C.A.

In those cases, members of the security forces had been acquitted of the charges of illtreatment and torture on the basis of the absence or insufficiency of evidence showing ill-treatment, whereas in the case at hand, the assize court did not acquit the accused police officers as it found that there was no evidence \u2012 or at least insufficient evidence \u2012 demonstrating that the accused had meted out ill-treatment to the applicant.

The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the \u201cunlawfulness\u201d in question and, where a violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7 95; and G\u00e4fgen cited above, \u00a7\u00a0163).",

By providing the accused with protection against improper compulsion by the authorities, these immunities contribute to avoiding miscarriages of justice and to securing the aims of Article 6 (see John\u00a0Murray, cited above, ibid.). The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seeks to prove its case against the accused without resorting to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0168).",

The applicant maintained in his police statements that he had not been involved in the offences of attempted abduction and leading a criminal organisation (see paragraph 18 above). The applicant contended, however, that he knew personally a number of his co-accused as well as \u015e.H. and was aware that there had been an attempt to abduct the latter. During the trial the applicant denied the veracity of those statements, claiming that he had been tortured while in police custody. According to the judgment of 18 July 2003 of the Istanbul State Security Court, the applicant\u2019s police statements of 26 and 27 March 2002 were included in the case file and the court delivered its judgment taking into account the content of the file (see paragraph 56 above). While it is true that the first-instance court did not make any specific reference to the applicant\u2019s police statements, in establishing the facts of the case and convicting the applicant, the court referred to the content of the case file which contained, inter alia, the applicant\u2019s statements to the police.

It is true that those proceedings led to the acquittal of the police officers. However, on 18 July 2003, i.e. the date on which the State Security Court delivered its judgment convicting the applicant, the investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment was still pending. What is more, in the case brought against the applicant, the latter and his representatives alleged at five of the six hearings that he had been subjected to illtreatment during his detention in police custody. The Court recalls that in the judgment of the State Security Court, the individual pieces of evidence in the case-file are explicitly described, the contents of which included, inter alia, the applicant\u2019s police statements. Although the applicant had pleaded in his defence that he had been subjected to ill-treatment whilst giving the police statements, the State Security Court, when convicting the applicant, repeatedly referred to the \u201ccontent of the case-file as a whole\u201d in its reasoning (see paragraph 56 above), not excluding in any way these statements allegedly obtained by ill-treatment, despite the fact that Turkish law does not usually attach consequences to any confessions obtained during questioning but later denied in court and which are decisive for the prospects of the defence (see Kolu v. Turkey, no.\u00a035811/97, \u00a7 60, 2\u00a0August 2005; \u00d6rs and Others, cited above, \u00a7 59; Baran and Hun v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a030685/05, \u00a7 70, 20 May 2010). Also, the State Security Court failed to examine the admissibility of the evidence in the case file before going on to examine the merits of the case, even though it had requested and received the investigation file from the Fatih public prosecutor\u2019s office and had the medical report of 27 March 2002 in its possession (see paragraphs 48 and 51 above). Nor did the court await the outcome of the investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment before delivering its judgment on the merits of the case (see S\u00f6ylemez v. Turkey, no. 46661/99, \u00a7\u00a0123, 21\u00a0September 2006).",
