ADF International submitted that the first prong of the test to be carried out to that end served as an initial threshold: the conflict arising had to reach a certain level of seriousness. The second prong of the test consisted in examining whether the belief was genuinely and deeply held: the convictions asserted by the individual had to be based on a set of identifiable and sincerely expressed values. The third prong involved an assessment of the nature of the conflict, and in particular, whether it had a moral dimension.

Although the Constitution does not enshrine a general right to exemption from military service, the interpretative declaration concerning Article 4 \u00a7 6 of the Constitution states that the paragraph in question does not exclude the possibility of a law providing for the compulsory performance of other types of service, whether within or outside the armed forces (alternative service), by anyone with a justified conscientious objection to performing armed or general military service. To that end, Law no.\u00a03421/2005 was enacted, placing conscientious objectors at the disposal of various public services further to a decision taken by the Minister of National Defence after obtaining the opinion of a special committee responsible for examining, either on the basis of documentary evidence or after interviewing the individual concerned, whether the requirements for granting conscientious objector status are satisfied.",
