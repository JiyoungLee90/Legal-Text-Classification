The court refused the following defence applications: to examine a member of the standing committee; to admit committee minutes in evidence regarding the public sale; and to hear information from the public prosecutor about the committee\u2019s work. It held that the proposed evidence concerned the committee\u2019s work which was not the subject of the proceedings.

The nature and severity of a criminal-law sanction, in principle, are factors to be taken into account for the assessment of that effect (see Kasabova v. Bulgaria, no. 22385/03, \u00a7 69, 19 April 2011). In such circumstances, the fact that the criminal-law sanction was not to be executed is certainly a relevant issue of fact, which the applicant was required, under Rule 47 \u00a7 6 of the Rules of Court, to bring to the attention of the Court. However, in order to assess whether the impugned conviction was justified in the circumstances of the case, the Court will examine a range of other relevant factors, as described below. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the information which the applicant failed to disclose, albeit relevant, did not concern the very core of the case at hand (see, conversely, Metalex DOO v. Serbia (dec.), no. 34176/10, \u00a7\u00a014, 3\u00a0May\u00a02016).

However, he had neither possessed nor been able to obtain any evidence to prove his allegations (\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435). Given his prior experience in a similar case, in which the same trial judge had refused to admit proposed evidence (see paragraphs 31 and 32 above), the applicant had had no reasonable grounds to believe that the court would take a different approach in the impugned proceedings. In any event, the factual basis for his allegations which were the subject of application no. 64659/11 had been the fact that Mr S.M. had belatedly submitted his declaration of assets, failing to specify the origin of shares worth EUR 300,000 (see paragraph 8 above). He further referred to public rumours, which have been shown to be true in 2015, that wiretapping equipment had, in fact, been misused. His questions had been based on allegations that had been brought to his attention and had fallen within the limits of acceptable criticism in the context of the political debate, which, as was commonly known, the political opposition had launched at the time regarding the issues in dispute. The submitted material (see paragraphs 9 and 22 above) sought to assist the Court to obtain a clearer picture about that debate. In any event, the domestic courts had not been bound by the parties\u2019 proposals and had been entitled to establish all the facts and adduce the relevant evidence of their own motion. However, they had based their findings about the falsity of the applicant\u2019s allegations only on Mr S.M.\u2019s statement. If the opposition could only hold press conferences if there was irrefutable evidence about irregularities by State officials, it would be deprived of its crucial role of informing and alerting the public about allegations of irregular conduct by officials.",

However, where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient \u201cfactual basis\u201d for the impugned statement: if there is not, that value judgment may prove excessive. In order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment it is necessary to take account of the circumstances of the case and the general tone of the remarks, bearing in mind that assertions about matters of public interest may, on that basis, constitute value judgments rather than statements of fact. However, it is to be noted that that distinction is of less significance in cases where the impugned statement has been made in the course of a lively political debate and where elected officials should enjoy a wide freedom to criticise Government actions, even if the statements made may lack a clear basis in fact (see, mutatis mutandis, Lombardo and Others v.

The relatively moderate nature of the fines does not suffice to negate the risk of a chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of expression. Generally speaking, while it is legitimate for the institutions of the State, as guarantors of the institutional public order, to be protected by the competent authorities, the dominant position occupied by those institutions requires the authorities to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings (see Morice v.

Accordingly, interferences with their freedom of expression call for the closest scrutiny on the part of the Court. That is the case because freedom of expression for members of parliament is political speech par excellence (see Kar\u00e1csony and Others v.

On that basis, they required that the applicant demonstrate the truth of his assertions, as specified under Article 172 \u00a7 4 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph\u00a032 above). In the absence of any proof by the applicant, they concluded that his statements were untrue and accordingly defamatory. The Constitutional Court was less categorical on this issue: despite holding that the impugned statements had reflected the applicant\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d, it nevertheless followed the approach of the criminal courts and accepted \u201c(their) findings that the (applicant\u2019s) statements (were) untrue\u201d. It added that the applicant had made no effort \u201cto prove the veracity of his question or statement\u201d, notwithstanding the fact that he had been \u201cable during the entire proceedings to present evidence as to the veracity of his statement\u201d (see paragraphs 18 and 30 above). Accordingly, the domestic courts applied the socalled \u201cpresumption of falsity\u201d (sometimes referred to as the \u201cdefence of justification\u201d or the \u201cdefence of truth\u201d), under which defendants are required to prove to a reasonable standard that factual allegations are true. The Court has held that such an approach does not, as such, contravene the Convention (see Rumyana Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 36207/03, \u00a7\u00a7 39 and 68, 14\u00a0February 2008; Makarenko v. Russia, no. 5962/03, \u00a7\u00a0156, 22\u00a0December\u00a02009; and Rukaj v. Greece (dec.), no. 2179/08, 21\u00a0January\u00a02010)), and has held a lack of effort to make out that defence against applicants (see Mahmudov and Agazade v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a035877/04, \u00a7\u00a044, 18\u00a0December\u00a02008). However, it has also held that if an applicant is clearly involved in a public debate on an important issue he should not be required to fulfil a more demanding standard than that of due diligence. In such circumstances, the obligation to prove the factual statements may deprive the applicant of the protection afforded by Article\u00a010 (see Kurski v. Poland, no. 26115/10, \u00a7 56, 5 July 2016 and Braun v.\u00a0Poland, no. 30162/10, \u00a7\u00a050, 4\u00a0November 2014).",

The defence presented by his lawyer before both the criminal courts and the Constitutional Court rested on his belief that the impugned statements had been made in an interrogatory form and in a political context (see paragraphs\u00a011, 17, 27 and 29). Accordingly, he argued that he should have been exempted from criminal liability under Article 176 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 34 above). The courts dismissed such arguments, finding that his statements had concerned, as stated in paragraph 75 above, false accusations of a factual nature about Mr S.M., presented in such a way that \u201cordinary\u201d viewers had been given the impression that they had concerned \u201ctruthful\u201d matters and \u201cfacts\u201d (see paragraphs 13 and 27 above).",

That question, as described in the media coverage, was related to Mr S.M.\u2019s belated declaration of his assets, in which he had reported his possession of shares worth EUR 300,000. The latter constituted, in the Court\u2019s view, sufficient factual ground for the applicant\u2019s statement. Here, the Court disagrees with the Government (see paragraph 53 above) and notes that the criminal courts were able to examine the applicant\u2019s statement in the context of the coverage of the events as a whole (see paragraphs 8 and 11 above). In the second part of his statement, the applicant further asked whether \u201cpolice wiretapping equipment (is being) misused for trading on the Stock Exchange\u201d. Although the applicant did not directly and explicitly accuse Mr\u00a0S.M. of misusing police wiretapping equipment, the Court accepts that the factual elements contained in that part of the statement concerned allegations of a particular type of misconduct by Mr S.M. as the head of the Agency. In that connection, it reiterates that accusations against a third person, although made indirectly and by way of a question, may be regarded as an allegation of fact susceptible of proof (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 74-76). However, the Court places significant importance on the wording used and the manner in which the applicant presented matters. In that connection, it is noteworthy that the impugned questions were related to and consisted of \u201cpublic rumours which have become stronger\u201d. The applicant essentially raised a question about something that had already been subject to public discussion (see, mutatis mutandis, Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland, 25 June 1992, \u00a7 65, Series A no.\u00a0239). Accordingly, his remarks were neither novel nor did he present them so as to be perceived as his own assertion. He merely put the matters that were of general interest for public debate, which, in the Court\u2019s view, is the role of politicians and members of parliament, as representatives of the electorate. In the ensuing proceedings against the applicant he was convicted because of his failure to prove what the domestic courts considered to be his own allegations. To the extent the applicant was required to establish the truth of his statement, he was, in the Court\u2019s opinion, faced with an unreasonable, if not impossible, task.",

Holding, which was perceived by the public, as confirmed by the Government (see paragraph 54 above), as being close to Mr S.M. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the impugned statement was given frivolously without any prior efforts by the applicant being made in order to shed light on the circumstances surrounding the public sale in question. The applicant further asked who was to be held responsible for that \u201cmegascandal\u201d. While some of the expressions used by the applicant may have lacked a certain degree of moderation and may have been sarcastic, they did not contain manifestly insulting language. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the impugned remarks remained within the limits of admissible exaggeration or provocation (see Mam\u00e8re v. France, no.\u00a012697/03, \u00a7 25, ECHR 2006XIII).",

In any event, the Court considers that the impugned remarks must be placed in context. In that connection, it notes the public debate that was going on at the time about the public sale in question (press conferences held by the applicant\u2019s political party, paragraphs 20 and 31 above). The trial judge could not have been unaware of that debate given the fact that this judge had already convicted the applicant of defamation for statements that he had made about the same public sale (see paragraphs 25 and 31 above). The courts remained silent on that issue and concluded that the statement in question contained factual allegations that the applicant had failed to prove. Given the on-going lively political debate about the issue at stake, the Court is unable to accept the domestic courts\u2019 view that he was required to prove the veracity of his allegations. It was not justified, in the light of the Court\u2019s case-law and in the circumstances of the case, to require him to fulfil a more demanding standard than that of due diligence (see paragraphs 62 and 75 in fine above).",

Transparency and prevention of abuse of power by public servants are matters of public concern in a democratic society which aim is to strengthen public integrity and maintain public confidence in public institutions.
