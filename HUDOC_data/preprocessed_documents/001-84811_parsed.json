The Court acknowledges that this delay was partly attributable to the applicant who had requested the wrong file and partly to the adverse weather conditions that prevented the conduct of the second on-site inspection. However the Court observes that the wrong file was submitted to the court within two months whereas it then took the court approximately one year and five months to acquire the correct file as the archives had been flooded in the meantime. On the other hand a period of one year and six months passed in between the decision to hold a second on-site inspection and the actual conduct of the inspection itself, a delay mainly explained by the adverse weather conditions. The Court notes that adverse weather conditions and flooding of the archives alone delayed the proceedings for some three years. In this respect the Court rejects the Government's above assertions which do not dispense the domestic courts from ensuring the expeditious trial of the action as required by Article 6.",
