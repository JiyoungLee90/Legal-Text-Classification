The materials showed that other persons, including O.L.'s father, had been accused of having committed fraud. The court also found from the documents at its disposal that during the period under investigation and until June 2003 O.L. had been a student and had not held a management position in any of the companies mentioned in the criminal file. As confirmed by the Moldovan authorities, O.L. did not have the right to sign any documents in the name of Vinis N.L.G., which directly contradicted the assertion made by the Moldovan prosecutors that he had been the director of that company in 2002.

Moreover, he did not notify the investigator at the relevant time of any reason not to trust the State-appointed lawyer, nor did he ask for an opportunity to have someone else find his lawyer, as his son had done (see paragraph 15 above). More importantly, S.L. did not submit that his statements made in the presence of that lawyer had been obtained under some form of duress or that they had negatively affected the course of the proceedings against him (see, mutatis mutandis and a contrario, Salduz v.
