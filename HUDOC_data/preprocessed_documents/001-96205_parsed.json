However, there were also further criteria with which the applicant did not comply either. The applicant had stated that his function would be comparable to that of persons involved in spiritual welfare or in clerical teaching after graduating in theology or who were preparing for such functions. In this connection, the Government stressed that the applicant had not stated during the domestic proceedings that he would study theology at a university or any equivalent institution. Furthermore, the applicant's submissions that he would perform divine service and engage in preaching activity had not been substantiated and were, in any event, irrelevant, as he had started doing that work long after the impugned decisions in the present case were issued. In his application the applicant had stated that he was still a \u201cstudent\u201d. Therefore, notwithstanding his religious denomination, the applicant had failed to prove that he complied with the criteria of the above provision.

While it was true that the Bund Evangelikaler Gemeinden in \u00d6sterreich had neither chairs nor faculties within state or church universities, it offered nonetheless intensive clerical training which consisted of theoretical studies and practical exercises. The applicant pointed out that the Biblical seminary he visited had prepared him to exercise pastoral care (Seelsorge) and to do preaching and had to be considered as comprehensive training for a clerical function. The applicant had been giving religious instruction to adolescents aged between 11 and 14 years in his municipality, had worked as a preacher and had performed divine service since February 2002 at the latest. In any event, the above provisions did not require the exercise of a clerical function but were complied with when the person concerned was preparing for such function. The Austrian authorities and courts had only linked the granting of an exemption from civilian service to membership of a recognised religious society and had not examined whether or not the person concerned performed comparable functions for the purposes of section\u00a024(3) of the Military Service Act.",

Observing that religious communities traditionally exist in the form of organised structures, the Court has repeatedly found that the autonomous existence of religious communities is indispensable for pluralism in a democratic society and is thus an issue at the very heart of the protection which Article 9 affords (see Hasan and Chaush v.

In the case of Religionsgemeinschaft\u00a0der Zeugen Jehovas and Others (no. 40825/98, 31\u00a0July 2008) the Court made it clear that a difference in treatment between religious groups which resulted in granting a specific status in law \u2013 to which substantial privileges were attached \u2013 while refusing this preferential treatment to other religious groups which had not acceded to this status, was compatible with the requirements of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article\u00a09 as long as the State set up a framework for conferring legal personality on religious groups to which a specific status was linked, all religious groups which so wished had a fair opportunity to apply for this status and the criteria established were applied in a non-discriminatory manner (ibid., \u00a7 92). In other words such a privileged status is a right which a religious community may apply for if it feels that such status would facilitate the religious society's pursuance of its religious aims. By its very nature, such a decision on the status of a legal person has repercussions for those persons who are affected by legal provisions in their position as members of that community and, accordingly, have to assume the consequences arising from their membership.",
