Firstly, according to them, the requalified charges had comprised exclusively the intrinsic elements of the original charge, thus the description and nature of the charge initially brought against the applicant had not been altered, and no issue arose under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention as a result of the mere change of an Article of the Criminal Code. In support, the Government referred to a decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia, dated 10 October 2007, according to which Article 336 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Criminal Code was a lex specialis to Article 332. Secondly, in view of all the above-mentioned factors, the new criminal qualification proposed by the prosecution implied only a change of Article. The applicant had been given time to comment on the requalified charges. She had had an opportunity to ask for an adjournment, but she had failed to do so. In her final statement before the Kutaisi Court of Appeal she had only voiced her concerns concerning the alleged unlawfulness of the requalification, while failing to mention her concerns regarding having insufficient time to adjust her defence. Stressing further the fact that the applicant was a former judge, the Government maintained that she had had various effective tools to defend herself, in full compliance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (a) and (b) of the Convention.",

The applicant challenged as erroneous the interpretation of the above provisions proposed by the Government. The Court is not in a position to act as a court of fourth instance and provide its own interpretation of the provisions in question. However, it does consider necessary to point out the following: the Kutaisi Court of Appeal left the applicant\u2019s pertinent argument about the wrongfulness of the prosecutor\u2019s application unanswered (see paragraphs 11-13 above). This argument merited a thorough consideration given that Article 540 \u00a7 1 of the CCP (prohibition of reformatio in peius) limited the authority of an appeal court to take any decision that was more unfavourable to the convicted person within the scope of the appeal initiated by the latter (see paragraph 21 above). In this connection, paragraph 2 of the same provision added that the scope of the examination by the court of appeal was limited to the charges brought against a defendant at the pre-trial investigation stage and subsequently maintained in the first-instance proceedings (ibid.). The Court observes that this complaint was also explicitly voiced by the applicant in her appeal on points of law (see paragraph 14 above). However, the Supreme Court of Georgia rejected her appeal as inadmissible, thus failing to fill the gap in the reasoning of the appeal court.",

Thus, from their perspective, there had been no requalification of the offence stricto sensu, and no overstepping of the scope of the initial charges. The Court cannot accept this argument. First of all, it is in conflict with the rationale of the decriminalisation bill prepared and adopted by the legislature. Notably, the explanatory note of the relevant bill made it explicit that the purpose of the proposed amendments was to remove criminal responsibility from the act of delivering an unlawful court decision and/or judgment (see paragraph 18 above). Furthermore, the Court notes that the only charge brought against the applicant in the prosecutorial decision of 26 October 2005 committing her for trial before a criminal court was delivery of an unlawful court decision (see paragraph 6 above). No reference was made to other potential charges or the lex specialis nature of Article 336 vis-\u00e0-vis Article\u00a0332. Thus, the investigation conducted with respect to the applicant was confined to the offence of delivery of an unlawful court decision. The same holds true for the subsequent court proceedings conducted against the applicant in absentia. The wording of the relevant judgments indicates that the issue of the applicant possibly being convicted of abuse of office in the alternative was not aired at all (see paragraph 7 above). Against this background, following the appeal lodged by the applicant, the Kutaisi Court of Appeal simply replaced one offence with another. It did so without considering the evident differences between the definitions of the two offences under the Georgian law (see Article 332 and 336 as cited in paragraph 17 above). Thus, the corpus delicti of the offence under Article\u00a0336 was the delivery of an unlawful judgment or court decision without any element of improper motive, which was, however, an element intrinsic to the offence of abuse of office under Article 332 (see ibid.).",

Article 28 of the CCP also provided for the compulsory termination of proceedings in the event of an act being decriminalised, unless the accused was willing to proceed with the trial (see paragraph 20 above). Even in such a case, the law provided that, if convicted, that person had to be released from serving a sentence (ibid.). By simply omitting the above provisions from its reasoning and by failing to examine their applicability to the particular circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case, the appeal court, with the silent post factum approval of the Supreme Court, rendered its decision procedurally and substantially unfair.",

Thus, the court of appeal did not warn the applicant that her offence could be requalified (see, a contrario, Ujlaki and Pisc\u00f3ti v.\u00a0Hungary (dec.) [Committee], no. 6668/14, \u00a7\u00a7 19-20, 26 February 2019). The hearing was not adjourned for further argument and the elements of the new offence were not debated in court (see Penev, cited above, \u00a7 41). In any event, as already noted above, the prosecutor\u2019s proposal for the requalification was flawed from the procedural point of view, a point duly noted by the applicant in the course of the proceedings. In such circumstances it cannot be said that the applicant should have anticipated the requalification of her offence.",
