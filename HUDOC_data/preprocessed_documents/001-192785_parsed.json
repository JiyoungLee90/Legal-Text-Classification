Both transactions had been attested in notarial deeds. In a further notarial deed of 1996 A.K. had been recognised as the owner of part of the property. In 2006 he had obtained a permit to enlarge the existing house. The construction works had been carried out in 2006 and 2007. A representative of the building control authorities had visited the site on 2 July 2009 and had established breaches of the relevant rules, but no administrative sanction had been ordered against A.K. An additional check had been carried out on 26 November 2009, after one of the co-owners of the property (not the applicant) had complained. That check had showed that part of the construction works undertaken by A.K. did not correspond to the construction permit. It appears however that A.K. had not been ordered to demolish the unlawfully constructed parts. Further complaints by the coowners concerning the construction undertaken by A.K. had been sent to the municipality on 13\u00a0May 2010.",

Those allegations had also damaged A.K.\u2019s professional reputation, since he was working in construction. This was so even bearing in mind that the municipal authorities had taken no particular action against A.K., and that checks on the construction site had been incited by other coowners of the property. The above considerations were valid regardless of whether the applicant had committed the criminal offence of defamation, since this was not the subject of the proceedings. The applicant had had resort to his constitutional right to petition the authorities, but the exercise of that right did not have to involve causing damage to others.",

Moreover, the interference had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued for the following reasons: the applicant\u2019s criminal prosecution had been discontinued and the criminal courts had only examined A.K.\u2019s civil claim against him; the applicant had not been a journalist or a whistle-blower, nor had A.K. been a public official, which meant that the authorities had owed no special protection to the applicant, and A.K. had not been obliged to tolerate criticism; the applicant had made a statement of fact, not a value judgment, and had not proven the veracity of the facts alleged; those facts were such that they could have affected A.K.\u2019s reputation; the damages ordered against the applicant had not been excessive; the award of damages had been made in adversarial proceedings and the domestic courts had given sufficient reasons for their decisions.",

These were based on the fact that the applicants had not \u201cdisseminated\u201d injurious statements, while the \u201cdissemination\u201d was an requisite element of the offence of defamation, as interpreted by the former Bulgarian Supreme Court and the current Supreme Court of Cassation. The applicants\u2019 cases had not reached the Supreme Court of Cassation, so that it could authoritatively rule on the matter. However, the Court decided that it did not have to pronounce on the question of lawfulness, since it considered that the interferences with the applicants\u2019 rights were in any event disproportionate (see Marinova and Others, nos. 33502/07 and 3 others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a081-82, 12 July 2016; Zdravko Stanev v.

They only examined the civil claim brought by A.K. in the same proceedings (see paragraphs 8-10 and 21 above). In view thereof, the Court sees no reason to call into question the lawfulness of the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression, as it did in the cases cited in the previous paragraph, on the ground of any failure of the domestic courts\u2019 to establish the elements of the criminal offence of defamation.

On the contrary, it would appear that, in making the impugned statement, the applicant deliberately sought to harm his nephew.

The applicant has not submitted details on his personal financial situation and the Court is unable to assess whether such an award against him was excessive and imposed on him a disproportionate burden. Furthermore, the applicant does not appear to have actually paid any part of that sum (see paragraph 17 above), nor has it been claimed that A.K. has attempted to obtain such a payment. Moreover, seeing that, as noted above, the case did not concern a complaint by the applicant to an authority competent to deal with it, it cannot be said that the finding of the applicant civilly liable risked having the effect of stifling potential future complaints (contrast Sapundzhiev, cited above, \u00a7 49).",
