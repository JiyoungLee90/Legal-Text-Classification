However, the only remedies to be exhausted are those which are effective. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time (see, inter alia, Vernillo v. France, judgment of 20\u00a0February 1991, Series A no. 198, pp.\u00a011\u201312, \u00a7\u00a027, and Dalia v.

Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement (see Dankevich v. Ukraine, no. 40679/98, \u00a7 107, 29 April 2003).",

In addition, even if this board had instituted proceedings in response to the applicant's complaint, they would have taken place exclusively between the board itself and the judge/court concerned. The applicant would not have been a party to such proceedings and would, at best, have only been informed of their outcome (see, mutatis mutandis, Horvat v.
