Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State\u2019s interest. The mere fact that the applicant is in a sector or department which participates in the exercise of power conferred by public law is not in itself decisive. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, to use the words of the Court in the Pellegrin judgment, a \u2018special bond of trust and loyalty\u2019 between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond. Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, first, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, second, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified.\u201d (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v.  [GC], no. 63235/00, 19 April 2007, \u00a7 62)",

He made use of his right and introduced an action against his employer. The Military Court of the Ryazan Garrison examined the applicant\u2019s claims and accepted them, awarding the applicant a daily allowance for his service abroad. After the final judgment of 14 April 2003 had been quashed by way of supervisory review, the applicant\u2019s claims were once again re-examined and dismissed.
