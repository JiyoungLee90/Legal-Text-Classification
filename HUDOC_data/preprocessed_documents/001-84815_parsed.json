Furthermore, it ought also to protect the authorities and other persons concerned from being in an uncertain situation for a prolonged period of time (see Kenar v. Turkey (dec.), no. 67215/01, 1\u00a0December 2005). The Court further recalls that under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention it may only deal with a matter within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken in domestic proceedings. However, special considerations could apply in exceptional cases where an applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the circumstances which make that remedy ineffective. In such a situation, the six-month period might be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware, or should have become aware, of these circumstances (see Hazar and others v.\u00a0Turkey, (dec.) no. 62566/00, 10 January 2002).",
