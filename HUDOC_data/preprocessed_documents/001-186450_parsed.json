The Government further argued that the Zagreb County Court had correctly held that there was no reason for the applicant to attend the session of the appeal panel as he had been heard during the trial and had been granted the opportunity to participate effectively in the proceedings before the first-instance court. The Government also contended that the applicant\u2019s appeal was clear and lacked any allegations that would warrant his presence at the appeal session. Furthermore, since the prosecution had not appealed against the first-instance judgment and had not been summoned to the session of the appeal panel, the Government deemed that the applicant had not been placed in a disadvantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis the prosecution.

As to the proceedings instituted by the applicant before the national authorities, the Court agrees that, as they were in part aimed at remedying the violation of the Convention alleged before the Court, the domestic legal costs may be taken into account in assessing the claim for costs (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7 284, ECHR\u00a02006V). Regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant the sum of EUR 675 for costs and expenses in the proceedings before the national authorities, plus any tax that may be chargeable to him on that amount. As to the Convention proceedings, making its assessment on an equitable basis and in the light of its practice in comparable cases, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant, who was represented by counsel, the sum of EUR 1,350 plus any tax that may be chargeable to him on that amount.",
