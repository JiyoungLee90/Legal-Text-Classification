He had made use of the available remedy for that issue, which was a complaint under Article 422 of the CCP (see paragraphs 10-12 and 17\u00a0above). The Court does not see how the initiation of custody proceedings or an application for the restoration of the applicant\u2019s parental rights could have remedied the alleged unfairness of the initial default proceedings.

The two court decisions which are at issue allowed the applicant\u2019s daughter to be issued with an international passport and to leave Georgia without her father\u2019s consent. The Court notes that the applicant challenged the validity of those decisions. It doubts, however, that the applicant\u2019s use of that avenue of redress after a delay of more than three years could have helped him reach his objective of seeking to re-establish contact with his daughter and/or having her returned to Georgia. As pointed out by the Government, the domestic courts could, at best, have quashed the impugned decisions. This measure, however, could not have effectively remedied the applicant\u2019s underlying complaint as his daughter would still have been inaccessible on account of her being abroad. Rather than engaging in purely procedural proceedings complaining about the alleged unfairness of the initial default decisions, the applicant should have applied directly to the Georgian courts for the restoration of his parental rights under Article 1209 of the Civil Code (see paragraph\u00a014 above). The initiation of custody proceedings was also an option for him to regain access to his daughter by requesting contact or visiting rights.",

However, the general concept of a fair trial, encompassing the fundamental principle that proceedings should be adversarial (see Ruiz-Mateos v.

(see paragraph 18 above). The Court notes in this connection the particularly sensitive nature of the issues at stake in the impugned proceedings, namely the possible restriction of the applicant\u2019s parental rights. The domestic courts should therefore have acted with the utmost diligence (see, mutatis mutandis, in relation to the \u201cparental participation\u201d requirement Glaser v. the United Kingdom, no. 32346/96, \u00a7\u00a070, 19\u00a0September 2000; see also, mutatis mutandis, in relation to the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, Veljkov v.\u00a0Serbia, no. 23087/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a085 and\u00a087, 19 April 2011), which they clearly failed to do. The negligent attitude of the Tbilisi City Court was particularly evident during the second set of default proceedings, when the court simply sent the summons to the address which had already been established as being invalid as a result of the first set of proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Miholapa v. Latvia, no.\u00a061655/00, \u00a7 28, 31 May 2007). Then it opted for public notification, knowing in advance that that approach would be useless if it was confirmed that the applicant was abroad (compare with Weber (dec.), cited above, where the applicant was aware of the initiation of the civil proceedings against him and, hence, of the risk of being issued with a default judgment).",

However, the Court is not convinced that the importance of expeditious proceedings which generally attaches to family proceedings necessitated a procedural shortcut to default proceedings and the circumvention of the rules on summonses (see, mutatis mutandis, P., C. and S. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a056547/00, \u00a7\u00a7 98-99, ECHR 2002VI). It was not argued before the domestic courts that the departure of L.G. was urgently required for a particular reason. Although the case file had information concerning her medical condition, the domestic courts did not make an assessment of that information. Furthermore, the unlimited restriction of the parental rights concerned (see paragraph 8 above) was made without any attempt on the part of the domestic courts to balance the possible competing interests of the father and the daughter.",

However, as noted above, that procedure cannot be used to the detriment of other procedural guarantees, notably the principle of equality of arms (see paragraph 34 above). According to the Georgian legislation in force at the material time the possibility of serving summonses by publishing them should have been used with due diligence and as a measure of last resort (see Articles\u00a071 \u00a7 3 and 78 \u00a7 1 of the CCP; see also, in this regard, Miholapa, cited above, \u00a7 29).

Firstly, in family matters, a court may on certain occasions act of its own motion or upon a motion brought by a State organ. This branch of the law allows exceptions to the principle nemo iudex sine actore. Secondly, the judge is not bound by the principle ne eat iudex ultra petita partium. Thirdly, the parties cannot dispose freely of their family-law claims. The courts, acting of their own motion, have to take into account the best interests of the child. Fourthly, the judge has to adjudicate on the basis of the factual circumstances existing at the time of the decision. He has to take into account the dynamics of family relations and establish the latest developments. Fifthly, the proceedings have to be conducted speedily as delays may cause detrimental effects to the child. The urgency of the situation may justify a departure from certain procedural principles. Sixthly, the court may often issue temporary orders with the purpose of determining urgent questions for a limited period. Such temporary orders may be particularly justified if there are difficulties in establishing the whereabouts of a parent. Seventhly, the principle of res iudicata has a limited practical meaning because judicial decisions pertaining to the child can be changed at any time depending upon the changing circumstances. It is interesting to note in this respect that the German Federal Constitutional Court stated as follows in its order of 5 April 2005, 1 BvR 1664/04, concerning a constitutional complaint against a custody decision of the Naumburg Higher Regional Court in the case of G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc:",

The national legislation may impose such an obligation for the purpose of ensuring the speediness of proceedings concerning the children in such situations.",
