The Court further considers that the findings of the medical reports match at least this applicant\u2019s allegation of having been beaten. In the circumstances of the present case, and considering the absence of a plausible explanation from the Government as to the cause of the injuries sustained by this applicant, the Court finds that these injuries were the result of ill-treatment for which the Government bore responsibility. It follows that there has been a substantive violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the inhuman and degrading treatment to which Mr Akg\u00fcl was subjected.",

When the applicants were brought to the  for a medical control, they were taken to the examination room with other accused persons, and the gendarme officers did not leave the room during the examination. The Court notes that the CPT has underlined the importance of proper medical examinations as an essential safeguard against ill-treatment of persons in custody. Such examinations must be carried out by a properly qualified doctor, without any police officer being present (see paragraph 26 above). In the present case, the Court notes that according to the domestic legislation, the gendarme officers had to stay in the examination room as the applicants were in custody in relation to a terrorism-related crime (see paragraph 18 above). Nevertheless, the cursory and collective nature of the examinations, such as in the present case, undermines their effectiveness and reliability (see, Akko\u00e7 v. , nos. 22947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000X.; Elci and Others v. , nos. 23145/93 and 25091/94, \u00a7 642, 13\u00a0November 2003).",

The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure \u201cequality of arms\u201d between the parties, the prosecutor and the detained person. The first fundamental guarantee which flows naturally from Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention is the right to an effective hearing by the judge examining an appeal against detention (see Svipsta v. Latvia, no. 66820/01, \u00a7 129, ECHR 2006III (extracts)), which the detainee should be able to exercise at regular intervals (Knebl v. the , no. 20157/05, \u00a7 85, 28 October 2010).",

                                "content": "52.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that in the Turkish system (Article 108 of the Criminal Procedure Code) the question of prolonging detention is examined ex proprio motu at regular intervals (every month during the pre-trial stage and at each hearing on the merits or more frequently at the trial stage). Furthermore, the detainee may lodge a request for release at any time during both the pre-trial stage and the trial stage and repeat that request without having to wait for any particular period. In addition, against every decision concerning detention on remand, whether taken at the detainee\u2019s request or ex proprio motu, an objection can be lodged (see Alt\u0131nok v. Turkey, no. 31610/08, \u00a7 53, 29 November 2011). The Court accepts that in such a system, the requirement to hold a hearing each time an objection is lodged could lead to a certain paralysis of the criminal proceedings (see Knebl, cited above, \u00a7 85). In the light of these considerations and taking into account the specific nature of the proceedings under Article 5 \u00a7 4, in particular the requirement of speed, the Court considers that it is not necessary for a hearing to be held in respect of each objection, unless there are exceptional circumstances (see Alt\u0131nok, cited above, \u00a7 54); in that respect, it recalls that domestic courts dealing with requests of release during pre-trial detention must provide the \u201cguarantees of a judicial procedure\u201d, so that the proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties \u2013 the prosecutor and the detainee (see, Karatay and Others v. Turkey, no. 11468/02, \u00a7 47, 15\u00a0February 2007).",

The first and third applicants did not have a right to appear before a court for more than four months, namely between 22 July and 30 November 2005, while the second applicant did not have a right to appear for more than two months. The Court observes in this connection that although they filed objections against their detention on remand on several occasions, pursuant to Article 271 of the Criminal Procedure Code their objections were decided by the court without holding a hearing (see paragraph\u00a027 above). The Court therefore considers that the fact that the applicants did not have a right to appear before a court during the pre-trial stage, after their detention was initially ordered by the investigating judge, is not compatible with the requirement to hold a hearing at regular intervals, as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4.",
