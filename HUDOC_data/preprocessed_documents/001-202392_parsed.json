He had not been aware of the need to inform the gas company, and had not been aware of any issues with the water heater. In 2005 a woman had been renting his apartment.

According to the prosecutor\u2019s report, even though the expert had been unable to establish whether the water heater had been installed in violation of the safety rules, it had been established that it had been altogether prohibited to have such water heaters installed in an eight-storey building. On 1\u00a0June 2007 the gas company technicians had discovered the violation of the safety rule in question, disconnected the water heater from the gas pipe, and given instructions to the applicant\u2019s mother. Nevertheless, given that the water heater had been functioning in the apartment on 30\u00a0April 2008, G.K. must have carelessly reconnected it, and it was the inhabitants of residential buildings who were responsible for ensuring the safe use of household gas equipment. The prosecutor took note of the expert\u2019s finding that G.K. could have avoided the fatal accident by opening the window (see paragraph 13 above), and G.G.\u2019s statement that the small upper window had indeed been open (see paragraph 14 above). The prosecutor further noted the expert\u2019s statement that, in certain cases, damp in an apartment might aggravate the situation, despite there being an open window or door (see paragraph 22 above). She also pointed to the statement of R.G., the owner of the apartment in question, confirming that it had been damp in the apartment, which had led him to carry out several renovation projects (see paragraph 23 above). Based on the above information, the prosecutor concluded that G.K.\u2019s death had been an accident, caused by reconnecting the water heater to the gas supply despite the gas technicians\u2019 warning, involving no element of a crime.",

Considering that a small upper window had been open in the apartment at the material time, the applicant submitted that her son could not have avoided the accident. She further submitted that while the prosecutor had noted that it had been completely prohibited to have a water heater installed in an eight-storey building, the gas company technicians had not indicated that in the relevant inspection record. Furthermore, the owner of the apartment who had installed the water heater had been at fault for not complying with the relevant regulations requiring him to ensure that such an installation be in compliance with technical requirements and be performed by the gas company rather than some private contractor. She further noted that the water heater had been installed two years before they had started to rent the apartment. Therefore, the investigation needed to determine whether the owner of the apartment had been warned by any authority about the faulty installation.

Furthermore, the law had failed to specify a clear course of action which the gas company and consumers had been obliged to follow upon discovering the defective installation of a gas-operated device in a residential building. Additionally, the law, as it had stood at the material time, had not provided for regular safety checks or an obligation to follow up on the discovery of a faulty installation of a gas-operated device. Nor had the relevant legislative acts adequately addressed the matter of the safety instructions to be given to individuals on the safety standards to be followed, either generally or following the discovery of a faulty installation, as in the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s case. In such circumstances, placing the responsibility to comply with safety standards when using gas-operated household devices solely or primarily with consumers had been unjustified. The applicant further underlined that there was no designated official authority responsible for overseeing the activities of the gas company and its compliance with safety standards. Finally, she emphasised in particular that, considering the high annual rate of carbon monoxide poisonings, the Government had been well aware of the risk which the gas-operated household devices posed to the life and health of society, and had failed to adequately regulate the matter.",

Turkey, no. 69546/12, \u00a7\u00a050, 4 October 2016, with further references). In the latter circumstances, the positive obligation covers a wide range of sectors (see Ciecho\u0144ska v.

In the particular context of dangerous activities special emphasis must be placed on regulations geared to the special features of the activity in question, particularly with regard to the level of the potential risk to human lives. They must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity, and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a071 and \u00a7\u00a090). Among these preventive measures particular emphasis should be placed on the public\u2019s right to information, as established in the case-law of the Convention institutions. The relevant regulations must also provide for appropriate procedures for identifying shortcomings in the processes concerned and any errors committed by those responsible at different levels, taking into account the technical aspects of the activity in question (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 89-90, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0132). As to the choice of particular practical measures, the Court has consistently held that where the State is required to take positive measures, the choice of means is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State\u2019s margin of appreciation. There are different avenues to ensure Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 134).",

Furthermore, the domestic legislation does not appear to have required, at least at the material time, that a written warning be given to a resident of an apartment when a violation of a safety rule was found.

The applicant does not deny this fact but asserts that the gas company should have followed up on their first visit.
