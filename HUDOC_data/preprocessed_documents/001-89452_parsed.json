In this connection, the Court reiterates that the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time is incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Nakhmanovich, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-71, and Sta\u0161aitis v.

The first judicial ruling to that effect was adopted two years and three months after his arrest. However, Article 5 \u00a7 3 requires that after a certain lapse of time the persistence of reasonable suspicion does not in itself justify deprivation of liberty and the judicial authorities should give other grounds for continued detention (see Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v.
