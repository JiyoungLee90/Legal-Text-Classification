The Court notes in this connection that the permits granted to the City of Stockholm were granted for five years in the case of the Sporrong Estate - with an extension for three, then for five and finally for ten years - and for ten years in the case of Mrs. L\u00f6nnroth. In the events that happened, they remained in force for twenty-three years and eight years respectively. During the whole of this period, the applicants were left in complete uncertainty as to the fate of their properties and were not entitled to have any difficulties which they might have encountered taken into account by the Swedish Government. The Commission\u2019s report furnishes an example of such difficulties. Mrs. L\u00f6nnroth had requested the Government to withdraw the expropriation permit. The City Council replied that the existing plans did not authorise any derogation; the Government, for their part, refused the request on the ground that they could not revoke the permit without the Council\u2019s express consent (see paragraph 21 above).",

Where the use of the properties is still possible although restricted, this provision remains applicable, even if the intention behind the measures is the eventual deprivation of ownership. This is confirmed in the present case by the fact that deprivation in reality never took place. The use of the property by the owner was never terminated by State action.

Thus, the only issue on which the applicants challenged the lawfulness of the measures taken in the present case was with regard to the duration of the expropriation permits. In my opinion, the determination of the procedural or factual matter of duration does not amount to a determination of civil rights; the mere fixing of time-limits for expropriation permits is in no way decisive for such rights. This is enough to exclude the application of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) without going further into the question of the existence of a \"contestation\" (dispute).",

The Commission stated (paragraph 107 of the report) that the initial determination of these time-limits was apparently a matter within the discretion of the Government, and that it was a natural interpretation of the said Act that the Government had also the competence to prolong their original decisions regarding such permits. Therefore, the Commission considered as lawful both the time-limits of five and ten years fixed by the Government in their decisions of 31 July 1956 and 24 September 1971, as well as the three prolongations of the expropriation permits in the case of the Sporrong Estate (see also the joint dissenting opinion of certain of my colleagues and myself with regard to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1) (P1-1).",

If a legitimate objective, namely the planning of the city of , necessarily affects the values of some of the properties in that city which are affected by the planning that is but a natural incident of owning property in an area subject to planning. But it is very far removed from anything in the nature of confiscation. If and when the property is acquired compensation will be paid for what is being acquired. Justice does not require that compensation must be paid for profits which might have been gained if there was no development of the area. The \"public interest\" in the correct sense necessarily implies a just public interest. If the public interest in question is a just and legitimate interest then the necessary diminution of the private interest required to sustain that public interest cannot in itself be unjust.",

The reality of the situation is that once it is apparent that the future planning of the city of  will take a certain shape the sale value of any property likely to be affected by planning intentions or proposals will be influenced thereby. Therefore the issue of the permit cannot be treated as an act of expropriation or as an act equivalent to expropriation. At the most it is an intimation of possible or even probable future events. It is the possibilities, or probabilities, of such events which influence the market - not the intimation of them. The Government permit in itself does not create any plan. In many countries local authorities often publish their development plans many years in advance of any step being taken to acquire any property even though it may be quite clear from the development plans that some property or properties will have to be acquired in whole or in part to carry out the proposed plan.",

Until expropriation actually takes place the applicants are free to deal with their property though admittedly in a market inhibited by the prospect of the probable future expropriation. However, this is normal in most areas of prospective planning. There is no evidence to indicate that the ultimate value of the compensation will be any smaller or less valuable relatively than the compensation which would have been payable if the expropriation had taken place soon after the issue of the permit by the Government. Any fall in value attributable to the existence of a city development plan should be the same in either event. It is an element not ordinarily affected by the effluxion of time. Unless the applicants are entitled to compensation for the very existence of a development plan they cannot claim to be victims of a breach of the first paragraph of Article 1 of the Protocol (P1-1).

The restrictions in the present cases are limited to the exigencies of the planning and there has been no evidence of any arbitrary restrictions.
