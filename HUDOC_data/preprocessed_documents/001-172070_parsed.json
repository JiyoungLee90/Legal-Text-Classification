Several high-ranking law-enforcement officials had been staying at the hotel at the time and for this reason, in addition to its own security guards, the hotel had been provided with a reinforced 24-hour police security unit (see paragraphs 21, 27 and 28 above). The entire police unit had been ordered to leave the hotel shortly before the arrival of the perpetrators and taken for the night to the premises of the Ministry of the Interior, leaving none of their officers to ensure security of the hotel, even though at least two Deputy Ministers of the Interior were in their rooms (see paragraphs 31 and 36-38 above).

Their vehicle had been able to drive around freely in spite of the missing number plates and the checkpoints on the roads. It had driven through welllit streets with unobscured windows, carrying men wearing balaclavas and camouflage uniforms and armed with machine guns.

This failure to obtain critical evidence, combined with the repeatedly criticised lack of willingness to investigate on the part of the police (see, for example, paragraphs 71-72 and 73 above) show that the investigation into the applicants\u2019 abduction and illtreatment cannot be said to have been effective as required by Article\u00a03 of the Convention.",
