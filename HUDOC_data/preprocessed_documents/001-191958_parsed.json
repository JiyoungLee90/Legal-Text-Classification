The Court notes the absence of any significant change in the way the applicant appeared before the trial and appellate courts for as long as the proceedings lasted \u2013 on each occasion he found himself behind metal bars. The Court concludes, therefore, that regardless of an almost five-month time gap between the end of the applicant\u2019s trial on 19\u00a0March 2012 and the examination of his case on appeal on 10\u00a0August 2012, his confinement in a metal cage created a \u201ccontinuous situation\u201d for the purpose of calculating the six-month time-limit set forth in Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention.

The practice of placing defendants in metal cages in the courtroom was an ordinary security measure applied to all defendants detained on remand. Introduced over twenty years ago, it was perceived as customary by the parties to the criminal proceedings and third parties alike and a priori was not aimed at humiliating those to whom it was applied. The \u201cfeelings of humiliation, inferiority, shame and helplessness\u201d allegedly suffered by the applicant resulted not from his placement in a metal cage, but rather from a natural reaction to the negative consequences of his unlawful actions. There were no grounds for believing that the parties to the proceedings and third parties had had a biased or hostile attitude towards the applicant on account of his confinement in a metal cage. In any event, the case had not been of any heightened public or media interest. Furthermore, placement in a metal cage served the purpose of protecting a person from any possible attack by victims while at the same time allowing him or her to choose a comfortable posture and move behind the barriers freely. The Government further argued that the applicant\u2019s confinement behind a metal partition in the remand prison during his participation in the hearing of his case on appeal via a video link could not have caused him any negative feelings since, in any event, the remand prison was a place of social isolation where detainees spent most of their time on premises equipped with various safety facilities. The Government concluded, therefore, that there had been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the present case. They made no submissions on the merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 13 of the Convention.",

He had had no criminal record, had been charged with non-violent crimes and had demonstrated orderly behaviour throughout the proceedings. His placement in the cage could not therefore have been justified. Furthermore, the proceedings had been followed by several journalists and several television channels had released news reports on the trial. For example, the \u201cKZN\u201d television channel had released a news report entitled \u201cSentence to Drug Dealers\u201d showing him in a metal cage. This report had been viewed by several thousands of people even before the conviction had become final. Showing him in a cage had created an image of an extremely dangerous criminal, which had caused him feelings of shame and helplessness. The applicant further submitted that, contrary to the Government\u2019s assertions, he had not been free to choose a comfortable position or move around the cage: he could not stand up or have any exchange with other participants of the proceedings unless authorised by the presiding judge. Besides, as could be seen from the photographs provided by the Government, the cage had been very limited in size, which had made it impossible to get into a comfortable position. Lastly, the applicant submitted that his confinement behind a metal barrier in the remand prison for his participation via a video link in the examination of his case on appeal had not been warranted by any security risks or courtroom order issues. The applicant further maintained his complaint under Article 13 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article\u00a03 of the Convention.",
