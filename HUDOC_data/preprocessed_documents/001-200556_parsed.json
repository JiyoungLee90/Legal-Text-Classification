A person who is deprived of his liberty, or, more generally, is confronted with lawenforcement officers, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is, in principle, an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7 88, with further references).",

In addition, the Court only briefly describes the context, which it should have considered more deeply: \u201cthe sensitive nature of the situation related to Roma in Slovakia at the relevant time\u201d (see paragraph 87 of the judgment). The applicant provided evidence to support his claim that this context encompassed systemic police bias, as did the European Roma Rights Centre in third party observations subsequently adopted by the applicant (compare Talpis v.
