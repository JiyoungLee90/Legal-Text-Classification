Thus, the States which, like Croatia, opted for a remedy designed both to expedite proceedings and afford compensation is free to award amounts which \u2013 while being lower than those awarded by the Court \u2013 are not unreasonable (see Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a093 and 96-97). This is so not only because such a remedy is closer and more accessible to an applicant than an application to the Court, but also because it is faster and is processed in the applicant's own language. It thus offers advantages that need to be taken into consideration (see Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], cited above, \u00a7 139).",
