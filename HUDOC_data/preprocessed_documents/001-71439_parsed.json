There were, moreover, sound reasons why Mrs Tuquabo-Tekle had been unable to bring her daughter to  or the  prior to September 1997. At the time when she had been granted leave to remain in Norway and permission to be joined by her children, contacts with Eritrea were impossible and it was for this reason that only Adhanom, who had been in Ethiopia at the time, was able to go to Norway. In September 1992 Mrs\u00a0Tuquabo-Tekle had travelled to Eritrea but it had not proved possible to obtain travel documents for Mehret, as there were not yet any official bodies equipped to issue passports in Eritrea and the authorities in Ethiopia refused to do so for Eritrean citizens. The family\u2019s housing situation in the  had posed a further problem: despite the fact that they had been placed on a waiting list and had been issued with a certificate of urgency (urgentieverklaring), no rental accommodation suitable for a family of two adults and four children was available.

Furthermore, the couple had not sufficiently shown why, in view of Mehret\u2019s age, she could not remain in the care of her uncle or her grandmother, if necessary supported financially by her family from the Netherlands. The Minister did not find it established that serious attempts had been made to arrange for Mehret to come to the  as soon as possible: Mrs Tuquabo-Tekle had been legally resident in the  since July 1993 but the request for Mehret to be allowed to join her had not been lodged until September 1997. Contrary to what the applicants appeared to contend, under the applicable legal provisions a lack of adequate accommodation would not have stood in the way of a provisional residence visa being granted. It appeared that Mrs Tuquabo-Tekle and her husband had let the inexpediency of Mehret\u2019s presence in their cramped accommodation prevail over the desire to reunite Mehret with her mother as soon as possible.

In its assessment, the Court will have regard to the age of the children concerned, their situation in their country of origin and the extent to which they are dependent on their parents. In this context it is to be borne in mind that the present case concerns not only immigration but also family life and that it involves an alien \u2013 Mrs\u00a0Tuquabo-Tekle \u2013 who already had a family which she had left behind in another country until she had achieved settled status in her respective host countries, that is Norway and the Netherlands (contrast Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, p. 34, \u00a7 68).",

However, the Court has previously held that parents who leave children behind while they settle abroad cannot be assumed to have irrevocably decided that those children are to remain in the country of origin permanently and to have abandoned any idea of a future family reunion (see \u015een v. the , no. 31465/96, \u00a7 40, 21 December 2001). Indeed, it appears clearly from the facts of the present case that Mrs Tuquabo-Tekle always intended for Mehret to join her. Thus, as soon as she had been granted leave to remain in , she took steps in order to be reunited with her children. Having obtained the Norwegian authorities\u2019 permission, she managed to be reunited with her son Adhanom but did not succeed in bringing Mehret to  at that time, owing to circumstances beyond her control (see paragraph 9 above).",

That case also concerned parents with settled immigrant status in the  who chose to leave a daughter (Sinem) behind in the care of relatives in her country of origin () for a number of years before they applied to be reunited with her. At this juncture the Court would remark that it is questionable to what extent it can be maintained in the present case, as the Government did, that Mrs Tuquabo-Tekle left Mehret behind of \u201cher own free will\u201d, bearing in mind that she fled Eritrea in the course of a civil war to seek asylum abroad following the death of her husband. Be that as it may, it is in any event the case that Mrs Tuquabo-Tekle and her husband, just like Mr and Mrs \u015een, have been lawfully residing in the Netherlands for a number of years, even opting for, and obtaining, Netherlands nationality. In addition, and also just as in the \u015een case, two children have been born to the couple in the : Tmnit in 1994 and Ablel in 1995. These two children have always lived in the  and its cultural and linguistic environment, have  nationality and attend school there. Consequently, they can only have minimal ties, if any, to their parents\u2019 country of origin (see \u015een, cited above, \u00a7 40).",

The Court added that this was all the more so as, in view of Sinem\u2019s young age, her integration into her parents\u2019 close family unit was particularly exigent (ibid., \u00a7 40). It is in this latter context that the two cases are different: whereas Sinem \u015een was 9 years old when her parents sought to be reunited with her (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 13), Mehret was already 15 when her mother and stepfather applied for a provisional residence visa on her behalf (see paragraph 11 above).
