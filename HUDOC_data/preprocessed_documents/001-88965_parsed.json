The applicant had mentioned in his article that the authorities had refused to initiate criminal proceedings and had criticised them for that. The purpose of the article had been to denounce the authorities\u2019 failure to investigate the allegations of police brutality. The applicant maintained that there existed a sufficient factual basis for his statement. Although he had failed to prove in court that his description of the events at the police station had been true in all its particulars, he was still under the protection of Article 10 of the Convention. Even harsh criticism in strong, polemical language published \u201con a slim factual basis\u201d was protected under Article 10 (see Dichand and Others v. , no.\u00a029271/95, \u00a7\u00a052, 26 February 2002).",

In cases where a journalist had defamed a public official unintentionally, only rectification and pecuniary damages should be available to the plaintiff. The applicant further argued that a journalist could not be required to prove the veracity of his every allegation according to the \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d standard applied in criminal law. A journalist who published an article about police brutality might not be reasonably required to act as a prosecutor and collect the evidence of guilt in a criminal case.

In assessing whether such a \u201cneed\u201d exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This margin of appreciation is not however unlimited, but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. The Court\u2019s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among many others, Krasulya v. , no.\u00a012365/03, \u00a7\u00a034, 22\u00a0February 2007, and Grinberg v. , no.\u00a023472/03, \u00a7\u00a027, 21 July 2005).",

He was found civilly liable for his publication, therefore the impugned interference must be seen in the context of the essential role of the press in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society (see Lingens v. Austria, judgment of 8\u00a0July 1986, Series A no. 103, \u00a7\u00a041, and S\u00fcrek (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7\u00a059). The allegations of police brutality were obviously a matter of great public concern and the applicant was entitled to bring them to the public\u2019s attention through the press. However, there is no evidence in the domestic judgments that the courts performed a balancing exercise between the need to protect the policemen\u2019s reputation and journalists\u2019 right to divulge information on issues of general interest. They confined their analysis to the discussion of the damage to the plaintiff\u2019s reputation without giving any consideration to the applicant\u2019s journalistic freedom or to the fact that the plaintiff was a civil servant acting in an official capacity and was accordingly subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals (see case-law cited in paragraph 26 above). The Court therefore considers that the Russian courts failed to recognise that the present case involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and the protection of reputation (see, for similar reasoning, Kwiecie\u0144 v. , no.\u00a051744/99, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR 2007...).",

Parts of the interview were found to have been defamatory by the domestic courts. In so finding, the Russian courts failed to distinguish between the author\u2019s own speech and his quotation of others, treating as irrelevant the fact that the impugned statements did not emanate from the applicant but were clearly identified as those proffered by other persons (see paragraph 13 above). The domestic courts did not advance any justification for punishment of the applicant for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview, although they were required to give particularly strong reasons for doing so (see case-law cited in paragraph 29 above).",

The Court accepts that the article contained serious factual allegations against the police and that those allegations were susceptible of proof. However, the Court considers that in the context of the balancing exercise\u00a0under Article 10, in particular where the reporting\u00a0by a journalist of statements made by third parties is concerned, the relevant test is\u00a0not whether the journalist can prove the veracity of the statements but whether a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis proportionate to the nature and degree of the allegation can be established (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, \u00a7 78). In that respect, it notes that the applicant submitted documentary evidence, including a dictaphone recording of his conversation with Mr S. and Mr M., the medical report noting Mr S.\u2019s injuries, the records of the confessions made by Mr S. and Mr\u00a0M. at the police station and copies of their complaints of ill-treatment. He also called Mr S. and Mr M. to the witness stand to confirm that the article reproduced their statements accurately without distorting or exaggerating them. The evidence produced by the applicant showed that Mr\u00a0M. and Mr S. had been indeed questioned by the police officers of the Leninskiy District police station and confessed to the theft, that they had sustained injuries while in police custody, and had complained to the domestic authorities that they had been ill-treated. It also demonstrated that despite their confessions Mr M. and Mr S. had never been charged and that another person had ultimately been convicted of the theft.",

It transpires from the Government\u2019s submissions that the courts attached such preponderant weight to the findings of the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry into Mr\u00a0S.\u2019s and Mr M.\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment and the refusal to initiate criminal proceedings against the policemen that no evidence produced by the applicant could have convinced them of the veracity of the statements published by him. The Court recalls in this respect that the standard of proof for establishing the well-foundedness of a criminal charge by a competent authority can hardly be compared to that which ought to be observed by a journalist when expressing his opinion on a matter of public concern (see Karman v. , no.\u00a029372/02, \u00a7\u00a042, 14 December 2006, and Unabh\u00e4ngige Initiative Informationsvielfalt v.\u00a0, no.\u00a028525/95, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2002I). The Court is therefore not satisfied that the Russian courts gave relevant and sufficient reasons for dismissing the evidence produced by the applicant or based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of relevant facts. In the Court\u2019s view, the body of evidence available provided sufficient factual basis for the allegation of police brutality. The Court is also unable to accept the Government\u2019s argument that it was not permissible for the applicant to publish the allegations of ill-treatment after the authorities had refused to initiate criminal proceedings against the police officers. The applicant mentioned in his article that the prosecutor\u2019s office had refused to open an investigation into the claims of ill-treatment made by Mr\u00a0S. and Mr M. He criticised the authorities for their passive attitude to the credible allegations of mistreatment of criminal suspects, thereby expressing his opinion on a matter of public concern.",

The Court is therefore convinced that the applicant recounted the facts faithfully without distorting them. Although it is true that the applicant did not publish the interview in its entirety, omitting some parts and laying emphasis on the others with the aim of intensifying the emotional impact of the publication, there is no indication that he went beyond the generally acceptable degree of exaggeration or provocation (see the case-law cited in paragraph 27 above).",

The judgments in the defamation action against the applicant gave rise to a breach of his right to freedom of expression since, by omitting to perform a balancing exercise between the need to protect the plaintiff\u2019s reputation and the applicant\u2019s right to divulge information on issues of general interests, by refusing to distinguish between the applicant\u2019s own speech and his quotation of statements made by others during an interview, and by failing to make an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts, the Russian courts did not apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and did not adduce \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d reasons justifying the interference at issue.
