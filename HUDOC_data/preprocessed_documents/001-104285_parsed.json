In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention (see Sheydayev v. Russia, no. 65859/01, \u00a7 59, 7 December 2006; Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 336; and Krastanov v. Bulgaria, no. 50222/99, \u00a7 53, 30 September 2004). At the same time, the Court is also mindful of the potential for violence that exists in penitentiary institutions and of the fact that disobedience by detainees may quickly degenerate into a riot (see G\u00f6mi and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a035962/97, \u00a7 77, 21 December 2006). The Court has previously accepted that the use of force may be necessary to ensure prison security, to maintain order or prevent crime in penitentiary facilities. Nevertheless, as noted above, such force may be used only if indispensable and must not be excessive (see Ivan Vasilev v. , no. 48130/99, \u00a7 63, 12 April 2007).",
