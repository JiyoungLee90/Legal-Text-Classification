The Court accepts that personal service might have hampered the expeditious assessment of the case in the proceedings currently under examination, in the light of the number of participants in those proceedings (see paragraph 12 above). However, it must be satisfied that the manner in which this limitation of the right of access to a court was applied in the present case struck a fair balance between the various interests at stake and did not render the applicants\u2019 rights illusory (see Artico v.

However, in assessing its reasonableness, regard must be had to the applicants\u2019 specific situation. In this connection, the Court observes that the first applicant (representative of all the applicants) lived more than 100\u00a0km away from the county court which delivered the judgment. Even considering that he would have had access to the court documents at the county court situated in his home town, as argued by the Government (see paragraph\u00a031 in fine, above), the Court reiterates that the first applicant was elderly at that time (see paragraph 4 above, as well as Zavodnik, cited above, \u00a7 79 in fine). In these specific circumstances, the Court considers that the fact that the first applicant would have to have gone to the county court regularly for a period of three months would have put a significant burden on him.",
