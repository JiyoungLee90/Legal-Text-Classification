The report is a comprehensive study of the national legislation regarding the heating standing charge and contains several conclusions and recommendations. The report finds, inter alia, that the 2012 Regulations dealt with disconnected units collectively rather than individually, given that the standing charge applied to all such units irrespective of whether they were heated more efficiently than units connected to the district heating network. In that connection, the report suggests that the new regulations should allow units heated more efficiently  an issue to be determined in appropriate proceedings before an independent commission  to discontinue the service provided through the district heating system. It also points to the possibility of a full or partial exemption from the obligation to pay the standing charge in other situations, such as if an unit has more exterior walls, good quality insulation, and so forth.",

They submitted that, in the alleged circumstances of his case (paragraph 4 above), the seventh applicant was entitled by law to bring such a claim against the supplier. To show the effectiveness of that remedy, they submitted copies of several final court judgments in cases where claimants had successfully sued a private electricity supplier for unjust enrichment regarding a standing charge, which the competent (administrative and judicial) authorities (in separate proceedings) had found to be in violation of competition law. To show that a claim for unjust enrichment would not lack any prospect of success, they submitted copies of judgments postdating the Supreme Court\u2019s legal opinion in which the same courts (paragraph 9 above) had held that claimants in similar circumstances to the seventh applicant were not required to pay the standing charge to the heat supplier (for period covered by the 2012 Regulations).",

Firstly, the Constitutional Court established the principle that users disconnected from the district network were \u201cindirect consumers\u201d of heat provided through that network to other units in the building. According to that court, \u201c[since they] objectively use certain heat ... [they] are required ... to pay for a service which ... they receive\u201d (see paragraph 17 above). Subsequent to that decision, the courts of general jurisdiction applied the same approach and dismissed the applicants\u2019 arguments against the private heat suppliers. In so doing, they referred to the fact that there were units in the applicants\u2019 buildings that were connected to and used the heat provided by the district network (\u201cdirect consumers\u201d). In such circumstances, the courts held the applicants liable to pay the standing charge as \u201cindirect consumers\u201d for having benefited from that heat. This approach was applied to all such disconnected units. It was only in February 2018, over five years after the standing charge had become payable, that the Supreme Court limited the scope of application of that approach by excluding a particular category of units if the conditions specified in its legal opinion were met. However, as noted above (see paragraph 40 above), that opinion was not consistently applied by the competent courts.",

They did not undertake an examination of the contested issues of fact, holding that \u201call (disconnected) units in a building connected to a district heating network [were] obliged to pay the standing charge irrespective of their position or the composition or construction of the internal installation\u201d (see paragraph 9 above).
