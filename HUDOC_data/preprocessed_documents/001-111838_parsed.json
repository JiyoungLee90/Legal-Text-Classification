It further reiterates that where a State agent has been charged with crimes involving torture or ill-treatment, it is of the utmost importance that he or she should be suspended from duty during the investigation and trial, and should be dismissed if convicted (see, mutatis mutandis, Abd\u00fclsamet Yaman v. , no. 32446/96, \u00a7\u00a055, 2\u00a0November 2004; and Serdar G\u00fczel v. , no. 39414/06, \u00a7\u00a042, 15\u00a0March 2011).",

Nevertheless, although the Bursa Public Prosecutor filed an indictment with the  approximately one month after the applicant\u2019s initial complaint, the ensuing criminal proceedings against the police officers concerned lasted for a period of eight years and six months, a delay that runs contrary to the promptness required to punish those responsible. There is no indication that the police officers were suspended from duty during that period, nor did the authorities take any disciplinary action against them (see paragraph 30 above). Furthermore, at the end of the criminal proceedings, the  suspended the pronouncement of the judgment whereby it had sentenced three police officers for the torture they had inflicted upon the applicant (see paragraph 26 above). According to the Court\u2019s case-law, suspension of such sentences undeniably falls into the category of the \u201cmeasures\u201d which are unacceptable, as its effect is to render convictions ineffective (see Okkal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73-78; and Zeynep \u00d6zcan v. , no. 45906/99, \u00a7\u00a7 40-46, 20 February 2007). In this respect, the Court notes that the suspension of the pronouncement of the judgment, regulated by Article 231 of the Code on Criminal Procedure (Law no.\u00a05271), has a more far-reaching effect than the deferral of the execution of a sentence and results in the impunity of the perpetrators. That is because the former\u2019s application removes the judgment with all its legal consequences, including the sentence, provided that the offender abides by the suspension order (see paragraph 32 above), whereas in the latter, neither the sentence nor the judgment ceases to exist. The Court considers therefore that the impugned court decision suggests that the judges exercised their discretion more in order to minimise the consequences of an extremely serious unlawful act than to show that such acts could in no way be tolerated.",
