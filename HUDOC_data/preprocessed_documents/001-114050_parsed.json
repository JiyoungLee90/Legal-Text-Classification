The representative of the accused had been informed of the examination before the British court beforehand but decided not to attend.

The proven credibility of this witness was such that the participation of both accused [in J.G.\u2019s questioning] could not have affected [his statement\u2019s] evidential value ... As can be seen from the written grounds of the judgment, the court also relied on J.G.\u2019s statements obtained in the proceedings before the British courts and the final judgment of the German court, which were valid evidence because their lawfulness was not questionable as [a result of the fact that] the judgments were final.

In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 84, 16 November 2010, with further references therein). In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole, having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victim(s) that crime is properly prosecuted (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 175, ECHR\u00a02010) and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see, amongst many authorities, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, \u00a7 70, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II).

In this connection, it notes that the transfer of a convicted prisoner from one State to another entails a complex procedure requiring a number of security measures, notably when the two countries concerned are at significant distance. States cannot be considered obliged to run such a procedure in all the cases. This is especially true where, as in the present case, there is a possibility to hear the witness at stake in the country where he is held in custody. Therefore, the Court considers that there was sufficient justification for admitting J.G.\u2019s statement.",

More specifically, Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses, in the autonomous sense given to that word in the Convention system (see Asch v.\u00a0Austria, 26 April 1991, \u00a7 25, Series A no. 203).\u00a0It is accordingly not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses: he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7 29, 6 May 2003).",

In particular, where the applicant\u2019s conviction is based primarily on the assumption of his being in a particular place at a particular time, the principle of equality of arms and, more generally, the right to a fair trial, implies that the applicant should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to challenge this assumption effectively (see Popov, cited above, \u00a7 183).",
