The case originated in an application (no. 32644/96) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mrs Bruna Sanella (“the applicant”), on 6 March 1996. Before the Court the applicant was represented by Mrs G. Benedetti, a lawyer practising in Milan.
The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, and by their co-Agent, Mr F. Crisafulli.
The applicant complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention that she had been unable to recover possession of her flat within a reasonable time owing to a lack of police assistance. Invoking Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, she further complained about the length of the eviction proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr V. Zagrebelsky, the judge elected in respect of Italy, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government appointed Mr G. Raimondi as ad hoc judge to sit in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 2).
On 22 June 2000 the Court declared the application admissible.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1928 and lives in Milan.
The applicant is the owner of an apartment in Milan, which she had let to S.S.
In a registered letter of 19 June 1987, the applicant informed the tenant that she intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1987 and asked him to vacate the premises by that date.
In a writ served on the tenant on 13 October 1988, the applicant reiterated her intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Milan Magistrate.
By a decision of 3 November 1988, which was made enforceable on 10 November 1988, the Milan Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 28 September 1989.
On 22 September 1989, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises.
On 12 October 1989, she served notice on the tenant informing him that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 10 November 1989.
Between 10 November 1989 and 18 June 1996, the bailiff made twenty-six attempts to recover possession.
Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as, under the statutory provisions providing for the staggering of evictions, the applicant was not entitled to police assistance in enforcing the order for possession.
On 26 June 1996, the tenant vacated the premises.
The relevant domestic law is described in the Court's judgement in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, 28.7.99, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V.
