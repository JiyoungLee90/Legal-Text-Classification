It is noted in particular that the defendant cannot be considered to have been mentally insane before, during or after the commission of the crime ... Even though the defendant is capable of committing a similar offence in the future, it is not necessary to commit him to a regular mental hospital [krankzinnigengesticht], but instead he should be placed in a custodial clinic for psychopaths [psychopatenasiel] to undergo a rather lengthy treatment under very strict surveillance. In Cura\u00e7ao there is a choice only between prison and the national (regular) mental hospital [Landspsychiatrisch Ziekenhuis]. Taking into consideration that the risk of recidivism is for the time being very high, even if treatment could possibly start immediately, and that, consequently, intensive surveillance is of primordial importance (such surveillance being impossible in the national mental hospital), and the fact that the defendant is not to be considered criminally insane within the meaning of the law, admission to the national mental hospital is wholly contraindicated. The sole option remaining is for him to undergo his punishment in prison (transfer to a custodial clinic in the Netherlands is impossible on account of the defendant\u2019s limited intelligence and insufficient ability to express himself verbally). It is strongly advised that, where possible in the prison setting, an attempt should be made to attain a stronger personality structure in the defendant in order to avoid recidivism in the future.\u201d",

No treatment has taken place during the period of detention. It is furthermore not the case, as would be customary within the framework of treatment, that the circumstances which led him to his deed have been discussed with him so that he might subsequently have acquired an insight into how to avoid or defy such circumstances. In the case of the convicted person it would have been expected that in the course of such discussions his relationship with women and the question of dealing with rejection would have been addressed. As already mentioned, no such discussions or treatment have taken place.

On Cura\u00e7ao we have the choice only between prison and the national psychiatric hospital. Taking into consideration that for the time being the risk of recidivism is very great, even if treatment were to be commenced immediately, and that intensive surveillance is consequently of primordial importance (such surveillance being impossible in the national psychiatric hospital!), as well as the fact that the accused is not to be considered insane within the meaning of the law, admission to the national psychiatric hospital is wholly contraindicated. The sole option remaining is for the accused, should he be found guilty of the offences with which he has been charged, to undergo his sentence in prison (a transfer to, for example, a mental asylum in the Netherlands is in my opinion not possible because of the accused\u2019s limited intelligence and insufficient ability to express himself verbally). The Rapporteur strongly advises that, if possible, attempts should be made in the prison setting to attain a stronger personality structure in order to avoid recidivism in the future.\u201d",

As regards the former complaint it found that there had been no violation of Article 3. It noted the introduction in November 2011 \u2013 some twenty months after the application had been lodged \u2013 in national (that is, Cura\u00e7ao) law of a periodic-review mechanism for such sentences and considered that this mechanism met the criteria set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 66069/09 and 2 others, \u00a7\u00a7 119-22, ECHR 2013).

The introduction of the periodic-review procedure, while offering a theoretical possibility of release, was ineffective in the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case, since as long as he had not been provided with treatment, it could not lead to any conclusion other than that he was still too dangerous to be considered for a reprieve.

Moreover, seven of the nine persons on whom a life sentence had been imposed in the Netherlands Antilles since 1980 had sought a pardon and in two instances, including the applicant\u2019s case, a pardon request had been granted.

In addition, the obligatory periodic review of life sentences \u2013 which, the Government conceded, had only come into force after the application was lodged with the Court \u2013 provided for the release on parole of a life prisoner if the Joint Court of Justice was of the opinion that a continuation of the custodial sentence would no longer serve any reasonable purpose.",

As regards the applicant\u2019s complaints that he had never been placed under a regime befitting his mental condition and that his life sentence was de facto irreducible because he had not been offered adequate treatment for his personality disorder or transferred to a custodial institution in the Netherlands, the Government submitted that in 1980, when the applicant was sentenced, it had not been possible to impose a TBS order for confinement in a custodial clinic in the Netherlands Antilles. There had been no custodial clinic in either Cura\u00e7ao or Aruba and the applicant\u2019s transfer to such an institution in the Netherlands had been considered impossible in view of his limited intelligence and insufficient ability to express himself verbally. Mental-health treatment thus specifically not being part of the Joint Court of Justice\u2019s judgment, no blame could be attached to the national authorities for not executing a measure that had not been imposed. It did not appear from either the applicant\u2019s contacts with the prisons\u2019 social workers or the numerous letters he had addressed to various authorities that a lack of mental-health assistance had been his main concern. In any event, the applicant had been offered psychiatric help for his personality disorder during the time he was incarcerated in Cura\u00e7ao. In this connection the Government referred to the letter of Dr M. de O., according to which the applicant had, upon his arrival in the prison in Cura\u00e7ao, been placed under psychiatric observation and good contact of a therapeutic nature had been established with a view to his rehabilitation (see paragraph\u00a034 above). This therapeutic contact had ended when the applicant had been moved to Aruba, a transfer he had specifically requested despite being aware that the prison complex there did not comprise a Forensic Observation and Counselling Unit and that the availability of psychiatric help would be limited. The Government had not been informed of any contact between the applicant and psychiatrists or psychologists in Aruba until 2011, when the first periodic review of his life sentence had been carried out. Psychiatric help had been available to him in Aruba since the adoption of the judgment of the Joint Court of Justice of 21 September 2012.",

The Court has, however, held that the imposition of an irreducible life sentence on an adult may raise an issue under Article 3 (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 97). A life sentence does not become irreducible by the mere fact that in practice it may be served in full. No issue arises under Article\u00a03 if a life sentence is de jure and de facto reducible (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a098, and Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 108). On the basis of a detailed review of the relevant considerations emerging from its case-law and from recent comparative and international-law trends in respect of life sentences, the Court found in Vinter and Others that a life sentence can remain compatible with Article 3 of the Convention only if there is both a prospect of release and a possibility of review, both of which must exist from the imposition of the sentence (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a010418 and 122). It further observed in that case that the comparative and international-law materials before it showed clear support for the institution of a dedicated mechanism guaranteeing a review no later than twenty-five years after the imposition of a life sentence, with further periodic reviews thereafter (ibid., \u00a7 120, see also Bodein v. France, no. 40014/10, \u00a7 61, 13\u00a0November 2014). It is for the States to decide \u2013 and not for the Court to prescribe \u2013 what form (executive or judicial) that review should take (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 99, and Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 104 and\u00a0120). The Court has held that presidential clemency may thus be compatible with the requirements flowing from its case-law (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 102).",

While many of these grounds will be present at the time a life sentence is imposed, the balance between these justifications for detention is not necessarily static and might shift in the course of the execution of the sentence. It is only by carrying out a review of the justification for continued detention at an appropriate point in the sentence, that these factors or shifts can be properly evaluated (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 111). The review required in order for a life sentence to be reducible should therefore allow the domestic authorities to consider whether, in the course of the sentence, any changes in the life prisoner and progress towards his or her rehabilitation are of such significance that continued detention is no longer justified on legitimate penological grounds (ibid., \u00a7 119). This assessment must be based on rules having a sufficient degree of clarity and certainty (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 125 and 129; see also L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar v. Hungary, no. 73593/10, \u00a7\u00a057, 20 May 2014, and Harakchiev and Tolumov v. Bulgaria, nos.\u00a015018/11 and 61199/12, \u00a7\u00a7 255, 257 and 262, ECHR 2014) and the conditions laid down in domestic legislation must reflect the conditions set out in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 128). Thus, a possibility of being granted a pardon or release on compassionate grounds for reasons related to ill-health, physical incapacity or old age does not correspond to the notion of \u201cprospect of release\u201d as formulated in Kafkaris (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 127, and \u00d6calan v. Turkey (no. 2), nos. 24069/03 and 3 others, \u00a7 203, 18 March 2014). The Court held in a recent case that the assessment must be based on objective, preestablished criteria (see Trabelsi v. Belgium, no. 140/10, \u00a7 137, ECHR 2014). The prisoner\u2019s right to a review entails an actual assessment of the relevant information (see L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar, cited above, \u00a7 57), and the review must also be surrounded by sufficient procedural guarantees (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 105, and Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7 262). To the extent necessary for the prisoner to know what he or she must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, it may be required that reasons be provided, and this should be safeguarded by access to judicial review (see L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar, cited above, \u00a7 57, and Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 258 and 262). Finally, in assessing whether the life sentence is reducible de facto it may be of relevance to take account of statistical information on prior use of the review mechanism in question, including the number of persons having been granted a pardon (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 103; Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 252 and 262; and Bodein, cited above, \u00a7\u00a059).",

In Vinter and Others (cited above) the Grand Chamber thus addressed the problem of how to determine whether, in a given case, a life sentence could be regarded as reducible specifically in the light of the rehabilitation function of incarceration. In this context, it held that it would be incompatible with human dignity \u2013 which lay at the very essence of the Convention system \u2013 forcefully to deprive a person of his freedom without striving towards his rehabilitation and providing him with the chance to regain that freedom at some future date (ibid., \u00a7 113). It went on to note that there was now clear support in European and international law for the principle that all prisoners, including those serving life sentences, be offered the possibility of rehabilitation and the prospect of release if that rehabilitation was achieved (ibid., \u00a7 114). While punishment remained one of the aims of imprisonment, the emphasis in European penal policy was now on the rehabilitative aim of imprisonment, even in the case of life prisoners; this was expressed in Rules 6, 102.1 and 103.8 of the 2006 European Prison Rules, Resolution (76) 2 and Recommendations Rec(2003)23 and Rec(2003)22 of the Committee of Ministers, statements by the CP|T, and the practice of a number of Contracting States.

Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, \u00a7\u00a072, ECHR 2002VIII; Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a044362/04, \u00a7 28, ECHR 2007V; James, Wells and Lee v. the United Kingdom, nos. 25119/09 and 2 others, \u00a7 209, 18 September 2012; and Khoroshenko v. Russia [GC], no. 41418/04, \u00a7\u00a7 121 and 14445, ECHR 2015). In a slightly different context the Court has, moreover, held that, in circumstances where a Government seek to rely solely on the risk posed by offenders to the public in order to justify their continued detention, regard must be had to the need to encourage the rehabilitation of those offenders (see James, Wells and Lee, cited above, \u00a7 218). One of the aims of rehabilitation is to prevent reoffending and thus to ensure the protection of society.",

Indeed, the Court has held that \u201c ... a whole life prisoner is entitled to know ... what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions\u201d (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 122). It has also held, with reference to Vinter and Others, that national authorities must give life prisoners a real opportunity to rehabilitate themselves (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7 264). It follows from this that a life prisoner must be realistically enabled, to the extent possible within the constraints of the prison context, to make such progress towards rehabilitation that it offers him or her the hope of one day being eligible for parole or conditional release. This could be achieved, for example, by setting up and periodically reviewing an individualised programme that will encourage the sentenced prisoner to develop himself or herself to be able to lead a responsible and crime-free life.",

As to the extent of any obligations incumbent on States in this regard, the Court considers that even though States are not responsible for achieving the rehabilitation of life prisoners (ibid.), they nevertheless have a duty to make it possible for such prisoners to rehabilitate themselves. Were it otherwise, a life prisoner could in effect be denied the possibility of rehabilitation, with the consequence that the review required for a life sentence to be reducible, in which a life prisoner\u2019s progress towards rehabilitation is to be assessed, might never be genuinely capable of leading to the commutation, remission or termination of the life sentence or to the conditional release of the prisoner. In this connection the Court reiterates the principle \u2013 well established in its case-law \u2013 that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are not theoretical or illusory, but practical and effective (see, among many other authorities, G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 123, ECHR 2010). The obligation to offer a possibility of rehabilitation is to be seen as an obligation of means, not one of result. However, it entails a positive obligation to secure prison regimes to life prisoners which are compatible with the aim of rehabilitation and enable such prisoners to make progress towards their rehabilitation. In this context the Court has previously held that such an obligation exists in situations where it is the prison regime or the conditions of detention which obstruct rehabilitation (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7 266).",

A lack of appropriate medical care for persons in custody is therefore capable of engaging a State\u2019s responsibility under Article 3 (see Naumenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a042023/98, \u00a7 112, 10 February 2004).

This assessment should also address the likely chances of success of any identified forms of treatment, given that Article 3 cannot entail an obligation for a State to enable a life prisoner to receive treatment that is not realistically expected to have any significant impact in helping the life prisoner to rehabilitate himself or herself. For this reason, account is to be taken of the life prisoner\u2019s individual situation and personality. The Court, moreover, recognises that certain mental-health conditions are not, or not easily, amenable to treatment. Given that, owing to their mental-health situation, such life prisoners may not themselves be sufficiently aware of a need for treatment, the aforementioned assessment should be conducted regardless of whether any request for treatment has been expressed by them (see paragraph 106 above). Where the assessment leads to the conclusion that a particular treatment or therapy may indeed help the life prisoner to rehabilitate himself or herself, he or she is to be enabled to receive that treatment to the extent possible within the constraints of the prison context (see the relevant Council of Europe instruments set out in paragraphs 66-69 above; see also paragraph 103 above). This is of particular importance where treatment in effect constitutes a precondition for the life prisoner\u2019s possible future eligibility for release and is thus a crucial aspect of de facto reducibility of the life sentence.",

In this context the Court observes that the rejections of the applicant\u2019s various requests for pardon were based, inter alia, on the assessment that the risk of recidivism he was considered to pose continued to exist. In the later years of his incarceration this in fact became the sole reason for the refusal to grant him release of any kind. While the risk of reoffending and the need to protect society are relevant penological grounds capable of justifying continued detention of a life prisoner (see paragraph 100 above), the Court will nevertheless have to assess whether the applicant in the specific circumstances of the present case was offered possibilities of rehabilitating himself also during the period of his imprisonment preceding the lodging by him of the present application, as the existence of such possibilities, in particular of any that addressed his mental-health problems, may have affected his prospects of release.",

Owing to the fact that no order for placement in a custodial clinic could be imposed in the Netherlands Antilles at that time \u2013 as the applicable law did not provide for such a measure \u2013 and considering that placement in such a clinic in the European part of the Kingdom was not feasible, the Joint Court of Justice imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the applicant on 11 March 1980 (see paragraphs\u00a01516 above). However, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s detention in a prison rather than in a custodial clinic could not have obviated the need for the recommended treatment. Nor can the Court accept that by dint of the mere fact that the punishment imposed on the applicant did not comprise a measure stipulating that he undergo treatment, the Government were under no further obligation in this regard for the duration of the applicant\u2019s incarceration. It reiterates that States are under an obligation to provide detainees suffering from health problems \u2013 including mental-health problems \u2013 with appropriate medical care (see paragraph 105 above), inter alia, with a view to allowing them, if possible, to rehabilitate themselves, regardless of whether a detainee has made a request to that effect (see paragraphs 106 and 108 above).",

It is furthermore clearly supported by the case file, notably, the email from the senior social worker at the prison in Aruba of 29\u00a0July 2014 (see paragraph 46 above) and a report of 1 September 2014 drawn up by the psychologist at the same prison, both of which state that there is no mention in the applicant\u2019s medical file of his having undergone any psychiatric or psychological treatment (see paragraph\u00a045 above).",

The Court further notes that certain measures were taken and facilities offered which, even if their main purpose was not the applicant\u2019s rehabilitation, may be considered conducive to that purpose. Thus, the applicant was transferred from Cura\u00e7ao to Aruba in 1999. The applicant had requested this transfer in order to be closer to members of his family, and it was considered to be beneficial for his rehabilitation and psychologically favourable for him (see paragraphs 3435 above). The applicant was able to work and benefited from the structured life in prison (see paragraph 42 above). He was reported to have changed over the years: while he may be described as having been a troublesome inmate in the early years of his incarceration in Cura\u00e7ao, he significantly improved his behaviour during his detention in Aruba (see paragraphs\u00a019, 40 and 42 above).",

In this connection the Court notes that one of the judges of the Joint Court of Justice wrote in 1997, when consulted on a request for a pardon lodged by the applicant, that he considered it would be irresponsible to grant a pardon to the applicant, whose risk of reoffending had been established to be high and who had not received the treatment in prison that had been recommended (see paragraph 24 above). The Joint Court of Justice also noted in its advice to the Governor of Cura\u00e7ao, relating to that same request for a pardon, that the applicant had not undergone any (psychiatric) treatment aimed at strengthening his personality structure in order to prevent recidivism (ibid.). Finally, and most markedly, the Joint Court of Justice observed in its decision of 21 September 2012 pursuant to the periodic review of the applicant\u2019s life sentence that important aspects of the applicant\u2019s disturbed personality, on the basis of which it had originally been concluded that the risk of recidivism was high, were still present and that no treatment had taken place during the years of detention. Although the Joint Court of Justice found that after thirty-three years the applicant\u2019s imprisonment no longer served the aim of retribution, it concluded that his continued detention was necessary in order to protect the public as the risk of his reoffending remained too great to allow his release (see paragraphs\u00a08.4, 8.6., 8.7 and 8.12 of the Joint Court of Justice\u2019s decision set out in paragraph 32 above).",

However, although the applicant in the present case was indeed initially, prior to being sentenced to life imprisonment, assessed as requiring treatment, it does not appear that any further assessments were carried out \u2013 either when he started serving his sentence or thereafter \u2013 of the kind of treatment that might be required and could be made available or of the applicant\u2019s aptitude and willingness to receive such treatment. In the Court\u2019s view, very little, if any, relevance falls to be attached to the fact that the applicant himself had not apparently been concerned about procuring treatment and had preferred to be transferred from Cura\u00e7ao to Aruba where the availability of psychiatric help was even more limited. It must be borne in mind that persons with mental-health problems may have difficulties in assessing their own situation or needs, and may be unable to indicate coherently, or even at all, that they require treatment (see paragraph 106 above).",

The innovation concerns the de facto aspect of reducibility. In the Chamber judgment the Court\u2019s now revised standard interpretation of de facto reducibility was applied and it was on that basis, combined with the refusal of the Chamber to lend generous retroactive effect to the Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 66069/09 and 2 others, ECHR 2013) case-law on the reducibility of life sentences, that no violation was found. Whether a life sentence was de jure and de facto reducible used to depend upon characteristics of decision-making and examples tending to suggest that a person serving a whole life sentence would be able to obtain an adjustment of that sentence, having regard to the circumstances (see Harakchiev and Tolumov v. Bulgaria, nos. 15018/11 and 61199/12, \u00a7 262, ECHR 2014). In the present judgment the Court has put the emphasis on the obligation of the State not to leave a life sentenced person with a personality disorder without serious rehabilitative support to be able to qualify (de facto) for possible release. Thus de facto reducibility is taken to be more than just a general characteristic of the system for releasing life sentenced persons. Originally I joined the unanimous conclusion of the Chamber that there had been no violation of Article 3 concerning the reducibility of the life sentence, but I have to admit that the applicant\u2019s representative has convincingly shown to the Grand Chamber that the possibility of release had no substantive meaning in the circumstances of this case, where the applicant could not reasonably have qualified for it by means of his own efforts.",

These two issues being closely intertwined, the Grand Chamber quite rightly addresses both in the part of the judgment dedicated to the \u201crelevant principles\u201d. The purposes of this opinion are to underscore the explicit consequences and to point out the implicit consequences of the Grand Chamber\u2019s finding of a violation of Article 3 of European Convention on Human Rights (\u201cthe Convention\u201d).",

This is the very first time that the Court has acknowledged the crucial importance of an individualised sentence plan for the promotion of resocialisation of prisoners, that importance being reinforced by a statement of principle of the Grand Chamber. The obligation to promote resocialisation is an Article\u00a03 obligation which imposes on the State a duty to act or, to use the words of the Grand Chamber, \u201ca duty to make it possible for such prisoners to rehabilitate themselves\u201d (paragraph 104). Thus, the Grand Chamber perceives the State\u2019s legal obligations to promote resocialisation and to provide and implement an individualised sentence plan as two sides of the same coin.",

This is the meaning of the self-evident last sentence of paragraph 104. But the Article\u00a03 obligation to provide the \u201cconditions of detention and facilities, measures and treatments\u201d, in other words, the appropriate individualised sentence plan and the respective implementation conditions, is an obligation of result, as is crystal clear from the language of paragraph 111. The statement of the Grand Chamber in this paragraph is quite assertive: the State will have complied with its obligations under Article 3 \u201cwhen it has provided\u201d for conditions of detention, facilities, measures and treatments capable of enabling a life prisoner to reintegrate himself or herself into society, and this obligation is independent from the prisoner\u2019s willingness to make use of those facilities, measures and treatments. It is in this light that the reference to an \u201cindividualised programme\u201d in paragraph 103 as an \u201cexample\u201d of a resocialisation-oriented prison policy must be interpreted. In other words, the meaning of the exemplificative language of paragraph 103 is only understandable in the context of the strongly assertive language of paragraph\u00a0111. The individualised sentence plan is the central pillar of a resocialisation-oriented prison policy, but it should be articulated with a set of other detention conditions, material facilities, practical measures and psychiatric, psychological and other medical treatment.",

Although Mr Murray was diagnosed with a pathological disorder, in particular a very limited development of his mental faculties, he was never considered mentally insane. Neither the few psychiatrists consulted nor the domestic courts questioned his criminal liability. Yet the Court does not restrict the scope of its analysis to a discussion of the State\u2019s obligation to provide resocialisation programmes to mentally sane offenders. On the contrary, the broad language used in paragraph 109, which refers to \u201ctreatments or therapies \u2013 be they medical, psychological or psychiatric\u201d, clearly indicates the willingness of the Grand Chamber to submit the State to the same obligation vis\u00e0vis mentally insane offenders. In view of the borderline nature of Mr Murray\u2019s mental condition, the Grand Chamber purposely expands its analysis to the situation of all \u201cprisoners with mental-health problems\u201d (sub-heading (c) of \u201cthe relevant principles\u201d of \u201c[t]he Court\u2019s assessment\u201d), regardless of the gravity of the mental illnesses or disorders of the prisoner, the degree of the prisoner\u2019s impairment in taking autonomous decisions and the determination of the relevant legal status as a mentally sane or insane offender in the criminal proceedings. Such an unrestricted approach is obviously comprehensible in the light of both Recommendation No. R (98) 7 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to member States concerning the ethical and organisational aspects of health care in prison and the 2006 European Prison Rules, which the Court cites abundantly in paragraphs 66 and 73 to 76 of the present judgment.",

Mentally insane offenders subjected to a similar period of internment or longer should, a fortiori, benefit from the same plan. In spite of the apparent focus on the situation of life prisoners, the Grand Chamber does signal that its principled approach to the obligation to promote resocialisation applies to \u201call prisoners, including those serving life sentences\u201d. When referring specifically to the individualised programme, the Grand Chamber also mentions in general terms the \u201csentenced prisoner\u201d, not the life prisoner, as the beneficiary of such programme.",

The Grand Chamber firmly rebuts this argument and finds explicitly that these positive obligations were binding on the respondent State already in 1980. From the imposition of his life sentence, the applicant was entitled to have a prospect of release and the possibility of a review mechanism fulfilling the requirements flowing from the Convention. Paragraph 116 of the present judgment does not leave a shadow of doubt about the Grand Chamber\u2019s intention to assess the respondent State\u2019s conduct taking into account the entire period of Mr Murray\u2019s incarceration. Thus the Court does apply the obligation to promote resocialisation and set up a review mechanism to a period of incarceration starting in 1980. In so doing, the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment does not proceed with a retroactive application of international legal standards, since these standards have been clear at European level since 1973 (see Resolution of the Committee of Ministers (73) 5 on Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners), and even earlier than that at a global level (see United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners of 1955). To put it in a straightforward way, the Grand Chamber considers that Vinter and Others only restated penological standards that had been binding on member States of the Council of Europe since at least the 1980s.",

As one of the most important practical aspects of the positive obligation of States Parties to protect the physical and psychological well-being of inmates under the Convention, the obligation to provide and implement an individualised sentence plan, including individual psychiatric and psychological treatment, is an obligation of result which is imposed on States Parties to the Convention, regardless of the inmate\u2019s wishes. The inmate should, of course, be encouraged to adhere to and cooperate with such a plan, but the fact that he or she rejects it or remains indifferent to it will not release the State from its duty to prepare, implement and review the individual sentence plan in any event.

This contention can easily be rejected on the basis of the doctrine enshrined in Article 4 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the United Nations International Law Commission in 2001), according to which the conduct of any State organ, be it that of the central government or of a territorial unit of the State, must be considered an act of that State under international law. It is neither Cura\u00e7ao nor Aruba but the Kingdom of the Netherlands which is the Party responsible under the Convention for ensuring compliance with its standards. For this same reason, it is also irrelevant to claim, as the Government did, that there was no obligation to offer the applicant psychiatric treatment, since no such order was imposed by the sentencing court, the Joint Court of Justice of the Netherlands Antilles (\u201cthe Joint Court of Justice\u201d).

If adequate treatment was not available in Cura\u00e7ao, the applicant should have been sent to the Netherlands, where professional help could have been provided to him, if necessary with translation, using one of the three languages that he spoke: Papiamento, English or, with more difficulty, Dutch. Even less acceptable is the Government\u2019s argument presented at the Grand Chamber hearing that the applicant never requested a transfer to the Netherlands.

The logical conclusion to be drawn from the above set of Convention principles is that, if a parole mechanism must be available to those convicted of the most heinous crimes, a fortiori it must be available to other prisoners. It would fly in the face of justice if offenders convicted of less serious offences could not be paroled whenever they are apt to reintegrate society, while such an opportunity would be afforded to offenders convicted of more serious crimes.

Furthermore, there was no published procedure or criteria governing the operation of the procedure. Lastly, a refusal to order a prisoner\u2019s early release was not amenable to judicial review.

They produced four psychiatric reports, of 11 October 1979, 10\u00a0February 1994, 21 July 2012 and 17 August 2012, and a \u201cletter\u201d from a psychiatrist of 6 September 1991. This means that until the review procedure initiated in accordance with the new provisions of the Cura\u00e7ao Criminal Code, only two psychiatric reports and a psychiatrist\u2019s \u201cletter\u201d had been issued. Two psychiatric reports in the period between 1980 and 2012 \u2013 this was the extent of the professional psychiatric care that the applicant received in twenty-two years of incarceration. As the Joint Court of Justice concluded, in its judgment of 21 September 2012, while evaluating the applicant\u2019s risk of recidivism existing at the time of the imposition of the sentence in 1980 and during the period of incarceration, \u201csince then no treatment in any shape or form ha[d] taken place\u201d. Clearer than this the Antillean judges could not have been. Understandably, the judges of the Grand Chamber of this Court cannot reach a different conclusion in paragraph 122 of the present judgment, which acknowledges that Mr\u00a0Murray received no treatment at all during his incarceration.",

The majority deliberately choose not to address this aspect of the case in paragraph 126, although they set out the \u201crelevant principles\u201d for that purpose in the earlier paragraphs 99 and 100. The pardon system in force in the former Netherlands Antilles provided no lawful, objective, penological criteria for the sentence review, no time frame for the review, no judicial oversight, no obligation to give reasons for the governor\u2019s decision not to grant a pardon and no oral hearing of the inmate. No updated medical opinions or psychiatric reports on the state of the applicant\u2019s mental health or information from the prison authorities was gathered and put at the disposal of the Procurator General or the Joint Court of Justice. Everything fell within the discretion of the Governor, who was entirely free not to follow the Public Prosecution Service\u2019s submission or the Joint Court of Justice\u2019s advice in favour of release.",

He was finally diagnosed with cancer in early 2013. On 2 September 2013 he was brought back to the prison in Cura\u00e7ao, with a view to facilitating his health treatment. After the intervention of the Court in response to a request for an interim measure, the applicant was placed in a nursing home in Cura\u00e7ao, with two guards at his door. For surgery it was too late. Since treatment in prison was no longer an option, he was pardoned by the Governor only on 31 March 2014, entailing the remission of the rest of his prison sentence, and thus allowing him to die in a dignified manner in the presence of his family in Aruba. Even then, the applicant was left to his own devices. It was his sister, with her small pension, who had to pay for his nursing.",

Thus, the applicable rules on periodic review of life sentences between 15 November 2011 and 31 March 2014 should have been assessed by the Court.",

Too much discretion is allowed in the formulation of the review criteria. There is no way in which a life prisoner can know what he or she should do to be considered for release and under what conditions. The additional concretisation in paragraph 2 of these criteria, with the reference to the opinion of the victim or of the surviving close relatives and the risk of recidivism, does not suffice to satisfy the requirements of the principle of legality. On the contrary, the fact that the position of the victims or their relatives is included in the examination of the question whether the continued execution of a life sentence can still be justified confuses the assessment of legitimate penological grounds with an exercise of quenching the victims\u2019 \u2013 or their relatives\u2019 \u2013 thirst for revenge. By concentrating on the need for revenge and resentment, this policy attributes a predominant role to the worst possible form of retribution: a blind, visceral, \u201cjust deserts\u201d feeling on the part of the victims or their relatives. The offender will have to \u201crot in jail\u201d as long as the victims or their relatives deem their thirst for revenge unquenched, even though he or she may be ready to live a law-abiding life in society.",

The less the State fulfils its obligation towards the victims or their relatives, the more inclined they will be to compensate for their loss with a need to prolong the offender\u2019s incarceration. Although \u201crehabilitated\u201d, the prisoner may be kept in continued detention as a scapegoat for the State\u2019s failure to attend to the needs of the victims or their relatives. In fact, that is exactly what happened in the present case: the Joint Court of Justice found, in its judgment of 21 September 2012, that, since the victim\u2019s relatives had never received adequate psychological care, the applicant\u2019s release would shock them very much. Furthermore, it even considered that the act that he had allegedly threatened them with in 1979, that is, twenty-three years before, could still contribute to their feelings of insecurity.",

Mr Murray could not be released simply because, as the Antillean judges admitted, he had never had a chance to undergo psychiatric treatment. The only possible solution for his resocialisation would have been to provide him with proper psychiatric treatment, which was not even tried. In other words, the State refuses parole until one is capable of leading a law-abiding life in society, which can only happen if the prisoner is provided with proper psychiatric treatment by the State, but the same State withholds this treatment. This is a typical \u201cCatch 22\u201d situation: the State imposes a condition for release but denies the prisoner the means of satisfying the condition. In this context, realistically speaking, the outcome of any review by the Governor or the Joint Court of Justice was nothing but a foregone conclusion.",

That is what happened to the applicant James Murray. The lack of psychiatric treatment rendered his life sentence de facto irreducible. The Article 3 violation was aggravated by the existence of a discretionary and opaque pardon system, at the time the sentence was imposed, which did not meet the Convention requirements and was of no help to the applicant. The newly introduced periodic-review mechanism under Article 1:30 of the Criminal Code of Cura\u00e7ao, which did not provide him relief either, is also problematic with regard to the lack of foreseeability of the grounds for review of the sentence and the predominant role that it attributes to a purely retributive, revenge-oriented penal policy.",
