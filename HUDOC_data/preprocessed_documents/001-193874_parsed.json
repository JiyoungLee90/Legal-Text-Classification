At the same time, if the time-limit for an ordinary appeal procedure is extended after a considerable lapse of time and for reasons which do not appear to be particularly persuasive, such a decision can infringe the principle of legal certainty. The Court acknowledges that it is primarily within the domestic courts\u2019 discretion to decide on the extension of the time-limit for an appeal, but that discretion is not unlimited. The courts are required to indicate reasons. One of those reasons could be, for instance, a failure by the State authorities to inform parties of decisions taken with respect to their cases. Even then, however, the possibility of an extension would not be unlimited, since the parties should take steps within reasonable intervals to enquire about the progress of judicial proceedings of which they are aware. In every case, the domestic courts should verify whether the reasons for extending a time-limit for appeal could justify the interference with the principle of res judicata, especially where the domestic legislation does not limit the courts\u2019 discretion either as regards the time or grounds for an extension of the time-limit (see Ponomaryov v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 3236/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041, 3 April 2008).",
