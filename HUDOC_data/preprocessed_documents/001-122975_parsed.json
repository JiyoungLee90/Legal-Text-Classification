The authorities granted his request. According to the most recent information provided by the Government on 24\u00a0January\u00a02013, the applicant had been able to visit his son regularly, usually once every fortnight, at the DGSACP\u2019s premises. Visits had taken place on 9 September, 23 September, 7 October, 21 October and 2\u00a0November\u00a02011, when, according to the minutes drafted by the authorities, the applicant had showed a lot of love and affection to his son, who also enjoyed getting to see his father. The DGSACP informed the Romanian Government Agent that, on 7 May 2012 and 8 January 2013, the applicant had declared his willingness to regain parental rights and responsibilities in respect of his son provided that he would benefit from social assistance payments, which would allow him, on the one hand, to repair his house, the condition of which had deteriorated while he had been in prison, and, on the other hand, to be able to pay the costs of boarding school for his son and any urgent transportation of his son which might possibly occur. The DGSACP also informed the Government Agent that it would continue to support the development of the relationship between the applicant and his son and that it would seek and support the return of the child to the applicant\u2019s care as soon as circumstances permitted it.",

It notes in this respect that that the relevant provisions of domestic law allow, but do not oblige, the domestic courts to order a prisoner\u2019s temporary release in certain circumstances. The domestic courts\u2019 task was therefore to evaluate whether the requirements of domestic law had been met. In the case at hand, the Bucharest Court of First Instance and the Bucharest County Court did precisely that: on the basis of the evidence the applicant brought before them and taking his specific situation into consideration, they found that his application for temporary release was unsubstantiated because he had failed to demonstrate how his release from prison at that time, when his child was in the care of social services by virtue of a final decision of the domestic courts, could improve his family situation.
