Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement (see Dankevich v.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine 1996 governing the administration of justice, judicial powers are entrusted solely to the independent courts. The provisions relating to the structure, functions and organisation of the prosecuting authorities contained in the Chapter VII of the Constitution of Ukraine (Articles 121-123) and the Law on Prosecution (Chapters I-II of the Law) provide that in criminal proceedings the tasks of prosecution are carried out by prosecutors. In this respect, the Court notes the Government\u2019s submission that prosecutors in  were at the material time, and, indeed, still are, subordinate to the Prosecutor General of , who is proposed for appointment by the President of Ukraine and elected by the Parliament of Ukraine. The President of Ukraine can also dismiss the Prosecutor General from his position without the consent of the Parliament. It is therefore indisputable that prosecutors, in the exercise of their functions, are subject to the supervision of an authority belonging to the executive branch of the Government. In the Court\u2019s view, the mere fact relied on by the Government that under the applicable laws prosecutors, in addition to exercising a prosecutorial role, also act as guardian of the public interest, cannot be regarded as conferring on them a judicial status or the status of independent and impartial actors. It notes that prosecutors perform investigative and prosecuting functions and, therefore, their position in the criminal proceedings as provided for by the law at the material time, in particular by the provisions of Law on Prosecution (Chapters I-II) and the Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine (Articles 22, 25 and 32 of the Code), must be seen as that of a party to these proceedings. The Court notes therefore that recourse to the prosecutor, who was a party to the criminal proceedings in the instant case, did not offer reasonable prospects of success as it was not \u201ceffective\u201d. The applicant was therefore not under an obligation to avail himself of this remedy.",

As to the introduction of amendments to Article\u00a0234 of the CCRP, allowing for complaints to be lodged against the prosecutor or investigator in the course of the investigation, the Court considers that even though this remedy exists in theory as from 30 January 2003, the Government have not shown what its practical implications are. Furthermore, the law does not specifically state whether Article\u00a0234 of the CCRP is a remedy for the length of proceedings in a criminal case and what kind of redress can be provided to an applicant in the event of a finding that the length of the investigation breached the requirement of \u201creasonableness\u201d.

They further submitted that no agreement had been submitted to the Court confirming the applicant\u2019s representation and the arrangements for the payment of legal fees. In particular, the Government considered that the applicant\u2019s lawyers unreasonably overestimated the time (more than 400 hours) they allegedly spent in preparing the case.
