In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Assenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94).",

Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2015). In this connection, the Court notes that following the incident three guards involved gave written statements to the Prison Director.

The prison administration left the matter there and no attempt was made to obtain more details from the guards. Furthermore, no statements were taken from the two prisoners the authorities claimed were involved in the incident, and the applicant himself was not heard. Finally, there is no indication in the medical records of what could have caused the perforated eardrum and the authorities did not seek medical opinion as to the possible cause of the injury.
