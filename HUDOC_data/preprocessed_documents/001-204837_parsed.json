He was prosecuted in administrative-offence proceedings over one hundred times, including at least thirty occasions when he was deprived of his liberty (apparently through the escort or arrest procedure). He had allegedly adopted certain positions that were hostile towards the authorities, in particular during and after the elections to the State Duma in 2011.\u00a0The applicant\u2019s representatives maintained that he had been persecuted for his political activism and that the authorities\u2019 actions had been aimed at preventing his participation in various opposition activities, in particular in protest rallies after the elections, originally planned to be held on 5 and 10\u00a0December 2011 (apparently, the latter was to be held at Bolotnaya Square in Moscow at 2 p.m. and the applicant was one of the organisers) and on 24 December 2011.

For instance, arbitrariness may arise where there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities or where the order to detain and the execution of the detention did not genuinely conform to the purpose of the restrictions permitted by the relevant sub-paragraph of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see S., V. and A. v.

The Court notes that the applicant could not take part because he had been taken to a court hearing under the court order of 9 December 2011 requiring his presence there (see paragraphs\u00a028-33 above). Those proceedings bore no relationship to the rally on 10 December 2011 (see, by contrast, Navalnyy and Yashin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 76204/11, \u00a7\u00a7 6-42, 4 December 2014). As indicated in paragraph 102 above in the context of Article 5 of the Convention, the applicant\u2019s lawyers made no submissions before the Court regarding that order. It remains uncontested that it was issued because of the applicant\u2019s absence from earlier court hearings scheduled between late October and early December 2011 (see paragraph 29 above). The applicant did not challenge the factual elements underlying that judicial decision either. In view of the foregoing, no sufficient evidence has been adduced to support the applicant\u2019s allegation that there was an arbitrary \u201cinterference\u201d with his freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in relation to the rally on 10\u00a0December 2011 (see, by contrast, Huseynli and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a084-97).
