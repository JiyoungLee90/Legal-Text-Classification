Such a practice had a legal and procedural justification in that the Constitutional Court wanted to keep its powers of review practical and effective by confining its examination to active decisions on detention. As the applicant had lodged (on 18 April 2012) a constitutional complaint against the decision on his detention of 2 April 2012 (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above), and as in the meantime a new decision on his detention had been adopted (1\u00a0June 2012, see paragraph 16 above), the Constitutional Court had declared his complaint inadmissible without examining it on the merits.
