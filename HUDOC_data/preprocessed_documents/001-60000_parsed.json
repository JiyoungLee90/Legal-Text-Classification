According to the Court\u2019s case-law, a \"tribunal\" is characterised in the substantive sense of the term by its judicial function, that is to say determining matters within its competence on the basis of rules of law and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner. It must also satisfy a series of further requirements - independence, in particular of the executive; impartiality; duration of its members\u2019 terms of office; guarantees afforded by its procedure - several of which appear in the text of Article 6 \u00a7 1 itself (Belilos v. Switzerland judgment of 29 April 1988, Series A no. 132, p. 29, \u00a7 64). Where a penalty is criminal in nature there must be the possibility of review by a court which satisfies the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1, even though it is not inconsistent with the Convention for the prosecution and punishment of minor offences to be primarily a matter for the administrative authorities (Malige v. France judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VII, p. 2937, \u00a7 45).",

Austria judgment, op.cit., \u00a7 42). Thus, the Court has to examine whether in the administrative criminal proceedings against the applicant his conviction was reviewed by any other authority or court which satisfies the requirements under Article 6 \u00a7 1 as regards the tribunal element and, if so, whether this body has held a public hearing.",

In the present case the applicant had not expressly waived his right to a hearing, nor does it appear that he limited his appeal to points of law or to the sentence. Thus, it appears that according to section 51e, the Independent Administrative Panel should have held a hearing ex officio. However, it did not do so. The Court further notes that the applicant specifically complained to the Constitutional Court (and the Administrative Court) that the Independent Panel had failed to hold a hearing, but to no avail.",
