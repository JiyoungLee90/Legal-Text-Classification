Romania (dec.), no. 13902/11, 20\u00a0March 2012), in that in Romania the legislative measure prohibiting the simultaneous receipt of a State-paid pension and a salary acquired through State employment had been taken at the height of the financial crisis, and had been lifted when that crisis had abated. In contrast, by the time the amended legislation had entered into force in Hungary (1 July 2013), Hungary had already ceased to be subject to the EU excessive deficit procedure, the release from which had been the aim of the legislation. In addition, the Government had declared in 2013 that the country\u2019s economic situation was excellent, and also from their ambitious spending plans it appeared that they were of the view that the economic crisis was over.",

In addition, in the same year, 2013, the pension ceiling had been raised considerably: whereas it had previously not been possible for a monthly pension to exceed HUF 300,000 (at that time approximately EUR\u00a01,020), the highest monthly pension paid out had now reached HUF\u00a02,000,000 (currently approximately EUR 6,500). Having regard to those factors, the impugned measure could not even in theory have contributed to helping Hungary obtain release from the excessive deficit procedure. The savings actually made currently amounted to no more than 0.0001% of Hungary\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).",

Moreover, those State employees\u2019 earnings were also considerably higher than the applicant\u2019s salary and the suspension of their pension payments would thus not have had the same impact on them as it had had on the applicant, who had only taken up employment after his retirement out of financial necessity.

At the hearing before the Grand Chamber they submitted that, owing to an imbalance in the ratio of pension recipients as opposed to pension contributors \u2013 caused, inter alia, by an ageing population and the statutory availability of early-retirement schemes \u2013 the Hungarian State pension system had been facing serious challenges, with the situation being exacerbated by the 2008 global economic crisis. A number of measures had therefore been taken in order to reform the pension system. One such measure had been the abolition in 2013 of the ceiling on monthly pension contributions (see paragraph 29 above), which had been incorrectly described by the applicant as the elimination of the maximum amount that could be received by way of a monthly pension; in fact, the law in force prior to the measure had not contained such a maximum. In the short run, the abolition of the ceiling on pension contributions had resulted in a significant increase in the revenues of the Pension Fund and, while in the long run it might also lead to an increase in expenditure, important constraints \u2013 such as a highly degressive calculation of pension amounts \u2013 were in place to prevent such a development.",

In 2012, compulsory retirement at the statutory pensionable age with a prohibition on resuming employment had been introduced in the civil service sector by Decree 1700/2012 (see paragraph 23 above) as a means of downsizing that service, where appropriate, and reducing youth unemployment. That decree was applicable only to central Government \u2013 that is, ministries and their subordinate bodies \u2013 and could thus not impose any obligation on local government bodies to dismiss persons in receipt of pension benefits in their employ. It was to the latter category of employees that the measure at issue in the present case applied; they were given the choice between either discontinuing their employment and continuing to receive their pension, or continuing their employment and having their pension payments suspended. This measure was thus part of a package of measures aimed at securing the long-term sustainability of the pension system, reducing public debt and facilitating the closure of the EU excessive deficit procedure that had been initiated against Hungary (by the Council of the European Union in accordance with Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).",

In this connection they referred to the case of Panfile, cited above, which, like the present case, also concerned an applicant who \u2013 at the time a law had entered into force prohibiting the concurrent receipt of a pension and a State-paid salary \u2013 had been in receipt of pension benefits while simultaneously being in State employment. In that case the Court had noted that, since Mr Panfile had had the choice between continuing to receive his monthly pension and terminating his employment, or having the pension payment suspended while continuing to work for the State, he had not suffered a total deprivation of his entitlements, neither had he been divested of all means of subsistence. In the present case, however, the Chamber had not considered it necessary to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 taken alone. The principle of consistency required that such an examination be carried out in the present case also. That examination should lead, so the Government argued, to the same conclusion as the Court had reached in Panfile: the applicant had had the choice between receiving his pension or continuing to work, and it was to be assumed that he had elected to stay in employment because his salary was higher than his pension. As his pension had amounted to HUF 162,260 (at that time approximately EUR 550), he must have been in receipt of a monthly salary higher than the average salary in Hungary in 2013 (which had been HUF 151,118 (at that time approximately EUR 515)). For those reasons it could not be said that the applicant had been made to bear an excessive individual burden.",

In this connection the Court observes at the outset that there is no suggestion that when the applicant started his employment at Budapest XIII District Municipality on 1 July 2012 he had any inkling of the changes to the pension system that were afoot. It would therefore be disingenuous to hold that he could have avoided being affected by the amended legislation simply by electing not to re-enter State employment (contrast and compare Mauriello v. Italy (dec.), no. 14862/07, \u00a7\u00a039, 13 September 2016, and Torri and Others v. Italy (dec.), nos.\u00a011838/07 and 12302/07, \u00a7 37, 24 January 2012). But once the legislation at issue had entered into force, it was not the case that the disbursement of the applicant\u2019s pension was suspended without his having any choice in the matter. In similar fashion to the applicant in Panfile (cited above, \u00a7 23), and as the Government also pointed out (see paragraphs 55-56 above), the applicant was able to choose between discontinuing his employment in the civil service and continuing to receive his pension, or remaining in that employment and having his pension payments suspended.

Thus, an excessive individual burden was found to have been imposed in cases in which, inter alia, the withdrawal or discontinuance of a pension amounted to the total loss of an applicant\u2019s sole source of income (see B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy, cited above, \u00a7 123; Apostolakis, cited above, \u00a7 39; and Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, \u00a7 74, 15\u00a0September 2009), and those in which a suspended pension constituted a considerable part of the monthly income before tax of the applicants, who worked on a part-time basis only (see Laki\u0107evi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070). By the same token, the Court has held that a fair balance was struck in a number of cases because, inter alia, the cap on pensions complained about did not totally divest the applicants \u2013 who were among the top earners of the persons in receipt of a retirement pension in Bulgaria \u2013 of their only means of subsistence (see Valkov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 97), or because it was considered that the Contracting State concerned had been entitled to take into account the other sources of income of the applicant \u2013 who also received benefits under private pension schemes \u2013 when establishing the amount of a widow\u2019s allowance (see Matheis v. Germany (dec.), no.\u00a073711/01, 1 February 2005). The Court applied a similar approach in the case relied on by the Government, that is, Panfile, in which, after the loss of his job due to the introduction of legal provisions preventing him from receiving concomitantly a pension and a salary, the applicant continued to receive a full monthly pension, whose level was higher than the level of the national average salary before tax (see Panfile, cited above, \u00a7 23).",

In other words, the requirement to demonstrate an analogous position does not require that the comparator groups be identical. An applicant must demonstrate that, having regard to the particular nature of his or her complaint, he or she was in a relevantly similar situation to others treated differently (see Clift v. the United Kingdom, no. 7205/07, \u00a7 66, 13 July 2010).

This scheme provided for pension entitlements for both groups, regardless of whether they had previously worked in the public or the private sector (see paragraphs 21-22 above). Accordingly, old-age pensions disbursed to employees in the public sector originated from the same source as pension payments to employees working in the private sector. Nevertheless, this is not in itself sufficient to establish that the situations of persons in receipt of a pension and employed in the civil service after retirement and those in receipt of a pension but re-employed in the private sector were relevantly similar for the purposes of the assessment of the present case.",

It was precisely the fact that, as a civil servant, he was in receipt of a salary from the State that was incompatible with the simultaneous disbursement of an old-age pension from the same source. As a matter of financial, social and employment policy, the impugned bar on simultaneous accumulation of pension and salary from the State budget had been introduced as part of legislative measures aimed at correcting financially unsustainable features in the pension system of the respondent State. Steps taken to reform deficient pension schemes had, in turn, been part of action taken with the aim of reducing public expenditure and debt. This did not prevent the accumulation of pension and salary for persons employed in the private sector, whose salaries, in contrast to those of persons employed in the civil service, were funded not by the State but through private budgets outside the latter\u2019s direct control. As already stated in paragraph 126 above, it was the distinction between the sources of the salaries of employees in the public and private sectors that led the Court to conclude in Panfile that those two categories of persons could hardly be regarded as being in an analogous or relevantly similar situation within the meaning of Article 14.",

The applicant was 47 years old when, in 2000, after 27 years of service and one year before some very generous earlyretirement schemes were abolished, he chose to avail himself of one such scheme open to members of the police force. The statutory retirement age in Hungary varied, at the relevant time, between 62 and 63. The applicant only reached this statutory retirement age in 2016, three years after his case had been lodged before the Court. The majority judgment indicates that both (certain) public and (some) private-sector employees used to be eligible for early-retirement pensions. However, the terms and conditions of eligibility for such pensions are nowhere further elaborated. It is noteworthy that the applicant could have continued to work in the police force beyond the age of 47 and, had he done so, he would have continued to contribute to his pension, which would have continued to increase. It is also relevant, as the respondent Government pointed out, that neither the applicant nor his (State) employer had ever paid any additional pension contribution in order to cover the additional cost of the preferential treatment embodied in the longer disbursement period. In receipt of his early-retirement pension, he continued to work, first in the private sector for twelve years and subsequently in the civil service. It was when he was reemployed in the latter in 2012 that the impugned pension reform measure was adopted. The latter provided for suspension of the applicant\u2019s pension entitlement for as long as his employment in the civil service continued. To continue receiving his pension he had to stop working in the civil service or return to employment in the private sector. In short, receipt of both a Statefunded pension and a Statefunded salary was excluded. Some of this information could only be pieced together following the oral submissions of the respondent Government at the hearing on 9 November 2016 and in response to detailed questions posed to both parties by judges of the Court.

The choice of comparator will often change the outcome of the case, and the judicial choice of comparators is sometimes criticised for being arbitrary or lacking in a consistent rationale. Well-founded criticism of this weakness should spur the Court to present clearly the objective basis on which it determines questions of comparability. Secondly, the long and open-ended list of prohibited grounds in Article 14 means that a lack of rigour in cases where the comparator is central mean all \u201ceggs\u201d are placed in the justification and reasonableness basket. When that happens, as it did at Chamber level in the instant case, it may be all too easy for a lacklustre defence by a respondent Government on the question of objective and reasonable justification to lead to the finding of a violation.

The identification of the factors that characterise situations in a particular context is an issue that goes to the assessment of the merits of the case. The Court cannot, in answering this legal question, confine its analysis simply to the elements as they may have been relied on by the complainant in a discrimination case.

Persons, like the applicant, who have not reached the statutory retirement age continue to be in a position to work and have an earning capacity. Furthermore, in paragraph 71 of the majority judgment, an important consequence of early retirement is referred to. Those who receive earlyretirement pensions do so on the basis of a far shorter contribution period \u2013 both by them and their (State) employer \u2212 than those who continue to work until the statutory retirement age.

It is obvious that entitlements to early retirement, whereby contributions stop as early as the disbursement of benefits begins, cause relatively larger deficits and, conversely, draw more on the supplementary funding from the State budget than pension entitlements based on longer contribution periods and later commencement of benefit disbursements. Thus, by virtue of and since his early retirement, the applicant had in fact enjoyed benefits subsidised from State funds over a longer period of time than persons in receipt of entitlements from other schemes. This is another reason why, in the context of measures designed to address such imbalances and resulting expenditures from the State budget, it is problematic in a comparability analysis to overlook differences in the various pension entitlement schemes and the financial in- and outflows arising from them.",

Two distinct issues needed to be addressed in the analysis under Article 14. The first one was whether the applicant was in an analogous situation to the suggested comparator group. If this was indeed the case, the second issue to be addressed was whether the difference in treatment was justified. The majority rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint already in answering the first question. They held that the applicant was not in an analogous situation compared with individuals who, like him, were in receipt of an old-age pension but who, unlike him, were in private employment (see paragraphs 121-33 of the judgment). We respectfully disagree. Consequently, in our view, an analysis was required as to the necessity of the different treatment, namely whether it was objectively and reasonably justified.

The difference in treatment consisted in the fact that the applicant had his pension payments suspended whereas those working in the private sector did not. Thus the pertinent question is whether the two groups, the one to which the applicant belonged comprising individuals in receipt of an old-age pension and working for the public sector, and the comparator group comprising individuals in receipt of an old-age pension and working for the private sector, were in an analogous or relevantly similar situation.",

Only the latter, in our view, should have been taken into account in establishing whether the applicant was in an analogous or relevantly similar situation to the comparator group. The fact that the applicant was in public employment and not in private employment after becoming entitled to an old-age pension was irrelevant for the purposes of his entitlement to such a pension. The public versus private-employment distinction thus constituted the different treatment in the otherwise identical entitlement to an old-age pension of the two groups that had to be compared. The measure contested by the applicant was precisely the suspension of his entitlement to an old-age pension, and the analysis of comparability of the two groups should have been based only on the factors giving rise to such entitlement. The difference between individuals in public and private-sector employment is certainly not irrelevant, but it should have been taken into account only in the analysis of whether this difference in treatment was justified or not.",

It is true that the Court held in those cases that the different treatment of private and public-sector employees in the enjoyment of their rights under the Convention was justified under certain circumstances. We do not believe, however, that this acceptable differentiation of the Convention rights of private and public-sector employees can justify the conclusion that the two categories in the present case were not in an analogous or relevantly similar situation. While the judgments of the Court that were cited undoubtedly drew a distinction between the Convention rights of public and private-sector employees, the reliance on such a distinction in the present case reveals confusion as to the relevant circumstances required for the comparison. This approach fails to recognise that in the cases relied on by the majority the distinction between public and private-sector employees was a pre-existing feature which defined the very content of the right at issue. Whether pension rights, the right to free speech or the right of access to court were at stake, the very essence of the rights at issue in those cases emanated from the specific characteristics of the public service, and as a result the very essence of the right was defined differently, precisely because of the inherent differences between public and private-sector employment. This was the case even in Panfile, albeit that the Court did not rely on this in reaching its decision. The applicant\u2019s right to an old-age pension in that case stemmed from special legislation on military personnel (see Panfile v. Romania (dec.), no. 13902/11, \u00a7 3, 20 March 2012). In the present case, however, the underlying right, the applicant\u2019s entitlement to an old-age pension, was in no way affected by the difference between public and private-sector employment.

As described in paragraph 21 of the judgment, the Hungarian social-security pension scheme is a compulsory, contributory system. Every employee, no matter whether in the public or the private sector, contributes in the same way to the system, which is funded by means of a certain percentage withdrawn from the employee\u2019s monthly income and an employer\u2019s contribution of 27% of the amount of the employee\u2019s salary.",

In that case the Court held that the prohibition of discrimination enshrined in Article 14 of the Convention was meaningful only if, in each particular case, the applicant\u2019s personal situation in relation to the criteria listed in that provision was taken into account exactly as it stood. To hold that the applicant\u2019s employment in the public sector while he was in receipt of an old-age pension was decisive for defining whether he was in an analogous situation to the comparator group also runs counter to other decisions of this Court. If this approach had been taken in Gaygusuz v. Austria (16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV), the conclusion would have had to be that the applicant was not in a relevantly similar situation to other persons entitled to emergency assistance in Austria, because, unlike those other persons, he was not an Austrian national.",

The burden of proof, as the Court has held on many occasions, is on the respondent Government, who have to demonstrate that the difference in treatment was justified (see Khamtokhu and Aksenchik v.\u00a0Russia [GC], nos. 60367/08 and 961/11, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2017; Vallianatos and Others v.\u00a0Greece [GC], nos. 29381/09 and 32684/09, \u00a7 85, ECHR 2013 (extracts); and D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, \u00a7\u00a0177, ECHR 2007IV).
