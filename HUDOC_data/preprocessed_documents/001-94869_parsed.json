Examining the applicant's request for supervisory review, on 26 April 2007 the Presidium of the Moscow City Court determined that the money which the applicant had carried across the customs border had been neither the object of the offence of smuggling nor proceeds from any criminal activities. It was therefore not liable to confiscation under either sub-paragraph 1 or sub-paragraph 4 of Article 81 \u00a7\u00a03. It is remarkable in this connection that, in making such a finding in a general manner, the Presidium's decision could only be read as being applicable to the entire amount of money carried by the applicant.

In fact, as regards that amount, the Presidium's decision did nothing to remedy the lacunae in the legal reasoning of the first-instance, appeal and supervisory-review courts. In this connection the Court emphasises that the existence of public-interest considerations for the contested measure, however relevant or appropriate they might have appeared, did not dispense the domestic authorities from the obligation to cite a specific legal basis for such decision (see Frizen, cited above, \u00a7 34).",

The Moscow City Court's order to return \u201conly\u201d USD 10,000 and UAH 31 to the applicant was not based on \u201cunexplained reasons\u201d, but instead was logical because it separated the \u201csmuggled\u201d part of the total amount (USD 3,020), which was not declared to the customs authorities and consequently was confiscated, from the \u201clegally carried\u201d part of the amount, which was declared to the customs authorities and was thus confiscated illegally.
