The Court observes that the applicant submitted the writ of execution to the social security service in accordance with the Instruction of the Ministry of Finance. The social security service refused to process his writ and advised him to apply to the local department of the Ministry of Finance. The applicant followed that advice, but the local department of the Ministry of Finance also refused to pay. After that he submitted the writ to the Ministry of Finance (see paragraphs 15 et seq.). In the Court's view, in the absence of clear instructions as to the enforcement procedure to be followed, the applicant cannot be blamed for the delay in submitting the writ of execution to the competent agency. It is incumbent on the State to organise its legal system in such a way that ensures co-ordination between various enforcement agencies and secures honouring of the State's judgment debts in good time. It would impose an excessive burden on the applicant if he has to forward the writ of execution from one competent State agency to another (see Reynbakh v. Russia, no. 23405/03, \u00a7\u00a023, 29 September 2005). The Court does not see any reason to depart from its findings in the Reynbakh case, and concludes that the applicant took reasonable steps to obtain execution of the judgment in his favour.",

Turning to the instant case, the Court observes that the judgments in the applicant's favour were quashed and are no longer enforceable under domestic law.

The court therefore considers that the enforcement of the judgments of 15 May 2006 and 5 March 2007 will constitute the appropriate redress for the violations found.
