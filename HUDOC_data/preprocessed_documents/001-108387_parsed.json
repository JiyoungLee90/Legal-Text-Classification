In particular, the Court notes that, even though the applicant lodged his appeal on the same date of the delivery of the first instance judgment, this became final and a copy was available to him only two years and five months later. This resulted in delaying also the set of a hearing regarding the appellate proceedings.

Thus, the Court observes that national courts\u2019 handling of the case did not facilitate its timely completion.
