I do not remember exactly whether [Arayik Avetisyan] came first or [K.S.]. I was very scared by the incident and do not remember certain things ... [Arayik\u00a0Avetisyan] had come to the room to take some documents. As far as I remember there were four of us in the room: me, [K.S.], [Arayik Avetisyan] and [S.M.]. A bit later ... [S.H.] gave S.M. a Makarov gun ... to be given to ... [M.]. I understood that it was the gun assigned to [M.] ... [S.M.] put the gun on the table which was in front of the cupboard to the right of the entrance ... I do not remember exactly whether it was [S.H.] or [S.M.] who put the gun on the table, but it was one of them. Having approached the table, [Arayik Avetisyan] took the gun and said: \u2018This is my gun; what is it doing here?\u2019 He said that as a joke. At that moment [K.S.], who was next to [Arayik Avetisyan], took the gun from him and said: \u2018No, this is my gun\u2019. They were joking. At that point both of them were by the table, after which [Arayik\u00a0Avetisyan] moved backwards. I was standing by the window, next to the metal cupboard. Having taken the gun, [K.S.] loaded it and held the gun barrel up, towards [Arayik Avetisyan] after which a shot was fired. At that moment [Arayik\u00a0Avetisyan] was standing next to the computer desk with his back towards the metal cupboard, half-turned with his face towards [K.S.] ... As a result of the shot [Arayik Avetisyan] fell to the floor between the metal cupboard and the computer desk ... I realised that the bullet had hit [Arayik Avetisyan] ... I saw that ... the bullet had hit his forehead and there was bleeding. I bent to lift him up but realised that he was dead. There was no way out and I left the room because I was scared. I never went back to that room. I have heard that the doctor ... moved the body in order to provide assistance.\u201d",

In particular, the Regional Court did address the issue even though the applicant\u2019s former complaint against the decision of 10 February 2009 had been declared inadmissible for having been lodged out of time (see paragraph 52 above). In a situation where the investigative measures regarding the death of the applicant\u2019s son continue until the present day despite the formal decisions to stay the proceedings (see paragraphs 48 and 77 above) and, more importantly, where it is not clear what redress, if any, the applicant could have obtained had her appeal been granted and the proceedings resumed, the Court does not consider that lodging a timely appeal against the decision of 10 February 2009 constituted an effective remedy for her complaints concerning the inadequacy of the investigation into her son\u2019s death.

The authorities had failed to determine the circumstances surrounding his death. The investigation, which had lasted more than sixteen years, had failed to clarify the precise circumstances of her son\u2019s death. That failure had been expressly admitted by the authorities who had stayed the proceedings twice on the grounds that they had been unable to identify the person who had killed her son while the military police had been assigned to continue with operative measures in order to find the offender.",

One week later K.S. was charged with murder. He was eventually indicted for negligent homicide as a result of breach of rules for handling firearms (see paragraphs 16 and 33 above). The Court further notes that the domestic courts remitted the case to the prosecution three times in so far as the charges against K.S. were concerned, pointing to inconsistencies and deficiencies in the investigation which in the courts\u2019 opinion had to be addressed (see paragraphs 30, 34 and 41 above). The Court finds that the repeated judicial decisions whereby the case was remitted to the prosecution as a result of errors committed by the investigating authorities within one set of proceedings disclosed in the applicant\u2019s case a serious deficiency in the operation of the judicial system (see, mutatis mutandis, Wierciszewska v.\u00a0Poland, no. 41431/98, \u00a7 46, 25 November 2003).",

What is more, the authorities hastily accepted A.K.\u2019s further retraction of that statement without exploring any further the possibility of any pressure, psychological or other, on the witness (see paragraph 27 above). This becomes even more striking in the light of K.S.\u2019s statement made on 17 March 2011 when he denied the version of the events as described in all his previous statements and in fact implied that those had been submitted by him out of fear for his security and that of his family (see paragraph 63 above).",
