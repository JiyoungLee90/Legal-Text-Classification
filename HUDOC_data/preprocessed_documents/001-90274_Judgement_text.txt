The case originated in an application (no. 29907/05) against the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, lodged with the Court, under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”), by, at that time, a citizen of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, Mr Radenko Stanković (“the applicant”), on 1 August 2005.
As of 3 June 2006, following the Montenegrin declaration of independence,  remained the sole respondent in the proceedings before the Court.
The applicant was represented by Mr R. Spasojević, a lawyer practising in Valjevo. The Government of the State Union of Serbia and  and, subsequently, the Government of Serbia (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 15 March 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Mionica.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 7 November 2001 the applicant, a bus conductor, was dismissed by his employer, “Lasta Strela”, a transportation company based in Valjevo.
On 24 December 2001 he filed a claim with the Municipal Court in Valjevo (“the Municipal Court”), seeking reinstatement and payment of salary arrears.
Following a remittal of 14 April 2003, the next hearing in the case was scheduled by the Municipal Court for 27 September 2004.
Of the nine separate hearings scheduled between 27 September 2004 and 26 January 2006, it would appear that four were adjourned whilst five were held. As regards the former, two hearings were adjourned because the respondent and/or several witnesses had not been duly summoned and the other two because witnesses, of whom two were proposed by the applicant, had, though duly summoned, failed to appear in court (for which omission they were ultimately fined).
On 27 January 2006 the Municipal Court ruled against the applicant.
On 25 April 2006 the applicant was served with this judgment.
On 3 May 2006 the applicant filed an appeal with the District Court in Valjevo (“the District Court”).
On 18 December 2006 the District Court returned the case file to the Municipal Court, requesting it to submit certain missing documents.
On 29 March 2007 the District Court upheld the judgment rendered at first instance.
On 3 April 2008 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s appeal on points of law (revizija).
Article 122 § 3 provided that all employment-related disputes were to be resolved by the courts within a period of 6 months from the date of institution of the proceedings.
This Act entered into force on 23 March 2005 and thereby repealed the Labour Act 2001.
The text of Article 195 § 3 of the Labour Act 2005 corresponds to Article 122 § 3 of the Labour Act 2001.
