That court held that the indictment issued by the investigating authorities and the police officers\u2019 statements in this regard were not supported by any plausible evidence (see paragraph 30 above). The applicant was ultimately convicted of illegal possession of a quantity of narcotic substances exceeding that necessary for personal use, without intent to sell. His final conviction was therefore based on physical evidence, namely narcotic substances found on his person during a search carried out at the NDMIA on 23 June 2006. In convicting the applicant, the Assize Court also referred to the medical forensic opinion of 5\u00a0July 2006 which said that he was at the initial stages of drug addiction.",

It took place at 7.20 p.m. on 23 June 2006 at the NDMIA, nowhere near his place of arrest. In this connection, the Court notes that it has already found in a case against Azerbaijan that the police\u2019s failure to conduct a search immediately following an arrest without good reason raises legitimate concerns about the possible \u201cplanting\u201d of evidence (see Layijov v. Azerbaijan, no. 22062/07, \u00a7\u00a069, 10 April 2014). The Court considers that these findings are also relevant to the present case. In fact, the time lapse of around twenty minutes between the arrest and search raises legitimate concerns about the possible \u201cplanting\u201d of the evidence, because the applicant was completely under the control of the police during that time. Moreover, there is nothing to suggest that there were any special circumstances rendering it impossible to carry out a search immediately after the applicant\u2019s arrest. The Court further observes that the domestic courts failed to examine a copy of the videorecording of the search despite the applicant\u2019s explicit request in this regard (see paragraphs 31-32 above). Furthermore, the Government also failed to provide a copy to the Court when specifically requested to do so.",
