Those reviews took place in June 1998 and April 2000, a gap of 22 months, and the administrative procedures preceding those reviews were entirely separate. He therefore did not understand the rationale for the Government distinguishing between DLP hearings and the Parole Board review. He submitted that the fact that the second review started one year after his arrival in category C conditions was immaterial. There was no explanation for the delay in transfer to those conditions and in any event it was for the Government to ensure that its procedures were properly organised and resourced. One year to reinforce and test work already completed was more than sufficient. He further contended that the fact that the Parole Board did not recommend his release, nor an early review of his detention, in April 2000 was irrelevant to the question of whether the 22\u00a0month period between the 1998 and 2000 reviews complied with Article\u00a05 \u00a7 4.",

The Court in the Herczegfalvy case (cited above, pp. 24-25, \u00a7 77) found that periods between reviews of fifteen months and two years were not reasonable in the case of a person detained on grounds of mental illness. In the cases of Oldham v. the United Kingdom (no. 36273/97, judgment of 26 September 2000) and Hirst v. the United Kingdom, cited above), concerning discretionary life prisoners, the Court found that 21 month and 2 year delays between reviews were not reasonable.
