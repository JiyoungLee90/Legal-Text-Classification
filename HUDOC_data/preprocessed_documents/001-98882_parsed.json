There had been Russian military checkpoints at the roads leading to and from Gekhi. The armed men who had abducted Beslan Khutsayev, Movsar Khutsayev and Adam Didayev had Slavic features and had spoken Russian without an accent, which proved that they were not of Chechen origin.

The applicants consistently indicated to the Court and to the national investigation that they had started to look for their relatives from 16 December 2001 by applying to various State bodies in Gekhi and in Urus-Martan (see paragraph 32 above). The investigation in case no.\u00a061030 was instituted on 25 February 2002, that is, more than two months after Beslan Khutsayev, Movsar Khutsayev and Adam Didayev's abduction. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of a kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It also appears that within the following month two applicants were questioned and granted victim status. However, it appears that after that a number of crucial steps, including questioning of other witnesses, examination of the sites and medical examinations of the victims, were unacceptably delayed and were conducted only in January and February 2007 \u2013 that is, more than five years after the event (see paragraphs 70, 72-75 and 77 above). It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

Thus, it failed to identify and question the servicemen who had manned the roadblock to which the witnesses referred, to find out whether any special operations had been carried out in Gekhi on the night in question, and to identify and question any of the servicemen who had been involved in the detention of Beslan Khutsayev, Movsar Khutsayev and Adam Didayev or their fellow detainees. The investigation also inexplicably failed to pursue the information about the findings of clothes and human remains in April 2002, even though the relatives recognised some of the items of clothes as those belonging to Movsar and Beslan Khutsayev (see paragraph 24 above).",

The Government argued that the applicants could have sought judicial review of the decisions of the investigating authorities in the context of the exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court observes that the applicants did, in fact, make use of that remedy, which eventually led to the resumption of the investigation (see paragraph 84 above). However, the Town Court's instructions to the district prosecutor's office to investigate the crime effectively did not bring any tangible results for the applicants. The investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, but it appears that no significant investigative measures were taken to identify those responsible for the kidnapping. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants could not be required to challenge in court every single decision of the district prosecutor's office. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

The official bodies denied that those who had intruded into the applicants' home and abducted their relatives were State agents (see, by contrast, Chitayev and Chitayev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a059334/00, \u00a7\u00a7 64, 77 and\u00a0143, 18 January 2007).
