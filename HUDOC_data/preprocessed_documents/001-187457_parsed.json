Furthermore, the Government observed that the applicant had been assisted by a lawyer on 19\u00a0April\u00a02008 when he had been informed of the accusations against him. In addition, by contrast with the applicant in the case of Argintaru v.\u00a0Romania ((dec.) no. 26622/09, 8 January 2013), in his subsequent testimonies before the investigative authorities the applicant in the current case had not substantially changed his first statement.

In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant in the current case complained before the domestic courts of the lack of access to a lawyer during his initial questioning by the police and requested that his initial statement be excluded from the evidence to be considered during the trial (see paragraph 14 above). He reiterated his complaint in the appeal and cassation proceedings (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above). The Tulcea County Court and the Constan\u0163a Court of Appeal did not address the applicant\u2019s specific allegation and merely mentioned, in a general manner, that he had had access to a lawyer when he had been formally informed of the charges against him and throughout the proceedings (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above). The High Court of Cassation and Justice, deciding on the applicant\u2019s case with final effect, considered that all the statements taken during the pre-trial stage of the proceedings had been in compliance with the law since the applicant had not been detained and therefore legal representation had not been mandatory in his case (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). The Court considers that in making only general statements and invoking the non-mandatory aspect of the legal representation in the applicant\u2019s situation the domestic courts did not repair the consequences resulting from the absence of a lawyer during the applicant\u2019s initial questioning by the police (see, mutatis mutandis, S\u00eerghi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a052; and contrast Ibrahim and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 282-284).",

In that regard, the Court observes that in his subsequent statements given in the presence of his lawyer, the applicant partially retracted his initial confession as concerns the accusation of importing the LSD tabs and alleged that he wasn\u2019t aware of the presence of these tabs in his luggage (see paragraph 10 above).

The above-mentioned principle is even more relevant in the current case since before the domestic courts it was not in dispute that the assistance of an interpreter was necessary for the applicant who, throughout the entire trial before them, was assigned an interpreter (see paragraph\u00a026 above and compare Baytar, cited above, \u00a7 51). In this connection, the Government argued that the domestic courts had thoroughly analysed the applicant\u2019s complaints and found that the proceedings as a whole had been fair (see paragraph 36 above). The Court notes however that, as in the case of the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the lack of assistance of a lawyer (see paragraph 45 above), the domestic courts made only general statements about the proceedings as a whole and did not specifically examine the particular context in which the initial statement in question had been given by the applicant and its possible repercussions on the overall fairness of the proceedings (see paragraphs 17, 19, 23 and 24 above).",
