In its view, the absence of any specific regulation of detention matters in Article 466 \u00a7 1 did not create a legal lacuna incompatible with the Constitution. Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Minsk Convention provided that, in executing a request for legal assistance, the requested party would apply its domestic law, which in the case of Russia was the procedure laid down in the CCrP. That procedure comprised, in particular, Article 466 \u00a7 1 of the Code and the norms in its Chapter 13 (\u201cMeasures of restraint\u201d) which, by virtue of their general character and position in Part I of the Code (\u201cGeneral provisions\u201d), applied to all stages and forms of criminal proceedings, including proceedings for the examination of extradition requests.

Since the nature of the Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under Article 3 in cases of this kind lies in the act of exposing an individual to the risk of ill-treatment, the existence of the risk must be assessed primarily with reference to those facts which were known or ought to have been known to the Contracting State at the time of the extradition (see Cruz Varas and Others v.

In this respect, the Court reiterates that diplomatic assurances are not in themselves sufficient to ensure adequate protection against the risk of ill-treatment, and there is an obligation to examine whether they provide, in their practical application, a sufficient guarantee that the applicant will be protected against any such risk (see Othman (Abu Qatada) v. the United Kingdom, no. 8139/09, \u00a7 187, 17\u00a0January 2012).",

In the present case the Court is inclined to consider that the assurances given by the Belarusian authorities were more of a general nature (compare, for example, Klein v. Russia, no. 24268/08, \u00a7 55, 1 April 2010). Moreover, the Government did not indicate whether there existed any specific mechanisms \u2013 either diplomatic or monitoring \u2013 by which compliance with those assurances could be objectively checked (see, by contrast, Othman (Abu Qatada), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 199 and 203-04). Their vague reference to the fact that they had not encountered any problems in their previous cooperation with the Belarusian authorities in similar matters (see paragraph 48 above) is not sufficient for the Court to dispel doubts about those assurances.

In support of his allegations that he risked ill-treatment, the applicant described his previous encounters with the police prior to his move to .

The Court, however, is not convinced by the authenticity or evidentiary value of that certificate, given that it had not been stamped or signed by an official authority of the party. The same doubts were expressed by the Russian courts. The Court\u2019s qualms are further strengthened by the following consideration: apart from a vague statement that he took part in the political activities of the opposition parties in Belarus from 1998 to 2000 and again in 2010, the applicant failed to provide any further information in that respect \u2013 such as details about his political activities, the dates and places of the opposition meetings, rallies and demonstrations, dates of his visits to Belarus to take part in the political life of the country, the nature of his alleged financial contribution, or any other relevant data to support his allegation that he was an active member of the opposition movement (see, by contrast, Y.P. and L.P. v. France, no.\u00a032476/06, \u00a7\u00a7 10-13, 2 September 2010). In the same vein, the applicant\u2019s submissions that he had already been a victim of ill-treatment on his previous encounters with the Belarusian police are uncorroborated. Once again he omitted to provide any description of the alleged events, except for the torture technique allegedly used on him by police officers. In the Court\u2019s view, the lack of such information strips the applicant\u2019s submissions of credence. This conclusion is not altered by the fact that on 14 May 2012 the Russian FMS granted the applicant temporary asylum status. The Court is not persuaded by the applicant\u2019s argument that the impugned decision can be regarded as indicative of a personal risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. It interprets the decision of 14 May 2012 as no more than the Russian authorities\u2019 attempt to provide the applicant with a lawful basis on which to continue residing in  while the proceedings before the Court were pending.",

This provision does not require the detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to extradition to be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or absconding. In this connection, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c): all that is required under sub-paragraph (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d.

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is at issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law.

The offences with which the applicant was charged in Belarus were regarded as \u201cserious\u201d offences under Russian law, on which basis his detention was extended to twelve months, in accordance with Article 109 \u00a7 3 of the CCrP (see paragraph 35 above) and after the expiry of that term he was released (see paragraph 25 above).

Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention. However, where domestic law provides for an appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, for instance as concerns the speediness of the review in appeal proceedings. Accordingly, in order to determine whether the requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d has been complied with, it is necessary to effect an overall assessment where the proceedings have been conducted at more than one level of jurisdiction (see Mooren v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7 106, 9 July 2009). At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to proceedings before a court of appeal (see Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7 96, with further references).",

In fact, the Government admitted the domestic courts\u2019 failure to speedily examine the detention matters in the applicant\u2019s case. In this respect, the Court notes that the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure requires a first-instance court to transfer the detention file to a higher court after the expiry of the three-day time-limit for appeal against a detention order and that it lays down an obligation on a second-instance court to examine an appeal against a detention order within three days after the transfer of the file (see paragraph 36 above). The Russian courts did not comply with those requirements in the present case. In these circumstances the Court concludes that the periods in question cannot be considered compatible with the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 4, especially given that their duration was entirely attributable to the authorities (see, for similar reasoning, Niyazov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 27843/11, \u00a7 163, 16 October 2012, with further references).",
