In his appeal against the decision of 16 July 2001 the applicant challenged the necessity of his continued detention in the EBI. He also stated that he was suffering both physically and mentally as a result of the EBI detention regime without, however, substantiating that claim. Relying on the findings of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCPT\u201d) in respect of its visit to the EBI in 1997 and on the Court\u2019s decision on admissibility of 28 August 2001 in the case of Van der Ven v. the Netherlands (no.\u00a050901/99), he argued that his (continued) detention in the EBI infringed his rights under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention on account of the EBI detention regime.",

It held, on the basis of the different elements set out in the impugned decision, that the applicant was extremely likely to try to escape and, in view of the offences of which he was suspected, that he posed an unacceptable risk in terms of the danger of his committing further serious violent crimes. Noting that the applicant was suspected of offences in respect of which a twenty-year prison sentence had been imposed at first instance and which were a source of grave concern to society and public opinion, the Appeals Board was of the opinion that the applicant, in the event of an escape, would pose an unacceptable risk to society. It also took into account the fact that specific threats to kill the applicant or to have him killed had repeatedly come to light. It therefore concluded that the applicant\u2019s stay in the EBI corresponded to both situations provided for in Article 6 (a) and (b) of the Regulation on the selection, placement and transfer of detainees (Regeling selectie, plaatsing en overplaatsing van gedetineerden) of 15 August 2000. As regards the applicant\u2019s reliance on the Convention, it held that the proceedings on the extension of the applicant\u2019s stay in the EBI fell outside the scope of Article 6 of the Convention and that the interference with the rights guaranteed by Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was permissible to the extent that such interference was in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society in the interests of, inter alia, the prevention of disorder or crime. Lastly, it held that the decision to extend the applicant\u2019s stay in the EBI was lawful and that, weighing up all the interests involved, it could not be considered as unreasonable or unjust. It did not deal with the applicant\u2019s argument that the extension of his stay in the EBI was contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.",

The Supreme Court found that this was not possible, holding that it was solely for the legislature to decide in what cases a remedy was to be provided.

Although it agreed with the Netherlands State that the judge responsible for provisional measures had incorrectly assumed that Article 41 of the Convention gave Mr Lors\u00e9 an (independent) right to redress which, if need be, could be asserted before the domestic judge, it held that this could not lead to the setting-aside of the judgment as, pursuant to the Convention, the State was obliged to provide redress. However, relying on the Court\u2019s reasoning in the cases of Papamichalopoulos and Others v. Greece ((Article 50), judgment of 31 October 1995, Series A no.\u00a0330B) and Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy ([GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, ECHR 2000VIII), the Supreme Court considered that, although the State was in principle free to determine the manner in which redress was to be provided, that freedom did not mean that the domestic judge was unable to take a decision on that point, but simply that a suitable form of redress was to be sought within the domestic legal order. As the Netherlands State had acted unlawfully towards Mr Lors\u00e9 in so far as his rights under Article 3 had been violated, as found by the Court, Mr Lors\u00e9 was entitled to claim compensation from the State, which would be acting unlawfully if it failed to provide a suitable form of redress. The Supreme Court accepted that such compensation could be granted in a manner other than the payment of a sum of money. In cases such as the present one, where the violation found concerned the manner of execution of a custodial sentence, it could take the form of cessation of the execution of the sentence. The Supreme Court found that the order of the judge responsible for provisional measures to cease execution of the prison sentence should be regarded as a suitable form of compensation in kind in the case of Mr Lors\u00e9. As regards the argument raised by the State that the closed system of legal remedies and the corresponding obligation for the State to execute rulings of the criminal courts precluded the form of redress claimed by Mr Lors\u00e9, the Supreme Court \u2013 while acknowledging that there was a difference between a situation in which the violation found concerned a domestic criminal conviction itself or the proceedings having led to that conviction [as in the case of Van Mechelen and Others] and a situation in which the violation found was unrelated to such a conviction or proceedings [as in the case of Mr Lors\u00e9] \u2013 held that this difference did not mean that the judge responsible for provisional measures had based point 3.5 of the impugned ruling on an incorrect interpretation of the law. Given the particular circumstances of the case, the violation of Article 3 found by the Court and the fact that there was no specific statutory remedy for determining redress for such a violation, the Supreme Court concluded that in that case an exception to the closed system of legal remedies could be accepted. It further found that the judge responsible for provisional measures had given sufficient reasons as to the determination of the compensation awarded to Mr Lors\u00e9.",

For instance, steps were being taken to increase staff/inmate communication through a training programme known as \u201cSafety at the door\u201d, as well as by the previously-mentioned adaptations of the exercise yards. Further, a slight expansion of the types of activities offered had made it possible for inmates to practice playing musical instruments in their cells.

The purpose of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court. The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies is, however, limited to making use of those remedies which are likely to be effective and available, meaning that their existence is sufficiently certain and they are capable of redressing directly the alleged violation of the Convention.",

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see, for instance, Reilly v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 53731/00, 26 June 2003).",

Under Article 46, the High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final judgments of the Court in any case to which they are parties, the execution being supervised by the Committee of Ministers. One of the effects of this is that where the Court finds a violation, the respondent State has a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction under Article 41, but also to select, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in their domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress so far as possible the effects. The respondent State remains free, subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment (see Scordino, cited above, \u00a7 233).

Furthermore, such measures should be such as to remedy the Court\u2019s finding of a violation in respect of a general practice, so that the system established by the Convention is not compromised by a large number of repetitive applications stemming from the same cause. Such measures must therefore include a mechanism for providing injured persons with compensation for the violation of the Convention established in the cases of Van der Ven and Lors\u00e9 and Others. In that connection the Court\u2019s concern is to facilitate the rapid and effective correction of a defect identified in the national system of human-rights protection.
