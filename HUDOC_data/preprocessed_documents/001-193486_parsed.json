Firstly, they submitted that lodging a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor against the governor of the Edirne Prison for intercepting the letters could not be considered an effective remedy for the purpose of application no. 4356/06 and that therefore the six-month time-limit for lodging an application with the Court could not start to run from the public prosecutor\u2019s decision not to prosecute. They submitted that an objection, which was an ordinary remedy against a decision of the enforcement court, had been available but that the first and third applicants had not filed an objection against either of the decisions of the Edirne Enforcement Court of 25 October 2005 and 9 May 2007. They further argued that the date on which application no. 4536/06 had been lodged should not be taken as 23 November 2005, when the applicants\u2019 representative had sent a letter to the Committee of Ministers, but as 19\u00a0October 2006, when the applicants\u2019 representative had sent an application form to the Court (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above). They therefore submitted that the application, in so far as it had been lodged by the first and third applicants, should in any event be rejected for non-compliance with the six-month rule since the impugned decisions of the Edirne Enforcement Court had been served on those applicants on 17\u00a0November 2005 and 18 May 2007, but the applications had been lodged with the Court only on 19 October 2006 and 21 November 2007. The Government further argued that none of the applicants could claim to be victims since they had ultimately been able to submit forms of authority to the Court (see paragraph 27 above).",

According to the Government, it was evident from the letters sent by the applicants\u2019 representatives that they had been attempting to contact the applicants before they had expressed any wish to lodge an application with the Court. In that respect the Government argued that such conduct on the part of the applicants\u2019 representatives could be regarded as soliciting, which was prohibited under domestic law (see paragraph 30 above). Finally, they argued that the interception of the letters had had a legal basis in domestic law, specifically section 59(4) of Law no. 5275, which provided that certain restrictions could be applied by enforcement courts to correspondence between prisoners convicted of terrorism-related offences and their lawyers. Lastly, they argued that Article 34 of the Convention could not be relied on alone but only in conjunction with a substantive complaint under the Convention or its Protocols.",

Russia [GC], no. 30078/06, \u00a7 159, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). An applicant\u2019s position might be particularly vulnerable when he is held in custody with limited contact with his family or the outside world (see Cotle\u0163 v.

The Contracting Party\u2019s procedural obligations under Articles 34 and 38 of the Convention must be enforced irrespective of the eventual outcome of the proceedings, and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or potential chilling effect on the applicants or their representatives (see, among other authorities, Rasul Jafarov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0185).",

Furthermore, it is not in dispute that those letters were not handed over to the applicants and that the forms of authority were withheld from the applicants by the decisions of the Edirne Enforcement Court on the ground that the letters could not be categorised as falling within a lawyer\u2019s permitted professional activities and that the applicants\u2019 lawyers had allegedly put pressure on the applicants to lodge a case before the Court. Therefore, the issue before the Court is whether the impediments to the correspondence between the applicants and their representatives, by means of the decisions of the domestic courts, amounted to a failure to comply with the respondent State\u2019s obligation not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of the right of petition under Article 34 of the Convention.",

The Government submitted in that connection that the lawyers were trying to solicit business by contacting the applicants before the applicants had expressed a wish to complain about the authorities\u2019 decision before the Court. The Court notes however that the Government\u2019s arguments are not supported by the decisions of the domestic courts which did not make any finding on that basis, namely whether the lawyers were retained by the applicants prior to their decision to lodge a complaint with the Court. Likewise the domestic courts did not refer to the relevant provisions of the Lawyers Act which prohibit lawyers from soliciting business. In the absence of such findings by the domestic courts, and having regard to the fact that the applicants claimed that their lawyers in question had been their lawyers prior to the interception of the letters sent by the association, the Court accordingly rejects the Government\u2019s arguments on this issue. On the other hand, the Court considers it unacceptable from the standpoint of the protection of the right of individual petition that the domestic courts took it upon themselves to decide for the applicants whether or not they should lodge an application with the Court. It goes without saying that it is for the individual to decide whether to take a course of action concerning an alleged violation of his or her Convention rights. It is also of particular concern to the Court that the domestic court which ordered the measure to intercept the letters addressed to the applicants was the very same court in respect of whose decisions the applicants wanted to complain in the context of their original application to the Court. The Court finds that by acting as they did, the domestic courts attempted to discourage, or even prevent, the applicants from pursuing a Convention remedy.",
