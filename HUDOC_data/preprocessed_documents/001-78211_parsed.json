Insofar as the applicant complained about the failure of the authorities to prosecute Z., the Court recalls that the Convention does not guarantee, as such, the right to bring criminal proceedings against a third person. Finally, as regards the complaint under Article 8 of the Convention about the supervisory review proceedings of 13 September 2001, the Court recalls that the existence of \u201chome\u201d for the purposes of the Convention depends on whether there is a continuous and sufficient link with a particular place, there being no need for it to be lawfully established (see Prokopovich v. Russia, no. 58255/00, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2004...). On the facts, the Court observes that from the materials in its possession it transpires that the applicant's only place of residence was in the town of Kholmsk in the Sakhalin Region and there is nothing to suggest that at the relevant period she undertook any steps with a view to moving to the house in dispute in Azov or, indeed, resided there on a permanent basis. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the proceedings of 13 September 2001 did not concern the applicant's \u201chome\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention.",
