The letter of 23 April 1980 stating his wish to withdraw his application (see paragraph 23 above) afforded proof of this, in that Mr. Corigliano gave as the reason the disappearance of the object of the dispute (materia  contendere) as a result of his acquittal on 19 February 1980 by the Messina Court of Appeal (see paragraph 21 above). Although he retracted his letter of withdrawal shortly thereafter on 20 May 1980 (see paragraph 23 above), he did so solely on account of the institution of a fourth set of proceedings against him, which, so the Government pointed out, clearly had \"nothing to do with the length\" of the third set.

In criminal matters, in order to assess whether the \"reasonable time\" requirement contained in Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) has been complied with, one must begin by ascertaining from which moment the person was \"charged\"; this may have occurred on a date prior to the case coming before the trial court (see, for example, the Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 22, \u00a7 42), such as the date of arrest, the date when the person concerned was officially notified that he would be prosecuted or the date when the preliminary investigations were opened (see the Wemhoff judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 7, pp. 26-27, \u00a7 19, the Neumeister judgment of the same date, Series A no. 8, p. 41, \u00a7 18, and the Ringeisen judgment of 16 July 1971, Series A no. 13, p. 45, \u00a7 110).

Furthermore, as the Government have rightly emphasised, the facts of the case give cause to believe that observance of the \"reasonable time\" requirement did not constitute one of his primary concerns (see paragraphs 30-31 above). The same remark applies to the alleged non-pecuniary damage; in any event, this damage has, in the opinion of the Court, already been sufficiently repaired by the finding of a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) (see notably, mutatis mutandis, the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere judgment of 18 October 1982, Series A no. 54, p. 8, \u00a7 16).",

However, he incurred no such costs in , and before the Convention institutions he argued his case in person. On the other hand, he is entitled to reimbursement of the travel and subsistence expenses he had to meet in attending the hearings on 12 April 1980 before the Commission and on 21 April 1982 before the Court, these expenses not having been borne by the Council of Europe (see the above-mentioned Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere judgment, ibid., pp. 9-10 and 11, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 25).
