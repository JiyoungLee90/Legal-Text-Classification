A failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.

There is a striking consistency in the times given for the second raid. Hakim\u00a0\u0130pek referred to the return of the soldiers around 4 or 5 p.m. The applicant and Sevgol \u0130pek considered that they came back around 6 p.m. Mehmet Nuri Yolur and Abdulkerim Yolur did not testify as to the time of the second raid, since they had been taken away following the morning operation.

Secondly, the domestic authorities never conducted any meaningful investigation into the applicant's complaint. On Turgut Alp\u0131's own admission, he never visited the hamlet, relying rather on his belief that the hamlets and villages in the area were uninhabited and that it would have been pointless to travel to the applicant's hamlet. It is also to be observed that all three witnesses heard by the Delegates were convinced in their own minds that the damage caused to the property in the hamlet was probably the work of the PKK. Although there was undoubtedly terrorist activity in the area, the Government have not produced any proof whatsoever that the PKK descended on the hamlet on 18 May 1994 and burned it down. ",

The Court does not attach any significance to Mehmet Nuri Yolur's statement to the Delegates that he set off with the soldiers around 9 to 10 a.m. This is an obvious inaccuracy. It is significant for the Court that the applicant and his witnesses never adverted to the use of violence by the security forces to remove the applicant's two sons and the other four inhabitants.

Turkey (judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, \u00a7 108), in which the Court held that there were insufficient persuasive indications that the applicant's son had met his death in detention. The Court notes that in the aforementioned Kurt case, the applicant's son \u00dczeyir Kurt was last seen surrounded by soldiers and village guards in his own village. In the instant case, however, the applicant's two sons and four other villagers were seen being taken away by soldiers (see paragraph 153 above). It has also been established that the \u0130pek brothers were last seen in the hands of the security forces in an unidentified military establishment (see paragraph 156). Although the Court is unable to determine the fate of the applicant's two sons, given the general context of the situation in south-east Turkey in 1994, there are strong grounds for believing that their unacknowledged detention would be life-threatening (Orhan, cited above, \u00a7 330; Timurta\u015f, cited above, \u00a7\u00a085 and the \u00c7i\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7 146). It would recall in this connection that it has held in earlier judgments that defects undermining the effectiveness of criminal law protection in the south-east during the relevant period, permitted or fostered a lack of accountability of members of the security forces for their actions (Cemil K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v.

Consequently, the responsibility of the respondent State for their death is engaged. Noting that the authorities have not provided any explanation as to what occurred following the \u0130pek brothers' apprehension, and that they do not rely on any ground of justification in respect of any use of lethal force by their agents, it follows that liability for their death is attributable to the respondent Government (Timurta\u015f, \u00a7 86, and \u00c7i\u00e7ek, at \u00a7\u00a0147, Orhan, \u00a7 331, judgments cited above).

The investigations carried out by the Diyarbak\u0131r and Lice public prosecutors and later by Lieutenant-Colonel Turgut Alp\u0131 did not go beyond the acceptance of the confirmations received by them that the applicant's sons did not appear in the custody records or wanted lists of the Diyarbak\u0131r DGM, the Diyarbak\u0131r Public Order Command, the Lice District gendarmerie command and other security forces in the region (see paragraphs 32 and\u00a052).

However, there were striking omissions and defects in the conduct of the investigation. It would observe in this connection that no serious attempts were made by the prosecuting authorities to question the applicant in relation to his complaints (see paragraph 36 above). The first attempt was made by the  chief public prosecutor who gave police officers from the  police headquarters the address of the applicant which appeared on the application form, and instructed them to summon the applicant to his office. However, the officers were unable to find the applicant since the public prosecutor wrongly recorded in his letter the name of the block of flats where the applicant lived (see paragraphs 39 and 40). In a further attempt on 8\u00a0March 1996, another person with a name similar to that of the applicant was questioned by LieutenantColonel Alp\u0131. However, this person was seventeen years younger than the applicant and had no children. The Court finds it unsatisfactory that this person's statements were partly relied upon by Lieutenant-Colonel Turgut Alp\u0131 in his decision to discontinue the investigation (see paragraph 54 above). It is also noteworthy that the Lice Governor ordered the publication in a newspaper of the decision of 16 December 1996 to discontinue the investigation on the ground that the authorities were unable to find the applicant (see paragraph\u00a034 above). However, this contradicts the Government's assertion that they took a statement from the applicant on 8\u00a0March 1996, i.e. two months previously. In the Court's opinion, these facts are demonstrative of a lack of due diligence and vigour in this investigation. Finally, on 26 December 1999 the applicant was called to the Kulp gendarmerie station and his statements were taken in regard to his allegations (see paragraph 36 above). However, no follow-up was given to this interview.",

However, the Court has already found in previous cases against Turkey that this body cannot be regarded as independent as it is made up of civil servants hierarchically dependent on the governor, an executive officer linked to the very security forces under investigation (see, among others, Orhan, cited above \u00a7 342, G\u00fcle\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 77-82, and O\u011fur, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0855-93). It considers that, in the circumstances of the present case, that Council's appointment of a lieutenant-colonel, Mr Turgut Alp\u0131, as investigator was inappropriate given that the allegations were directed against the security forces of which he was a member. In this regard, the willingness of Lieutenant-Colonel Alp\u0131 to give credence to the accounts offered by the security forces confirms the Court's above findings (see paragraph 139 above).",

It has stressed in that connection that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. In order to minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5. Bearing in mind the responsibility of the authorities to account for individuals under their control, Article 5 requires them to take effective measures to safeguard against the risk of disappearance and to conduct a prompt and effective investigation into an arguable claim that a person has been taken into custody and has not been seen since (Kurt, \u00a7\u00a7 122-125, cited above, and, also cited above, \u00c7akici, \u00a7\u00a0104, Akdeniz and Others, \u00a7 106, \u00c7i\u00e7ek, \u00a7 164, Orhan, \u00a7\u00a7 367-369).",

Their detention there was not logged in the relevant custody records and there exists no official trace of their subsequent whereabouts or fate. In the view of the Court, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of holding data recording such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see the above-cited judgments of Kurt, \u00a7 125; Timurta\u015f, \u00a7 105; \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, \u00a7\u00a0105; \u00c7i\u00e7ek, \u00a7 165 and Orhan, \u00a7 371).
