They argued that there was evidence before the police interview of the applicant\u2019s involvement in the incident such as to give rise to a case to answer. The Government noted in this connection that there was evidence from the applicant himself that he had been present during the events in question and that a description given by the victim of one of his assailants plainly fitted the applicant. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s fingerprints were found on the frame of the window from which the victim fell. These and other incriminating matters were put to the applicant at the first interview and the evidence against him clearly called for an explanation.

He had the benefit of legal assistance at the police station. The burden of proof lay with the prosecution throughout the trial and the jury was reminded in substance that it could only draw an adverse inference if satisfied that the applicant\u2019s silence could only be sensibly attributed to him having no answer or none that would withstand scrutiny and that he later fabricated his defence after waiting to see how the evidence against him emerged. The jury was also told that if it was satisfied that the applicant\u2019s reason for not answering questions (receipt of legal advice) was a good one, it could not hold it against the applicant by drawing an adverse inference. Furthermore, Mr Mohamoud\u2019s identification of the applicant constituted a compelling case against the applicant and no plausible explanation was advanced by the defence as to why Mr\u00a0Mohamoud would have thrown himself out of the window of his own volition.

They found support for this proposition in the above-mentioned Condron judgment and pointed out that the jury was in any event well aware that the applicant had spoken to his solicitor before the police interview and had been advised not to answer questions. They stressed, in addition, that the trial judge left it open to the jury to decline to draw any adverse inferences against the applicant because of the legal advice even though no evidence had been adduced by the applicant about the content of the advice. On this last point, the Government emphasised that the applicant could have explained in court the reasons for his solicitor\u2019s advice and why he had chosen to follow it. Alternatively, he could have called his solicitor to testify to these matters. The applicant\u2019s failure to pursue either course cannot engage the responsibility of the Government.

Had it been put to him during interview, it would have been capable of constituting a fact relied on in his defence in response to police questioning and may have prevented the drawing of an adverse inference at his trial. The applicant further stressed that interview questions cannot in themselves constitute evidence that call for an answer, otherwise the only requirement for an inference to be fair and proper is that questions were asked but not answered. Given that he was presumed innocent at the time of the interview and that no burden lay on him to prove his innocence, he was entitled to await any prosecution evidence such as, for example, a positive identification, before admitting his presence at the scene. In these circumstances he had been properly advised by his solicitor not to answer the questions put to him by the police at the first interview.",

By informing the jury of this, the trial judge effectively withdrew the jury\u2019s consideration of whether the fact of legal advice was capable of preventing an adverse inference.

Moreover, the applicant had been willing at his trial to testify to the content of his solicitor\u2019s advice.

In their view, it was unnecessary to instruct leading and junior counsel to work on the case, especially since one of them had extensive experience in dealing with the sort of complaint declared admissible by the Court. Furthermore, it was unreasonable to charge for almost eighty-four hours\u2019 work on the case. In their submission, the fees claimed by counsel would have been more appropriately fixed at two thirds of the hourly rates charged. The Government also questioned why it was necessary for the solicitor involved in the case to submit a claim for one hour\u2019s travelling time. ",
