However, it seems to me that we cannot be sure whether the Court was put under direct pressure. The first point is important to find out the nature of the present regime in Turkey. From a legal point of view, however, what is more important is how the Constitutional Court gave such a judgment. In other words, the people who should be criticised and who should be held responsible are the eight judges at the Court, all of whom are \u2018adults\u2019 and \u2018sensible\u2019. The real issue is to examine to what extent the professional backgrounds and intellectual capacities of these individuals are sufficient for such a job and to question whether they had the right to act in accordance with their prejudices. This can be done only through analysing the judgment from a legal point of view. As a matter of fact, the reasons for judgment have not yet been published. But there is nothing wrong in subjecting the judgment to such an analysis in its form as pronounced to the public. Besides, I do not think that the reasons for judgment when they are published in a few weeks\u2019 time will invalidate our first analysis. Our observations and information regarding the previous judicial approach of the Court demonstrate that the reasoning in the judgment will be \u2018prearranged\u2019. In other words, in the established practice of the Court the thing which is termed \u2018the reasoning\u2019 is fabricated and formulated at subsequent stages to justify the predetermined judgment [made] on the basis of prior opinions.

This means that a distinction was made between continuation in the sociological sense and the continuation of a political tradition, and continuation in a technical legal sense among consecutive political parties. This is an extraordinarily appropriate legal understanding. If this is the case, it means that the Constitutional Court considered that the Fazilet Party, while continuing the political line represented by Milli Nizam (national order) and the Milli Selamet Party in the sociological and political sense, was not the continuation of the Refah Party with another title.",

According to this view, the Constitution stipulates that \u2018a party which was dissolved cannot be re-established under another title\u2019, but neither the Constitution nor the Law on Political Parties require that the sanction of dissolution be applied to such a party if it has acted contrary to the Constitution. If this was the reason for which the Constitutional Court refused the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s request to dissolve the Fazilet Party on the basis of it being a continuation of the Refah Party, this only demonstrates that the court did not, at least, violate the positive law in this respect.

This judgment is faulty on two grounds. Firstly, the activity which is claimed to be \u2018contrary to secularism\u2019 \u2013 in fact, it is only comprised of words [and] statements \u2013 does not have such characteristics. Most of them concern expressions of concern [about] the social consequences of the lack of freedom created by the prohibition on wearing the headscarf. In other words, these statements have the nature of being demands for freedom voiced by Members of Parliament \u2013 mostly from the podium of Parliament. Criticism of a prohibition, especially if it is voiced by members of parliament, cannot be contrary to any democratic and constitutional regime. As long as it is voiced in a peaceful way, a demand for freedom cannot be contrary to the principles of secularism and democracy, even if the right or freedom which constitutes the subject of the demand has not been recognised in positive law. Besides, wearing the headscarf is not prohibited for university students in Turkish law. The prohibition on wearing the headscarf which has been implemented in Turkey in recent years is not a requirement of the current legal order, but it is a result of current power relations. In other words, the existence of this prohibition is a de facto and not a de jure phenomenon.",

Even in this case, the fact that some MPs or party members are making such criticism individually does not make the party \u201ca hub\u201d of that activity. In fact, being the \u201chub\u201d or \u201cfocus\u201d of any kind of activity for an organisation means the following: that the activity arose from the centre of that organisation, it is directed, controlled and administered by that centre; and that the activity is performed intensively, decisively and continuously. The facts in the trial record clearly demonstrate that these criteria did not apply to the legal personality of the Fazilet Party. Apart from [the fact that it was] far from being in a position to become the \u201chub\u201d of the [relevant] activity, the Fazilet Party did not become a determined follower of the issue of the headscarf ban in addition to many other issues. In fact, this party has been the most \u201cobedient\u201d party of the system for the last three years and did not hold a clear and decisive view on any major issue, probably because of the fear of being dissolved.",

In other words, according to the Constitutional Court, the election of a citizen who wears a headscarf as an MP and her attempt to take the oath in Parliament while wearing the headscarf are contrary to secularism. This is an unsound understanding for many reasons. First of all, if \u201cnational sovereignty\u201d is one of the true \u2013 not fake \u2013 basic principles of Turkey\u2019s constitutional order, no constitutional organ, particularly the Constitutional Court, whose legitimate authority stems from this principle, can impose any restrictions on the nation\u2019s right to elect its representatives. Merve Kavak\u00e7\u0131 was put forward as a candidate by the Fazilet Party, but she was elected by the Turkish nation. If the Constitutional Court had found this fact to be contrary to secularism, it would have \u201cannulled\u201d the nation. Secondly, there is no provision in the Constitution stipulating that a person who wears a headscarf cannot be an MP and that she cannot take the oath in Parliament in a headscarf. [Nor does] such a provision exist in Parliament\u2019s standing orders. This can be understood from the fact that an initiative was recently launched in Parliament to add such a prohibition to its standing orders. Besides, even if there were such a provision, this would be considered null and void because it would be contrary to the Constitution. In fact, the Turkish Grand National Assembly does not have the right to act [in a way] which would bring about the abolition of the citizens\u2019 rights to elect representatives and to be elected as representatives, which are one of [their] basic rights. Actually, since the aim of the standing orders is to ensure the conduct of Parliament\u2019s activities in an orderly way, a right cannot be annulled with such a procedural action.",

Unfortunately, the High Court has interpreted secularism in many of its judgments in a totalitarian manner. According to the Court, secularism is not a pro-freedom and pro-peace principle restricting the State, but is a higher principle legitimising the imposition by the State of a certain way of life on citizens. The Constitutional Court considers secularism as the categorical refusal of the demands of religion in the social, public and political arenas. Therefore, it thinks that secularism authorises the State to remove manifestations of religion in society. Moreover, it exalts this principle to the level of being the most important value of the constitutional order. According to this understanding, democracy, the rule of law and human rights are all secondary values, which should [only] be recognised to the degree allowed by secularism.",

It also stubbornly ignores the pro-freedom/democratic criticism of this notion. Despite the fact that even the Turkish literature on the subject of \u201csecularism in a democratic system\u201d has expanded to a considerable degree in the last ten or fifteen years, our judges in the Constitutional Court turn a blind eye to this literature. Furthermore, in this trial at least, our senior judges did not need to undertake additional efforts to obtain new sources and information on this issue.

It is anti-democratic because it restricts in an arbitrary way the field of democratic politics and the sphere of activity of democratic political actors. It is anti-freedom because it is oppressive and imposing. It is contrary to secularism because it oppresses religious choices and creates discrimination on the grounds of religion.

It is because of this reason that the obstacle to freedoms in Turkey is not Parliament, which does not change the Constitution and which does not enact the necessary laws.

The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10.

It has also underlined the importance of academic freedom (see, for example, Sorgu\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 17089/03, \u00a7 35, 23 June 2009; and Sapan v.\u00a0Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 34) and of academic works (see Aksu v.

In this connection, academic freedom in research and in training should guarantee freedom of expression and of action, freedom to disseminate information and freedom to conduct research and distribute knowledge and truth without restriction (see Recommendation 1762 (2006) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe). It is therefore consistent with the Court\u2019s case-law to submit to careful scrutiny any restrictions on the freedom of academics to carry out research and to publish their findings (see Aksu v. Turkey [GC], cited above, \u00a7 71). This freedom, however, is not restricted to academic or scientific research, but also extends to the academics\u2019 freedom to express freely their views and opinions, even if controversial or unpopular, in the areas of their research, professional expertise and competence. This may include an examination of the functioning of public institutions in a given political system, and a criticism thereof.",

France, no.\u00a020893/03, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2008 (extracts)). At the same time, however, the Court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary, which, as the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a State governed by the rule of law, must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties. It may therefore prove necessary to protect that confidence against destructive attacks which are essentially unfounded, especially in view of the fact that judges who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying (see Prager and Oberschlick, cited above, \u00a7\u00a034).",

It has taken into consideration the applicants\u2019 interest in conveying to the public the first applicant\u2019s view on a topic of general interest and voicing his criticism, balanced against the claimants\u2019 interest as individuals exercising a judicial function in having their reputations protected and being protected against personal insult. In this connection, the Court reaffirms that the courts, as with all other public institutions, are not immune from criticism and scrutiny. In particular, a clear distinction must be made between criticism and insult. If the sole intent of any form of expression is to insult a court, or members of that court, an appropriate sanction would not, in principle, constitute a violation of Article 10 of the Convention (see Ska\u0142ka v. Poland, no. 43425/98, \u00a7\u00a034, 27\u00a0May 2003). The Court considers that some of the language and expressions used in the article in question, notably those highlighted by the domestic courts, were harsh and that they could be perceived as offensive. They were, however mostly, value judgments, coloured by the author\u2019s own political and legal opinions and perceptions. In this connection, the Court also observes that they were based on the manner in which the Constitutional Court ruled on certain issues and that these rulings, including the dissolution of the Fazilet Party, were already subject to virulent public debate, as the applicant sought to demonstrate in the domestic proceedings. They could therefore be considered to have had a sufficient factual basis (see, a contrario, Barfod v. Denmark, 22 February 1989, \u00a7 35, Series A no.\u00a0149). In so far as it concerns statements of fact contained in the impugned article, the Court finds that the domestic courts did not attempt to distinguish them from value judgments, nor do they appear to have examined whether the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d incumbent on the applicants within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention were observed, or to have assessed whether the article was published in good faith.",

Hungary, no. 23954/10, \u00a7 20, 19 July 2011). Thus, when account is taken of the content of the article as a whole, and the context in which they were expressed, the Court is of the opinion that the impugned strong and harsh remarks contained in the article, set out in general terms, with respect to the judges of the Constitutional Court, cannot be construed as a gratuitous personal attack against the claimants.

At least as matters currently stand, these assumptions remain at the level of intuitions. The meaning, rationale and scope of academic freedom are not obvious, as the legal concept of that freedom is not settled. Traditionally, academic freedom referred to a crucial element of university autonomy: non-interference by external powers in university teaching. This core academic freedom has increasingly been accepted as including personal freedom of expression, often in the sense of scholars\u2019 autonomy. It is in this sense that the maxim of the independence of university teachers and researchers was recognised as a constitutional principle by the French Constitutional Council (see decision no. 83-165 DC, 20 January 1984, in which it was held that \u201cby their very nature, the functions of teaching and research not only permit but require ... that free expression and personal independence are guaranteed by the provisions applicable to them\u201d and that \u201cthe guarantee of [teachers\u2019] independence stems from a fundamental principle recognised by the laws of the Republic\u201d). A similar approach can be found in the constitutional case-law of many other European countries. Also, teachers\u2019 freedom of expression is interlinked with the freedom of research. In order to provide for the self-determination necessary for the autonomous advancement of learning, knowledge and science, institutional autonomy is guaranteed under the name of academic freedom. However, although academic freedom refers, first and foremost, to institutional autonomy, it cannot be reduced to its institutional setting, since scholars\u2019 institutional autonomy is meaningful only if they enjoy personal freedom of research that entails unimpeded communication of ideas within, but not exclusively within, the scholarly community. This interrelatedness between academic institutional autonomy and personal freedom of scholars is expressed in various instruments including Recommendation CM/Rec(2012)7 of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the responsibility of public authorities for academic freedom and institutional autonomy. In this Recommendation, academic freedom and institutional autonomy are characterised as \u201cessential values of higher education\u201d which \u201cserve the common good of democratic societies\u201d. It is also emphasised that \u201cacademic freedom should guarantee the right of both institutions and individuals to be protected against undue outside interference, by public authorities or others\u201d, which is \u201can essential condition for the search for truth\u201d, and that \u201c[u]niversity staff and/or students should be free to teach, learn and research without the fear of disciplinary action, dismissal or any other form of retribution\u201d (see paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Recommendation).",

This would be superficial. Convincing justification for impugned \u201cextramural\u201d academic speech can very often be arrived at only if one takes into consideration the need to communicate ideas, which is protected for the sake of the advancement of learning, knowledge and science.",

On the contrary, there can be no democratic society without free science and free scholars. This interrelationship is particularly strong in the context of social sciences and law, where scholarly discourse informs public discourse on public matters including those directly related to government and politics. In Recommendation No. R(2000)12 of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the social sciences and the challenge of transition, it is emphasised that \u201cthe social sciences play a strategic role in guaranteeing an informed public and in building a society based on democracy\u201d and that \u201call democracies have a growing need for the social sciences for their economic and social development, to help their institutions to understand and to solve societal problems, to increase the confidence of their citizens in democracy and to enhance the vigour of the democratic process itself, encompassing electoral politics, government, and civil society\u201d. As a matter of principle, social and legal scientists\u2019 contributions to public discourse and other \u201cextramural\u201d utterances that are based on their research, professional expertise and competence serve the public interest. It is for this reason that social and legal scientists\u2019 judgments, those of value no less than those of fact, where these academics freely express their views and opinions on matters belonging to the area of their research, professional expertise and competence, deserve the highest level of protection under Article 10. True, in general, in order to be protected under Article 10, a public comment or utterance on any matter, not only on one of public concern and irrespective of who has pronounced it, does not need to have an \u201cacademic element\u201d. However, ceteris paribus, the presence or absence of an \u201cacademic element\u201d in an impugned comment or utterance may be decisive in finding whether a particular \u201cspeech\u201d which otherwise would constitute an unlawful infringement of personal rights is protected under Article\u00a010.",

In fact, to substantiate this finding only one argument has been explicitly put forward, namely that Mr Erdo\u011fan\u2019s \u201carticle ... was published in a quasi-academic quarterly as opposed to a popular newspaper\u201d. That is clearly not enough and could therefore be misleading. We think that it should also have been explicitly noted that the said \u201cstrong and harsh remarks ... with respect to the judges of the Constitutional Court\u201d, as value judgments, were part of an explanatory opinion based on the scholarly analysis conducted by a professional academic in the field of constitutional law. This is precisely what can justify their protection under Article 10 in the context in which they were expressed. We do not intend to speculate here whether hypothetical generalised \u201cstrong and harsh remarks\u201d of an identical nature but lacking an \u201cacademic element\u201d (for example, because they were made by a non-academic commentator) would likewise have been regarded as not constituting \u201ca gratuitous personal attack against the claimants\u201d and would enjoy the same level of protection under Article 10, even if they had been made public in the same or equivalent \u201cquasi-academic\u201d journal.",

                        "content": "10.\u00a0\u00a0This is by no means to deny the offensive nature of the personal conclusions of Mr Erdo\u011fan\u2019s article. Under \u201cordinary\u201d circumstances such language, especially if read in isolation, should raise serious concerns as being offensive to personal reputation, in particular because it depicts identifiable members of a court on the grounds of their judgment. The Court\u2019s case-law has on more than one occasion recognised that \u201cthe courts \u2013 the guarantors of justice, whose role is fundamental in a State based on the rule of law \u2013 must enjoy public confidence; and it may therefore prove necessary to protect judges from offensive and abusive verbal attacks\u201d (see De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24\u00a0February 1997, \u00a7 37, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997\u2013I; Janowski v. Poland [GC], no. , \u00a7\u00a033, ECHR 1999-I; and Ungv\u00e1ry and Irodalom Kft. v. Hungary, no.\u00a064520/10, \u00a7 44, 3 December 2013). However, in the present case the Court has dealt with a situation where a professor of constitutional law had offered a scholarly analysis of a Constitutional Court judgment, a matter clearly within his academic expertise and competence. His professional analysis preceded his opinion on the personalities of certain judges, and the opinion was based on that analysis. Professor Erdo\u011fan, after having considered alternative explanations for the specific reasoning and conclusions of the Constitutional Court, came to the conclusion that the judgment analysed was unprofessional and that this lack of professionalism originated in the lack of professionalism of the judges of that court. This is an informed opinion \u2013 not in the sense that it is factually correct, but in the sense that it is research-and-facts-related. To express such an opinion in that situation was a legitimate thing to do for an academic within the scope of the professional freedom needed in the field of constitutional law, which by its nature plays \u201ca strategic role in guaranteeing an informed public and in building a society based on democracy\u201d (see Recommendation No.\u00a0R(2000)12, cited above). We find that these considerations were not properly taken into account in the proportionality analysis, when the domestic courts accepted that the protection of the reputation of judges \u2013 which is necessary in a democratic society \u2013 did not allow a constitutional law professor to express his informed opinion, even if factually incorrect, on the alleged lack of professionalism of the judges of the Constitutional Court.",
