He requested that the video surveillance footage of the day of the incident be inspected. He handed in to the court the minutes from a hearing of 9 February 2004 in some other proceedings which noted that the applicant had changed the lock of the small door leading to the courtyard and that he had handed the new keys to R.H. at that hearing. In reply to the questions put by the applicant\u2019s counsel, R.H. submitted that there had been between twelve and sixteen cameras surveying inside and the outside area of the house and that the recordings had been stored for about fifteen days. He said that the applicant had been standing somewhere between his entrance and the courtyard of the house during the incident but had refused to sketch where the incident had taken place. R.H. further replied that he had not checked the video footage following the incident, but that in any event the cameras would have not covered the whole incident and that the server of the video surveillance system had broken down on many occasions; he later added that in any case the server had been changed by the maintenance company. The applicant insisted that an inspection of the site be carried out and that evidence concerning video surveillance, including information such as the change of server, could and should be verified. The judge found it unnecessary to obtain the evidence in question and the following day acquitted the applicant finding that it had not been proved that the applicant had directed the threats against R.H.",

In particular, as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce. Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) leaves it to them to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses (see, among many other authorities, Topi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 41, and Perna v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a048898/99, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2003V). It is accordingly not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he or she has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; the defendant must, in addition, support his or her request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth. Thus, when the applicant has made a request to call witnesses which is not vexatious, and which is sufficiently reasoned, relevant to the subject matter of the accusation and could arguably have strengthened the position of the defence or even led to the applicant\u2019s acquittal, the domestic authorities must provide relevant reasons for dismissing such a request (see Topi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 42).",

After being initially acquitted, the applicant was convicted solely on the basis of the testimony of R.H. and K.C., to whom the court referred as R.H.\u2019s work colleague and who had testified that R.H. had told him about the incident (see paragraph 17 above). Apart from the fact that K.C. had not witnessed the incident himself, it cannot be overlooked that a number of facts raised in the proceedings called into question his credibility but were not addressed by the court in any detail, for example the fact that K.C. had met with R.H. in a bar just ahead of the hearing at which he testified, but denied knowing why he had been summoned to the court; that it was alleged that K.C. had been previously reported to police for false testimony (see paragraph 16 above) and that K.C. had been mentioned as a witness for the first time only six years after the criminal complaint had been lodged by R.H.

In this connection the Court observes that R.H. admitted that there had been between twelve and sixteen cameras installed in and around the house (see paragraph 14 above). The Court therefore considers that reasonable efforts should have been made after R.H. lodged his criminal complaint with the police to secure the footage with a view to verifying whether it had captured the incident. The Court can accept that this initial failure, which can only be attributed to the authorities and R.H., could perhaps not have been redressed later, however no conclusions were drawn from it in the judgment convicting the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Melich and Beck v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a035450/04, \u00a7 51, 24 July 2008).

(see paragraphs 13 and 16 above). This request was refused on the grounds that the facts had been sufficiently established (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above) and that, in any event, having regard to his written statement, D.\u010c., could not testify directly about the incident leading to the charges (see paragraph 17 above).

To this end, the Court notes that although at the hearing the applicant stated \u2013 in support of his request to question D.\u010c. \u2013 only that the latter would testify to the fact that R.H. had regularly influenced witnesses (see paragraph 13 above), his request could not be said to have been vexatious and it was indeed relevant to his main line of defence \u2013 challenging the reliability of R.H. and K.C.",

They rather express what would appear to be the courts\u2019 position that such evidence could not be, as a matter of principle, considered relevant. In particular, in the criminal proceedings against the applicant the Supreme Court addressed the argument that D.\u010c. could presumably testify to the hostile relationship between the applicant and R.H. and about the latter\u2019s influence on witnesses, but, like the lower courts, concluded that this evidence would not have been relevant as it did not relate to the actual incident which was the subject of the charges (see paragraph 23 above). What is more, even in the proceedings concerning the reopening application, in which D.\u010c. gave his testimony (see paragraph 27 above), the courts took the view that D.\u010c. did not need to be questioned in the trial as his testimony did not relate to the actual incident underpinning the charges (see paragraphs 28, 29 and 30 above).",

Russia, no. 77018/01, \u00a7 36, 29 January 2009). The Court also observes that the subsequent examination of D.\u010c. in the proceedings concerning the application for reopening did not cure that defect. In particular, the courts deciding on his application for reopening relied predominantly on the same arguments as the trial court (see paragraphs 28, 29 and 30 above).",
