These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private and family life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see S\u00f6derman, cited above, \u00a7 78).

There are different ways of ensuring respect for private life, and the nature of the State\u2019s obligation will depend on the particular aspect of private life that is in issue. Where a particularly important facet of an individual\u2019s existence or identity is at stake, or where the activities at stake involve a most intimate aspect of private life, the margin allowed to the State is correspondingly narrowed (see S\u00f6derman, cited above, \u00a7 79, with further references). In particular, effective deterrence against grave acts, where fundamental values and essential aspects of private life are at stake, requires the States to ensure that efficient criminal-law provisions are in place (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02324 and 27; M.C. v. Bulgaria, no. 39272/98, \u00a7 150, ECHR 2003XII; K.U. v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7 43; A, B and C v. Latvia, no. 30808/11, \u00a7\u00a0148, 31 March 2016; and M.S. v. Ukraine, no. 2091/13, \u00a7 62, 11 July 2017). Concerning such serious acts, the State\u2019s positive obligation under Article 8 to safeguard the individual\u2019s physical or moral integrity may also extend to questions relating to the effectiveness of the criminal investigation (see, among other authorities, M.C. v.

Furthermore, the applicant is a well-known journalist and there was a plausible link between her professional activity and the aforementioned intrusions, whose purpose was to silence her (see further paragraph 119 below).",

The Court is not concerned with allegations of minor errors or isolated omissions in the investigation; it cannot replace the domestic authorities in the assessment of the facts of the case; nor can it decide on possible alleged perpetrators or their criminal responsibility (see M.C. v.

Even though in the present case the criminal offence committed against the applicant was of a different nature, and the relevant complaints concern different Convention provisions giving rise to procedural obligations which are not entirely identical, the similarity with those cases is that the offence was committed against a well-known investigative journalist highly critical of the government. This distinctive feature is highlighted by the fact that the threatening letter received by the applicant demanded that she refrain from what she was doing, which can be understood in the overall context of the case as referring most likely to her professional activity. In a situation where the applicant was well known in society specifically for her journalistic activity and for that activity only, it is difficult to discern any motive for threats of public humiliation received by her other than a motive connected to that activity. The absence of such a motive could be demonstrated only if it was conclusively and convincingly ruled out as a result of an effective investigation.",

Similar general statements about procedural steps taken were made in the investigating authorities\u2019 letters addressed to the applicant (see paragraphs\u00a037-38 above).

From the material available and from the applicant\u2019s submissions, which have not been expressly disputed by the Government, it appears that, on their first encounter on 19 March 2012, the investigator failed to properly record and possibly even actively avoided recording Mr\u00a0N.J.\u2019s statements, which were highly relevant to the case. The Government submitted the investigator\u2019s subsequent order of 30 March 2012 granting the applicant\u2019s request to formally question Mr N.J. However, no further documents, such as a formal record of questioning, were submitted by the Government. As the case file stands, it has not been shown that Mr N.J. had been properly questioned.

As indicated in paragraph 106 above, it is a concept which covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person, and can therefore embrace multiple aspects of the person\u2019s physical and social identity. Article 8 is not limited to the protection of an \u201cinner circle\u201d in which the individual may live his own personal life as he chooses and to exclude therefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle. It also protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see B\u0103rbulescu v. Romania [GC], no. 61496/08, \u00a7 70, 5 September 2017, with further references). Private life may even include activities of a professional or business nature (see Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 76639/11, \u00a7\u00a7 100-01, 25 September 2018). The Court has also held that everyone has the right to live privately, away from unwanted attention (see Smirnova v.

Journalists working in the country were often violently attacked, or prosecuted on baseless criminal charges. Another tactic used against journalists and activists was publication of intimate videos or photographs in order to harass them.

Finland [GC], no. 931/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012426, 27 June 2017, and Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g v. Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, \u00a7 165, 8 November 2016). The Court also reiterates that the key importance of freedom of expression as one of the preconditions for a functioning democracy is such that the genuine, effective exercise of this freedom is not dependent merely on the State\u2019s duty not to interfere, but may call for positive measures of protection, even in the sphere of relations between individuals (see Fuentes Bobo, cited above, \u00a7 38; \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 42-43; and Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a059). In particular, the positive obligations under Article 10 of the Convention require States to create, while establishing an effective system of protection of journalists, a favourable environment for participation in public debate by all the persons concerned, enabling them to express their opinions and ideas without fear, even if they run counter to those defended by the official authorities or by a significant part of public opinion, or even irritating or shocking to the latter (see Dink, cited above, \u00a7 137).",
