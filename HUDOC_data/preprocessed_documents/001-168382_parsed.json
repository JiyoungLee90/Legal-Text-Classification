Accordingly, when trying to establish whether in the present case the respondent can claim State immunity, it is necessary to establish the nature of the relationship between the plaintiff and the respondent, because this relationship determined what kind of immunity \u2013 absolute or limited \u2013 should be applied to the State. The plaintiff worked at the embassy of the Kingdom of Sweden as Head of Culture and Information Projects. Even though a labour contract had been concluded between the plaintiff and the defendant, the job position of the applicant in itself (pati ie\u0161kov\u0117s pareigyb\u0117) pre-supposes (suponuoja) that the legal relationship between the parties had a civil service nature (a public-law relationship) rather than that of labour (a private law relationship), because the plaintiff\u2019s functions were linked to the implementation of the Kingdom of Sweden\u2019s sovereignty. The embassy, as an institution of a foreign diplomatic service, represents a foreign State, maintains international relations, implements foreign policy goals and defends the rights and interests of its citizens and other individuals. Accordingly and also based on the legal practice of the Lithuanian courts, work of such a nature belongs to a relationship regulated by public law (the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in the civil cases of V.\u00a0Stukonis vs the USA Embassy and A.\u00a0Cudak/Senkevi\u010d vs the Embassy of Poland). The ability of the court to protect the rights of the plaintiff depends on whether the foreign State has demanded that the doctrine of State immunity be applied. In this case the embassy of the Kingdom of Sweden made such a request on 19 May 2006, relying on Lithuanian case-law. This means that the case must be discontinued.\u201d",

The applicant emphasised that by itself the fact that she had been the head of culture and information projects did not prove that there had been a State civil service relationship (valstyb\u0117s tarnybos pob\u016bd\u017eio santykiai) between her and the embassy. She pointed out that the firstinstance court had not examined the scope of her functions. She also relied on the 1972 European Convention on State Immunity (see paragraph\u00a054 below). Even though neither Lithuania nor Sweden had acceded to that Convention, it was significant for comparative purposes. In that context the applicant noted that under Articles 4 and 5 of that Convention States could not ask for the application of State immunity in private-law cases, particularly if the proceedings related to a contract of employment between the State and an individual and where the work was performed on the latter\u2019s State territory.

International law and international law doctrine acknowledge the doctrine of limited immunity, when immunity from foreign courts\u2019 jurisdiction is granted only to a State\u2019s activity in the public-law sphere, and immunity does not apply in the private law sphere, which is not linked to exercising sovereignty. When establishing whether the dispute arose from a relationship covered by absolute State immunity or from a relationship where the State does not have immunity, it is necessary to establish the nature of the dispute. The plaintiff stated that a labour contract (darbo sutartis) has been concluded between her and the embassy of the Kingdom of Sweden. Accordingly, it is necessary to establish whether the applicant and the embassy of the Kingdom of Sweden had employment legal relationship (darbo teisiniai santykiai), or a State civil service legal relationship (valstyb\u0117s tarnybos teisiniai santykiai).

Given that there are no international legal norms which are obligatory and regulate the above questions, it is for each State to decide which persons who work at a diplomatic representation should be considered as being in State service [of a foreign State]. As can be seen from the limited case-law of the Republic of Lithuania, it is considered that everyone who works in a diplomatic representation of a foreign State, that is to say, the administrative and technical personnel and service personnel of a diplomatic representation, in one way or another contribute to the performance of the sovereign rights of a represented State, carrying out public-law functions, and therefore they are considered to be [employed] in the civil service of that State.

The abuse of one\u2019s rights is prohibited. It is prohibited to hinder the\u00a0formation of trade unions by employees and to interfere with the lawful activities of unions (Article 35). It is also prohibited to give notice of the termination of an employment contract and to dismiss someone from work when an employee is on temporary sick leave (Article 131 \u00a7\u00a01). Employees who have temporarily lost their functional capacity owing to sickness are to retain their position and duties if they are absent from work for no more than 120 days consecutively or for not more than 140 days within the previous 12 months (Article 133 \u00a7 2). An employer is entitled to terminate an employment contract without giving the employee any prior notice when the employee commits an act of gross misconduct (Article 136 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(2)). An act of gross misconduct is a breach of discipline at work involving a gross violation of the provisions of laws and other legal acts which directly regulate the employee\u2019s work, or any other gross transgression of work duties or work regulations. An act of gross misconduct at work may involve improper conduct with visitors or customers or any other acts which directly or indirectly violate a person\u2019s constitutional rights (Article 235).",

However, should the court establish that the employee may not be reinstated for economic, technological, organisational or similar reasons, or because he may find himself in unfavourable conditions, the court will declare the dismissal unlawful and award the employee his or her average salary from the time of the unlawful dismissal until the execution of the court\u2019s decision, as well as severance pay (Article 297 \u00a7 4). Severance pay depends on the employee\u2019s length of service. If the employee, as the applicant in this case, has worked in a particular job for between 120 and 240 months, severance pay is equal to the sum of five average salaries (Article 140 \u00a7 1 (5)).",

It observed that once a dismissal had been declared unlawful, it was for the court examining the case to verify whether any unfavourable conditions prevented the return of the employee to his previous job. The court had to examine the existence of such conditions ex\u00a0officio, irrespective of whether the employee had relied on that ground in his claim. Similarly, the court was not bound by the employee\u2019s claim. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 297 of the Labour Code were alternative measures to protect the employee\u2019s rights and promote social justice. Accordingly, should the court find that the employee could not return to his former job because of unfavourable conditions, it should apply Article 297 \u00a7\u00a04 of the Labour Code as a remedy for the breach of the employee\u2019s rights. If no such unfavourable conditions had been established, the court should apply Article 297 \u00a7 3.",

So also are the acts of \u2018dismissal\u2019 or \u2018removal\u2019 of a government employee by the State, which normally take place after the conclusion of an inquiry or investigation as part of supervisory or disciplinary jurisdiction exercised by the employer State. This subparagraph also covers cases where the employee seeks the renewal of his employment or reinstatement after untimely termination of his engagement. The rule of immunity applies to proceedings for recruitment, renewal or employment and reinstatement of an individual only. It is without prejudice to the possible recourse which may still be available in the State of forum for compensation or damages for \u2018wrongful dismissal\u2019 or for breaches of obligation to recruit or to renew employment. In other words, this subparagraph does not prevent an employee from bringing action against the employer State in the State of the forum to seek redress for damage arising from recruitment, renewal of the employment or reinstatement of an individual. The Commission on second reading replaced the words \u2018the proceeding relates to\u2019 adopted on first reading by the words \u2018the subject of the proceeding is\u2019 to clarify this particular point.

The Court itself had repeatedly acknowledged the absence of any trend in international law towards a relaxation of the rule of State immunity as regards issues of recruitment to foreign missions (the Government relied on Fogarty v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 37112/97, \u00a7 38, ECHR\u00a02001XI (extracts), and Cudak v.

Nevertheless, taking into consideration the applicant\u2019s title of cultural, information and press officer at the Swedish embassy, as well as the nature of her duties there, it appeared that she had clearly contributed to the exercise of discretionary powers intrinsic to the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Sweden. Among other functions, the applicant had been responsible for coordinating cultural events and information projects, working under the guidance of the diplomatic personnel of the embassy. That had been confirmed by the Supreme Court, which had considered that the applicant\u2019s work corresponded to one of the functions of a diplomatic mission established in Article 3 \u00a7 1 (e) of the 1961 Vienna Convention. Taking into account the applicant\u2019s duties at the Swedish Embassy, the Government also considered that the present case was clearly covered by the exception enshrined in Article 11 \u00a7 2 (a) of the 2004 United Nations Convention, to which Sweden was a party. There existed a special bond of trust and loyalty between the applicant and the Kingdom of Sweden. Contrary to the applicant\u2019s submissions (see paragraph 75 below), the size of the applicant\u2019s salary at the embassy did not of itself contradict such a conclusion. The decision by the Kingdom of Sweden to invoke State immunity in the applicant\u2019s case proved that the applicant\u2019s dispute had arisen out of legal relations regulated by public law (acta jure imperii), not by private law (acta jure gestionis).",

In that context the Lithuanian Government also noted that the applicant had been represented by a Swedish lawyer practising in Stockholm. That lawyer or some other could have explained to the applicant how to turn to the Swedish courts.

The obligation to ensure that immunity is properly respected is incumbent on the forum State. Its courts must make an ex officio determination of whether a State is entitled to immunity. This was further clarified in the 1991 ILC commentary, which states that \u201c[e]mphasis is placed, therefore, not so much on the sovereignty of the State claiming immunity, but more precisely on the independence and sovereignty of the State which is required by international law to recognize and accord jurisdictional immunity to another State\u201d (Yearbook ILC (1191) Vol. II Part Two, p. 23). Thus, it is the forum State alone that has sovereign authority to grant State immunity, taking into account relevant national and international law. As a result, the invocation of immunity itself is without legal effect. Only when a court in the forum State decides to grant immunity is a legal effect produced.",

The fact that the applicant had sought reinstatement, as opposed to the applicant in Cudak (cited above), who had only sought compensation for her dismissal, was undisputed.

For instance, the applicant had had the power to decide without supervision how financial support for cultural and related purposes should be granted to various organisations and to make payments to appointed recipients. Those duties had been aimed at achieving the public and institutional objectives of the embassy. They had also involved an element of trust and confidentiality since they had touched upon the actual business or policy of a foreign government, Sweden. While that discretion had to a certain extent been limited when the post of counsellor for cultural affairs had been established, the applicant had retained the ability to act in the relevant field after the organisational changes at the embassy. The outside perception had likely been that the applicant had retained her responsibilities for cultural affairs and she had in fact continued to make independent decisions on granting financial support without consulting the counsellor for cultural affairs. In addition, the applicant had assisted in secretarial and assistant duties. Even though the applicant\u2019s duties had been varied, both in their nature and in the degree of responsibility, a number of them had involved the \u201cexercise of governmental authority\u201d at the Swedish embassy.

Indeed, her duties had been to assist the diplomatic personnel at the embassy, and she had had no authority to influence any policies that had been adopted. Metaphorically speaking, it was appropriate to describe the applicant\u2019s duties as a \u201cmessenger\u201d, rather than as the author of the message, let alone as someone who adopted or made decisions about policies underlying whatever message had to be communicated. The applicant\u2019s fairly lowranking position at the embassy was further confirmed by her accreditation certificate, which had indicated that she was part of the Swedish embassy\u2019s administrative and technical personnel, and had not benefited from any diplomatic immunities or privileges. Last but not least, the fact that she had held a very low-ranking position at the embassy was further illustrated by the fact that she had a fairly low salary (see paragraph\u00a0108 below).",

It would be hard to explain why someone who had an ordinary job, who resided and was stationed in Lithuania and was a Lithuanian citizen, should turn to a Swedish court to claim his or her right under an employment contract which was, in all its relevant parts, including the question of dismissal, regulated by Lithuanian law. Given the current trend to have disputes over employment contracts resolved in the State where they arose, it was also highly uncertain whether a Swedish court would assume jurisdiction over her case. Even if a case was accepted for examination in Sweden, the applicant would face substantial disadvantages in a Swedish procedure, owing to the different legal system and language and the need to have legal advisors specialising in Swedish procedural law, private international law and Lithuanian labour law.",

Austria (no. 2), no. 14497/06, \u00a7 69, 20 June 2013). In this connection, the Court notes that the application of absolute State immunity has, for many years, clearly been eroded. It has also affirmed that Article 11 of the ILC\u2019s 1991 Draft Articles, on which the 2004\u00a0United Nations Convention was based, applies to Lithuania under customary international law. This Article enshrines the rule that a State has no jurisdictional immunity in respect of employment contracts, except in the situations exhaustively enumerated therein. The Court must take this into consideration in examining whether the right of access to a court, within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1, has been respected (see Cudak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06468).",

Be that as it may, the Swedish authorities have not argued before the Lithuanian courts that proceedings for the applicant\u2019s dismissal could undermine Sweden\u2019s security interests (see paragraph 31 above; also see, mutatis mutandis, Cudak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072). Consequently, paragraph 2 (d) of Article 11 of the 2004 United Nations Convention cannot reasonably apply in the present case. It has also not been argued before this Court that the applicant and the Swedish embassy had agreed in writing to exclude the applicant from the jurisdiction of the Lithuanian courts, an exception listed in paragraph\u00a02\u00a0(f) of Article 11.",

It recalls that in Fogarty the proceedings which the applicant wished to bring did not concern the contractual rights of a current embassy employee, but instead related to alleged discrimination in the recruitment process (see paragraph\u00a038 of that judgment). In the instant case, however, the applicant had worked at the Swedish embassy in Vilnius for nearly fourteen years. The fact that after her dismissal she asked for reinstatement along with her claim for compensation does not change this conclusion in any major way (see point\u00a010 of the ILC commentary, cited in paragraph 58 of this judgment). Such an interpretation was also to an extent supported by the Swedish Government (see paragraph 71 in fine above). In this connection the Court also observes that Article 297 \u00a7 4 of the Lithuanian Labour Code allows the court to award a severance payment instead of reinstatement (see paragraph\u00a050 above). This possibility is also confirmed by the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in the case of A.\u00a0Cudak vs the Embassy of Poland, where that court acknowledged that Ms\u00a0Cudak\u2019s reinstatement was not an option and awarded her severance pay as an alternative (see paragraphs 45 and\u00a046 above). Lastly, while paragraph 2 (c) of Article 11 of the 2004 United Nations Convention does not prohibit a State from invoking immunity when court proceedings concern the reinstatement of an individual, that ground was not relied on by the Lithuanian courts in the applicant\u2019s case. Rather, they were taken up with another of the ground listed in Article 11 of that Convention \u2013 whether the applicant performed particular functions in the exercise of governmental authority (paragraph\u00a02\u00a0(a)), a matter which the Court will address next.",

Contrary to the applicant\u2019s view, locally employed staff working at the Swedish Embassy were not in an analogous situation for the purpose of Article 14 of the Convention to Swedish staff working there. There was a fundamental difference between those two categories of employees. On the one hand, employees of the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs who were posted abroad were individuals who were employed by the Swedish Government in their country of origin, in accordance with applicable Swedish legislation and corresponding labour market conditions. That category of employees in principle had no relation to the local labour market of the receiving State. Locally employed staff, on the other hand, were resident in the country where the diplomatic mission was situated. They were employed under the labour legislation of that country and other labour market conditions. That order was generally recognised and applied in relation to staff at diplomatic missions all over the world.",

It transpires from the case file that the applicant\u2019s title as the \u201chead\u201d of culture, press and information projects appeared only in some of her own submissions to the domestic courts, and not in any of her job descriptions at the embassy. On the other hand, in her objection to the civil proceedings, the Swedish ambassador neither gave the applicant\u2019s title nor explained the applicant\u2019s duties in order to justify the application of State immunity by the Lithuanian courts (see paragraph 31 of the judgment). The Chamber rightly attached no particular weight to how the applicant interpreted and designated her own duties, because litigants are free to employ different strategies in court proceedings. But this aspect was passed over in silence, as was the striking parallel between the present case and Cudak v. Lithuania ([GC], no.\u00a015869/02, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2010). More particularly, in Cudak, the Lithuanian Supreme Court acknowledged that it had been unable to obtain any information allowing it to establish the scope of the applicant\u2019s \u201cactual duties\u201d. In the present case the domestic courts did not even go that far. Instead, the Vilnius Regional Court and the Court of Appeal simply based their reasoning on the \u201cjob position itself\u201d and \u201cthe title of the job itself\u201d respectively (see paragraphs\u00a032 and 34 of the judgment), thus finding that the applicant had \u201cto a certain extent\u201d helped Sweden to carry out its sovereign functions. The courts did not explain to what extent that was so by examining the actual duties she performed, nor did they justify their decisions by explaining on what basis \u2013 documents or facts brought to their attention \u2013 they had reached such a conclusion. Thus, the level of legal consideration concerning the merits of the applicant\u2019s argument was unjustifiably limited. All of this took place against the background of the applicant\u2019s plea that no evidence about the scope of her functions had ever been analysed (see paragraph 33 of the judgment). On this point it could have been noted that the provisions of Article\u00a011 of the 2004 United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property (although not ratified by Lithuania, it is used by its courts as a \u201cguideline\u201d), and in particular the exceptions enumerated therein, must be strictly interpreted (see Sabeh El Leil v. France ([GC], no. 34869/05, \u00a7 66, 29\u00a0June 2011). This last provision from the Grand Chamber\u2019s case-law \u2013 although it is the most important and directly relevant to the case under examination!\u00a0\u2212\u00a0is not even mentioned in the judgment. An attentive student would ask: why? Does it signify that the Court\u2019s attitude is about to change?",

The Supreme Court noted that, pursuant to Article 3 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the gathering of information about a receiving State, as well as the promoting of cultural relations, were among the functions of a diplomatic representation (see paragraphs\u00a038 and\u00a053 of the judgment). That being the case, the Supreme Court also held that everyone who worked in the diplomatic representation of a foreign State, including the administrative, technical and service personnel, in one way or another contributed to the meeting of the sovereign goals of the represented State, with the result that the diplomatic representation\u2019s immunity from jurisdiction was justified (see paragraph 38). To support that finding in the present case, the Supreme Court then relied on its own earlier finding in A.\u00a0Cudak vs the Embassy of Poland. Such an overarching application of State immunity to everyone who works at a diplomatic representation is in plain contradiction with the current developments in international law (see Sabeh El Leil, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053) as well as with the spirit of the Court\u2019s judgment in Cudak (cited above). The Supreme Court\u2019s choice to grant State immunity in this case thus appears to have been based largely on the Swedish ambassador\u2019s demand to that effect (see paragraph\u00a038 in fine). Such \u201cexpanded\u201d reasoning would also have provided justification for the dismissal of the Government\u2019s objection that Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 was inapplicable on account of the applicant\u2019s special bond of trust and loyalty to the Swedish embassy.",
