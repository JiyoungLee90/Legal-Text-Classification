In coming to such a conclusion, the Court takes into account that, in the Polish language, the word ocenzurowano means that a competent authority, after having controlled the content of a particular communication, decides to allow its delivery or expedition. Consequently, as long as the domestic authorities continue the practice of marking the detainees' letters with a simple ocenzurowano stamp, the Court would have no alternative but to presume that those letters have been opened and their contents read. The Court would also point out that the risk of such a stamp being forged by prisoners in order to fabricate evidence in the Strasbourg proceedings is so negligible that it must be discounted. Had the domestic authorities been concerned about the risk of fabrication, they could have avoided it by adding to the register of incoming and outgoing mail information about its condition (see, mutatis mutandis, Campbell v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 February 1992, Series A no. 233, p. 22, \u00a7\u00a062; Halford v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III, p. 1016, \u00a7\u00a048).",
