There is one courtroom in Serbia \u2013 in the District (Central) Prison in Belgrade \u2013 as an auxiliary courtroom of the High Court in Belgrade, in which the dock is enclosed by metal bars and bulletproof glass. In France, some courts use glass docks, which in rare cases are reinforced with steel cables and used pursuant to a decision by the presiding judge of the court. In Latvia, although a minority of tribunals still have metal cages, that practice is falling into disuse. In Italy, metal cages installed in the 1980s for trials of alleged mafia or terrorist group members are no longer used.",

Where it is clear from the outset however that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see Varnava and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, \u00a7 157, ECHR 2009). Where the alleged violation constitutes a continuing situation against which no domestic remedy is available, the six-month period starts to run from the end of the continuing situation (see \u00dclke v. Turkey (dec.), no. 39437/98, 1 June 2004). As long as the situation continues, the six-month rule is not applicable (see Iordache v. Romania, no. 6817/02, \u00a7 50, 14 October 2008). The concept of a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d refers to a state of affairs which operates by continuous activities by or on the part of the State to render the applicant a victim (see Petkov and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), nos. 77568/01, 178/02 and\u00a0505/02, 4 December 2007). The Court found previously that in the situation of a repetition of the same events, such as, for example, an applicant\u2019s transport between the remand prison and the courthouse, even though the applicant was transported on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked variation in the conditions of transport to which he had been routinely subjected created, in the Court\u2019s view, a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d which brought the entire period complained of within the Court\u2019s competence (see Fetisov and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a043710/07, 6023/08, 11248/08, 27668/08, 31242/08 and 52133/08, \u00a7\u00a075, 17\u00a0January 2012). The same is true where applicants in custody, as in the present case, are routinely confined in a metal cage in the courtroom each time they are brought from their detention facility to the courthouse for examination of their case.",

The applicants, who have implied that as a consequence of that situation there were no domestic remedies to be exhausted, ought therefore to have lodged their applications with the Court no later than six months from the cessation of the situation complained of, in order to comply with the sixmonth rule. By lodging their applications on 5\u00a0May 2008 and 2 July 2008, respectively, at the time when the third trial was pending, the applicants complied with that rule in relation to their confinement in a cage during the third trial only.

During that period there had been nothing to justify those fears, that is, nothing to suggest that he had threatened the victims and witnesses or committed any other unlawful acts against them. In the decision of 8 February 2005 the Magadan Regional Court had imposed on the applicants an undertaking not to leave their place of residence as a preventive measure, which restriction had lasted ten months. The court and the prosecution, which had not appealed against that decision, had not considered that the applicants posed a danger to society. There had been no grounds on which to change that preventive measure to detention on remand on 6\u00a0December 2005. Mr\u00a0Slyadnev had been detained on the same grounds as his co-defendant Mr Grishin.

On this latter point, in any event, the Court does not accept that such a threat has been substantiated. It observes that the Magadan Regional Court never assessed whether the applicants\u2019 physical restraint was at all necessary during the hearings. Moreover no reasons were given for keeping the applicants in a cage. Nor can those reasons be found in court detention orders, contrary to the Government\u2019s submissions that the applicants posed a threat to witnesses, and that it was this threat that warranted their detention on remand. The first applicant was not remanded in custody for the duration of the third trial. He was detained on remand in unrelated proceedings for reasons that are not known (see paragraphs\u00a034 and\u00a046 above). The second applicant\u2019s detention was ordered by the same court decisions as those which the Court has examined in the case of the applicants\u2019 codefendant and found to lack \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons for detention on remand to be compatible with Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention, and, in particular, to lack reasons which would show the risk of retaliation against, or pressure on, the witnesses now alleged by the Government (see Mikhail Grishin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 149-150). That conclusion is fully applicable to the present case, and there is nothing in the Government\u2019s submissions to the Grand Chamber which would warrant departing from it. Nor can the accusations that the applicants had committed violent crimes or their previous convictions \u2013 some of them with conditional sentences \u2013 six or more years before the trial in question, or the first applicant\u2019s subsequent conviction, be reasonably considered to support the Government\u2019s submissions in this respect. As to the negative references referred to by the Government (see paragraph 96 above), they do not suggest that the applicants\u2019 personalities were such as to require their physical restraint during their trial; and the second applicant also had positive references from the administrations of his remand centre and prison (see paragraph\u00a044 above).",

The Grand Chamber judgment is limited to the use of a metal cage as described in paragraphs 48 and 125. We would note that Russia and other countries that have used metal cages in courtrooms are developing a tendency to replace them with glass enclosures or \u201corganic glass screens\u201d (see paragraph\u00a075 of the judgment). The present judgment does not apply to such security measures. However, we would stress that such \u201ccages\u201d might raise issues under the requirement of procedural fairness in Article 6 \u00a7 1 and the presumption of innocence in Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (compare the Views of the Human Rights Committee in Kovaleva and Kozyar v. Belarus, Communication No. 2120/2011, Views of 29 October 2012, CCPR/C/106/D/2120/2011, \u00a7 11.4).",

It is the Court\u2019s established case-law that Article 3 enshrines an absolute right. Hence, the provision is not only non-derogable, as is evident from Article 15 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, but it also does not permit exceptions, regardless of the conduct of the victim or the circumstances (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2010). Accordingly, while the context of a given treatment or punishment may be taken into consideration in determining whether the threshold of severity required for a violation of Article 3 has been reached, it cannot provide a justification for those acts or omissions that reach this threshold (see Ireland v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 163, Series A no. 25, and Saadi v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a037201/06, \u00a7 127, ECHR 2008). There is, in short, no room for a margin of appreciation or a justification for ill-treatment reaching the threshold of Article\u00a03. There is room for relativity only on the question whether the threshold of severity has been reached for a violation of Article 3, not whether treatment or punishment that reach this threshold constitute a violation of the Convention (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 162).",

This paragraph could be misunderstood, a contrario, as suggesting that a sufficient legal basis could have somehow justified the alleged violation of Article 3. We consider it essential that no such impression be conveyed. The existence of a sufficient legal basis is one condition of justifying an interference with Articles\u00a08\u201311 of the Convention, which explicitly permit such justifications in their respective second paragraphs. As no justification is possible under Article\u00a03, paragraph 124 of the present judgment must be read as an argument ad abundantiam. In other words, it must be taken as a passing comment on the problematic nature of regulating court proceedings by unpublished orders of a general nature. In no event should this paragraph be read as meaning that a sufficient legal basis could ever legitimise acts otherwise contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (compare, in the same vein, the Concurring Opinion of Judge Bratza in the case of Jalloh v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, ECHR 2006-IX, arguing that the majority\u2019s consideration of whether the forced administration of emetics was \u201cnecessary\u201d detracted from the absolute nature of Article 3).",

While such \u201ccaging\u201d persists, despite the lack of manifest functional necessity, a latent function has thus become apparent. By presenting defendants in a cage, they are symbolically humiliated and portrayed as members of an inferior breed compared to ordinary humans. Therefore human dignity is at the heart of the matter, as the Court well recognises.",

My concern is that the Court\u2019s reasoning could be understood as allowing in principle some possible justification within the scope of absolute rights. A similar concern is very well expressed in the concurring opinion of Judges Keller and Nicolaou. I would like to draw attention to the sequence in the Court\u2019s reasoning. The Court first, clearly and unsurprisingly, holds in paragraph\u00a0127 that Article 3 prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which is why there can be no justification for any such treatment. In paragraph 136 the Court concludes that the minimum level of severity has been reached. In the light of this assessment I find it confusing that the Court then holds in paragraph\u00a0137 that the use of metal cages can never be justified under Article 3 of the Convention. How could it be? This message is either void and should therefore have been omitted or it is otherwise worrisome at this stage in the Court\u2019s reasoning. Article 3 guarantees absolute rights. Does it then make sense even to raise the possibility of justification once the measure has entered its scope? To reconsider such a possibility at that stage of the reasoning, even though the Court answers in the negative here, could weaken the understanding of its concept of absolute rights.",

That would not be contrary to the concept of absolute rights, provided the assessment is faithfully performed in view of the underlying values. It has been observed, however, that there is seemingly a subtle but new shift with regard to the application of the principle of proportionality and Article 3. That conclusion might be drawn because there is no clear line observed between what is allowed for in the assessment and what is out of the question after the threshold of Article\u00a03 has been reached. The reference to forms of \u201cunjustifiable\u201d ill-treatment would indicate that subjective processes are involved in the application of Article\u00a03, going beyond the assessment of sufficient severity for the measure to fall within the scope of that Article. This may cause understandable concern in that it creates an impression, albeit false and unintended, that certain breaches of Article 3 could on occasion be justified.",

In the assessment as to whether the threshold of ill-treatment has been reached, it is common for subjective as well as objective factors to play a role. By generalising the finding that holding defendants in metal cages before the court during trial is a prohibited form of degrading treatment, subjective factors for the assessment of such a violation of Article 3 have become less relevant. I welcome such a generalisation, making clear what standards should be met. In the light of this understanding, I would have welcomed an even lesser focus on whether the applicants must have suffered from being caged before the court. They may have suffered intensely. But suppose they had not, being blessed perhaps with extraordinary mental coping capacities or owing to a sheer lack of sensitivity. Would that have made a difference? I do not think it should have done. Holding a defendant in a metal cage has a strong theatrical dimension, staging a ritual of humiliation. Where it is the State\u2019s obligation to set the scene for a fair trial, such humiliating exposure of defendants before the court constitutes degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3.",
