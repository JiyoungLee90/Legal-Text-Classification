It notes that the hearings were scheduled regularly. It also does not lose sight of the role of the applicant who contributed to the length of the proceedings by having the case re-assigned to a different judge and refusing to submit requested information. While an applicant cannot be blamed for taking full advantage of the resources afforded by the national law in the defence of his interests (see, mutatis mutandis, Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v. Turkey, 8 June 1995, \u00a7\u00a066, Series A no.\u00a0319-A), the resulting delays cannot be attributed to the authorities. The Court also notes that the applicant did not present any evidence in support of his allegations that the trial court had failed on a few occasions to duly summon the parties to the hearings.",
