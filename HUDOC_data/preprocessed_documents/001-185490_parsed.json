In Carmel Saliba v.

Of relevance is that it was not engaged in ordinary commercial business, operating instead in a heavily regulated field subject to environmental and health-and-safety requirements (see, mutatis mutandis, Mykhaylenky and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 35091/02 and 9 others, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2004XII). It is also significant that the decision to create the mine was taken by the State, which also expropriated numerous privately-owned properties in the area to allow for its functioning, under legislation concerning \u201cespecially important State needs\u201d (see paragraphs 7 and 24 above). All of the above factors demonstrate that the company was the means of conducting a State activity and that, accordingly, the State must be held responsible for its acts or omissions raising issues under the Convention.",
