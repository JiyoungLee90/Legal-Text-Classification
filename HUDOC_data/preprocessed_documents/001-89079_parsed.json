It considers that, in the circumstances of the present case, the aforementioned bodies\u2019 appointment of senior police officers as investigators was inappropriate, given that the allegations were directed against the police force of which they are members. In this regard, the willingness of the investigators to give credence to the accounts put forward by their colleagues and the conclusions reached by them confirm the Court\u2019s previous findings (see paragraphs 14, 17 and 19 above).",
