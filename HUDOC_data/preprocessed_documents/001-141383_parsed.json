In particular, the Assize Court limited itself to hold that the preventive measure of remand in custody in respect of the applicant should remain \u201cunchanged\u201d without specifying concrete grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention.

However, the Court observes that the translation contract concerns a translation from English into Azerbaijani of the original application drafted in English, and the possible translation of other relevant documents. In this connection, the Court observes that the applicant did not submit any translated documents to the Court. Moreover, the Court does not consider that the translation of the application from English into Azerbaijani was necessary for the proceedings before the Court. Therefore, having regard to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 3,919 covering costs under all heads.",
