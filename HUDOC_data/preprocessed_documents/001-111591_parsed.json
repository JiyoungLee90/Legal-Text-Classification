The Court does not lose sight of the fact that the Supreme Court of Russia provided two irreconcilable opinions on the issue. While the ruling of the Presidium of the Supreme Court of Russia of 12\u00a0April 2006 confirms the Government\u2019s assertion, a decision by the Supreme Court\u2019s Military Chamber unambiguously found such reasoning without merit (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).",
