Furthermore, a person could always refuse to undergo an operation, even if it was life-saving. As concerns those who were detained, however, their choices in this respect were very limited. They could not opt for a particular specialist to treat them, nor did their lack of consent relieve the custodial authorities of the duty to provide the necessary medical assistance, by force if required.
