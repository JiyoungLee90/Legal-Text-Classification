In particular, when the personal space available to a detainee falls below 3\u00a0sq.m of floor surface in multi-occupancy accommodation in prisons, the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 arises (ibid., \u00a7 137). In cases where a prison cell \u2013 measuring in the range of 3 to 4 sq.m of personal space per inmate \u2013 is at issue, the space factor remains a weighty factor in the Court\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of conditions of detention. In such instances a violation of Article 3 will be found if the space factor is coupled with other aspects of inappropriate physical conditions of detention (ibid., \u00a7 139). Where a detainee had at his or her disposal more than 4 sq.m of personal space in multi-occupancy accommodation in prison and where therefore no issue with regard to the question of personal space arises, other aspects of physical conditions of detention remain relevant for the Court\u2019s assessment of adequacy of an applicant\u2019s conditions of detention under Article 3 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 140).",

The relevant legislation did not draw any further distinctions between the different categories of persons with whom detainees could correspond, such as, for example, lawenforcement and other domestic authorities, Convention and other international bodies, relatives, legal counsel, and so on. It did not elaborate on the manner in which the screening measures would be exercised. In particular, it did not provide for any participation by or involvement of prisoners at any stage of the monitoring process. Nor did it specify whether the detainee was entitled to be informed of any alterations to the contents of his or her outgoing correspondence. Moreover, the monitoring was automatic, without any time-limits and did not require any reasoned decision giving grounds for the screening measures and/or setting a time frame for it. Lastly, there was no specific remedy enabling the detainee to contest the measure and obtain adequate redress. On account of those characteristics of the applicable domestic legal regime the Court concluded that the applicable domestic law had not offered an appropriate degree of protection against arbitrary interference with a prisoner\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence and that interference with the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 8 on account of that monitoring had not been \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 54).",
