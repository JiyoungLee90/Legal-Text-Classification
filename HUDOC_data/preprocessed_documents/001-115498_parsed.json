It also noted that he had not been issued with a residence permit enabling him to live legally in French Guiana until 16 June 2009. On that basis, the Chamber considered that at the time of the applicant\u2019s removal to  a serious question had arisen as to the compatibility of his removal with Article 8 of the Convention. It considered that the applicant had an \u201carguable\u201d complaint for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention and within the meaning of the Court\u2019s case-law. It accordingly went on to examine the merits of the complaint and the effectiveness of the remedy available to the applicant in French Guiana. It found that the remedy of which the applicant had been able to avail himself before the Cayenne Administrative Court had made it possible for him to have the removal order declared illegal and, subsequently, to obtain a residence permit, even though, because it had no suspensive effect, the applicant had been removed before the Administrative Court could examine his case. It went on to note that the applicant\u2019s removal had not definitively broken his family ties, as he had been able to return to French Guiana some time after being deported \u2013 albeit illegally at first \u2013 and had been given a residence permit. Bearing in mind, inter alia, the margin of appreciation the States enjoy in such matters, the Chamber held that there had been no violation of Article 13 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8.",

At the time of his removal the applicant was 18 years old, single, had no children and was in good health. He had been sent back to the country where his grandparents lived and a few months later he had been able to return to French Guiana and resume his life there without incident.

The fact that the authorities had been unable to issue the first residence permit until 16 June 2009 had been the applicant\u2019s own fault, as he had not seen fit to submit the requisite papers and had made no effort to regularise his situation when invited to do so.",

Illegal immigration and the criminal networks that facilitated it were encouraged by the peculiar topography there, which made the borders permeable and impossible to guard effectively. Moreover, considering the large number of removal orders issued by the prefect of French Guiana, introducing an automatically suspensive remedy might overload the administrative courts and adversely affect the proper administration of justice. The exception was also justified by the need to maintain a certain equilibrium in French Guiana and by the close bilateral ties  had with the neighbouring countries.",

In such cases the Court made a proper assessment of the proportionality of the removal in relation to the aim pursued. In doing this the Court applied the criteria laid down in its case-law (for example, Boultif v. Switzerland, no.\u00a054273/00, ECHR 2001IX). So the effectiveness of the remedy was not conditional on its having suspensive effect.

These territories were in fact a testing ground for immigration policies and police practices. In French Guiana, for example, unlike in mainland , the police could carry out general identity checks without the prior authorisation of the public prosecutor. The conditions at holding facilities were unsatisfactory, and expulsions from French Guiana were carried out swiftly and on a massive scale. In 2010, for example, 6,073\u00a0people had been placed in the administrative holding centre, which had a capacity of 38 places, and 4,057 had been expelled after being held for 1.4 days on average. In that same year only 717 (11.8%) of the 6,073 people held there had been brought before the liberties and detention judge. In the submission of the third-party interveners, such results were entirely due to the lack of a suspensive remedy, to the detriment of the fundamental rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. This lack of a suspensive remedy applied even to aliens alleging violations of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention or Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 \u2013 in disregard of the Court\u2019s case-law.",

The expulsion rate for the Cayenne holding centre was 80% (compared with 20-30% in mainland France). Often, expulsion was simply a matter of ferrying the illegal aliens across the river, so it took no time at all (less than four hours). Brazil was the only country with which France had concluded an agreement on readmission from French Guiana, which made it possible to expel Brazilian nationals without any formalities. Departures for  were organised every day and the individuals concerned were held for such a short time that it was difficult for CIMADE to assist them with the legal formalities.",

Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Rotaru v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2000V).",

Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, \u00a7 448, ECHR 2005III), independent and rigorous scrutiny of a claim that there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 (see Jabari, cited above, \u00a7 50), and reasonable promptness (see Bat\u0131 and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos. 33097/96 and 57834/00, \u00a7 136, ECHR 2004IV).

The rationale of this Convention is explicitly stated in its Preamble, which recognises that undocumented migrants face serious human rights violations, that appropriate action should be encouraged to prevent and eliminate clandestine movements and trafficking in migrant workers and that recourse to the employment of undocumented migrants will be discouraged if the fundamental human rights of all migrant workers are recognised. With those challenges on the horizon, the Migrants Convention boldly acknowledged a wide range of civil, political, economic and social rights for migrant workers and their relatives, documented as well as undocumented, including the right of access to the courts and the right of appeal against an expulsion decision. According to Article 22, paragraph 4, of the said Convention: \u201cExcept where a final decision is pronounced by a judicial authority, the person concerned shall have the right to submit the reason he or she should not be expelled and to have his or her case reviewed by the competent authority, unless compelling reasons of national security require otherwise. Pending such review, the person concerned shall have the right to seek a stay of the decision of expulsion.\u201d",

The International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights prohibits arbitrary or unlawful interference with the migrant\u2019s family and provides for the right of access to a court, including the right to a suspensive appeal against the expulsion, deportation or removal of undocumented migrants. In 2008 the Human Rights Committee examined specifically the situation in French Guiana and vehemently censured the respondent State in this case in the following terms: \u201cIn addition, no recourse to the courts is available to persons deported from the overseas territory of Mayotte, involving some 16,000 adults and 3,000 children per year, or in French Guiana or Guadeloupe (Articles 7 and 13). The State Party should ensure that the return of foreign nationals, including asylum-seekers, is assessed through a fair process that effectively excludes the real risk that any person will face serious human rights violations upon his return. Undocumented foreign nationals and asylum-seekers must be properly informed and assured of their rights, including the right to apply for asylum, with access to free legal aid. The State Party should also ensure that all individuals subject to deportation orders have an adequate period to prepare an asylum application, with guaranteed access to translators, and a right of appeal with suspensive effect. ... The State Party should exercise the utmost care in the use of such assurances and adopt clear and transparent procedures allowing review by adequate judicial mechanisms before individuals are deported, as well as effective means to monitor the fate of the affected individuals.\u201d This position of the Human Rights Committee is evidently valid not only for asylum-seekers, but also for all undocumented migrants who face a decision of expulsion, deportation or removal or any similar measure, as the Committee itself has stated. In other Committee decisions, the protection of all migrants, irrespective of their legal status, has been stressed even more clearly. The most striking example is the Concluding Observations of the Human Rights Committee on Belgium, of 12 August 2004, where the Committee affirmed in a straightforward way that \u201c[t]he State Party should extend the deadline for lodging complaints and give complaints a suspensive effect on expulsion measures. ... It should give suspensive effect not only to emergency remedies but also to appeals accompanied by an ordinary request for suspension filed by any migrant against an expulsion order concerning him or her\u201d. The same firm approach was sustained in the Concluding Observations on Ireland, of 30 July 2008, where the Committee recommended that the State \u201cshould also introduce an independent appeals procedure to review all immigration-related decisions. Engaging in such a procedure, as well as resorting to judicial review of adverse decisions, should have a suspensive effect in respect of such decisions\u201d.",

However, by allowing only those carried out \u2018in pursuance of a decision reached in accordance with law\u2019, its purpose is clearly to prevent arbitrary expulsions. On the other hand, it entitles each alien to a decision in his own case and, hence, Article 13 would not be satisfied with laws or decisions providing for collective or mass expulsions. This understanding, in the opinion of the Committee, is confirmed by further provisions concerning the right to submit reasons against expulsion and to have the decision reviewed by and to be represented before the competent authority or someone designated by it. An alien must be given full facilities for pursuing his remedy against expulsion so that this right will in all the circumstances of his case be an effective one. The principles of Article 13 relating to appeal against expulsion and the entitlement to review by a competent authority may only be departed from when \u2018compelling reasons of national security\u2019 so require. Discrimination may not be made between different categories of aliens in the application of Article\u00a013\u201d. Although these considerations were aimed at migrants lawfully present on the territory, the Committee also added that whenever the legality of a migrant\u2019s presence on the territory was in dispute, the guarantees of Article 13 should apply.",

The broad scope of the preservation of due process encompasses all matters and all persons, without any discrimination. The migratory status of a person cannot constitute a justification in depriving him or her of the enjoyment and exercise of his or her human rights, and upon taking up a work-related role the migrant acquires rights by virtue of being a worker that should be recognised and guaranteed independently of his or her regular or irregular situation in the State of employment. In addition, the  acknowledged that neither the text nor the spirit of the American Convention established a restriction as to whether the irreparable damage should be against life or physical integrity, and consequently other rights should be subjected to protection similar to that afforded to life and personal integrity.

On the one hand, Guideline 5 of the 2005 Committee of Ministers Twenty Guidelines on forced return provides: \u201cIn the removal order, or in the process leading to the removal order, the subject of the removal order shall be afforded an effective remedy before a competent authority or body composed of members who are impartial and who enjoy safeguards of independence. The competent authority or body shall have the power to review the removal order, including the possibility of temporarily suspending its execution. ... The exercise of the remedy should have a suspensive effect when the returnee has an arguable claim that he or she would be subjected to treatment contrary to his or her human rights as set out in Guideline 2.1.\u201d In its Commentary to the Guidelines, the Committee explained that \u201c[t]he requirement according to which the exercise of the remedy should have the effect of suspending the execution of the removal order when the returnee has an arguable claim that he or she is likely to be subjected to treatment contrary to his or her human rights as set out in Guideline 2.1 is based on the judgment delivered by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of \u010conka v. Belgium (no. 51564/99, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2002-I)\u201d.

Accordingly, a remedy with an automatic suspensive effect should be provided for in regard to the human rights of those in need of international protection (as established in Guideline 5, paragraph 3) and a remedy with a discretionary suspensive effect should be foreseen in all other cases (as provided for in Guideline 5, paragraph 1).",

Furthermore, Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals has a specific provision on the existence of an appeal against removal. Article 13 provides for the possibility of the suspensive effect of the appeal being determined by the appeal body. In other words, European Union member States should at least provide for a review with discretionary suspensive effect. A refusal by the reviewing authority of the request for a stay of execution runs the risk of error and consequently of causing irreversible damage, unless the case is manifestly ill-founded; but if that is the case, the appeal should be immediately disposed of for lack of any plausible grounds. When the case is not manifestly ill-founded, a stay of execution of the appealed decision is called for by the very nature of the review proceedings. In other words, either the appeal against an expulsion or removal order is manifestly ill-founded and therefore the reviewing authority is in a position to take an immediate decision on it, making the suspension of the effects of the appealed expulsion order otiose; or the appeal is not manifestly ill-founded, and a refusal of suspensive effect could seriously compromise the very aim of the review proceedings and deprive the guarantee provided to the appellant of its meaning. Other than the inadmissible margin of risk of irreversible damage, it should be kept in mind that when an application for review has to be made outside the host country it cannot be made in as fair a way as within the country, mainly because of the obvious practical difficulties that migrants face to keep in touch with their lawyers or the authorities in the host State and to put forward the evidence capable of substantiating their case. The hard reality of the minimal number of cases of expelled aliens who successfully appeal from overseas and return to the host country is overwhelming evidence that a non-suspensive appeal against an expulsion, deportation or removal order is nothing but a self-fulfilling prophecy.",

Irreversible damage is usually linked to physical damage, such as that resulting from torture and ill-treatment. But the Court gave up this link in \u010conka. There, the notion of irreversible damage was derived from the prohibition of the collective expulsion of aliens, regardless of their legal status. Thus, \u010conka set a principle according to which potential irreversible damage may be invoked without the simultaneous allegation of danger of torture or ill-treatment. Moreover, the Court reasoned that an effective remedy requires full suspensive effect, but discretionary suspensive effect is inconsistent with the required effectiveness of the remedy. Two arguments supported this statement: firstly, \u201cit is not possible to exclude the risk that in a system where stays of execution must be applied for and are discretionary they may be refused wrongly\u201d (see \u010conka, cited above, \u00a7 82), and, secondly, \u201cit should be noted that the requirements of Article 13, and of the other provisions of the Convention, take the form of a guarantee and not of a mere statement of intent or a practical arrangement\u201d (ibid., \u00a7\u00a083). A suspensive effect which depends \u201cin practice\u201d on the discretion of national authorities does not replace the procedural guarantee offered by a remedy with automatic suspensive effect, even if the risk of error is in practice negligible. When national authorities are not necessarily required to defer execution of the expulsion, deportation or removal order while an appeal is pending, the guarantee of an effective remedy is no longer real, but virtual.",

                        "content": "It is true that there can be a judicial control of the mistakes made by the police and the administrative authorities, but this control takes place months or even years after the person was removed. This policy of fait accompli does not provide migrants with any effective means of remedying violations of their human rights prior to removal. Migrants are de facto at the mercy of the unfettered discretion of the police and administrative authorities. This situation did not change with the recent judgment of the Conseil d\u2019Etat on the removal of a migrant from French Guiana, where the court ruled that there was a presumption of urgency which justified the applicability of Article L. 521-1 of the Administrative Courts Code. According to this rule of ordinary administrative law, the juge des r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s has the power to suspend the enforcement of any administrative decision when urgency so requires and there is serious doubt about the legality of the impugned decision. Evidently, this new jurisprudence does not absolve the respondent State, in general terms or in the present case. The reason is simple: the request under Article L. 521-1 of the Administrative Courts Code is not suspensive itself, which means that the remedy in question does not automatically entail the suspension of the removal. The removal decision can be enforced by the administration between the lodging of the appeal and the decision of the judge on the suspension of the removal order. Therefore, the new jurisprudence still does not satisfy the requirements laid down by the Court in the landmark \u010conka judgment in order to prevent potentially irreversible infringements of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention. Since it was incumbent on the Government to prove that national law complied with the requirements provided for in \u010conka, and they have failed to meet this burden of proof in a satisfactory manner, I cannot but conclude that the deficiencies of the national legal framework, as applied in French Guiana, have not been overcome by the decision of the Conseil d\u2019Etat of 9 November 2011.",

The respondent State reiterated the argument made by the Conseil Constitutionnel in its decision no. 2003-467 of 13 March 2003, which refers to the particular situation and the lasting difficulties of the d\u00e9partement of French Guiana (la situation particuli\u00e8re et les difficult\u00e9s durables du d\u00e9partement de la Guyane). This argument is similar to the one used by Belgium in \u010conka and by the Dominican Republic in the case of expulsion of Haitian migrants. It is based on the practical impossibility of upholding human rights. When no other argument is valid, one is tempted to resort to the argument of the force of facts. But then the rule of law does not prevail over facts \u2013 instead facts dictate the rule.",

The respondent Government did not apply Article 15 to French Guiana. In fact, it did not even suggest that the situation in French Guiana was of such an exceptional nature that Article 15 was applicable. However, if the respondent Government do want to depart from the principles of the Convention in a part of their territory because of an exceptional situation that part of the territory is facing, the only way to do it is by applying Article 15. In other words, if the respondent Government want to depart from the principle of a suspensive remedy against the removal of migrants in the , then they have to comply with the strict requirements of Article 15 and justify the exceptional nature of the measures taken under Article 15. They have not done so to date.",
