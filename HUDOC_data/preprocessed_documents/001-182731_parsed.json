Furthermore, the limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion. Moreover, the dominant position which the government occupies makes it necessary for it to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified attacks and criticisms of its adversaries (Ceylan v.

The Court reiterates in that connection that tolerance and respect for the equal dignity of all human beings constitute the foundations of a democratic, pluralistic society. That being so, as a matter of principle it may be considered necessary in democratic societies to sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify violence, hatred or intolerance provided that any \u201cformalities\u201d, \u201cconditions\u201d, \u201crestrictions\u201d or \u201cpenalties\u201d imposed are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, mutatis mutandis, G\u00fcnd\u00fcz v. Turkey, no. 35071/97, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2003XI). It certainly remains open to the relevant State authorities to adopt, in their capacity as guarantors of public order, measures, even of a criminal-law nature, intended to react appropriately and without excess to such remarks (see, for instance, Erdo\u011fdu, cited above, \u00a7 62). Moreover, where such remarks incite violence against an individual, a public official or a sector of the population, the State enjoys a wider margin of appreciation when examining the need for an interference with freedom of expression (see, among many other authorities, \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, cited above, \u00a7 66; and Ceylan, cited above, \u00a7 34).",

Admittedly, a certain degree of immoderation may fall within those limits, given that Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed (see, among many other authorities, G\u00fcl and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041).",

It is also of relevance that the appeal to abstain from participation in the election of the President of Russia (see paragraph 27 above), was published in an issue for February-March 2004.

The article, inter alia, fervently criticised a first-instance court\u2019s judgment by which that officer had been absolved of criminal liability on the grounds of temporary insanity. The article also suggested that the fact that an insane officer had been in command of a regiment necessitated a compulsory psychiatric examination of other officers and servicemen of Russia\u2019s armed and security forces (see paragraph 10 above). Against this background, the phrase at issue cannot be regarded as an appeal to any criminal act, or as incitement to hatred against federal servicemen or lawenforcement officers. Rather, it can be seen as a scathing criticism of the judicial response to the murder of a young woman by a high-ranking military officer who had been, furthermore, a representative of the State seconded to the Chechen Republic to maintain constitutional order in the region and called upon to protect the interests of civilians. It is also an expression of concern that a mentally unstable person had been placed in command of a regiment, and an emotional appeal to take necessary measures with respect to the personnel of the federal armed and security forces to prevent similar incidents in the future.",

Ireland, no. 44179/98, \u00a7\u00a069, ECHR 2003IX (extracts)). In this connection, it notes, firstly, that it does not appear that at the time of the events under examination, the applicant was a public, well-known or influential figure (see, by contrast, Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001). It is also noteworthy that the impugned statements were printed in a self-published newsletter, the number of copies of which, as was pointed out by the applicant and not disputed by the Government, was very low (see paragraphs 63-64 and 74 above). Those copies were distributed by the applicant in person or through his acquaintances at public events in Moscow only to those individuals who expressed their interest (see paragraph 37 above). It is thus clear that the circulation of the newsletter at issue was insignificant. Moreover, it cannot be said that the incriminated statements were disseminated in a form that was impossible to ignore (see Perin\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7 253, and, by contrast, Vejdeland and Others v. Sweden, no.\u00a01813/07, \u00a7\u00a7 56-57, 9 February 2012), or in any other way that enhanced the message they were conveying (see, by contrast, F\u00e9ret v. Belgium, no.\u00a015615/07, \u00a7 76, 16 July 2009). On the contrary, it is clear that the above-mentioned factors in the present case significantly reduced the potential impact of the impugned statements on the rights of others, national security, public safety or public order (cf.\u00a0Ok\u00e7uo\u011flu v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a024246/94, \u00a7 48, 8 July 1999; Gerger v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 24919/94, \u00a7\u00a050, 8 July 1999; and Karata\u015f, cited above, \u00a7\u00a052).",

The domestic courts may have considered that some of the statements in paragraph 98 (which the Court finds to glorify violence) were problematic only because they were accompanied by those in paragraph 110 (which the majority considers innocuous), or vice versa. The rigid classification adopted by the Court prevents an analysis of the actual decision taken by the Russian courts, and leads the majority to undertake a proportionality analysis of a decision that did not exist and that we must second-guess \u2013 that is, the Court assesses the five-year sentence and the three-year ban on journalism as if it had been imposed only by virtue of the statements contained in paragraphs\u00a098 and\u00a0119.

In particular, an interference with one of those Articles has been found when \u201c[domestic] law d[id] not indicate with sufficient clarity the scope and conditions of exercise of the authorities\u2019 discretionary power in the area under consideration\u201d (see Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no.\u00a027798/95, \u00a7 62, ECHR 2000II). As the Court\u2019s Article 7 case-law makes clear, not only must the prohibited conduct be described in a way that its prosecution is foreseeable, the penalties that might be imposed for it should be precise enough as to be foreseen (see Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a021906/04, \u00a7 140, ECHR 2008). This is also true for \u201claws\u201d restricting Article 10, which should allow a \u201ccitizen ... to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail\u201d (see Rekv\u00e9nyi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR 1999III).",

Although payment has not been made, the applicant remains indebted to his lawyer. The reality of the debt was, in my view, indisputable. It arises from a letter presented by the applicant\u2019s lawyer requiring payment for his work and emphasising that his client is insolvent. It must be borne in mind that the applicant has spent five years in prison and it is therefore unlikely that he was in receipt of any resources throughout that long period.
