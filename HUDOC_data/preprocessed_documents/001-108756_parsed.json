The Court further observes that the matter was duly brought before the appropriate authorities at a time when they could reasonably have been expected to investigate the circumstances in question. The applicant\u2019s allegations, which were detailed and consistent throughout the domestic proceedings and before this Court, were, at least to some extent, corroborated by a medical certificate recording injuries to the head, ribcage and heel. The domestic authorities themselves repeatedly admitted having serious doubts concerning the lawfulness of the actions of the policemen on 8\u00a0December 2001 (see paragraphs 27 and 39) and it is moreover clear that the arresting officers themselves admitted to having used physical force during the applicant\u2019s arrest (see paragraph 15).

As acknowledged by the investigating authority itself (see paragraphs 38 and 39), the necessary actions had not been taken as long as two years later, and in fact they were not conducted at the domestic level at all. The Court, however, is mindful of the important role which investigative interviews play in obtaining accurate and reliable information from suspects, witnesses and victims and, ultimately, in discovering the truth about the matter under investigation. Observing the demeanour of the suspects, witnesses and victims during questioning, and assessing the probative value of their testimony, forms a substantial part of the investigative process.",

The Court has previously considered that the loss of records is capable of depriving an applicant of an opportunity to usefully challenge his arrest and detention (see Boris Popov v. , no. 23284/04, \u00a7\u00a7 74-75, 28 October 2010) and this is precisely what happened in the present case, where the destruction of the relevant records demonstrably impeded the pending criminal investigation at the domestic level, such loss being specifically mentioned and deplored by the investigative authorities (see paragraph 37).

The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see, for example, Aksoy v.

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the particular circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7 69; Aksoy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54; and Tanr\u0131kulu v.
