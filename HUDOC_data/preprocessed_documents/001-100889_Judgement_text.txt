The case originated in an application (no. 19236/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Ms Regina Balcer (“the applicant”), on 28 April 2007.
The applicant was represented by Ms G. Kalinowska-Jarzyńska, a lawyer practising in . The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant complained that she had been deprived of access to the Supreme Court.
On 5 March 2009 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. It was also decided that the Committee would rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1 of the Convention).
In accordance with Protocol No. 14, the application was allocated to a Committee. The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government's objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Rogoźno.
After the applicant's husband had died in April 2002, she instituted proceedings in which she claimed her widow's pension. On 25 September 2002 the Poznań Social Security Board dismissed the applicant's request. On 24 April 2006 the Poznań District Court dismissed her appeal against that decision. On 11 October 2006 the  dismissed the applicant's further appeal.
On 13 October 2006 the applicant requested to be served with the written grounds to that judgment. They were served on her on 6 November 2006.
On 27 December 2006 the applicant requested the court to assign a legal-aid lawyer to the case with a view to lodging a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court.
On 12 January 2007 the  allowed the applicant's request for legal aid. On 17 January 2007 the Poznań Bar Association assigned a lawyer to the case. On 23 January 2007 the  informed the applicant accordingly.
In a letter to the court dated 9 February 2007 the lawyer explained that she saw no grounds on which to prepare a cassation complaint in the applicant's case.
On 20 March 2007 the court informed the applicant about the lawyer's refusal and that the timelimit for the lodging of a cassation complaint had expired on 6 January 2007. The court's letter was served on the applicant on 23 March 2007.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the procedure for lodging cassation appeals with the Supreme Court against judgments of the appellate courts are stated in the Court's judgments in the cases of Siałkowska v. Poland, no. 8932/05, 22 March 2007; Staroszczyk v. Poland, no. 59519/00, 22 March 2007; Smyk v. Poland, no. 8958/04, 28 July 2009; Zapadka v. Poland, no. 2619/05, 15 December 2009; Bąkowska v. Poland, no. 33539/02, 12 January 2010.
On 5 February 2005 amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, adopted on 22 December 2004 (Ustawa o zmianie ustawy Kodeks postępowania cywilnego oraz ustawy Prawo o ustroju sądów powszechnych), entered into force. Under the amended text of Article 398 1 § 5, the timelimit for lodging a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court was extended from thirty to sixty days.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a request for leave to appeal out of time was the only method by which a cassation appeal submitted after the expiry of the timelimit could be admitted for examination (21 April 1997, II CZ 38/97; 27 September 2001, II UZ 51/01). In a further series of decisions the Supreme Court considered that it would be unfair for the legally-aided party to be penalised for the fact that legalaid applications could not be processed quickly enough to make it possible for a cassation appeal to be lodged within a period of thirty days counted from the day of service of the judgment on the party. The parties waiting for legal-aid services cannot be held at fault for shortcomings in the system. A party who was obliged to have recourse to legal aid should not be put in a worse situation than that of a person who did not seek it. A request to appeal out of time should therefore be submitted within seven days from the date on which the legal-aid lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file or had an effective possibility of drafting an appeal (4 March 2005, II UZ 72/04; 27 June 2000, I CZ 62/00), or from the date when the lawyer was informed that he had been assigned to the case by the local Bar Association (11 October 2001, IV CZ 163/01; 17 November 1998, II UZ 122/98; 11 October 2001, IV CZ 163/01;
In a resolution adopted by a bench of seven judges of the Supreme Court on 17 February 2009 (III CZP 117/08) that court acknowledged that there had been discrepancies in the manner in which the beginning of the seven-day time limit for submitting an application for leave to appeal out of time by legally-assisted parties had been determined. The court was of the view that applications for leave served the purpose of making access to the Supreme Court for legally-aided parties genuine and effective. Hence, the beginning of the time-limit could not be determined in a mechanical manner in all cases. The courts should instead examine the circumstances of individual cases as a whole and determine that date bearing in mind the genuine possibility for a lawyer to examine the case and prepare a cassation appeal.
