In this respect, ECRI would like to express its concern about a draft law on the modification and completion of certain legislative acts adopted in its first reading by Parliament on 11 October 2007. According to this draft law, only persons having exclusively Moldovan citizenship are entitled to work in senior positions in the government and in several public services. From the information it has received, ECRI understands that if this draft law enters into force as it stands, Moldovan citizens with multiple citizenship would be seriously disadvantaged compared with other Moldovan citizens in access to public functions. It thus appears that, if the law enters into force as such, this could lead to discrimination, i.e. unjustified differential treatment on the grounds of citizenship. ECRI understands that a wide-ranging debate is occurring within  at the time of writing this report as far as this draft law is concerned and that many sources both at the national and international level have stressed the need to revise the text thoroughly before its final adoption in order to ensure its compatibility with national and international standards.",

Although they have a common origin in the need to ensure both the independence of elected representatives and the freedom of choice of electors, these criteria vary in accordance with the historical and political factors specific to each State. The multiplicity of situations provided for in the constitutions and electoral legislation of numerous member States of the Council of Europe shows the diversity of possible approaches in this area (see Podkolzina v. Latvia, no.\u00a046726/99, \u00a7\u00a033, ECHR 2002II). The Court has held that for the purposes of applying Article 3, any electoral legislation must be assessed in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned, so that features that would be unacceptable in the context of one system may be justified in the context of another. However, the State's margin of appreciation in this regard is limited by the obligation to respect the fundamental principle of Article 3, namely \u201cthe free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\u201d (see Melnychenko v. Ukraine, no. 17707/02, \u00a7\u00a7 55, ECHR 2004X). Any conditions imposed must not undermine or run counter to, the concern to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of an electoral procedure aimed at identifying the will of the people through universal suffrage (see, Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a02) [GC], no.\u00a074025/01, \u00a7\u00a062, ECHR 2005IX).",

At that time the authorities did not appear to have had any concerns about the impact which the grant of this facility would have on the loyalty of those opting for dual nationality. The Government did not mention at the time that the political rights of persons who decided to acquire another nationality would be impaired. Since 2003, and no doubt encouraged by the new policy, a large section of the Moldovan population (see paragraphs 15-17 above), has obtained dual or multiple nationality in the legitimate expectation that their existing political rights would not be curtailed.",

For that reason, it is essential to take a holistic approach to the impact which restrictions on either right may have on the securing of the aforesaid guarantee. In other words, there is an interdependence and the Court must be vigilant so as to ensure that impediments to the right to be elected to parliament do not rebound negatively on citizens' right to vote in accordance with their perception of which candidate will best promote their interests in Parliament. The possible negative consequences for the free expression of the will of the people and the value of pluralism cannot be discounted.",

It cannot overlook the inconsistency of such practice with the recommendations of the Council of Europe in the field of elections concerning the stability of the electoral law (see paragraph 48 above). It would also appear that the promoters of the electoral reform rejected categorically the proposals of the opposition to submit the draft for the Council of Europe's expertise in accordance with Moldova's obligations and commitments and that the Government did not react in any way to the unequivocal signals of concern from the Council of Europe.",
