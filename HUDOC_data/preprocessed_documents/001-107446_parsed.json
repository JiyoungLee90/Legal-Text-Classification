No arguments have been advanced either before the domestic courts or before the Court to justify that failure on the applicant\u2019s part. The Court would point out in that connection that according to its case-law, the more serious an allegation is, the more solid its factual basis should be (see Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere, \u00a7\u00a0101; Pedersen and Baadsgaard, \u00a7\u00a078 in fine; cited above, and Rumyana Ivanova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a036207/03, \u00a7\u00a064, 14\u00a0February 2008). The allegation in the instant case was serious as it undermined the lawyer\u2019s professional integrity and called his diligence into question (see Wo\u0142ek and Others v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no.\u00a020953/06, 21\u00a0October 2008, mutatis mutandis), and thus called for thorough research on the part of the applicant.",

The newspaper refused to publish the rectification.

There is no authority in the Court\u2019s caselaw for such a statement and such an approach does not appear to be compatible with the role of the press in ensuring the public character of judicial proceedings and their transparency and fairness. While the Court has stressed the importance of journalistic objectivity and balance in the context of judicial reporting (see Egeland and Hanseid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a049; Reinboth and Others v.\u00a0Finland, no.\u00a030865/08, \u00a7\u00a078, 25\u00a0January 2011), it is of the view that it is of primary importance for the proper functioning of judicial systems that journalists are free not only to inform the general public about the factual aspects of cases examined by the courts, but also to formulate and disseminate their views and opinions on important issues involved in or connected with the subject-matter of cases under judicial consideration. In the same vein, it is important that the courts have an opportunity to obtain feedback on how their acts and judicial decisions are understood and regarded by the public. Such knowledge contributes to the quality of judicial decision-making and to a better understanding by society at large of the complexity of the issues involved in the administration of justice.",

They carried out a careful balancing exercise between the interests involved (compare and contrast Keller v.\u00a0Hungary (dec.), no.\u00a033352/02, 4 April 2006 and Kwiecie\u0144 v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a051744/99, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR 2007...). In particular, the firstinstance court adopted the test of adequate diligence in assessing whether the journalist had discharged her obligations. The approach taken by the courts is therefore compatible with freedom of expression guaranteed by Article\u00a010 of the Convention (contrast Soko\u0142owski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a075955/01, \u00a7\u00a046, 29 March 2005; Zakharov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a014881/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a029 and 30, 5\u00a0October 2006; and Karman v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a029372/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a042 and 43, 14\u00a0December 2006). The Court notes that the present case is to be distinguished from the case of Aquilina and Others v. Malta, cited above, where all the evidence heard by the domestic courts in the defamation proceedings against the applicants clearly indicated that the magistrate hearing the bigamy case had made a finding of contempt of court in respect of the lawyer appearing for the accused. In that case, however, the domestic courts (in the defamation proceedings) paid little or no attention to this evidence, preferring to rely on the brief and apparently incomplete record of the proceedings before the Court of Magistrates (see\u00a0paragraphs 47 \u2013 49 of that judgment). Moreover in that case the court reporter had shown due diligence in attempting to verify the facts, and the newspaper had published an apology two days later (paragraph\u00a050).",
