The company had been unable freely to plan its activities, since it had fully depended on the Road Inspectorate\u2019s instructions in its day-to-day activities. Furthermore, the town administration had unlawfully registered the company in excess of its competence. The town administration was the company\u2019s only founder and owner, controlled the company\u2019s activities and gave instructions as to the assets management, namely, it ordered the transfer of property operated by the company to a different company. When the assets were transferred, the company did not have any debts; otherwise, under Articles\u00a061\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 and 65\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Civil Code (see paragraph\u00a028 above), liquidation would have been possible only pursuant to a court decision, whereas there was no such decision in the present case until 2001. Moreover, after having ordered the transfer, the municipal authorities had not wound the company up. While the other municipal company, \u201cthe Housing Exchange Bureau\u201d, benefited from having economic control over the transferred assets, the Arsenal company, which formally continued to exist, was supposed to bear the respective expenses for cleaning, maintenance and electricity. As a result, the company accumulated a debt which it was unable to cover, in the absence of available assets. That permitted the Tax Service to apply to the commercial court with a request for the company\u2019s liquidation. The applicant further alleged that the enforcement proceedings had been defective and, in particular, his request for an injunction had been dismissed.",

In fact, the administration ordered the restructuring of the enterprise in the form of a spinoff and transferred the above-mentioned assets to the newly created Housing Exchange Bureau, whereas the debt that accumulated in respect of unpaid salaries was not transferred to the new entity.

Unlike in national jurisdictions, the emphasis of the Court\u2019s activity is on passing public judgments that set human rights standards across Europe. The Court recalls that in recent cases of Liseytseva and Maslov and Samsonov (both cited above) it has examined in detail the issue of State responsibility for the debts of the unitary companies having the right of economic control. The Court further notes that the present case is one of many similar Russian cases that concern the respondent State\u2019s liability for its failure to enforce final domestic judgments rendered against municipal unitary companies. In cases involving many similarly situated victims a unified approach may be called for. This approach will ensure that the applicants remain aggregated and that no disparity in the level of the awards will have a divisive effect on the applicants (see, for a similar approach in respect of the non-enforcement cases concerning State-owned companies in Serbia, Sto\u0161i\u0107 v.\u00a0Serbia, no.\u00a064931/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a066-68, 1\u00a0October 2013; see further, for instance, Moskalenko and Others v.\u00a0Ukraine [Committee], nos.\u00a01270/12 et al., \u00a7\u00a023, 18\u00a0July 2013; Goncharova and Others and 68 other \u201cPrivileged Pensioners\u201d cases v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a023113/08 et al., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a022-24, 15\u00a0October 2009; Kulkov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a025114/03 et al., \u00a7\u00a067, 8\u00a0January 2009; and Tarnopolskaya and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a011093/07 et al., \u00a7\u00a057, 7\u00a0July 2009).",
