Noting that the applicants\u2019 version of the events was based on the statements of those who had not witnessed the abduction themselves, except for the statement of Mr Ma.Ma., that the video of the abduction had not assisted in the identification of the culprits (see paragraphs 24 and 45 above) and taking into account that the abductors drove ordinary vehicles and were wearing balaclavas and civilian clothing, the Court has little evidence to rely upon. However, bearing in mind that after the events the applicants received information alleging knowledge of their relative\u2019s whereabouts which they submitted to the authorities with a delay varying from several days to several weeks (see, for example, paragraphs 28 and 32 above), along with the subsequent discovery of the burnt body and the experts\u2019 evaluation concerning its identity (see paragraphs 52 and 53 above), the Court is not persuaded that the abduction of the applicants\u2019 relative by State agents is the only possible explanation of the events in question.",

In response to their complaint, the latter took no action until 3 June 2013, when they examined the crime scene. There is no explanation for the reasons for such a belated reaction to reliable information concerning such a serious crime (see paragraph 7 above). In spite of the applicants lodging a second abduction complaint on 24 May 2013 (see paragraph 17 above) in which they alleged that the police were wilfully postponing steps in the investigation, the proceedings were only initiated three weeks later, that is to say on 14 June 2013 (see paragraph 20 above). Thus, no reasonable steps were taken to secure the evidence (see paragraphs 19 and 33 above) and demonstrate diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious matter (see Shafiyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a049379/09, \u00a7 90, 3 May 2012). The Court notes that the video of the abduction made by Mr Ma.Ma. was obtained by the investigation one week after its commencement (see paragraph 24 above). It would be reasonable to presume that the investigators could have questioned immediately, amongst other witnesses, the policemen who had arrived at the crime scene shortly after the incident or enquired whether any special operations had been carried out by the police or the CPE. However, those steps were either taken with a significant delay or not at all (see paragraph 23 and 41 above). Furthermore, in spite of the applicants\u2019 consistent allegations of the involvement of the CPE officers in the abduction (see paragraphs 38 and 43 above) and the latter\u2019s statements to the contrary (see paragraphs 42 and 47 above), no meaningful steps, such as a confrontation or formal questioning of the officers\u2019 colleagues concerning their whereabouts on 20 May 2013, were taken to clarify the situation within the framework of the investigation of the criminal case. Instead, the internal police inquiry which was set up to clarify the situation, concluded that it was impossible to do as there were significant discrepancies in the statements obtained (see paragraph 47 above). In spite of this conclusion, no further steps were taken by the investigators.",

The Court has previously accepted that this remedy may, in principle, offer a substantial safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power by an investigating authority where it refuses to institute criminal proceedings or orders their termination, given a court\u2019s power to reverse a refusal to institute criminal proceedings and indicate the defects to be addressed (see, among many other authorities, Trubnikov v.

Russia (dec.), no.\u00a020427/05, \u00a7 27, 22\u00a0October 2013). However, the Court has on many occasions found this remedy ineffective where the essence of the applicants\u2019 complaints lay in challenges to the investigators\u2019 inaction, resulting from the failure to take the necessary and timely steps and to keep the families informed of the progress and main procedural steps of the proceedings (see Shafiyeva, cited above, \u00a7 95, and Askhabova v.

However, from the contents of the investigation file it is apparent that due to the delays in the opening of the investigation and the authorities\u2019 failure to keep them informed of the relevant developments, the applicants learned of the omissions in the proceedings at a later date. In addition, there was no specific procedural act to appeal against. In cases such as the one at hand the domestic courts would be unable to issue specific guidelines to the investigating authorities, because of the absence of such a procedural act. Therefore, an appeal by the applicants to a court against the investigators\u2019 actions or omissions, owing to the nature of the matter and the need to react promptly, along with the limited scope of the court\u2019s review, would not be able to redress the defects in the investigation. Accordingly, the Court finds that an application to the domestic courts with complaints concerning alleged acts or omissions on the part of the investigating authorities would be ineffective in such circumstances and dismisses the Government\u2019s objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
