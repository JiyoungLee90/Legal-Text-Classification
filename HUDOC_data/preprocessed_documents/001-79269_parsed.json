In addition the Court reiterates that when the basis of the violation found is the lack of any compensation, rather than the inherent illegality of the taking of the property, the compensation need not necessarily reflect the full value of the property (see I.R.S. and Others v.\u00a0Turkey (just satisfaction), no.\u00a026338/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02324, 31 May 2005). It therefore deems it appropriate to fix a lump sum that would correspond to the applicants\u2019 legitimate expectations of obtaining compensation (see\u00a0Scordino v.
