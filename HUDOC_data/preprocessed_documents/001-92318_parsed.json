On the first occasion he stated that on the night of 8 November 2001 he, his brother Bekkhan and their mother had been at home. At about 4 a.m. some men had knocked at their door and introduced themselves as \u201cthe night police\u201d. Three men in camouflage uniform, armed with machine-guns and without masks, had entered the house. The group had consisted of about twenty armed men, the majority of whom had remained in the yard. Those who entered the house had requested the family members to produce their passports. Then the witness and his brother Bekkhan had been taken to the yard and made to stand against the wall for a search. During the search one of the men had asked the witness\u2019 name. When the latter had told him that his name was Aslanbek, the man had asked him whether he was \u201cthe Bearded Aslanbek\u201d. The witness had told him that he was not. After that the men had taken Bekkhan back in the house for 10-15 minutes. After that they had left the house and had taken Bekkhan with them. The armed men had told the witness and his mother that they were supposed to obtain information about Bekkhan from the Oktyabrskiy district department of the interior (the Oktyabrskiy ROVD). According to the witness, his mother had run after the perpetrators, but the latter had opened gunfire over her head and she had returned home. At some point later the investigators questioned the witness for the second time. He additionally stated that when he and his brother Bekkhan had been taken to the yard by the armed men, one of them had told him to get down on his knees. The man had spoken Russian with a Chechen accent. When the witness had told him that he had a problem with his legs and that he was unable to get on his knees, the man had threatened to shoot him. When the witness\u2019 mother had asked the men where they were taking Bekkhan, they had told her that she would need to contact the Leninskiy ROVD or the Zavodskoy ROVD to obtain such information. According to the witness, he would be able to identify one of the men who had abducted his brother. The abductors, who did not have any insignia on their uniforms, had left in a white VAZ-2121 car and URAL and ZIL vehicles without registration numbers. According to the witness, his brother Bekkhan had been abducted in connection with the investigation he had been conducting concerning the death of their uncle in 2000. On a number of occasions unidentified persons had placed notes threatening Bekkhan with retaliation if he persisted in his investigation. The witness also stated that a man named Rustam had informed him that for three days he had been detained in the local military commander\u2019s office together with Bekkhan Alaudinov. According to the witness, his brother had not participated in illegal armed groups. No other information has been submitted in respect of the second questioning.",

There had been Russian military checkpoints on the roads leading to and from the town. The armed men who had abducted Bekkhan Alaudinov had arrived in military vehicles late at night, which indicated that they had been able to circulate freely during the curfew. The men had acted in a manner similar to that of special forces carrying out identity checks. A few days after the abduction the applicant had recognised one of her son\u2019s abductors as he was entering the local military commander\u2019s office.",

The investigation in case no.\u00a025157 was instituted on 12\u00a0December 2001, that is, one month and four days after Bekkhan Alaudinov\u2019s abduction. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of a kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were delayed and were eventually taken only after the communication of the complaint to the respondent Government, or not at all (see paragraph 55). Furthermore, the Court notes that, as can be seen from the decision of the domestic court, the investigators failed to identify and question the chief officers of the Urus-Martan district military commander\u2019s office; failed to establish the owner of the military vehicles which had moved around Urus-Martan on the night of the abduction; and failed to identify and question the officer whom the applicant had identified as one of her son\u2019s abductors (see paragraph 60 above).\u00a0It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such failures, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",
