This was explained by the fact that the adoptive parents, although preventing their communication, were not exercising psychological pressure on the girl and were not denigrating the grandmother. The expert considered, however, that communication between the child and the grandmother could have a negative impact on the psychological state of the child, as there was an unsettled conflict between the applicants and the Z.s: the grandmother disapproved of the child\u2019s adoption and was challenging its lawfulness. The expert further considered that the child\u2019s residence with the grandparents would not be ideal, because, given the instability of interfamilial relations and the protracted conflict in the applicants\u2019 family, there existed a risk of the child\u2019s being involved in the adults\u2019 conflict. However, since the girl retained the positive image of her grandmother and expressed her wish to communicate with her, it was possible to establish a contact arrangement, which would provide for an obligatory preparatory stage, including reconciliation between the relatives.",

The Pushkinskiy District Court therefore ordered Mr and Ms Z. not to place obstacles in the way of the first applicant\u2019s communication with M. and held that contact between the first applicant and M. should take place as follows: during the first six months after the finalisation of the judgment \u2013 each second and fourth Sunday of the month from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. outside the parents\u2019 and the grandparents\u2019 places of residence in the presence of the parents, and thereafter on the same conditions without the parents present.

The Court notes in this connection that the second applicant did not make an application for postadoption contact with his granddaughter before the District Court examining the adoption case at first instance. This issue was therefore not examined by the District Court and no reference to post-adoption contact between the child and the second applicant was made in the operative part of the adoption judgment, resulting in the loss of any legal tie between them and making it impossible for him to seek contact with the child under Article\u00a067 of the Family Code as of the adoption judgment\u2019s becoming final on 7\u00a0December 2013 (see paragraphs 30 and 68 above).",

This issue was left to the discretion of the court examining the adoption case (see paragraphs 60 and 67 above).

Instead the City Court upheld the adoption judgment and led the second applicant to believe that it was open to him to have the issue of his post-adoption contact with his granddaughter settled after the termination of the adoption proceedings pursuant to the procedure provided by Article 67 of the Family Code. In reality, though, no such remedy was available to him because, as the City Court and the District Court found in the Article 67 proceedings, in the absence of a specific provision as to continued post-contact in the adoption judgment, no application for contact could be made.",
