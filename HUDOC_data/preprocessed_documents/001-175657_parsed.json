In this connection, the Government referred to the case-law of the HSC (see\u00a0paragraph 17 above). For the Government, the procedure established by Article 349 \u00a7 3 of the CCP allowed defendants to validly waive their procedural rights. Moreover, it complied with the requirements for a valid waiver set forth in the Court\u2019s case-law, in that it required the domestic courts to verify that defendants understood the implications of accepting the use of that abridged procedure and accepted it voluntarily. Moreover, the waiver under Article 349 \u00a7 3 was not absolute in that it did not prevent appeals on procedural grounds and did not extend to the legal classification of the admitted facts.

However, any restrictions contained in domestic legislation on the right to a review mentioned in that provision must, by analogy with the right of access to a court embodied in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, pursue a legitimate aim and not infringe the very essence of that right (see Krombach v.

No satisfactory explanation has been provided for this contradiction. Moreover, following communication of the case to the respondent Government the HSC, with reference to the instant application pending before the Court, reiterated, in its circular letter to the lower courts, that the admission of factual circumstances in the course of the trial did not deprive the defendant of the right to appeal on the grounds that the substantive criminal law had been incorrectly applied (see paragraph 18 above). Therefore, it cannot be said that the applicant should have foreseen that by admitting to the facts as established by the court in the course of his trial, he was forgoing the possibility of appealing against his conviction if he believed that the legal classification of his acts was incorrect.",
