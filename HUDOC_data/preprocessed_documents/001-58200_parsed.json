The investigations into her death were still under way. A ballistics examination revealed that the bullet was misshapen and no material information could be obtained which could lead to a conclusion as to the weapon used. No empty cartridges were found at the scene. Thus, there was no information in the file on the weapon which had caused the death. Since the fighting started at 9.30 p.m. and continued into the night, there was no eyewitness evidence as to what was seen or heard. Proceedings were continuing with a view to apprehending the members of the PKK involved in the armed clash but since they did not return to the scenes of clashes for a long time it would take time to identify and arrest them. As regards the allegations made in the applicant\u2019s statement of 9 October 1993 taken by the Human Rights Association (\u201cthe HRA\u201d), the claim that the security forces opened harassing fire on the village was false and was intended to denigrate the security forces involved in the fight against terrorism. It was the duty of security forces to maintain order and protect the population so there could \nbe no question of them opening harassing fire on the village. The incident in Kesenta\u015f resulted from the type of ambush operation commonly carried out by the security forces on roads leading into and out of villages.",

If the blurred figure had been a 9, this had been a mistake. Major Kuzu had also been adamant that there would be no security forces in the south. In brief, there would be no point: the terrain had not been favourable and they had known the PKK would come from the north and would flee in that direction. Since Major Kuzu had not been present during the clash, on his own testimony, the Commission felt unable to give his evidence much weight. \u0130sa G\u00fcndo\u011fdu had based his sketch on what he had heard from the units involved \u2013 apparently a brief radio contact.

The Commission also found that there was significant evidence indicating that the bullet may have been fired by the security forces (see paragraph 41 above).

In particular, the notion of an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the relatives to the investigatory procedure (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Aksoy and Ayd\u0131n judgments at p. 2287, \u00a7 98, and pp. 1895\u201396, \u00a7 103, respectively).

That step was useful and necessary, firstly in order to ascertain the details of the applicant\u2019s allegations, and secondly to explore the possibility of reaching a friendly settlement, which is the first step under the Convention system towards solving the problem. When a complainant is invited to meet a national authority to discuss an application to the Commission, the person in question may feel some disquiet. But to interpret that psychological state as pressure exerted to prevent the applicant from continuing the proceedings before the Strasbourg institutions is in my opinion the result of either bad faith or a political machination to discredit the respondent Government. To my mind, the Court should ask itself whether the applicant was not rather under pressure from the Diyarbak\u0131r Human Rights Association, which acts in such cases by means of a kind of actio popularis which is not authorised by Article 25; and these applications, originating in Diyarbak\u0131r, all follow the same course \u2013 London (the Kurdish Human Rights Project) and Strasbourg.",
