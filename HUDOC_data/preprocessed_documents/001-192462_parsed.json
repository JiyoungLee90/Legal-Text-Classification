In his statement, the applicant submitted that he and G. had murdered D. and S. after being incited to do so by Dor., who had wished to take revenge on the women because she believed that one of them had been having an affair with her partner and that the other one had facilitated the start of the affair. At noon on the day of the murder, Dor. had given them knives, which the applicant described in detail, and they had then gone away.

Approximately three hours before the statement was made, the applicant was questioned by the investigator as a witness in connection with the murder of D. and S. but submitted no information suggesting his involvement in the murder (see paragraph\u00a09 above). The Court is unable, on the basis of the documents before it, to explain such a drastic change in the applicant\u2019s testimony within such a short interval or to decide whether the applicant made his confession on his own initiative or at the instigation of the authorities. At the same time, once the applicant had informed the investigator that he was going to make a statement of surrender and confession to the police, the authorities must have been aware of the possible context of such a statement and of the consequences that would arise. However, there is no indication that the investigator offered the applicant any legal assistance before recording his confession or secured the presence of a lawyer. Moreover, even after the confession was made \u2013 that is to say when the investigator formally had every reason to suspect the applicant of the double murder \u2013 there is nothing to suggest that the applicant\u2019s status as a witness was formally changed to that of a suspect or that he was offered legal assistance in connection with the murder charge. Instead, in the absence of a lawyer, the applicant was made to participate, apparently as a witness, in the reconstruction of the crime scene; during the reconstruction he made further self-incriminating statements (see paragraph 11 above). It should not be overlooked in this respect that under domestic law the applicant was entitled to mandatory legal representation as regards the double murder, as he faced the possibility of life imprisonment (see paragraph 41 above).",
