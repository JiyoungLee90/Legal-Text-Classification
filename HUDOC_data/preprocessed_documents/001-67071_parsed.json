They agreed that the cases were uncomplicated as concerned the facts, but found that they were to some extent complex due to problems in law as well as procure. In this respect the Government referred inter alia to the involvement of EU-law issues, notably the question whether the relevant provision of the 1989 Act should have been notified to the European Commission and the question whether the cases should have been referred to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. Moreover, the Government found that the applicants to a very considerable extent had been a contributory cause to the length of the proceedings. Finally, the Government maintained that it could not give rise to criticism that the city courts decided to adjourn the criminal proceedings pending the outcome of the \u201ctest-cases\u201d as these decisions were reasonably motivated. All in all the Government found it inappropriate that the applicants on the one hand requested adjournments of the proceedings; extensions of time-limits for submission of pleadings; were unable to appear before court hearings before certain dates; raised questions of principles, including a request for a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice; requested an expert witness; and a special counsel assigned, and on the other hand claimed that the length of the proceedings were excessive.",

Furthermore, the applicants found that there were several periods of unacceptable inactivity during the proceedings for which only the Government were to blame, including the delay caused by the applicants\u2019 claim that the 1989 Act had had no legal authority. In any event the applicants found that the duration of the proceedings before the Supreme Court had been excessive. Two other factors had caused an unreasonable delay of the proceedings in the applicants\u2019 opinion; the adjournment of their cases pending the outcome of corresponding cases and the lack of resources in the Danish court system. Finally, the applicants pointed out that they had not in any way been compensated for the lengthy proceedings e.g. by having been imposed a more mitigating sentence.",

In the Court\u2019s view, when assessing the relevance and reasonableness of an adjournment of a criminal trial pending the outcome of another case, be it a test-case or not, it must be taken into account what is at stake for the persons involved (see inter alia Boddaert v.\u00a0, judgment of 12\u00a0October 1992, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0235D, \u00a7\u00a038). Also, since adjournment of criminal proceedings in general have a serious impact to the detriment of the indicted, the progress of the case which outcome is awaited, should be monitored thoroughly by the court which decides to adjourn the criminal trial.
