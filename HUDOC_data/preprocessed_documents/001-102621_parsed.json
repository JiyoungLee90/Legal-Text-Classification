It noted that the applicant had failed to participate in any therapeutic measure to address his sexual problems which had led to his offences and, by denying his offences in prison, had made any therapy pointless. Moreover, due to his organic personality disorder, which led to a continuous decomposition of his personality, the applicant was no longer able to reflect on his possibly deviant sexual behaviour and to discern limits.

The term \u201ccriminal law\u201d in connection with the question of power to legislate covered the regulation of all, even subsequent, repressive or preventive penal responses by the State which used the offence as a connecting factor, which were aimed exclusively at offenders and which were factually justified by the original offence. This interpretation was compatible with the fact that measures of correction and prevention, such as preventive detention, were not to be classified as \u201cpenalties\u201d to which the prohibition of retrospective punishment under Article 103 \u00a7 2 of the Basic Law applied. The objective of this latter provision, laying down a fundamental right, was different from that of a provision on legislative competence such as Article 74 of the Basic Law. Retrospective placement in prison under the (Dangerous Offenders') Placement Acts enacted by the L\u00e4nder was very similar to preventive detention under the Criminal Code, both in relation to the applicable procedure and in relation to its nature, and had been authorised in order to complement the measures of correction and prevention under the Criminal Code by the possibility of a preventive detention which had not been ordered in the judgment of the sentencing court. The L\u00e4nder therefore did not have the power to make laws on the placement of criminals in detention because the Federation exhausted its concurrent legislative power in this area. The court thus disagreed with the submissions of the Federal Government, which had taken the view that the L\u00e4nder had legislative competence to regulate the subject-matter at issue.",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof (see, among many other authorities, Erkalo, cited above, \u00a7 52; Saadi \nv. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 67; and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 116). \nThis primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Stafford, cited above, \u00a7 63, and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116). \u201cQuality of the law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 50, Reports 1996III; Nasrulloyev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 656/06, \u00a7 71, 11 October 2007; and Mooren v.  [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7 76, 9 July 2009). The standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention thus requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, \n23 September 1998, \u00a7 54, Reports 1998VII, and Baranowski v.

However, an interpretation of \nsub-paragraph (c) of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1, in the light of Article 5 as a whole, confirms that the applicant's detention for an indefinite period for preventive purposes was not covered by that sub-paragraph. Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 5, everyone detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of that Article must be brought promptly before a judge and tried within a reasonable time or released pending trial. The applicant's detention for preventive purposes was not, however, decided in order for him to be brought promptly before a judge and tried for offences \u2013 potential ones \u2013 and was thus not pre-trial detention as permitted by that provision. Moreover, the potential further offences in question were not sufficiently concrete and specific, as required by the Court's case-law (see, in particular, Guzzardi, cited above, \u00a7 102, and M. v. , cited above, \u00a7 102), as regards, in particular, the place and time of their commission and their victims.

The Court notes that the Bayreuth Regional Court based its decision, upheld on appeal, to order the applicant's placement in prison for an unlimited period of time after consulting two experts (a psychological expert and a psychiatric and psychotherapeutic expert, see paragraphs 12 and 14 above) on the applicant's dangerousness, as prescribed by section 4 of the Bavarian (Dangerous Offenders') Placement Act (see paragraph 46 above). \nThese experts had confirmed that the applicant currently posed a serious threat to the sexual self-determination of others.

This is illustrated by Articles 66 and 63 of the Criminal Code, a Federal law, and apparently also by the distinction made between the Bavarian (Dangerous Offenders') Placement Act on the one hand, and the Bavarian (Mentally Ill Persons') Placement Act, on the other. Under section 1 \u00a7 3 of the Bavarian (Dangerous Offenders') Placement Act, an order for a person's placement in prison was not to be made if that person was placed in a psychiatric hospital under the Bavarian (Mentally Ill Persons') Placement Act (see paragraph 44 above). Thus, it is clear that dangerous persons diagnosed with a mental illness were to be placed in a psychiatric hospital by the competent courts. In the applicant's case, the competent authorities had, however, refused to request the applicant's placement in a psychiatric hospital under the Bavarian (Mentally Ill Persons') Placement Act \n(see paragraph 13 above).",

For the execution of his placement, the rules for the execution of preventive detention orders made under the Criminal Code applied by analogy (section\u00a06 of the Bavarian (Dangerous Offenders') Placement Act, see paragraph 46 above). As the Court concluded in its recent judgment in the case of M. v.  (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 127-129), there is no substantial difference in practice between the execution of a (long) prison sentence and that of a preventive detention order.

It reiterates that, in order to be \u201clawful\u201d, the detention must conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, which must, moreover, be of a certain quality and, in particular, must be foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see paragraph 79 above). The Court notes that the domestic courts based the applicant's detention on the Bavarian (Dangerous Offenders') Placement Act, which the  found to be incompatible with the Basic Law. However, that court ordered the continued application of that Act until 30 September 2004. During the period at issue before the Court, the applicant's detention could therefore be considered to have complied with national law, as the said Act, read in conjunction with the Federal Constitutional Court's order, remained valid and applicable during a transitional period. However, a further issue arises in relation to the foreseeability of the (continued) application of the Bavarian (Dangerous Offenders') Placement Act, despite its unconstitutionality. The Court notes in this connection that three of the eight judges of the Federal Constitutional Court itself considered that that court did not have the power, in the applicant's case, to order the continued application of the unconstitutional (Dangerous Offenders') Placement Act (see paragraphs 26-29 above). However, in view of the above finding that the applicant's detention for preventive purposes was not justified under any of the sub-paragraphs of Article 5 \u00a7 1, it is not necessary to decide this question in the present case.",
