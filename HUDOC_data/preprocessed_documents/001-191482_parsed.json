The applicant denied the police officers\u2019 allegations of self-inflicted injuries and stated that he had signed the explanation about allegedly falling before the arrest under the threats of continued illtreatment from police officers S.D. and I.B., who had beaten him up before. According to statements by the applicant\u2019s girlfriend, she heard the applicant screaming from being allegedly beaten up during his arrest and at the police station; several days later at the police station he had complained to her that police officers had beaten him up; he had had abrasions on the face; and he had lost consciousness during a confrontation between them and the ambulance had been called.",

The most recent decision of 29 October 2010 maintained the same findings and had the same defects as the earlier decisions, for example the decision of 26 June 2009. The Court is therefore not convinced that an appeal to a court by the applicant, which could only have had the same effect, that is the annulment of a refusal to institute criminal proceedings, would have offered the applicant any redress. It therefore considers that an appeal in the circumstances of the present case would have been devoid of any purpose (see Devyatkin v. Russia, no.\u00a040384/06, \u00a7 30, 24 October 2017).
