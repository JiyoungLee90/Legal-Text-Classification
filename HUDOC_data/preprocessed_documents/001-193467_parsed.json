In this regard, the Court reiterates that while the applicant is entitled to make use of her procedural rights, she must bear the consequences when that leads to delays (see Malicka-W\u0105sowska v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 41413/98, 5 April 2001).",

In total, the first-instance court dealt with the case for over five years, during which it limited its actions to requesting new expert opinions every few years.

Moreover, a further two years later, in 2013, the court ordered yet another expert opinion. In this connection, the Court would reiterate that States are responsible for delays attributable to the conduct of their judicial or other authorities. They are also responsible for delays in the presentation of the reports and opinions of courtappointed experts. A State may be found liable not only for delay in the handling of a particular case, but also for failure to increase resources in response to a backlog of cases, or for structural deficiencies in its judicial system that cause delays. Tackling the problem of unreasonable delay in judicial proceedings may thus require the State to take a range of legislative, organisational budgetary and other measures (see Rutkowski and Others, cited above, \u00a7 128).",
