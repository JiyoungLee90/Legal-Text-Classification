The case originated in an application (no. 3479/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Valeriu Rusu (“the applicant”), on 11 December 2003.
The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Mr Vitalie Pârlog.
The applicant complained  that the failure to enforce a final judgment in his favour had infringed his right to have his civil rights determined by a court within a reasonable time, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, and his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions, as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 13 February 2006 the President of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on admissibility, merits and just satisfaction.
The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Edineţ.
In 1949 the Soviet authorities implemented their collectivisation policy and the applicant's grandparents were deprived of their land.
On 11 April 2002 the applicant's father sought from the Feteşti Local Council (“the Local Council”) the allocation of a plot of land, as provided for by the Land Code. His request having been refused, on an unspecified date in April 2002 he brought an action against the Local Council.
On 25 April 2002 the Edineţ District Court ruled in favour of the applicant's father and ordered the Local Council to allocate him a plot of land measuring 1.09 hectares. The judgment was not challenged and after fifteen days it became final and enforceable.
On 20 May 2002, on behalf of his father, the applicant wrote a letter to the Feteşti Local Council, seeking compliance with the judgment of 25 April 2002. On 28 May 2002 the Local Council replied that the judgment could not be complied with due to lack of available land.
On 22 May 2002, on behalf of his father, the applicant wrote a letter to the Edineţ District Court and complained about the Council's non-compliance with the judgment of 25 April 2002. The applicant alleged that the District Court had sent the letter to the bailiff, who had not replied.
On 4 February 2003 the applicant's father died. On 8 May 2003 a public notary issued an inheritance certificate in respect of the applicant, according to which he had inherited his father's plot of land, as provided for by the judgment of the Edineţ District Court.
On 8 May 2003 the applicant lodged a request with the Local Council seeking the allocation of land measuring 1.09 hectares, in accordance with the judgment of 25 April 2002 and the inheritance certificate. The Local Council did not reply.
On an unspecified date in 2003 the applicant initiated proceedings against the Local Council, seeking compensation for the value of the crops he could have obtained from cultivating his land in 2002.
On 11 August 2003 the Edineţ District Court ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the Local Council to pay him compensation in the amount of 5,000 Moldovan Lei (MDL) (324.12 euros (EUR) at the time). The Local Council lodged an appeal against the judgment.
On 6 November 2003 the Bălţi Court of Appeal upheld the appeal, quashed the judgment of 11 August 2003 and dismissed the applicant's action. The Court of Appeal found that since the applicant's father had died and the applicant had inherited the land only in May 2003, the latter could not seek compensation for the year 2002. The applicant lodged an appeal in cassation.
On 13 April 2005 the Supreme Court of Justice gave a final judgment and dismissed the applicant's action.
The judgment of 25 April 2002 has not been enforced to date.
The relevant domestic law has been set out in Prodan v. Moldova (no. 49806/99, ECHR 2004III (extracts)).
In addition, the relevant provisions of the Land Code read as follows:
Article 20.  Documents which confirm the rights of owners of land
“The documents which confirm the rights of owners of land are the following: the title deed of ownership of a plot of land (titlul de autentificare a dreptului deţinătorului de teren), issued by the local administrative authorities ..., the inheritance certificate ... as well as other [documents]...”
Article 21.  Inability to use the land until the delimitation of its borders
“The owners of land do not have the right to use it ... until the Local Council ... has delimited its borders...”
