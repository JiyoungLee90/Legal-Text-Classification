A couple of hours later he was again passing by the police station when he saw S., who was on the night shift, and suggested that they share a bottle of cognac. S. agreed. Soon, alone at the station, the applicant and S. began to practise disarming techniques with S.'s service pistol. A fatal shot was fired accidentally in the process. The applicant had believed that the pistol was empty; however, one cartridge had been left inside by S. According to the forensic autopsy report, at that time S. had been heavily drunk (blood alcohol content of 4.59 \u2030). Anticipating accusations of murder, the applicant decided to fake an attack on the police station. To that end he broke a door leading to the office of the commander of the police station and took away S.'s pistol, wallet and bag. The bag contained, inter alia, the official stamp of the police station and the deceased's police ID. He hid the pistol at his father's country residence and destroyed the stamp and ID.",

The Supreme Court further held that the prosecution's charges were based on the evidence collected at the initial stages of the investigation when the applicant had been denied any rights of defence and had been ill-treated by the police. In particular, the court stated that the applicant had been subjected to psychological pressure and had been beaten \u201cso severely that a window pane had been broken\u201d. The court sentenced the applicant to one and a half years' imprisonment for the theft of the official stamp and personal documents (Article 193 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Criminal Code of 1961) and remitted the remainder of the case for a fresh investigation.",
