In this respect the Constitutional Court noted that the authorities of Lithuania, as a State re-established in 1990, were not responsible for the Soviet occupation half a century earlier, nor were they responsible for the consequences of that occupation. The Constitutional Court held that since the 1940s many private persons had bought, in accordance with the legislation applicable at the material time, various properties which had previously been nationalised. It was impossible to deny those factual and legal aspects, and the domestic legislation on the restitution of property duly took into account the interests not only of the former owners, but also of private persons who had occupied or purchased the property by way of legal contracts.",
