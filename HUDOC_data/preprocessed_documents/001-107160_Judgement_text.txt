The case originated in twelve applications (nos. 44387/04, 2513/05, 24753/05, 34770/07, 37169/07, 54527/07, 21648/08, 42081/08, 56022/08, 59873/08, 671/09, 4555/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by fifteen Russian nationals (“the applicants”), on various dates listed in the appendix to this judgment.
Mr S.A. Abdulvagapov, Mr A.V. Gominykh, Mr S.S. Abdulov, Mr V.M. Prokhozhev and Mr A.R. Shirobokov were represented before the Court, respectively, by Mr A.Y. Gautayev, Ms Y.V. Akhmineyeva, Ms L. Zhukova, Ms O.A. Sadovskaya and Mr A.V. Rossikhin, lawyers practising in different regions of Russia.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On various dates the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
In accordance with the pilot judgment Burdov v.  (no. 2) (no. 33509/04, ECHR 2009...), the applications were adjourned pending their resolution at the domestic level.
The Government later informed the Court that enforcement of the domestic judgments in the applicants’ favour was impossible due to certain domestic execution formalities and requested the Court to consider the applications on the merits. The Court therefore decided to resume examination of the present cases.
The applicants were born on the dates listed in the appendix to this judgment and live in various regions of .
On the dates listed in the appendix the domestic courts found in the applicants’ favour against various State bodies. Mr Tkhyegepso and Ms Afaunova were awarded compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by unlawful actions of a State body. Ms I. Kalitkina and Ms Y. Kalitkina were awarded, respectively, a survivor’s pension and compensation for the loss of breadwinner. Mr Shirobokov was initially awarded a flat, but subsequently this award was converted into its monetary equivalent amounting to 950,000 Russian roubles (RUB). The rest of the applicants, active and retired military officers, obtained monetary awards against various military units. The amounts awarded by the domestic courts are listed in the appendix.
The applicants took various steps to obtain execution of the judgments. However, the judgments remain unenforced to date.
On an unspecified date Mr Shirobokov obtained from the Supreme Court of Russia compensation for non-pecuniary damage resulting from delayed enforcement of the judgment in his favour in the amount of RUB 68,000 (approximately 1,700 euros (EUR)).
Federal Law no. 68-ФЗ “On Compensation for Violation of the Right to a Trial within a Reasonable Time or the Right to Enforcement of a Judgment within a Reasonable Time” of 30 April 2010 (in force from 4 May 2010) provides that in the case of a violation of the right to trial within a reasonable time or of the right to enforcement of a final judgment, Russian citizens are entitled to seek compensation for non-pecuniary damage. Federal Law No. 69-ФЗ, adopted on the same day, introduced the pertinent changes into Russian legislation.
The transitional arrangements (section 6.2 of Federal Law no. 68ФЗ) provided that everyone who had a pending application before the European Court of Human Rights concerning a complaint of the type described in the law had six months to lodge the complaint with the domestic courts.
