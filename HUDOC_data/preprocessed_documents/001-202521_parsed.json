A man who immediately after the elections in which the party to which he belonged and [which] led [the campaign] promoting party loyalty so that people supported it and which received 30.6% of the votes \u2013 what was his first political act? To visit whom? The occupation leader in the so-called presidential palace. And this is really a stab in the back for the laws and rights of our people. That is to say, only naive people cannot understand the political messages imparted by this unacceptable act, and indeed who was he accompanied by? By Mr C.Th. who, to remind you incidentally, recently received a respectable sum of 7,000 Cyprus Pounds from a Turkish company and the next day went to a television station and stated that there was no pseudo-state. And I also want to note that this in essence constituted an up-grade of the pseudo-state which the English and the Americans seek. By whom? By our own people. And this constitutes huge support for Turkish intransigence. Why should the Turks change their positions when our own people and especially people who hold office with the approval of our people hold these views? That is to say, if we were in the position of the Turks, would we change our views? Namely, when you see people who acted in this way and swore on the Holy Bible that the Annan plan be accepted because it was manna from heaven, they would have to be crazy to change their attitude and positions.",

And I think now the responsibility has to be emphasised of all these people who, due to their naivety, believe that party loyalty is above the interests of the country and the people. We must first preserve the party and let the country go where it will. And become Turkish. And when Mr C. went accompanied by Mr T. and his daughter yesterday, he certainly went also accompanied by all these thousands of votes received by these gentlemen.

Consequently, the main issue in the case was not the meaning of the language used in relation to the actions attributed to the plaintiff, but whether it was justified to link the two remarks made by the applicant. The Supreme Court ruled that the combination of both the above-mentioned actions, together with the words used and the synthesis made by the applicant, left no room for any interpretation other than the implication that the plaintiff/appellant had acted as alleged after receiving money from the Turkish company. Such conduct, in the context of the situation in Cyprus, the Turkish invasion and occupation of the northern part by Turkish troops, could create in an average reasonable reader, in the absence of any other reference, feelings of hatred, contempt and derision of the plaintiff/appellant.

The amendments provide that a judge, whether sitting alone or as a member of a bench, cannot hear a case in which a party is represented by a lawyer who is a member of the \u201cfamily of the judge\u201d. Family is defined as parents, spouses, children, children\u2019s spouses, siblings, siblings\u2019 children and siblings\u2019 spouses and persons with whom a judge has a spiritual relationship (\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), the relationship of fatherinlaw and son-in-law/daughter-in-law, and the relationship between fathers-in-law (\u03c3\u03c7\u03ad\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd-\u03b3\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd/\u03bd\u03cd\u03c6\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ae \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5). Furthermore, if a lawyer is the employer, employee or partner, or has a professional relationship with a lawyer who is a family member of a judge, including a trainee lawyer, the judge should inform the parties to the proceedings of all the relevant facts. In such a situation, if an objection is raised concerning the judge\u2019s participation in the hearing of the case, the judge then decides if he or she will recuse himself or herself or not, in light of the relevant case-law, including the recent case-law of the Court. The Supreme Court referred in this connection to the Court\u2019s judgments in Nicholas, cited above, and Ramljak v.\u00a0Croatia (no.\u00a05856/13, 27 June 2017). If no objection is made and the judge does not consider that there are grounds for his or her recusal, he or she is free to continue hearing the case. This judicial practice does not apply when the court appearance concerns minor matters (\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b5\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd).",

It held that it did not have inherent jurisdiction to annul or amend a judgment, as this would constitute third-instance jurisdiction, which neither the Constitution nor domestic law allowed for.

In particular, it reiterates that when a judge has a blood tie with an employee of a law firm representing a party in any given proceedings, this does not in and of itself disqualify the judge.

It is, however, a situation or affiliation that could give rise to misgivings as to the judge\u2019s impartiality. Whether such misgivings are objectively justified would very much depend on the circumstances of the specific case, and a number of factors should be taken into account in this regard. These should include, inter alia, whether the judge\u2019s relative has been involved in the case in question, the position of the judge\u2019s relative in the firm, the size of the firm, its internal organisational structure, the financial importance of the case for the law firm, and any possible financial interest or potential benefit (and the extent thereof) on the part of the relative (ibid.).",

During the appeal hearing he had withdrawn the grounds of appeal raising the defence of fair comment, which would have given the Supreme Court the opportunity to examine whether the defamatory statement had been covered by the said defence. In doing so the Supreme Court would have proceeded with a balancing exercise between the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression and the appellant\u2019s right to reputation within the parameters of that defence. In domestic law, the defence of fair comment acted as a safeguard for freedom of expression in relation to matters of public interest and could be used as a procedural safeguard to the benefit of a defendant in defamation proceedings. The recognition and safeguarding of that defence essentially sought to ensure the participation of citizens in matters of public interest, through public criticism and comment on persons and situations in relation to matters of public interest, provided that there was no bad faith. It further afforded a defendant in such proceedings the chance to prove that there had been a sufficient factual basis for his or her allegation. Referring to the Court\u2019s judgment in Morice v. France ([GC], no.\u00a029369/10, \u00a7\u00a0155, ECHR\u00a02015), the Government argued that according to the Court\u2019s case law, being afforded such an opportunity was a factor to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference under Article\u00a010. In support of their arguments the Government referred to judgments of the Supreme Court in defamation proceedings in which the defence of fair comment had been raised and examined (see paragraphs\u00a03235 above).",

The firstinstance court found that his statements had not been defamatory and, in any event, upheld the defence of fair comment. On appeal, however, the applicant withdrew that defence and agreed that the matter to be examined on appeal concerned only whether or not the statements had been defamatory. It transpires from the record of the hearing before the Supreme Court that the appellant\u2019s lawyer initially raised the issue whether the issue of fair comment should be pursued, and the Supreme Court explicitly asked the applicant\u2019s lawyer\u2019s viewpoint on the matter. An exchange ensued which initially was not entirely clear. The Supreme Court, however, then clarified that the subject matter of the trial in view of that exchange would be limited to whether or not there had been defamation and nothing else, and that this would determine the outcome of the appeal. As the Government pointed out, the applicant\u2019s lawyer agreed with the court unreservedly on the matter and expressly stated that he was in favour of limiting the issue on appeal to whether there was defamation. As a consequence, the Supreme Court\u2019s examination of the case and ruling was limited to that sole issue.",

The above amount was broken down as follows: (a) EUR 25,413.66 for costs and expenses incurred in relation to the firstinstance proceedings in civil action no.\u00a03775/06, in the appeal proceedings (appeal no. 297/08) and the firstinstance proceedings concerning damages; (b) EUR 14,586.34 for the expenses incurred in appeal no.\u00a079/13, in the proceedings contesting the costs awarded by the firstinstance court in civil action no. 3775/06, and for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court. The applicant provided certain receipts and bills of costs in relation to the costs and expenses incurred domestically.",

The applicant had failed to give any itemised bills or invoices substantiating his claim for EUR 40,000, but relied on an oral agreement. That amount was in any event excessive. Furthermore, some of the costs claimed did not concern proceedings which were the subjectmatter of the present application. The only costs that the applicant could claim in relation to the domestic proceedings were those which had been approved by the Registrar (of the Supreme Court) for legal costs incurred in civil case no. 3775/06 and civil appeal no. 297/08; and the costs of the additional first-instance proceedings concerning damages. These amounted to EUR\u00a013,282.88.",

The domestic proceedings concerned his complaint under that provision. The issue of impartiality during the appeal proceedings only came up following the conclusion of the proceedings in appeal no. 297/08. The additional proceedings were confined to the question of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff for defamation. Thus the costs and expenses incurred by the applicant before the domestic courts were not incurred in his attempt to seek redress for the violation found by the Court under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention.
