Accordingly, in the present case the lodging of the appeal was limited to a period of one year after the date on which the decision became final (they cite also Sovtransavto Holding v. Ukraine, no. 48553/99, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 2002VII). They considered that the final decision had been quashed for having seriously infringed the law, therefore to correct judicial mistakes and miscarriages of justice, situation which had already been sanctioned by the Court (see Ryabykh v. , no. 52854/99, \u00a7 52, ECHR\u00a02003IX). Furthermore, the Procurator-General had not acted on his own initiative but at the request of the Association, which had been party to the initial proceedings. Lastly, the Government contended that if the final decision had not been quashed, the applicant would have received from the Association a sum of money that he did not deserve (unjust enrichment) and recalled that the case had been referred back to the ordinary courts and during the new trial all the procedural requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 had been observed.",
