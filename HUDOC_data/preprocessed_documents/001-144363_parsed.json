However, under section 25 of that Act the value of a claim concerning real property should be equal to its market value (see paragraph 27 above). In the present case, an expert appointed by the Biograd na Moru Municipal Court established that the market value of the property at issue in its entirety was HRK 208,575.66 (see paragraph 9 above). It thus appears that the claim, which concerned a half share of that property, would amount to HRK\u00a0104,287.83. Yet the Biograd na Moru Municipal Court decided that the value of dispute was only HRK 10,000, without providing any reasons as to why the value set was more than ten times lower than the market value of the half share of the property established by the expert appointed by that court.",

Owing to that omission, the applicant\u2019s legal predecessor was left in the dark as to whether she had the right to lodge an appeal on points of law in respect of that claim. Her reliance on the market value, established by a court-appointed expert, appears reasonable in view of section 25 of the Court Fees Act.",
