This right extends only to disputes (\u201ccontestation\u201d) over \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law (see, inter alia, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, \u00a7 81; Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, \u00a7\u00a036).",

Indeed, it is self-evident that disputes over such matters may have major repercussions on the assets and liabilities of the estate of the company in liquidation. This restriction is therefore intended to protect the rights and interests of others, namely those of creditors (see Luordo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a086).",

The Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court held that only the liquidator could bring such an action on behalf of the company; the applicants, as mere shareholders, had no right to be party to such proceedings. The Court notes the Government\u2019s assertion that the applicants could have sued the liquidator if they deemed that its omission to start such litigation had caused them damage. However, it is not convinced by this argument, especially in view of the blanket denial of the applicants\u2019 locus standi as the company\u2019s owners. It reiterates that the Convention and its Protocols must be interpreted as guaranteeing rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and illusory. In the Court\u2019s view, it is unreasonable to expect the liquidator \u2013 who was responsible for securing the payment of creditors rather than protecting the interests of shareholders \u2013 to bring an official liability action in the name of the company against the very courts which had ordered the liquidation and decided on its own appointment (see, by analogy, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 49429/99, 9 September 2004). Moreover, to require the shareholders, for their part, to claim damages from the liquidator for not doing so would have proved excessively cumbersome for the applicants and provided an illusory solution for the protection of their pecuniary interests.",
