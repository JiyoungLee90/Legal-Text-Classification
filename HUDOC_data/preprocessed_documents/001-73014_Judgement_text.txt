The case originated in an application (no. 20551/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Czech national, Mr Jaroslav Heřmanský (“the applicant”), on 7 December 2001.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Hlavnička, a lawyer practising in Kamenický Šenov. The Czech Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V.A. Schorm of the Ministry of Justice.  On 19 October 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Hřensko.
On 3 July 1992 the Děčín District Court (okresní soud) granted the applicant’s action and declared the North-Bohemian Gas Company’s (Severočeské plynárny) immediate termination of his employment in 1989 null and void.
On 14 October 1997 the applicant lodged an action for loss of wages against his former employer in the  District Court. On 10 December 1997 he paid court fees.
On 25 September 1998 the District Court discontinued the proceedings due to the applicant’s alleged withdrawal of his action.
On 30 November 1998 the Regional Court, upon the applicant’s appeal of 23 November 1998, quashed this decision and remitted the case to the District Court for further consideration.
A hearing held on 9 April 1999 was adjourned sine die with a view to verifying information presented at the hearing.
On 25 October 1999 the applicant’s case was transmitted to another judge because of the long-term illness of the original judge.
On 4 October 2000 the applicant’s legal representative, upon the court’s telephoned request, submitted supplementary documents.
On 15 January 2001 he was requested to present other documents. As the applicant’s legal representative did not do so, the court urged him to comply on 9 April 2001. He complied on 14 May 2001.
On 13 June 2001 the defendant submitted its written comments.
On 28 August 2001 the District Court’s vice-president, upon the applicant’s complaint, acknowledged the delay in the proceedings.
As the judge dealing with the applicant’s case had left on maternity leave on 8 October 2001, another judge was appointed. On 15 November 2001 the District Court vice-president requested the new judge to deal with the case speedily. She renewed her request on 1 October 2002. On 31 October 2002 the vice-president appointed another judge to deal with the case due to the long-term illness of the previous judge.
In the meantime, on 9 August 2002, the applicant had asked for referral of his action to the Liberec District Court, considering that the latter would deal with the action without delay. On 10 March 2003 his legal representative was invited to clarify his client’s request. On 7 April 2003 the lawyer replied and, on 18 April 2003, he paid court fees concerning the referral.
On 7 May 2003 the applicant’s request was sent to the defendant which, on 29 May 2003, expressed its disagreement.
On 20 June 2003 the  (krajský soud) decided that the applicant’s action would not be transferred to the Liberec District Court.
On 4 September 2003 the vice-president of the District Court again urged the judge to continue to deal with the case.
Two hearings were held, on 7 November 2003 and 6 February 2004. A hearing which was to be held on 14 May 2004 was adjourned sine die on 2 April 2004, as the judge was ill. On 20 September 2004 another judge was appointed, who fixed the next hearing for 5 January 2005.
