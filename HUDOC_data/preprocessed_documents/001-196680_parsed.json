This was so, a fortiori in light of the fact that an alternative explanation (which not even the first applicant had attempted to provide) would have been completely implausible. It was not credible that the first applicant had been involved in two car accidents with people with whom he was already acquainted, involving his relatives and causing the same injuries, and in the same street in San Marino. Moreover, the numerous phone calls between the first and second applicants had confirmed the existence of a well-established relationship, albeit also a professional one, between the two accused. Therefore, the incriminating statements of G. and L. had not represented unexpected and decisive revelations but had just confirmed that the first applicant could not be considered so unlucky as to have had two such peculiar car accidents.",

Relying on judgment No.\u00a06 of the constitutional jurisdiction (namely, il Collegio Garante della Costituzionalita` delle Norme) of 1 August 2007 the judge considered that it had the competence to examine Convention complaints. It also noted that the first applicant had already brought proceedings before the ECtHR who had communicated the case to the respondent Government. However, even assuming the case was not inadmissible on the basis of the principle that the applicant having chosen one remedy he cannot have recourse to another (electa una via non datur recursus ad alteram), further considerations applied. The judge held that to enable consideration of such a request based on the extraordinary competence of the Judge of Extraordinary Remedies in Criminal Matters despite revision proceedings having originally been limited to the exhaustive list of grounds arising from Article 200 of the Code, such request would nevertheless have to comply with the same six months\u2019 rule applicable before the ECtHR. It followed that the applicant\u2019s Convention complaints were inadmissible as being out of time, them having been lodged more than six months after the appeal judgment in the proceedings complained of. He considered the remaining complaints inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded.",

Indeed none of the cases brought before the Court against San Marino had ever been rejected on the basis of nonexhaustion for failure to seek a remedy before the Judge of Extraordinary Remedies. It was true that by a judgment of 16\u00a0August 2016 the Judge of Extraordinary Remedies established his competence to examine human rights issues. However, that competence went beyond that provided in Article 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure concerning revision proceedings (see paragraph 59 above), and thus such competence had no basis in law (contrary, for example, to the new constitutional remedy in Turkey examined in Hasan Uzun v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a010755/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06871, 30\u00a0April 2013). Moreover, the 2016 judgment was not accessible since San\u00a0Marino did not have a system of published judgments (except for constitutional cases), thus making it difficult for individuals to learn about a new remedy created by case-law as opposed to codified law. Similarly, the decision of the Judge of Extraordinary Remedies, in the first applicant\u2019s case, to apply a six months\u2019 time-limit also had no legal basis. Indeed that judge had only chosen to apply the same time-limit used by the Court, but he could also have applied that relevant to revision proceedings namely a year (see paragraph 60 above) or that of any other human rights organ. Thus, even the rules regulating the remedy were uncertain. In this connection the first applicant referred to Williams v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom ((dec.), no.\u00a032567/06, 17\u00a0February 2009). The first applicant pointed out that pursuing an uncertain remedy could lead to having a case rejected by the Court for failure to abide by the six-month limit. He relied on Rezgui v.\u00a0France ((dec.), no. 49859/99, 7 November 2000) and Prystavska v.\u00a0Ukraine ((dec.), no.\u00a021287/02, 17 December 2002).",

Italy (no.\u00a076577/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0111113, 24\u00a0January 2019).

Romania, no.\u00a04941/07, \u00a7\u00a036, 6\u00a0October 2015; Kiiskinen v. Finland (dec.) no.\u00a026323/95, ECHR 1999-V; and contrast Zima v. Poland, (dec.). \u00a7 47, no.\u00a019186/10, 25\u00a0August 2015). The Court notes that the applicants\u2019 case became res judicata on the strength of the judgment of the Judge of Criminal Appeals of 10\u00a0October 2016, published on 12\u00a0October 2016. The Court further notes that in previous cases against San Marino the Court has already held that revision proceedings under Article 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure amounted to an extraordinary remedy which need not be exhausted, see, for example, the admissibility decision in Ercolani v. San Marino ((dec.), no.\u00a035430/97, 28\u00a0May 2002) and the cases cited therein.",

Indeed the fact that the Government did not raise this objection in respect of the second applicant, who did not undertake proceedings before the Judge of Extraordinary Remedies, lends support to this conclusion. It follows that the first applicant was not required to pursue such remedy. The fact that the first applicant pursued it after he lodged his application with the Court has no bearing on this finding.",

In this connection, the Government noted that G. and L. had been coaccused in the same proceedings, had confessed to the crime and had given evidence against the first and second applicants (see paragraph 17 above). Therefore, they had a personal interest in the outcome of the proceedings and, in accordance with the privilege against selfincrimination they were not obliged to make statements that might be detrimental to their personal position, nor were they obliged to participate in the trial.

In the Court\u2019s view once a co-accused or other accomplice makes statements incriminating another person (i.e. the accused), the former inevitably becomes \u201ca witness against him\u201d and should expect to be confronted by the accused as well as to be compelled to appear at trial for such purpose. Indeed, the absence under national legislation of any means to ensure the attendance of the accusers (charged with the same crime), for the purposes of examination, can be considered inadequate and can contribute to a finding of a violation of the rights of the accused (see, for example, Mild and Virtanen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 46-48). However, the Court emphasises that the status of \u201cwitness\u201d given to a co-accused or an alleged accomplice (tried separately) does not detract from their own rights as accused persons or criminal suspects, including that of the privilege against selfincrimination (see, by implication, Cabral, cited above \u00a7 34).

They failed to attend any other hearing thereafter, and although represented by counsel, they did not withdraw their statements, which had been admitted to the file. No further steps were taken by the domestic authorities to have G. and L. crossexamined as witnesses. The applicants\u2019 request to reopen the investigation in order to cross-examine them was refused (see paragraph\u00a039 above). Thus, the Court is of the view that the domestic courts did not make any significant efforts to hear G. and L. in adversarial proceedings. While it is true that there is no suggestion that L. and G. were absent witnesses in the sense that they were dead, sick, or unreachable (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7 119), they were absent witnesses in so far as they did not attend the trial in person while their untested evidence was admitted for use by the trial courts.",

Indeed, the investigating judge (see paragraph 25 above) and the firstinstance judge (see paragraph 39 above) held that under domestic law, an accused person could not crossexamine a coaccused witness. The first applicant contested this (see paragraph 74 above). The Judge of Criminal Appeals confirmed that the investigating judge had legitimately questioned L. and G. without the presence of the applicants\u2019 defence and that their statements had been correctly admitted as evidence and used in the firstinstance judgment, given that the Code of Criminal Procedure did not contain any rules on the admissibility of evidence (see paragraph 49 above).",

Indeed, the Court has previously found that a respondent Party could not be criticized for allowing criminal suspects to make use of their Article 6 rights, i.e. where a witness, once called, remained silent, invoking his privilege against self-incrimination (see Cabral, cited above, \u00a7 34, and Vidgen v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, no.\u00a029353/06, \u00a7\u00a042, 10 July 2012). The Court considers that had L. and G. been called for the purposes of cross-examination, even if they could not have been compelled to give evidence, the court would still have been able to see them in the witness box and assess their demeanour in response to crossexamination (compare Seton, cited above, \u00a7 62, and Pichugin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a038623/03, \u00a7 199, 23 October 2012).",

This is even more so where the coaccused, whose statements were being used, had admitted to the charges and not retracted their testimony via counsel present at the hearing, and thus had no apparent reason to remain silent at trial. Indeed, in the present case, precisely on the basis of their confession, the two witnesses had asked the court to take account of mitigating circumstances in sentencing them (see paragraph 36 above). It follows, that in the circumstances of the present case there was no good reason for not securing the attendance of the witnesses at the trial. As noted in the general principles (see paragraph 92 above), while this cannot of itself be conclusive of the unfairness of a trial, it is a very important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the overall fairness of a trial and one which may tip the balance in favour of finding a breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 3 (d) (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7 113).",

The Court notes that both the first-instance judge (see paragraph\u00a040 above) and the Judge of Criminal Appeals (see paragraph\u00a051 above) held that, in addition to G. and L.\u2019s statements, further corroborating evidence existed, namely, phone records showing contacts between the first applicant and G. prior to the car accident of 28\u00a0September 2011 and the odd circumstance that both accidents had occurred in the same street and had involved the same driver and the same passengers.

As to the strength of the additional incriminating evidence available in the present case, the Court will first take into account the evidence in relation to the first accident. Apart from the statements of L. and G., the corroborating factors consisted of the general circumstances of the accidents (see paragraph 9 above) which led to the matter being investigated, and the phone records (namely a list of phone calls, but not their content) between the first applicant and the second applicant, which happened after the first accident and for which the applicants provided an explanation (see paragraph 43 above). As to the second accident, the corroborating factors consisted again of the general circumstances of the accidents (see paragraph 9 above) and the phone records (namely a list of phone calls, but not their content) between the first applicant and G., before the accident. The Court considers that the available corroborative evidence could not be considered conclusive as to the fact that the accidents had been fictitious and as to the fraud with which the applicants were charged. It follows that since L. and G. were the only eyewitnesses to the offence in question, their testimony could be considered decisive. However, even if the evaluation of the weight of the evidence by the domestic courts was not unacceptable or arbitrary, for the purposes of the present case, it suffices for the Court to consider that even if not \u201cdecisive\u201d, L. and G.\u2019s statements carried significant weight and their admission in evidence clearly undermined the defence.",

However, in the present case, nowhere do the domestic judgments state that the court had been obliged to exercise particular diligence in assessing the witnesses\u2019 credibility given that neither the defence nor the court had been able to question and observe the demeanour of the witnesses at the trial (see, a contrario, Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0146). The Court of Appeal limited itself to holding that, in order to assess the reliability of evidence, a judge had solely to take into account the way in which the evidence in question had been acquired (see paragraph 49 above), a principle applicable to the assessment of evidence in general. Nor did the courts, anywhere in their judgment as regards G.\u2019s testimony or in the appropriate context as regards L.\u2019s testimony, (i) take any account of the fact that G. and L.\u2019s statements had not been consistent, namely that they had first denied all the charges against them and then later admitted to them (see Dimovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 46); (ii) make any observation as to whether the witnesses had given detailed and coherent descriptions of the circumstances of the offence; (iii) take into consideration the fact that the witnesses had, without good reason, not made themselves available for cross-examination (see, a contrario and mutatis mutandis, Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 148-49); or (iv) assess the reliability of L.\u2019s testimony in the light of the fact that it had been given to obtain the advantages offered to her in exchange.

She thus refused the applicants\u2019 request to crossexamine G. and L. at the investigation stage and did not include G. and L. in the list of witnesses to be heard at the trial (see paragraph\u00a026 above). She was thus aware that G. and L. would not be heard at the trial and by denying the applicants the opportunity to crossexamine them during the investigation, she took the foreseeable risk, which subsequently materialised, that neither the applicants nor their counsel would be able to question G. and L. at any stage of the proceedings.",

I also note in this context that the judgment criticises the domestic courts for not taking into account \u201cthe fact that the witnesses had, without good reason, not made themselves available for cross-examination\u201d (see paragraph 109 of the judgment). The problem with this argument is that a co-accused does not have to make him or herself available for cross-examination without being previously summoned for that purpose. The majority should instead criticise the domestic courts for not summoning the coaccused and for not expressly taking into consideration in the reasoning of the judgments the fact that the coaccused had not been questioned directly by the domestic courts.",

In my view, this is not the best way of approaching the problem. The initial assumption is the freedom of the accused in conducting his defence. The decision of an accused not to appear in person does not require any justification and deserves protection. However, this protection is not absolute because the right of the accused not to appear may be outweighed by the interests of the co-accused or other parties to the proceedings. The right of one accused to have a coaccused summoned and questioned directly at the trial usually prevails over the interest of this coaccused in not being present in person at the whole trial or at a specific hearing.",

The question whether there was a good reason for not summoning and seeking to examine another coaccused at the trial arises only if an accused requests the court to summon for the purpose of direct examination a co-accused whose statements may be relevant for deciding the criminal case. Such good reason may lie in the fact that a coaccused who previously made certain statements at the pretrial stage has asserted at the beginning of the trial his right to remain silent throughout the subsequent proceedings.",

Secondly, the absence of a co-accused before a court which approaches indirect evidence with caution may also create a handicap for the prosecution. Thirdly, in a legal system complying with the requirements of a fair trial the defence will have at its disposal a broad set of procedural rights (for instance, the right to submit new evidence and to contest the credibility of the evidence presented by the prosecution) and can always call into question the evidentiary value of statements made by other coaccused at the investigation stage and highlight their untested nature, thus further lowering their value. The inquisitorial principle coupled with the free assessment of evidence (or rather, more appropriately, the rational assessment of evidence) and the obligation to give reasons for the judgment require the domestic tribunal to establish the \u201cmaterial\u201d truth and to justify rationally the factual findings on which the judgment is based. These principles, if correctly adhered to, should ensure that the proceedings are fair and that the final judgment is just, in spite of the fact that one of the coaccused was not directly questioned by the court.",
