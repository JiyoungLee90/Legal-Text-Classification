The reopening of the proceedings in the Federal Court is merely a subsidiary means of redress, irrespective of the outcome of that procedure. An unfavourable outcome for the applicant cannot be regarded as any less compatible with the Convention than the absence of such a procedure (argumentum a maiore ad minus).

In my opinion, reopening of proceedings is not an ideal means of reparation in international law since it often does not allow the effects of a violation found by the Court to be redressed as far as possible (contrary to what the majority state in paragraph 56 of the judgment).
