Lastly, the Court of Cassation held that the act of throwing a Molotov cocktail at a police car was an aggravating circumstance in respect of the offence of criminal damage to public property using flammable or explosive materials, and thus the trial court ought to have sentenced the applicant only for the offence of criminal damage to property.",

The lawyer\u2019s presence and active assistance during questioning by police is an important procedural safeguard aimed at, among other things, preventing the collection of evidence through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the suspect and protecting the freedom of a suspected person to choose whether to speak or to remain silent when questioned by the police (see Soytemiz v.

That also applies to the right to legal assistance. However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, such a waiver must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance. Such a waiver need not be explicit, but it must be voluntary and constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right. Before an accused can be said to have implicitly, through his or her conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he or her could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his or her conduct would be. Moreover, the waiver must not run counter to any important public interest (see Simeonovi, cited above, \u00a7 115). It follows that a waiver of the right to a lawyer, a fundamental right among those listed in Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a03 which constitute the notion of a fair trial, must be strictly compliant with the above requirements (see, mutatis mutandis, Murtazaliyeva v.\u00a0Russia [GC], no. 36658/05, \u00a7 118, 18 December 2018).",

Those considerations also hold true for the validity of a waiver of the entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial, as what constitutes a valid waiver cannot be the subject of a single unvarying fact but must depend on the individual circumstances of the particular case (see Murtazaliyeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011718).",

In the view of the Court, this is another factor, which casts doubt on and stands against the contention that the applicant unequivocally waived his right to a lawyer in accordance with the Convention standards before making statements to the police on 28\u00a0July 2004.

As there were no compelling reasons to restrict the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer when he was giving statements to the police, the Court must apply a very strict scrutiny to its fairness assessment (see Dimitar Mitev v. Bulgaria, no. 34779/09, \u00a7 71, 8 March 2018). More importantly, the onus will be on the Government to demonstrate convincingly why, exceptionally and in the specific circumstances of the case, the overall fairness of the trial was not irretrievably prejudiced by the restriction on access to legal advice (see Beuze, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0145; Simeonovi, cited above, \u00a7 132; and Ibrahim and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0265).",

Cyprus, no. 4268/04, \u00a7 82, 11 December 2008). In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. Indeed, where the reliability of evidence is in dispute the existence of fair procedures to examine the admissibility of the evidence takes on an even greater importance (see Pavlenko v.

Pursuant to that provision, the police statements taken without a lawyer present should not have been used by the trial court unless they had been confirmed before a court or a judge.",
