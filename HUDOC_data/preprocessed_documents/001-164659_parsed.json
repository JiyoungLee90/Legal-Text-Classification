Given that the applicant organisation had not referred to objections to the broadcasting of the musical works, the existence of a de facto contractual relationship between the parties had been proven.

It awarded the applicant organisation compensation in the amount of LVL 100,000 (EUR\u00a0143,000), which exceeded the amount the defendant had paid under the expired licence agreement. It considered that it would be fruitless to issue an injunction prohibiting the defendant from broadcasting the works. The appellate court observed that in principle the parties had expressed their interest in concluding a licence agreement but that before and during the court proceedings the parties had not agreed on the equitable royalty rate. It also pointed to the applicant organisation\u2019s responsibility in failing to reach an agreement in the negotiation of a new licence. As a result, over a prolonged period of time the authors\u2019 rights had been unprotected. As the parties had not asked the court to decide on the exact terms and conditions of a licence agreement, the appellate court decided to impose on the parties a general obligation to conclude a licence agreement by 1\u00a0March\u00a02004. Given that the parties had been unable to agree on a royalty rate, the appellate court set the rate at 3% of the defendant\u2019s net turnover. In reaching this conclusion the appellate court took into consideration such elements as, inter alia, the royalty rate set in other court proceedings and the existing practice in certain other EU member States.",
