In the body examination report, it was noted that there was an ecchymosis measuring 1x1 cm and an abrasion on the surface of the knee cap of the second body that was later identified as that of Sava\u015f Buldan. It was further recorded that cyanosis was noted on the front part of the body, left leg upper part, left knee, genitals and the head. It was also perceived that rigor mortis was fading. It was observed that when the body was touched, the skin peeled - which was most probably due to its damp condition. One bullet entrance hall on right occipital area and burnt hair caused by a close-range shot and a bullet exit hole behind the right ear (which damaged the tissue, internal tissue and bones) were noted. A wide haematoma on the left eye due to trauma caused by a blunt object, fracture of the nose, and blood from the nostrils to the moustache area were also noticed. No other signs or abnormalities were observed either on the back of the body or the genital area. There were no documents to prove identification, nor were there any valuables or money. On the surface of the right hand and wrist a further ecchymosis measuring 1 cm. in width was noted, which was probably caused when the hands were tied with a rope. The doctors further concluded that as the cause of death was clearly cerebral haemorrhage, there was no need to conduct a classical autopsy. The estimated time of death was given as 10 hours before the autopsy was carried out.",

They did not feel that they had enough evidence to bring charges and consequently some officers from the Police, Gendarmerie and MIT started talking about using different methods of dealing with certain members of the Kurdish community. A special team was formed for this purpose by, inter alia, the Chief of Police, Mehmet A\u011far and the Chief of Special Forces, Korkut Eken. This team consisted both of members of the Special Forces and certain civilians, including Ya\u015far \u00d6z. The activities of this special team were known to other members of the MIT and the Intelligence Branch of the Gendarmerie (the J\u0130TEM). The kidnapping and the killing of Sava\u015f Buldan and his friends formed part of such activities. It was established that these persons were helping the PKK financially. The way they were kidnapped and killed did not bear any resemblance to the activities of a Mafia or other underground organisation known to us. Police identity cards and policing methods were used during the kidnapping of Sava\u015f Buldan and his friends, otherwise it would not have been possible to kidnap them and to kill them as there are checkpoints on the roads along which they would have been stopped. To go through these checkpoints could only have been possible by making use of an official title\u201d.",

This obligation is not confined to cases where it has been established that the killing was caused by an agent of the State. Nor is it decisive whether members of the deceased's family or others have lodged a formal complaint about the killing with the competent investigation authority. The mere fact that the authorities were informed of the killing of the applicant's brother gave rise ipso facto to an obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death (see Tanr\u0131kulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 103, ECHR 1999-IV). The nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfies the minimum threshold of an investigation's effectiveness depends on the circumstances of each particular case. It must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (see Velikova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 41488/98, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2000-VI, and \u00dclk\u00fc Ekinci, cited above, \u00a7144).",

However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating a use of lethal force or a disappearance may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see, in general, McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0108-15, ECHR 2001III, and Av\u015far, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 390-95).",

For the Court, the applicant's concerns should have led the authorities to broaden the scope of the investigation. However, it is apparent from the case file that the authorities did not make any serious attempt to broaden the investigation so as to investigate the possible involvement of State agents in the killing. It notes that a link between the killing of Sava\u015f Buldan and the special team mentioned in the Susurluk Report was in fact established in the decision of the  dated 24 November 1998. In reaching this decision, the  stated that there was no evidence to suggest that the killing of Sava\u015f Buldan and his friends had been carried out for personal motives. However, the  ruled that it had no jurisdiction in the matter and transferred the case file to the  (see paragraphs\u00a054-56 above). As can be observed from the facts of the case, a protracted dispute then ensued over which court had jurisdiction to prosecute Ya\u015far \u00d6z for the killing of Sava\u015f Buldan. Ultimately, the Fifth Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation found that the charges laid against Ya\u015far \u00d6z were not related to organised crime and remitted the case to the , which acquitted Ya\u015far \u00d6z for lack of evidence. It can only be concluded that in the course of these proceedings the link identified between the killing of Sava\u015f Buldan and the activities of the special team was regrettably ignored. The Court is also struck by the fact that it would appear that no investigation was carried out in order to determine whether the documents referred to by Mr Hanefi Avc\u0131 in his statement dated 7 February 1997 in fact existed (see paragraph 43 above). It recalls in this connection that, according to Mr Avc\u0131, if an investigation were to be conducted into certain sources it would be possible to find documents to verify the accuracy of the allegation that Sava\u015f Buldan and his friends had been killed by an illegal group.",

In this letter, which was written to the D\u00fczce public prosecutor's office, the Ministry requested the D\u00fczce public prosecutor's office to conduct a rapid and effective investigation into the killing of Sava\u015f Buldan, while noting at the same time that it was highly probable that the investigations would not produce any outcome. Despite the Ministry's effort to carry out an effective investigation, the Court observes that the domestic authorities never provided any information about the owner of the car with registration number 34 CK 420, which, according to an eyewitness, was one of the cars that had been used on 3 June 1994. Although on 4 June 1994, one day after the incident, this registration number was clearly referred to in the statement of one of the eyewitnesses, it is to be regretted that no steps were taken by the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y public prosecutor to trace the car. It was not until the letter of the Ministry of Justice that the authorities took steps to trace the car. Even then, the response of the domestic authorities must be considered very vague. In a letter dated 15\u00a0November 1996, the Istanbul Security Department stated that the vehicle with registration number 34 CK 420 was a metallic grey 1984  that had belonged to Mr\u00a0J.H. since 16 August 1995.

The effect of Article\u00a013 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see the following judgments: Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18\u00a0December 1996, Reports 1996VI, p. 2286, \u00a7 95, Ayd\u0131n v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports 1997VI, pp. 1895-96, \u00a7 103, and Kaya v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998I, pp.\u00a0329-30, \u00a7\u00a0106).",

The Court finds therefore that the applicant has been denied an effective remedy in respect of the death of his brother and thereby access to any other available remedies at his disposal, including a claim for compensation.",
