The Court observes that the only evidence relied upon by the Krefeld District Court when giving its decision of 4 August 2008 were the personal statements made by the two children before the Youth Office and before the District Court. There was no objective evidence for the alleged abuse. The Court further observes that, while the District Court had the benefit of direct contact with the children, the Court of Appeal based its assessment exclusively on the content of the case-file, without re-hearing the children in person. The applicants, for their part, relied on the statement of the children\u2019s attending physicians and of a psychologist, who had examined the boy on several occasions and did not detect any sign of abuse. They further pointed out that the children had regularly attended school and sports activities. Furthermore, it was not contested before the domestic courts that the girl had a vivid imagination. The Court considers that these facts were capable of casting doubts as to the truthfulness of the children\u2019s allegations.",
