The case originated in an application (no. 24559/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Emma Vladimirovna Talysheva (“the applicant”), on 26 May 2004.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms V. Milinchuk, former Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 10 July 2007 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant and the Government each submitted observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicant, Mrs Emma Vladimirovna Talysheva, is a Russian national who was born in 1934 and lives in .
The applicant sued her relative, Mr T., claiming sole ownership of a house. By a judgment of 1 March 2001 the Pervomayskiy District Court of Krasnodar granted her claims. No appeal was lodged.
Subsequently, the applicant sued Mr T. and the Krasnodar Town Council, seeking annulment of their title to the ramshackle buildings adjacent to the house.
On 18 June 2003 the Justice of the Peace in the 64th Circuit of the Tsentralniy District of Krasnodar granted her claims. No appeal was lodged.
In 2004 Mr T. applied for supervisory review of the judgments of 1 March 2001 and 18 June 2003.
On 12 February 2004 the Presidium of the  quashed the judgment of 18 June 2003 because the Justice of the Peace had misapplied the domestic law. Having re-examined the case, the Presidium issued a new judgment, rejecting the applicant's claims.
On the same date in the other case the Presidium also set aside the judgment of 1 March 2001 on account of procedural defects. In the Presidium's view, the first-instance court had misinterpreted the applicant's claim, had not supplied a legal basis for its findings, and had erroneously found that the defendant had admitted the claims. The Presidium re-examined the case and issued a new judgment rejecting the applicant's claims.
Both of the Presidium's judgments indicated that the parties had been notified of the hearing and had appeared before it.
On 21 July 2001 Mr T. applied for a court injunction to prevent the applicant from using a plot of land. By a default judgment of 30 October 2001, the Justice of the Peace in the 61st Circuit of the Tsentralniy District of Krasnodar granted the injunction. Upon the applicant's request, the Justice of the Peace revoked that judgment on 3 September 2002. On 21 November 2002 the Pervomayskiy District Court, sitting on appeal, decided that the default judgment should remain in force.
On 10 April 2003 the Presidium of the  quashed the judgment of 21 November 2002 and remitted the case to the Justice of the Peace.
On 14 December 2004 the District Court discontinued the proceedings because the parties had repeatedly failed to attend hearings.
The proceedings were resumed on an unspecified date. On 11 April 2006 the District Court endorsed a friendly settlement which had been reached by the parties.
On 27 February 2001 the  took a final decision rejecting the applicant's claims in an inheritance dispute.
The applicant was also an unsuccessful party to another land dispute. The final decision on that matter was taken by the  on 22 April 2003.
The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure at the material time is summed up in the Court's judgment in the case of Sobelin and Others v. Russia (no. 30672/03 et seq., §§ 33-42, 3 May 2007).
