His drug regimen has been adjusted to take account of his health complaints and the results of regular and extensive clinical, radiological and immunological monitoring. The hospital personnel examine the applicant at least once every three days. Specialists from the AIDS Centre have been invited to assess the applicant in order to determine possible amendments to the antiretroviral therapy. The recommendations of those specialists have been complied with. On 28 March 2012 a forensic medical panel determined that the applicant was category 2 disabled. As is clear from the most recent records dating from April 2012, while certain negative changes in the applicant\u2019s condition have been registered on a number of occasions during his stay in the hospital, they were dealt with and have been overcome.

It does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that the authorities had invited the applicant to consider the possibility of therapy in April 2007 (see paragraph 8 above) but only initiated the ART a year later (see paragraph 12 above). However, the Court interprets the steps taken by the Russian authorities in April 2007 not as a formal decision to start therapy but rather as a measure aimed at assessing the applicant\u2019s readiness to commence such therapy and psychologically preparing him for the inevitable necessity to commit to a lifelong highly aggressive and toxic regimen. The Court once again stresses that the Russian authorities commenced the antiretroviral therapy in compliance with the guidelines of the World Health Organization in force at the relevant time and with domestic legal requirements. As soon as the immunological results showed a drop of the CD4 cell count below 290 cells/mm3 in March 2008, the applicant began receiving treatment (see paragraph 12 above).",

In particular, the Court notes that the applicant was seen without delay by an attending prison doctor, who studied his medical history, recorded complaints, organised meetings with infectious disease specialists and solicited opinions from civilian doctors, in particular, from those at the AIDS Centre. The recommendations of those specialists amending the drug regimen were promptly put into practice. The doctors also examined the feasibility of the concurrent treatment of both the HIV and hepatitis infections, but, having studied the pill burden, drug toxicities and interactions, decided to delay the hepatitis virus therapy. That decision, prompted by the necessity of waiting until after the applicant\u2019s immune recovery in order to obtain a better therapy response, cannot be considered unreasonable.",

Each time the applicant was released from the hospital under the clinical supervision of the medical personnel of the correctional colony, who fully complied with the recommendations of the hospital doctors.

The decision concerning such an application lies with the courts, which have to assess a number of factors while determining the inmate\u2019s eligibility for release. In the applicant\u2019s case, the courts had taken into account the gravity of the crime of which he had been found guilty, the length of his term of imprisonment and the period which had already been served by the applicant, his behaviour during his serving the sentence, the severity of his illnesses, the conditions of his detention and whether or not the applicant had received proper medical attention. Having considered that the applicant\u2019s condition was stable, that he had received adequate medical care in detention, including the fact that the applicant would most probably not benefit from that level of medical care and would not adhere to the antiretroviral therapy if released, the Russian courts had rightfully refused to release him.",

Taking into account its findings pertaining to the quality of the medial assistance afforded to the applicant in detention (see paragraph 54 above) and keeping in mind that the applicant\u2019s condition has been considered stable, with the Russian authorities effectively addressing any negative changes (see paragraph 27 above), the Court does not see any reasons to depart from that principle.",

They also assessed the state of the applicant\u2019s health, the quality of medical services he was receiving in detention and the prospect of his receiving the necessary medical care if released. Having balanced all those considerations of progress, rehabilitation, remorse, and so on, the Russian courts concluded that the applicant\u2019s release was unwarranted (see paragraph 31 above). The Court sees no reason to conclude otherwise.",

However, on the basis of the evidence before it and assessing the relevant facts as a whole, the Court does not find it established that the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment that attained a sufficient level of severity to come within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention (see, for similar reasoning, Stoyan Mitev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a060922/00, \u00a7 73, 7 January 2010).
