As she had been fully successful in the case, she normally should have been compensated in respect of the costs of all justified acts of legal assistance received. A reduction of the award could only have been based on exceptional circumstances within the meaning of Article 150 of the Code of Civil Procedure. However, in determining the issue of legal costs, the Regional Court had made no use of that provision and, in any event, no such circumstances pertained, in particular because the case concerned unjustified delays in proceedings before a public authority lasting more than seven years; her efforts to ensure an out-of-court solution had been futile and had left her with no alternative to asserting her rights in the Regional Court; legal representation before that court was mandatory, the applicant was disabled, and she was living on the allowance specified above.",

It observed that, as such, the complaint concerned a decision on costs rather than on the merits of the applicant\u2019s action. It referred to its established case-law to the effect that decisions on costs could violate fundamental rights and freedoms only exceptionally, in particular if there were an extremely serious interference with such rights and freedoms. It was true that the decision contested in the applicants\u2019 case was \u201cchallengeable under the criteria of lawfulness\u201d. However, it was necessary to take into account that the value of the remaining two acts of legal assistance was only some EUR 270. This was less than three times the statutory minimum wage, the limit that was otherwise applicable to admissibility of appeals on points of law. If the amount at stake was this negligible, the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court could only be engaged in very exceptional circumstances and no such circumstances had been established in the applicant\u2019s case.

However, in its decision, it took no note at all of the claim in relation to the remaining two acts of legal assistance. Accordingly, the decision contains no analysis and no conclusion in relation to that part of the applicant\u2019s claim. In that regard, the Court notes the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding that the contested part of the Regional Court\u2019s decision was \u201cchallengeable under the criteria of lawfulness\u201d (see paragraph 12 above). In these circumstances, the Court considers that rather than having been decided upon summarily or by implication, as the Government may have wished to suggest, the claim in respect of the remaining two acts of legal assistance was simply overlooked by the Regional Court and has thus remained undetermined. In that regard, the Court reiterates that the right of access to court must be \u201cpractical and effective\u201d, not theoretical or illusory, and that it includes not only the right to institute proceedings but also the right to obtain a determination of the dispute by a court (see, for example, Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others v. Romania [GC], no. 76943/11, \u00a7 86, 29 November 2016, with further references).",
