The Court reiterates in this connection that treatment can be qualified as degrading when it arouses in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 167). Psychological suffering may result from a situation in which State agents deliberately instil fear in individuals by threatening to kill or ill-treat them: put differently, to threaten them with acts prohibited by Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention.",

More recently, the Court observed with concern when considering the applicant\u2019s Article 3 complaint in the Miroslaw\u00a0Garlicki\u00a0v.\u00a0Poland judgment that the authorities had, among other things, used a dozen masked and armed officers to arrest the applicant although it appeared that he did not present any particular security risk (application no. 36921/07, \u00a7 75, 14 June 2011).",

The Court notes in this connection that, with the exception of a reference to \u201cthreats\u201d, the domestic criminal law is silent on the issue of psychological suffering resulting from, for example, an aggressively conducted search, seizure and arrest operation. A complainant must allege that he or she sustained physical injury at the hands of State agents, failing which the authorities cannot be required to open an investigation into the background circumstances. The Government have not disputed this. For the Court, this lacuna in the criminal law is a matter of great regret, allowing as it does\u00a0those allegedly responsible for the infliction of psychological trauma, including with respect to an infant as claimed in the instant case, to escape accountability for their actions. The fact that the alleged behaviour of the State agents in the instant case could not be scrutinised must be considered to be at complete variance with the notion of an independent and effective investigation as required by Article 3, giving rise as it does to an unacceptable impunity for wrongdoers.",
