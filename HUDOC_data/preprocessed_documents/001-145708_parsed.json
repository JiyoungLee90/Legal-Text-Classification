They were all being pursued by the Chinese police because of their political views; the third applicant had already served a two-year sentence back in 1994 for declaring political views unfavourable to the Chinese Government. While they had been culturally assimilated, discriminated against and treated as secondclass citizens since the occupation of East Turkestan by China in 1949, the pressure exerted on Uighur opponents had increased since September\u00a011, 2001 under the guise of the global war against terrorism. They were all branded as separatists and terrorists on account of their peaceful efforts to maintain their cultural and religious identities, and if returned to China would risk being imprisoned, tortured or even executed, suffering the fate of other failed asylum seekers. The East Turkestan Foundation, based in Istanbul, confirmed the applicants\u2019 allegations and stated that their connection to the association would increase the risk to their lives or physical integrity if returned to China. They indicated that a number of Uighurs expelled from Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Nepal in recent years had been executed at the border by the Chinese authorities. The applicants added that their requests for refugee status were still under consideration before the UNHCR, and that they had been issued with asylum seeker certificates by that organisation.",

Firstly, he requested the revocation of the deportation order on 29 April 2009 on account of the threat of persecution, torture and even death he would be subjected to if returned to China, as well as that its execution be stayed pending the conclusion of the domestic proceedings. Secondly, he complained that the attempt to deport him in October 2008 had been unlawful, as there had been ongoing asylum and refugee proceedings before the domestic authorities and the UNHCR. Thirdly, he alleged that the asylum procedure had not been conducted lawfully by the national authorities; even though the asylum request had been lodged on his behalf by his legal representative, the asylum interview had been conducted in the absence of his lawyer and very perfunctorily. The interpretation provided during the interview had also been inadequate. Furthermore, the two-day period granted for objecting to the refusal of the asylum request had clearly not been long enough to allow him to formulate a meaningful objection. In addition, the refusal of his asylum request on the sole ground that he did not have ties to any illegal organisations contradicted the earlier intelligence reports linking him to the ETIM. It also demonstrated that the administration\u2019s examination of his case did not go beyond looking into his ties to a terrorist organisation, even though they had been expected to carry out more rigorous scrutiny of the merits of his claims. Fourthly, the applicant maintained that he had been detained unlawfully at the Kumkap\u0131 Foreigners\u2019 Admission and Accommodation Centre for over nine months. Lastly, he claimed that his repeated requests to obtain copies of the relevant administrative decisions concerning his asylum application had been left unanswered, which had restricted his access to legal remedies to contest those decisions. In this connection, he challenged the lawfulness of Circular no.\u00a057, which had prejudiced his defence rights by, inter alia, limiting his and his lawyer\u2019s access to his asylum file.",

While the applicants never admitted to any affiliation with the ETIM, it is clear that they were of interest to the Chinese authorities as suspected terrorists, which, according to the aforementioned international sources, was sufficient to put them at a real risk of treatment contrary to Articles\u00a02 and/or 3 of the Convention if returned to China (see paragraphs\u00a067-70 above).

In any event, removal to a third country would not allay the applicants\u2019 fears per se, or remove the respondent State\u2019s obligations under Articles 2 and 3, as long as the risk of repatriation to their country of origin existed (Auad v.

Furthermore, the facts constituting the alleged violation of Article 13 had already materialised by the time the risk of the applicants\u2019 deportation had ceased to exist. It appears that the applicants\u2019 deportation was only stopped on account of the Iranian authorities\u2019 refusal to accept them and the subsequent application by the Court of the Rule 39 measure, and not as a consequence of a domestic remedy, at least not initially. The Court notes in this connection that the domestic court decisions ordering the suspension or revocation of the applicants\u2019 deportation were issued considerably later than the Court\u2019s interim measure. The Government have also acknowledged that the applicants were only allowed to stay in Turkey because of the interim measure applied by the Court (see paragraph 36 above).",

According to the Ministry, the fact that the applicants had not sought asylum prior to their arrest was sufficient evidence to conclude that their fears about returning to China were not sincere and that the asylum request had only been lodged to prolong their stay in Turkey. For that reason, the Ministry ordered the applicants\u2019 immediate deportation, without addressing the personal and specific risks involved in returning them. Moreover, the deportation order was not served either on the applicants or their legal representative, which effectively denied them the opportunity to challenge it before the domestic courts. The authorities thus presented the applicants with a fait accompli; they did not even have the chance to contact their lawyers or families before being taken to the Iranian border.
