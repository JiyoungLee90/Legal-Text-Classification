It is not disputed that the applicant suffered from serious heart disease, had had heart attacks prior to his detention, and that his state of health deteriorated during the years he spent in custody. The Government did not deny that the authorities had been aware of his disease, which required periodic hospitalisation and medical interventions and, eventually, qualified him for heart surgery in a civilian hospital. The Court will thus examine whether the medical treatment received by the applicant in detention and particularly during the final months of his life was adequate (see Tarariyeva v. , no.\u00a04353/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a076-89, ECHR 2006...

Nevertheless, in November 1999 the applicant was transferred to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Detention Centre, which had no hospital wing. The applicant asserted that his transfer was a punishment for his complaint to the Helsinki Foundation. The Government did not comment on that matter and did not explain the reasons for the transfer. It appears from the case file and the parties\u2019 submissions that the applicant did not receive any medical treatment during the four months he remained in the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Detention Centre. There is no evidence that he saw a doctor during that time. Although the Court finds it unsubstantiated that the transfer was imposed on the applicant as punishment, it considers that, in consequence, the applicant\u2019s health deteriorated to the extent that on 21 March 2000 he lost consciousness and was transferred to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , where he had remained for ten months.

In total, the applicant remained in detention from 17\u00a0September 1997 until his death on 25 October 2001; that is, for over four years. The Court notes that the domestic authorities conducting criminal proceedings against the applicant continued to extend his detention, relying, repetitively, on the reasonable suspicion against him and on the complexity of the investigation, which justified his continued detention.

The prosecutor failed to establish whether the applicant was taken to the court room that morning, what exactly happened in the court building, why the ambulance brought him back to the detention centre and finally what happened before the applicant was brought unconscious from his cell at 3.45 p.m. The prosecutor failed to refer to the witness statements and to assess their accuracy, or to hear other witnesses such as prison guards, the applicant\u2019s cell mates or the ambulance team. The Court reiterates that the failure to establish the events of the last hours before the applicant lost consciousness on 22 October 2001 was crucial for an adequate assessment of whether the applicant received proper medical care on that day and whether the authorities had contributed to his death on 25\u00a0October 2001.",

However, the prosecutor gave no consideration to the doubts raised by the experts as to the circumstances in which the applicant\u2019s surgery was postponed on three occasions, the elucidation of which they judged to be outside their competence. That issue was mentioned in the District Court\u2019s decision; however, the latter unconditionally accepted the detention centre\u2019s explanation, without giving it any critical assessment. Finally, the Court cannot but note that the investigation lasted over two years, until the prosecutor decided to discontinue it, and that during that time the case lay dormant for over nine months as the prosecutor was waiting for an expert opinion to be prepared. In the context of the case, which required promptness, this period should be considered substantial, in particular since there is no appearance that the prosecutor took any action to discipline the experts.",

The description of those facts contained in paragraphs 9 to 48 of the judgment \u2013 that had to be based upon the investigation file \u2013 is fairly comprehensive. The investigating authorities acted with sufficient diligence: all those who could contribute to the establishment of facts had been heard by the prosecutor and expert opinions had been ordered and examined. It is true that other witnesses could also have been summoned (see paragraph 107 in fine), but we are not convinced that their testimony could have adduced relevant information. Prison guards and cell mates could confirm that the applicant had been very sick, but this was also established by other witnesses as well as by experts.",

But it cannot be interpreted in such a way that an investigation is only effective when it results in a criminal charge against individual State agents. Criminal responsibility on the part of individual State agents may of course rightly be ruled out on the basis of principles differing from those applying to the international-law responsibility of the Convention States. This is particularly true in the circumstances of this case where State responsibility is not engaged on the basis of the actions of identifiable individual State agents but rather by reference to the lack of quality and promptness of the medical care provided, the lack of cooperation and coordination between the various State authorities and other factors engaging different authorities and many individuals contributing to the breach (see paragraph 101 for further details). Although such reasons are sufficient to engage State responsibility under the Convention they may not be sufficient to charge and convict any individual person. We have the impression that in this case the majority have forgotten about this difference.",
