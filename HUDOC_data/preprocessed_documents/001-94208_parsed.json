The Court notes that in the Loizidou judgment ((merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 46) it held that it could not attribute legal validity for the purposes of the Convention to the provisions of Article 159 of the \u201cTRNC\u201d fundamental law concerning the acquisition by the \u201cTRNC\u201d of the immovable properties considered to have been abandoned on 13 February 1975. It furthermore considered that Greek-Cypriots who, like Mrs Loizidou, had left their properties in the northern part of the island in 1974 could not be deemed to have lost title to their property. It follows that the first applicant had property rights since 1974. He was therefore capable of transmitting these rights to his children (X and the third and fourth applicants), which he did on 12 January 1996 (see paragraph 11 above). The fifth applicant and her children (the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth applicants) inherited part of these properties from X on his death in November 1996 (see paragraph 11 above).

The other immovable property referred to in the application was possessed by refugees; it could not form the object of restitution but could give entitlement to financial compensation, to be calculated on the basis of the loss of income (by applying a 5% rent on the 1974 market values) and increase in value of the property between 1974 and the date of payment. Had the applicants applied to the Immovable Property Commission, the latter would have offered CYP\u00a0191,757.61 (approximately EUR 327,637) to compensate for the loss of use from January 1996 onwards and CYP 310,872.77 (approximately EUR\u00a0531,157) for the value of the properties. According to an expert appointed by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities, the 1974 open-market value of the applicants' house described in paragraph 11 above was CYP 4,661.02 (approximately EUR 7,963). Upon fulfilment of certain conditions, the Immovable Property Commission could also have offered the applicants an exchange of their properties with Turkish-Cypriot properties located in the south of the island.",
