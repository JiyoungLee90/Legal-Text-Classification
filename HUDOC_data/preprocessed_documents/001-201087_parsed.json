It observes that the introduction of restrictive legislation with regard to religious communities and a certain number of the restrictive practices described above seem to be the authorities\u2019 way of responding to the fear that forms of politically motivated religious extremism may emerge in Azerbaijan. The ECRI underlines that, even if they are legitimate, fears of this kind must not cause the authorities to lose their objectivity vis-\u00e0-vis religious minorities or to introduce practices imposing unreasonable requirements on them. The ECRI refers to its concerns, as set out above, regarding the conformity of the legislation in force with the European Convention on Human Rights. In the same context, it also refers to its above considerations warning against the use with regard to persons belonging to minorities of provisions intended to safeguard national security or to prohibit incitement of hatred in such a way as to stifle the legitimate, peaceful expression of minority identities. It again underlines that such practices involve a danger of generating or heightening feelings of mistrust within the minorities being targeted and may thus prove counter-productive. It also points out that opening up to diversity and dialogue among the different groups in society helps both to combat racism and to reinforce national security.\u201d",

Freedom of expression entails the right to impart and receive information and ideas without interference by public authorities and regardless of frontiers. The requirement of prior consent for the production and dissemination of religious literature is arguably unnecessary in a democratic society and may violate both freedom of expression and freedom of religion norms. The UN Human Rights Committee has stated that \u2018the freedom to manifest religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching encompasses a broad range of acts [...]; the practice and teaching of a religion or belief includes [...] the freedom to prepare and distribute religious texts or publication\u2019. The UN General Assembly has similarly called upon States to ensure \u2018the right to all persons to write, issue, and disseminate relevant publications in these areas [of religion or belief]. The OSCE Vienna Concluding Document (1989) likewise provides that OSCE participating States shall \u2018respect the right of individual believers and communities of believers to acquire, possess, and use sacred books, religious publications [...] and other articles and materials related to the practice of religion or belief\u2019 and \u2018allow religious faiths, institutions and organizations to produce, import and disseminate religious publications and materials\u2019.

In this context, they referred to Leyla \u015eahin v. Turkey ([GC], no. 44774/98, \u00a7 106, ECHR 2005 XI). Given that the books in question implied religious superiority and incited religious discord and could therefore damage the peaceful coexistence of several religious communities in a multireligious society, the ban on their import had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others, namely Christian and Jewish communities in Azerbaijan, as the books contained disparaging expressions directed against those communities. Moreover, the interference had been based on provisions of domestic law which were accessible to the applicant community and which had been formulated with sufficient precision to enable the community to foresee the consequences which a given action might entail. Furthermore, the lawfulness of the ban had been endorsed by the domestic courts, which had carefully examined submissions made by the Committee and the applicant community and had concluded that the books in question promoted religious segregation and discrimination.",

The Court reiterates in this regard that a certain margin of appreciation is generally available to the Contracting States when regulating freedom of expression in relation to matters liable to offend intimate personal convictions within the sphere of religion or to incite religious hatred or intolerance. The authorities\u2019 margin of appreciation, however, is not unlimited. It goes hand in hand with Convention supervision (see Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria, 20 September 1994, \u00a7\u00a050, Series A no.\u00a0295A). It is for the European Court to give a final ruling on the restriction\u2019s compatibility with the Convention and it will do so by assessing in the circumstances of a particular case, inter alia, whether the interference corresponded to a \u201cpressing social need\u201d and whether it was \u201cproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued\u201d. Indeed, such supervision can be considered to be all the more necessary given the rather open-ended notion of respect for the religious beliefs of others and the risks of excessive interference with freedom of expression under the guise of action taken against allegedly offensive material (see Murphy v. Ireland, no. 44179/98, \u00a7\u00a068, ECHR 2003\u2011IX (extracts). Cases which involve prior restraint call for special scrutiny by the Court (see Wingrove v. the United Kingdom, 25\u00a0November 1996, \u00a7 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011V, and Ibragim Ibragimov, cited above, \u00a7 96). The Court will therefore examine whether such a serious measure as banning a book was compatible with freedom of expression (see\u00a0Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2004IV) and whether the domestic courts gave relevant and sufficient reasons for their decisions.",

In particular, it failed to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the impugned remarks by examining them within the general context of the books. On the contrary, it assessed the statements in question when they were detached from their immediate textual context, and failed to examine which ideas they sought to impart. Moreover, the first-instance court did not take into account the fact that they were part of a religious text (see Ibragim\u00a0Ibragimov, cited above, \u00a7 116). The Court, therefore, cannot accept the reasons provided by the first-instance court as relevant and sufficient for the purpose of justifying the interference in question.",

Azerbaijan, no. 30500/11, \u00a7 97, 1 June 2017; Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC], no. 72508/13, \u00a7 372, 28\u00a0November 2017; and Jafarov and Others v.
