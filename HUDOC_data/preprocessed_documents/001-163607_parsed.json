The second set of proceedings was instituted on 29 January 2002 and concluded on 27 January 2005, in other words after the judgment in the first set of proceedings had become final. It is remarkable that the trial court did not find the second proceedings problematic in terms of the principle ne\u00a0bis\u00a0in\u00a0idem, dismissing the applicant\u2019s argument in this respect on the ground that the first case dealt with a different type of legal responsibility. This reply was commensurate with the applicable procedural rules of domestic law providing no ground for discontinuing criminal proceedings if there had been a previous conviction for an essentially similar administrative offence (see paragraph 19 above).
