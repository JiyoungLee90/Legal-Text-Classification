Furthermore, despite the use of force against the applicant by the police, no medical examination was conducted immediately upon his arrival at the police station. It is also observed that no plausible alternative version as to the origin of the applicant's injuries was advanced by the domestic authorities at any stage. Therefore, it could be assumed that the injuries sustained by the applicant were caused by the police. The applicant claimed that he had been beaten both during the arrest and later at the police station. The Government did not comment on these allegations, although the domestic authorities denied any ill-treatment of the applicant after his arrest. Even assuming that all of the applicant's injuries were caused during his arrest, the Court notes that the domestic authorities failed to establish the exact circumstances in which the applicant had received what was described in medical records as \u201cnumerous bruises resulting from application of force 45 to 50 times, a broken rib, chest trauma, pneumothorax and brain concussion\u201d (see paragraph 11) while in the hands of the police.",
