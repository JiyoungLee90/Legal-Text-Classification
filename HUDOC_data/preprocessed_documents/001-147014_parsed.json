Their article was also based on the information received from A.N. (the Deputy Minister of Health), B.O., W.D. and the statement received from the Minister of Health. The assertions of the representatives of the pharmaceutical company were confronted with the statements of W.D. The journalists further presented W.D.\u2019s professional and political career. In the article they pointed to specific contradictions and ambiguities in W.D.\u2019s account of his meetings with the representatives of the pharmaceutical company. The\u00a0article presented the claimant who was a high-ranking official in a\u00a0negative light, but the readers were offered two versions of the relevant events and could make their own assessment of it. It was undisputed that W.D. had met twice in restaurants with H.M.N. and \u0141.Z., the representatives of the American pharmaceutical company M.S.D. Inc. and introduced himself as the Head of the Private Office of the Minister of Health.",

The parties discussed the organisational and financial details of the joint project as well as the issue of the pharmaceutical company\u2019s difficulties in securing the placement of its drug on the list.

These factors, in turn, require consideration of other elements such as the authority of the source (Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above), whether the newspaper had conducted a reasonable amount of research before publication (Prager\u00a0and\u00a0Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 313), whether the newspaper presented the story in a reasonably balanced manner (Bergens Tidende and Others v. Norway, no. 26132/95, \u00a7 57, ECHR\u00a02000IV) and whether the newspaper gave the persons defamed the opportunity to defend themselves (Bergens Tidende and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058). Hence, the nature of such an exemption from the ordinary requirement of verification of defamatory statements of fact is such that, in order to apply it in a manner consistent with the case-law of this Court, the domestic courts have to take into account the particular circumstances of the case under consideration. If the national courts apply an overly rigorous approach to the assessment of journalists\u2019 professional conduct, the latter could be unduly deterred from discharging their function of keeping the public informed. The courts must therefore take into account the likely impact of their rulings not only on the individual cases before them but also on the media in general (see Kasabova, cited above, \u00a7 55 and Yordanova\u00a0and Toshev v.

Secondly, they contacted the Minister of Health and spoke to two other major protagonists of the story, namely B.O. and W.D. The\u00a0journalists\u2019 impression of the credibility of the story was reinforced by inconsistent accounts given by W.D. (see paragraph 11 above).

It\u00a0should also be noted that the content and the tone of the article was on the whole fairly balanced.

In the instant case, the domestic courts did not take into account the status of W.D. and the wider limits of permissible criticism applicable to politicians or public officials. Similarly, they omitted to consider the fact that the allegations of corruption had emanated from the pharmaceutical company and had been reported as such by the applicants. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court appear to have been unconcerned by the fact that one of the top officials in the Ministry of Health took part in the negotiations between two private companies on their joint business venture in which the public authorities had no involvement.
