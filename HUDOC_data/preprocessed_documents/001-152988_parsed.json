In earlier Russian cases on the right to free legal assistance during appeal proceedings in a criminal case, the Court has held that given the wide powers of Russian appellate courts, the seriousness of the charges against the applicants and the severity of the sentence which they faced, the interests of justice demanded that the applicants should have had legal representation at the appeal hearing (see Shekhov v. Russia, no. 12440/04, \u00a7 44, 19 June 2014, with references cited therein). The Court has also held that the applicant\u2019s representation on appeal was mandatory under domestic law when the applicant did not waive, explicitly or implicitly and in accordance with Article 51 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, his right to be assisted by counsel on appeal (see Eduard Rozhkov v. Russia, no. 11469/05, \u00a7\u00a7 23-24, 31 October 2013).",

It could examine evidence and additional materials submitted by the parties directly. It was empowered to dismiss an appeal and uphold a trial court\u2019s judgment, quash a judgment and terminate criminal proceedings, quash a judgment and remit a case for a fresh trial, or amend a judgment (see Kononov, cited above, \u00a7 35). The Court further notes that the charges against the applicant in the present case carried a maximum punishment of two years\u2019 imprisonment whereas the actual punishment imposed on him was a suspended sentence of one year and three months\u2019 imprisonment with one year\u2019s probation (see, respectively, paragraphs 16 and 9 above). However, it also considers that given the broad review powers of the appellate court, there remained a possibility that the applicant could have substantially benefited from his lawyer\u2019s specialist expertise and assistance. Moreover, under Russian law as interpreted by the Constitutional Court of Russia and the Supreme Court of Russia, the right to legal representation extends to appeal proceedings if, inter alia, the defendant has not waived in writing his right to legal aid counsel; and it is incumbent on the authorities to appoint him one (see paragraphs 22-25 above; Orlov v. Russia, no. 29652/04, \u00a7 52, 21 June 2011, and Eduard Rozhkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 23-24). In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that, unless the applicant waived his right to legal assistance, the interests of justice demanded that he should have a lawyer to represent him in the appeal hearing of his case, irrespective of the gravity of the charges against him and the length of his sentence.",

A waiver of legal assistance in Russia must be filed in writing and recorded in the official record of the relevant procedural act (see paragraph 23 above). The Court observes that the case materials do not contain any such document written by the applicant and record thereof. Therefore, the Court concludes that the applicant did not unequivocally waive his right to a lawyer for the appeal hearing (see, a contrario, Aleksandr Dementyev, cited above, \u00a7 50). The Court also notes that the applicant did not request in his appeal to have a legal aid lawyer appointed (see paragraph 10 above). It also remains unclear whether or not the applicant asked for the appeal hearing to be adjourned or for replacement counsel to be appointed by the appellate court. However, as the Court has previously held, it does not need to establish whether the applicant made such requests because the applicant\u2019s conduct could not of itself relieve the authorities of their obligation to provide him with an effective defence (see Shekhov, cited above, \u00a7 42).",
