That it had taken over nine years to complete the task could be explained both by the acknowledged complexity of the issue and by Parliament\u2019s foresight. Rather than partial, fragmentary alterations, Parliament had preferred an overall and systematic revision, extending inter alia to the delicate question of the status of children born in adultery. It had also pondered long over the temporal extent to be given to the new provisions; in the end concern for the legal certainty to be preserved in the interests of families, third parties and the State, together with the fear that a large number of lawsuits would follow, had induced it not to give the Law of 31 March 1987 any retrospective effect (see paragraph 15 above).",
