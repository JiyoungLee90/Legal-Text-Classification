Furthermore, apart from challenging the impartiality of one of the District Court judges after the expiry of the time-limit for appealing, it has not been shown that the applicant's conduct contributed to the length. While the proceedings before the different court instances, including the extraordinary proceedings, may not appear excessive when taken separately, the Court considers that the overall length of the proceedings of almost six years and nine months failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement (see, inter alia, Kocsis v. , no.\u00a02462/03, 11 April 2006).

The Government argued that the applicant's conduct had contributed to the length, since, for example, he had requested the replacement of the presiding judge. The Court observes that the proceedings were first stayed between 20 September 1993 and 15 December 1994 because the District Court had to await the outcome of the Court of Appeal's decision concerning the correct forum. That accounted for a delay of almost fifteen months. Moreover, the proceedings were interrupted between 15 March 1995 and 27 January 2000, i.e. for a period of over four years and ten months. Although it was the applicant who had requested that the counter-claim proceedings should not be examined until the final judgment in the original proceeding had been given, the Court has found above (see paragraph 43) that the latter proceedings were excessive in length. Furthermore, on 9 June 2000, the District Court upheld the applicant's request that the presiding judge should be replaced in the counter-claim proceedings. After that there was a period of inactivity of almost seventeen months before the District Court, presided over by a new judge, held a new preparatory hearing on 5 December 2001.",
