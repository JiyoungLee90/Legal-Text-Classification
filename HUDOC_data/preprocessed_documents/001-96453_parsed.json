Moreover, the offence of rape carried a maximum sentence of 10 years which, together with the serious circumstances of the incident as related by I.K., gave sufficient grounds to believe that the applicant, given the severity of the penalty, might be prompted to bring pressure to bear on her in order to make her refuse to testify, or change her testimony.",

In the circumstances of the case and given the nature of the charges against the applicant, it was not unreasonable on the part of the authorities to keep him in custody for the time necessary to secure the unhindered process of taking evidence from witnesses. It is true that with the passage of\u00a0time the victim\u2019s \u2013 and the main witness\u2019s \u2013 attitude towards the applicant changed considerably. She decided to marry him and asked the authorities to release him. Also, the applicant on many occasions expressed his regret for what he had done to her (see paragraphs 15-17 above). These were certainly important factors to be taken into account in assessing the degree of his culpability. They could, and did, have mitigating effects on the sentence imposed on the applicant (see paragraph 32 above). So they certainly required due consideration in the examination of the parties\u2019 requests for leave to marry in the Krak\u00f3w Remand Centre (see paragraphs 34-41).

This, the court considered, was an obstacle justifying the imposition of a ban on\u00a0his right to marry during the trial, a ban which in reality had no legal basis since under Polish law the relation \u201caccused-victim\u201d in criminal proceedings is not a legal or factual impediment to contracting a marriage (see paragraph 48 above).",

In the Court\u2019s view, however, Article 12 does not require the State to introduce separate laws or specific rules on marriage for prisoners; thus, as stated above, detention is not a legal obstacle to marriage (see paragraphs 91-93 above).

The discretion available in theory may be very wide, but the decisive element is how it\u00a0is\u00a0applied by the authorities in practice. In the applicant\u2019s case the Convention breach was caused by the lack of restraint displayed by\u00a0the\u00a0national judge in\u00a0exercising her discretion and by her failure to strike a fair balance of proportionality between the various public and individual interests at stake in\u00a0a\u00a0manner compatible with the Convention, rather than by the absence of detailed rules on marriage in detention.
