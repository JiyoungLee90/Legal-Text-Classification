On the other hand he would not be here if he had not come on a cocaine smuggling expedition in 1993; and if he had not been imprisoned he would have gone back to St Kitts, if he had ever come here at all, long before his AIDS was diagnosed. Taking account of the fact that the Court must give most anxious scrutiny to a decision which involves questions particularly of life expectancy, as this one apparently does, nevertheless I cannot find that an argument in this case that the decision of the Chief Immigration Officer was irrational is one that has any hope of success at all. Putting it the opposite way, it seems to me to be one which was well within the bounds of his discretion, and thus is not one with which the Court can properly interfere.\"",

This guide describes the three medical strategies available for treating HIV infection and AIDS: using anti-HIV drugs which attack HIV itself to delay or prevent damage to the immune system, treating or preventing opportunistic infections which take advantage of damage to the immune system and strengthening and restoring the immune system. Amongst the first category, several drugs can be used, including AZT (also known as Zidovudine or its tradename Retrovir). This belongs to a family of drugs called nucleoside analogues which inhibit an enzyme produced by HIV called reverse transcriptase (RT). If RT is inhibited, HIV cannot infect new cells and the build-up of virus in the body is slowed down. However, the existing drugs are only partially effective and at best can only delay the worsening of HIV-related disease rather than prevent it.",

As regards the second category, persons whose immune systems have been significantly damaged are vulnerable to a range of infections and tumours known as opportunistic infections. These commonly include cytomegalovirus (herpes virus), Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, anaemia, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis and PCP. PCP is a form of pneumonia which in people infected with HIV may affect the lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen and liver as well as the lungs. Steps to avoid such infections include taking care with food and drink and prophylactic treatment by drugs. In the case of PCP, which was a common cause of death during the first years of the epidemic and is still one of the commonest AIDS illnesses, options include the long-term taking of antibiotics such as cotrimoxazole and the use of nebulised pentamidine which is intended to protect the lungs.",

Admittedly, the domestic courts will review decisions with a greater rigour when they have an impact on human rights, but even in such cases they do not take a Conventionbased approach. Thus, in the case in issue, the Court of Appeal did not seek to satisfy itself whether the removal of the applicant would expose him to inhuman and degrading treatment but merely examined whether the decision-maker had taken this factor into account. This, he maintained, fell short of the test of \"independent scrutiny\" of a claim that there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3 (art. 3) which the Court in its Chahal judgment (loc. cit., p.\u00a01871, para. 151) had considered to be a crucial aspect of an effective remedy.

It did so against the background of the criteria which need to be satisfied before an administrative decision can be challenged on the grounds of its irrationality.

The applicant maintained that the effectiveness of the remedy invoked first before the High Court and subsequently before the Court of Appeal was undermined on account of their failure to conduct an independent scrutiny of the facts in order to determine whether they disclosed a real risk that he would be exposed to inhuman and degrading treatment. He relied on the reasoning in the Chahal judgment (loc. cit., p.\u00a01871, para. 151). However the Court notes that in that case the domestic courts were precluded from reviewing the factual basis underlying the national-security considerations invoked by the Home Secretary to justify the expulsion of Mr Chahal. No such considerations arise in the case in issue.",
