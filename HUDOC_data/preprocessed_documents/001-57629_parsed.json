The applicant ... maintained that Article 185 of the Vaud Code of Criminal Procedure (Vaud CCP) violates in the abstract, and in the alternative in the specific case, freedom of expression as secured in federal constitutional law and in Article 10 (art. 10) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). In so doing, he overlooked that it may be legitimate in the public interest to impose certain restrictions on the exercise of that fundamental right ... Article 10 \u00a7 2 (art. 10-2) in fine ECHR, moreover, provides expressly that such restrictions are permissible where they are necessary in a democratic society, in particular for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. The rule enacted in Article 185 Vaud CCP clearly conforms to these principles. A weighing of the competing interests at stake leads to the same conclusions. While it may indeed be readily appreciated that the applicant had grounds for rebelling against the sometimes unorthodox course taken by the proceedings against him, it must not be forgotten that the usual remedies were open to him; and, indeed, on a number of occasions he successfully availed himself of them. His interest in expressing his views on this matter in public and the public\u2019s interest in being informed by this means cannot outweigh the interest in ensuring that the judicial system can function as smoothly and impartially as possible. The prohibition against communicating information about an investigation until its completion and the penalties attaching to the offence are undoubtedly consistent with the proportionality principle. Consideration of whether the impugned interference was founded on sufficient reasons which rendered it necessary in a democratic society, having regard to all the public-interest aspects of the case (European Court of Human Rights, Sunday Times case, Series A no. 30, paragraphs 65-67) leads inevitably to the conclusion - particularly if the interests at stake in the Sunday Times case previously cited and in the applicant\u2019s case are compared - that there was no violation of freedom of expression.",

In that event the application of the Criminal Code would have justified an application of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) ECHR.

The appellant overlooks, however, that Article 49 \u00a7 3, second sub-paragraph, of the Swiss Criminal Code (SCC) enables the judge to rule out conversion where the person convicted has proved that, through no fault of his own, he is unable to pay the fine. In view of the foregoing, the possibility of a custodial sentence could not make the penalty imposed in the instant case a criminal one.",

The President of the Criminal Cassation Division, however, did not hold a hearing at all but gave his decision after a summary investigation entirely in written form, as provided for in Article 185 of the Vaud Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 20 above). The Criminal Cassation Division too dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal without hearing argument, as it was empowered to do by Article 431 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the same Code (see paragraph 17 above). The fact that the proceedings in the Federal Court were public did not suffice to cure the two defects just noted. Having before it a public-law appeal, the Federal Court could only satisfy itself that there had been no arbitrariness and not determine all the disputed questions of fact and law (see, mutatis mutandis, the Belilos judgment previously cited, Series A no. 132, pp. 31-32, \u00a7\u00a7 71-72). Furthermore, the Government did not claim that Mr Weber had waived his right to hearings; and the case did not come within any of the exceptions listed in the second sentence of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1).",

Admittedly R.M. appealed against his committal for trial, but even though his appeal meant that the order committing him for trial did not become final, the investigation nonetheless remained suspended (see paragraph 12 above).

As to the penalty incurred, it is not of such seriousness that it would entail the applicability of Article 6 (art. 6). This is no doubt a matter of opinion, but it appears to me that the Court has not had sufficient regard to the circumstances in which a fine may be converted into a term of imprisonment, namely where there is a deliberate intention not to pay it, and not merely where the person concerned finds himself unable to do so through no fault of his own. In the applicant\u2019s case, failure to pay would have been deliberate and the conversion into imprisonment actively desired. There is therefore no occasion to take into account, as the majority have done, the possibility of conversion in order to assess the seriousness of the penalty incurred. Furthermore, as is apparent from the case of Engel and Others, not all penalties consisting in deprivation of liberty are necessarily criminal ones within the meaning of Article 6 (art. 6) where they cannot be appreciably detrimental either by their nature or by their duration or by their manner of execution. Furthermore, the maximum amount of the fine (CHF 500) - and the fine imposed in the instant case amounted to CHF 300 - does not appear substantial in the Swiss context or likely to cause appreciable detriment. From this point of view too, therefore, I consider it unjustified to classify the offence as a criminal one within the meaning of the Convention.",
