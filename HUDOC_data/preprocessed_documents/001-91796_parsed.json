In the sobering-up centre, however, he refused to undress and became verbally abusive, which led the centre\u2019s staff to decide to put him in the special room with immobilising belts. At 4.55\u00a0a.m. Hubert Mojsiejew was put on the bed, on his stomach, and Z.K. tied his hands, legs and chest with the belts. During this, Mr Mojsiejew was calm and did not put up a struggle; he was mumbling incomprehensibly. After having been tied to the bed and examined by a doctor, Hubert Mojsiejew was left in his room. He was examined 20 minutes later but afterwards no employee from the shift that finished at 7 a.m., or from the following shift, came into the room in which Mr Mojsiejew had been immobilised and examined him. The employees occasionally observed him, looking mostly through a spy-hole in the door without entering the room, and were able to see his sides moving, from which they had concluded that he was still breathing.",

Thus, the court accepted the conclusions reached by the experts from the , who dismissed as highly improbable the hypothesis that the belts had been tied too tight and had obstructed the movement of his chest, since Mr Mojsiejew had not had any marks on his body indicating that pressure had been exerted by the chest belt. The court thus concluded that his death had been caused by strangulation (zad\u0142awienie) as pressure had been applied to Hubert Mojsiejew\u2019s neck. It had most probably happened when someone had put Mr Mojsiejew in a headlock. This immobilisation technique, if applied for a longer time, could lead directly to death, but if applied for a shorter period of time could cause brain damage, which affected breathing and after a certain time could also lead to death.",

In particular, the employees of the centre had been obliged to carry out constant supervision of the rooms in which intoxicated persons were detained. Under domestic law, patients immobilised by belts should be examined and checked every 15 minutes. If patients stayed calm and there were no other indications for the use of belts, they should be released; it should also be ensured that the patient did not need to use the toilet. However, Hubert Mojsiejew had not been examined every 15 minutes. He had been properly examined only once, about 20 minutes after he had been immobilised by the belts. Moreover, immobilisation by belts should not have been applied to him in the first place. The accused had thus deliberately failed in their obligation to protect Hubert Mojsiejew\u2019s life. Moreover, they had been completely unaware of the rules governing the manner in which care was to be provided to immobilised patients. In particular one of the accused, who was a doctor, had believed that a patient could be kept immobilised for 24 hours without being released.",

It has held that these remedies are effective in respect of the excessive length of pending judicial proceedings (see Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland (dec.), no.\u00a015212/03, 1 March 2005). However, in the present case it is not merely the excessive length of criminal proceedings which is in issue, but the question whether in the circumstances of the case seen as a whole, the State can be said to have complied with its procedural requirements under Article 2 of the Convention (see Byrzykowski v. Poland, no. 11562/05, \u00a7 90, 27 June 2006. The Court reiterates that the requirement of promptness is implicit in the procedural limb of Article 2 of the Convention and the authorities are required to conduct of their own motion a thorough and effective investigation into potential breaches of Article 2.",

Following the indictment, the trial court remained practically inactive during 2001 and 2002; thus, the trial started on 17 April 2003, over two years after the bill of indictment had been submitted to the court. After a single hearing on the latter date the trial court adjourned two subsequent hearings scheduled for 9 June 2003 and 24\u00a0February 2004. It remained inactive between these dates. The applicant was examined for the first time at the next hearing held on 10\u00a0May 2004, almost five years after the events of 28 August 1999. In spite of this extraordinary delay, and notwithstanding the particularly serious subject matter of the case, the court displayed only limited activity up until 10\u00a0December 2004, when it started holding hearings at regular intervals (see paragraphs 20\u201323 above).",

In the context of the case, which required promptness, this period should be considered substantial, in particular since there is no appearance that the court took any action to discipline the experts. The trial court failed to examine these experts, although they came to important conclusions regarding the cause of Hubert Mojsiejew\u2019s death, a shortcoming which was the major ground for the quashing of the judgment by the  on 13 November 2007. Lastly, the Court notes that the case has again been pending before the Tychy District Court since 13 November 2007 and no judgment has been delivered yet.

He was under the influence of alcohol. At about 9 a.m. on 28\u00a0August 1999 he was found dead in a room in which he had been immobilised by belts four hours before. The only injury established by experts was an internal injury to the soft tissues of his neck. The cause of Hubert Mojsiejew\u2019s death was asphyxiation. As regards the origin of Hubert Mojsiejew\u2019s internal injuries to his neck the Court notes that two groups of experts advanced different hypotheses. The first one, submitted by the \u015al\u0105ska Medical Academy, considered that the immobilising belt across Mr Mojsiejew\u2019s back could have been tied too tight, limiting his breathing and leading to his asphyxiation. The second medical opinion prepared by the  provided another explanation, noting that there had been no detection of any injury which could indicate that substantial pressure had been exerted on the area where the chest belt had been tied. They considered that Hubert Mojsiejew had been held in a headlock, probably while somebody had been tying him up with the belts, which could explain the injuries to his neck that had led to his death.",
