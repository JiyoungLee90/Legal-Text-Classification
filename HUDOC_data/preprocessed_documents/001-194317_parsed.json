Referring to the cases of Senchishak v.\u00a0Finland, no. 5049/12, 18 November 2014, Slivenko and Others v. Latvia (dec.)

Furthermore, the applicant had been neither a long-term nor settled migrant in Russia. His wife and children were not Russian nationals, had no close ties with the country, and therefore could leave Russia and join him, something which they had eventually done. Referring to the case of Kolosovskiy v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a050183/99, 29 January 2004, the Government argued that the applicant and his wife and children could return to Georgia and that they would not face insurmountable cultural and social difficulties adjusting to life there, given that the applicant\u2019s family members were Georgians and the applicant had resided there before.",

Russia, no. 17570/15, 7\u00a0March 2017; Zezev v Russia, no. 47781/10, 12 June 2018; and Gaspar, cited above). Therefore, the Court must examine whether the domestic proceedings were attended by sufficient procedural guarantees. It reiterates in this connection that even where national security is at stake, the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that measures affecting fundamental human rights must be subject to some form of adversarial proceedings before an independent body competent to review the reasons for the decision and relevant evidence, if need be with appropriate procedural limitations on the use of classified information (see, mutatis mutandis, Regner v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 35289/11, \u00a7\u00a7 151 and 161, ECHR 2017 (extracts)). The individual must be able to challenge the executive\u2019s assertion that national security is at stake. Failing such safeguards, the police or other State authorities would be able to encroach arbitrarily on rights protected by the Convention (see Nolan and K. v.\u00a0Russia, no. 2512/04, \u00a7 71, 12 February 2009, and Al-Nashif v.

The courts thus failed to examine a critical aspect of the case, namely whether the FSB department had been able to demonstrate the existence of specific facts serving as a basis for its assessment that the applicant presented a national security risk (see, by contrast, Regner, cited above, \u00a7 154). Those elements lead the Court to conclude that the national courts \u2013 except for the District Court, which did point out the FSB department\u2019s failure to submit evidence substantiating its allegations of a security threat (see paragraph 11 above) \u2013 confined themselves to a purely formal examination of the decisions leading to the applicant\u2019s exclusion from Russia (see, for similar reasoning, Liu (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 89, and Kamenov v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7 36).
