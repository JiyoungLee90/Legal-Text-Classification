He further complained of an ineffective investigation into his complaints about inadequate medical treatment in detention. Additionally, on 7 February and 24\u00a0May 2011 he complained about inadequate medical treatment of his medical conditions at present. The Court notes that these new complaints are not an elaboration of the applicant\u2019s original complaints on which the parties have commented.

When he complained about the injury on 18\u00a0March 2009, he was X-rayed within two days and a fracture was diagnosed.

The Court further observes that there was no specific mentioning of the applicant\u2019s TB category before 3 July 2009, which was significant for determining the necessary assistance (see paragraph 55 above). This in itself is sufficient to conclude that the medical assistance before 3 July 2009 was not comprehensive. Furthermore, the doctor occasionally did not indicate the names, dosage or duration of administration of the all medicine prescribed or did not indicate specifics of the therapy (see paragraphs 28, 38 and 41 above).

This must be assessed in each case according to its special features, the reasons given in the domestic decisions, and the matters referred to by the applicant in his applications for release. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty. In determining the length of detention pending trial under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, the period to be taken into consideration begins on the day the accused is taken into custody and ends on the day when the charge is determined, even if only by a court of first instance (see, among others, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a7 145, 147 and 153, ECHR 2000IV). The question whether or not the Court can look into complaints referring to a period which taken separately falls outside the six-month time-limit depends on the nature of the complaints and the type of violation alleged. Given that detention on remand is a continuous situation, the Court has on many occasions decided that where an accused person is detained for two or more separate periods pending trial, the reasonable-time guarantee of Article 5 \u00a7 3 requires a global assessment of the aggregate period (see Solovey and Zozulya, cited above, \u00a7 56, with further references).",

However, Article 5 \u00a7 3 requires that after a certain lapse of time the persistence of a reasonable suspicion does not in itself justify deprivation of liberty, and the judicial authorities should give other grounds for continued detention. Those grounds, moreover, should be expressly mentioned by the domestic courts (see Yeloyev, cited above, \u00a7 60). No such reasons were given by the courts in the present case.

The applicant was admitted to the TB ward, where he received continuous treatment and had the relevant medicines administered to him. It is beyond dispute that his health improved. Admittedly, even during this period of time the treatment was not perfect. The TB category was not mentioned, there was no individualised hygiene plan, the prison diet was not tailored to the applicant\u2019s needs and the medical assistance was still not comprehensive (see paragraph 91).

Instead, this problem was first addressed on 24 March, about two weeks after the injury occurred. Although the knee fracture had healed per se, it appears from the documents submitted that the knee remained deformed.",
