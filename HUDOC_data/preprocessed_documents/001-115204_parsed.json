As already indicated in the report on the 1999 visit (page 9, CPT/Inf (2001) 27), ill-treatment is not only harmful to the victim, but also degrading for the official who inflicts it or authorises it and ultimately prejudicial to the national authorities in general.",

As concerns the medical records the Court notes that the description of the injuries recorded on the day of the applicant\u2019s arrest contradict those recorded two days later when, after the alleged ill-treatment in the police station, the applicant was transferred to Central Prison (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above). Moreover, one of the police officers revealed under questioning that at the time of his interview at the R\u012bga Main police station the applicant was showing signs of injuries not recorded in any of the above-mentioned medical reports (see paragraph 21, section 5, above). It has to be noted that the forensic expert had issued his conclusions based only on the medical records, without actually examining the applicant in person (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above).

There is nothing in the case file to suggest, however, that the investigators or the prosecutor\u2019s office had paid any attention to this part of the applicant\u2019s complaint.",

Besides, it does not appear that the investigation had addressed the inconsistencies in the statements of the police officers. In particular, under questioning as a witness, officer L.K. referred to the applicant\u2019s facial injuries which had not been mentioned in any of the medical records (see paragraph 21, section 5, above). Furthermore, P.K. when questioned as a witness in the investigation into the alleged ill-treatment, said that he had hit the applicant in the face at the time of his arrest but had not mentioned this in the police reports made on the day of the applicant\u2019s arrest (see paragraph 8, above). The Court finds it incompatible with the principles of an effective investigation that the principal witnesses, the police officer L.K. (who at the time the alleged events took place had been in charge of questioning the applicant) was questioned as a witness six months after the investigation into the alleged ill-treatment had started (see paragraph 21, section 5 above). Moreover, the investigation had relied heavily on a forensic report (of an expert who had never actually examined the applicant in person) and had failed to question the medical personnel of the police department who had been in direct contact with the applicant. In the light of the above and taking note that the first findings in the investigation into the alleged ill-treatment were made more than two years after the initial complaint had been lodged, the Court cannot conclude that the investigation of ill-treatment was effective.",

The above-mentioned situation is similar to the facts in Jasinskis v. , no. 45744/08, \u00a7\u00a075, 21\u00a0December\u00a02010, in which the Court concluded that the inquiry carried out by the same authority allegedly liable for the wrongdoing did not comply with the minimum standards of an independent investigation. As concerns the present case, the Court cannot but come to an identical conclusion. The Court also observes, drawing conclusions from the Government\u2019s replies to the CPT, that the first attempt to establish an institution to be entrusted with carrying out internal investigations within the police was in 2003 (see paragraph  above), though the de facto independence of the newly established office had been questioned by the CPT (see paragraph  above).",

Even though the criminal case concerning ill-treatment was initiated in September\u00a01998, it was only following repeated complaints lodged by the applicant (who complained about the ineffectiveness of the investigation and, inter alia, the investigator\u2019s hesitation to arrange visual identification of the perpetrators) that the prosecutor responsible decided to review the case and in October\u00a01999 and September\u00a02000 issued instructions with further steps to be taken by the investigators (see paragraphs 18-19 above). This implies that the prosecutors responsible executed their tasks only as a consequence of the applicant\u2019s complaints and not as one would expect them to in the course of a thorough investigation (see also Assenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0117). In this connection the Court cannot disregard the fact that, several months after instigation of the criminal investigation, the prosecutor responsible was not aware of the body which was carrying out the investigation (see paragraph 16 above). The above-mentioned shortcomings cannot be remedied by the fact that the prosecutor had reprimanded the chief investigator concerning the arrangements for informing the applicant that the investigation into his alleged ill-treatment had been discontinued (see paragraph 23 above).",
