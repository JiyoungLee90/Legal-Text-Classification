The forensic experts had used different rubber gloves when handling different items, and the surface on which they had worked, as well as their instruments, had been thoroughly cleaned after the examination of each item. The Forensic Centre was a member of the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) and it had applied all the relevant guidelines and standards.

In the Government\u2019s view, even if the samples had been packed together there would have been no possibility of contamination.

While Article\u00a06 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see Schenk v.

The case file contains no record on the procedure in accordance with which the applicant\u2019s samples were taken and packed for forensic analysis, even though Article 75 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires a number of details to be recorded in such a situation (see paragraph 56 above). It is true that the request by which the police commissioned a forensic report noted that a new pair of gloves had been used each time a different item had been packed (see paragraph 17 above) but it made no reference to a record supporting such assertion.",

In addition, he named the police inspectors who had taken the samples for forensic analysis. The applicant reasoned his request with reference to the necessity that the circumstances of the taking and packing of the samples be elucidated, as well as the possibility that there had been a transmission of traces between one item and another, namely the bank robber\u2019s clothes and the applicant\u2019s clothes and the samples of his hair. Thus, it does not appear that the applicant\u2019s request was vexatious and there is no doubt that it was sufficiently reasoned, relevant to the subject matter of the accusation and it could arguably have strengthened position of the defence or even led to the applicant\u2019s acquittal had it been confirmed that there had been an intentional or unintended transmission and contamination of traces (see Polyakov v. , no. 77018/01, \u00a7\u00a034, 29\u00a0January 2009).",

Therefore, the only evidence actually linking the applicant with the bank robbery were the fibres from his clothes and the strands of his hair found on the clothes worn by the bank robber (compare Erkapi\u0107 v. , no. 51198/08, \u00a7\u00a7 85-87, 25\u00a0April 2013).",
