It further noted that the first applicant\u2019s medical examination had revealed numerous injuries on him and that during the court hearing the first applicant and M.V. had identified officers R.Kh and I.A. involved in their ill-treatment. The court stated that investigating authorities had abetted those officers by accepting the information obtained from the first applicant in violation of procedural rules. Comparing various documents from the case file, the court concluded that the first applicant\u2019s arrest record of 27 May 2004 had been forged. That fact was supported by the statement of an attesting witness, D., who said that he had not been present during the arrest. Instead, he had been asked to come to the Leninskiy ROVD, where police officers had made a copy of his passport. The court noted, however that according to an expert examination report, the signature on the arrest record had been made by D. The court further found that the first applicant\u2019s allegations that he had been detained on 26\u00a0May 2004 and subjected to physical violence had not been rebutted by the investigator. The fact that the first applicant had sustained bodily injuries after 27 May 2004 had been confirmed by medical documents.",

In the course of the visits to the North Caucasian region in 2006, the CPT\u2019s delegation once again received many credible allegations of recent ill-treatment of detained persons by members of law enforcement agencies and security forces in the Chechen Republic. The ill-treatment alleged was frequently of such a severity that it could be considered to amount to torture; the methods involved included extensive beating, asphyxiation using a plastic bag or gas mask, electric shocks, suspension by the limbs, hyperextension and, more rarely, the infliction of burns by cigarettes, lighters or other devices. Accounts were also received of threats of execution or of sexual abuse in order to obtain a confession or information. The general picture which emerged was that any detained person who did not promptly confess to the crime of which he was suspected (or provide information being sought by those responsible for the detention) would be in imminent danger of being ill-treated...",

Then, on 4 June 2004 a forensic medical expert found numerous bruises and abrasions on his body. The expert held that those injuries could have resulted from the alleged illtreatment by police officers (ibid.). On 2 July 2004 another expert established that he had scars on his chest and a knee (see paragraph\u00a037 above). About five years later, in September 2009 medical specialists from the Centre for Torture Survivors noted a number of scars, bodily marks and symptoms which were consistent with the detailed description of police ill-treatment which the applicant had submitted (see paragraphs\u00a04951 above).",
