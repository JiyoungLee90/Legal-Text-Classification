In reply, the Uzbek authorities had confirmed their intention to seek the applicant\u2019s extradition and had submitted a copy of a detention order issued by an Uzbek court.

Any deprivation of liberty under the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01(f) will be justified, however, only for as long as deportation or extradition proceedings are in progress. If such proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01(f).\u00a0The deprivation of liberty must also be \u201clawful\u201d (see A. and Others v. the  [GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7\u00a0164, ECHR 2009). Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (ibid.).",

As regards the applicant\u2019s detention from 28 to 30\u00a0September 2010, even accepting that the prosecutor\u2019s extension request was submitted to the district court in breach of the seven-day period, the Court considers that this procedural irregularity was not such as to entail a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Importantly, it should be noted in that connection that the applicant\u2019s detention during that period of time remained authorised by the previous detention order of 25 May 2010, which, as accepted by the applicant, was lawful. It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

The Court observes in that connection that, for unspecified reasons, the applicant chose not to appeal against the initial and some other detention orders. As with the procedure before the first-instance court, there is no reason to doubt that an appellate court would have been capable of assessing the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention with a view to extradition. Except for the appeal proceedings concerning the detention order of 30 September 2010 (see paragraphs 63-67 below), the applicant has not adduced any specific argument contesting the effectiveness of the available procedure or substantiating any unfairness in such proceedings. As previously mentioned by the Court, where detention is authorised by a court, subsequent proceedings are less concerned with arbitrariness, but provide guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention. Therefore, the Court will not be concerned, to the same extent, with the proceedings before a court of appeal if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees (ibid). The applicant could have raised various arguments relating to his detention, including those relating to the requirement of diligence in the conduct of the extradition proceedings and the length of the authorised detention period, when a court examined the prosecutor\u2019s renewed request for the extension of his detention or on appeal against the detention order.",
