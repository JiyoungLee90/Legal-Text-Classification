The Court recalls that compensation terms under the domestic legislation are material to the assessment whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicants. In this connection, the Court has previously held that the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference, and a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 only in exceptional circumstances (see N.A. and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a037451/97, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2005...; and Nastou v.

However, it should be underlined that the purchase of the buildings situated in the disaster area was never banned nor was there an indication in the title deed records that prohibited habitation of these buildings. As regards the regulation dated 28\u00a0August 1968, the Court notes that the terms of this regulation are not relevant to the applicant's request for compensation since he does not request re-housing but seeks compensation for the loss he has sustained because of the demolition of his house. Finally, in the Court's opinion, an eviction order which was sent to the previous owners of the building in 1971 has no bearing on the applicant's situation and does not explain the lack of any compensation for him.",
