A decision to place a suspect or an accused under house arrest must specify which restrictions have been imposed and designate a supervising authority to ensure that the restrictions are observed (Article 107 \u00a7\u00a7 8-10). A judicial decision to place a person under house arrest may be appealed against to a higher court within three days under the same procedure as an appeal against custody.

The rule is based on the assumption that the domestic legislative system provides an effective remedy in respect of the alleged breach. The burden of proof is on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that an effective remedy was available both in theory and practice at the relevant time, that is to say that the remedy was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see, amongst many others, Akdivar and Others v.

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to take into account the particular circumstances of the individual case. This means, amongst other things, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7 69; Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, no. , \u00a7 121, 11\u00a0January 2007; and Had\u017eimejli\u0107 and Others v.

He also used that procedure to appeal against two of the four extension orders, notably the two latest ones. His appeals were dismissed on the dates indicated in paragraph 39 above. The Court observes that the applicant was under house arrest for ten months, during which the grounds and reasons for it were examined by the competent courts at least ten times: five times when ordering and extending the house arrest, three times when examining the applicant\u2019s aforementioned appeals, and on at least two occasions when dealing with the investigating authorities\u2019 requests to replace house arrest with pre-trial detention. Moreover, the applicant brought up the same question during the judicial hearings on the merits. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s decision not to appeal against the first two extension orders does not give sufficient grounds to reach a finding that he had failed to comply with the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies. In coming to this conclusion the Court takes into account the risk of replacing house arrest with detention, which was pertinent, as shown by the investigating authorities\u2019 requests. The Court therefore dismisses the Government\u2019s objection as to nonexhaustion of domestic remedies.",

In proclaiming the \u201cright to liberty\u201d, paragraph 1 of Article 5 contemplates the physical liberty of the person; its aim is to ensure that no one should be deprived of that liberty in an arbitrary fashion. It is not concerned with mere restrictions on the liberty of movement; such restrictions are governed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4. Subparagraphs (a) to (f) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 contain an exhaustive list of permissible grounds on which persons may be deprived of their liberty and no deprivation of liberty will be lawful unless it falls within one of those grounds. Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, \u00a7 84, 23\u00a0February 2012).",

The condition that there be no arbitrariness further demands that both the order to detain and the execution of the detention must genuinely conform with the purpose of the restrictions permitted by the relevant sub-paragraph of Article 5 \u00a7 1. There must in addition be some relationship between the ground of permitted deprivation of liberty relied on and the place and conditions of detention (ibid.) In the context of sub-paragraphs (b), (d) and (e) the notion of arbitrariness also includes an assessment of whether detention was necessary to achieve the stated aim; likewise, detention pursuant to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) must equally embody a proportionality requirement (see Ladent v.

In any event, the scope of the new restriction was even wider than the previous ban on making public comments on the criminal case because it limited the applicant\u2019s access to broadcast media for making statements on any subject matter. Given the wording and the overall sense of Article 107 \u00a7\u00a07, combined with the judicial decisions in this case, the Court doubts whether the ban on the use of television and radio was an appropriate extension of the restriction on the use of \u201cmeans of communication\u201d.

However, as the Court has already established, those risks were entirely unsubstantiated and it does not appear that they played any role in the decision on the preventive measure (ibid.). Moreover, there was no link between the restrictions on the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression and the indicated risks. As to the risk of absconding, supposedly demonstrated by the trips to Moscow Region while the residence order was in force, it is difficult to see how even a genuine belief that the applicant was about to flee could be relevant to a ban on his use of radio and television as a means of communication. The applicant was confined to his flat; he was under strict surveillance and wore an electronic tracking device; he was not allowed to leave his flat, even to take walks. In those circumstances it was unlikely that an opportunity to issue a public statement via radio or television would have facilitated absconding. As to the possibility of the applicant using a public statement to influence witnesses or otherwise obstruct the investigation, it was referred to in the abstract and its relation with the use of radio and television remained equally tenuous.",
