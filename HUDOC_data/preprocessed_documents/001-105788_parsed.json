In particular, the legal significance of the existence of two orders is unclear. Also, the duplication resulted in a situation where there were two independent sets of judicial proceedings concerning the lawfulness of Mr M.\u2019s detention and no clarity as to whether the judicial decision repealing one of the detention orders actually affected the first applicant\u2019s situation (see paragraphs 13, 14 and 23-28 above).

In particular, while it apparently acknowledged the existence of such risks, the court placed on the first applicant the burden of proving that they stemmed from the Afghan authorities and that those authorities would not guarantee his safety (see\u00a0paragraph 33 above). This approach appears deficient on two levels. First, it seems to place excessive reliance on the question whether the illtreatment risked in the receiving State would emanate from State or nonState sources, whereas, in accordance with the Court\u2019s established caselaw, this issue, albeit relevant, cannot be decisive (see, among others, N. v. Finland, no. 38885/02, \u00a7\u00a7 163-165, 26 July 2005, and Salah Sheekh v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, no. 1948/04, \u00a7\u00a7 137-149, ECHR 2007-I). Second, by dealing with such a serious issue summarily and by placing on the first applicant, without any explanation, the burden of proving negative facts, such as the lack of State guarantees in , the court practically deprived Mr M. of a meaningful examination of his claim under Article 3. The Court reiterates in this connection that in view of the importance which it attaches to Article 3 of the Convention and the irreversible nature of the damage which may result if the risk of ill-treatment materialises, the effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 imperatively requires independent and rigorous scrutiny by a national authority of any claim that there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and  [GC], no. 30696/09, \u00a7 293, 21 January 2011, with further references).",

It observes that under Bulgarian law, whenever the executive chooses to mention national security as the grounds for a deportation order, appeals against such an order have no suspensive effect, even if an irreversible risk of death or ill-treatment in the receiving State is claimed (see paragraphs 16 and 50 above). Moreover, at least until September 2009, the  held that under Bulgarian law there was no possibility of staying the enforcement of a deportation order issued on national security grounds (see paragraphs 51 and 52 above). In the present case, it appears that the first applicant\u2019s request for a stay of his deportation pending the judicial review proceedings was left practically unexamined (see paragraph 29 above). Before the Court\u2019s decision to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, Mr M. could have been deported to  at any moment and without a prior independent examination of his claim that such deportation would expose him to a serious risk to his life or physical integrity. While this did not happen (apparently, partly for reasons beyond the Bulgarian authorities\u2019 control and partly because of delays in their actions (see paragraphs 69-75 above)), the issue to be examined is whether or not the available domestic remedies met the requirement of effectiveness under Article 13 and the Court\u2019s case-law. Those requirements take the form of a guarantee and cannot be deemed to have been satisfied by a de facto arrangement (see\u00a0Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien], cited above, \u00a7 66).",

Consequently, it is inconsistent with Article 13 for such measures to be executed before the national authorities have examined whether they are compatible with the Convention, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (see \u010conka v. , no.\u00a051564/99, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2002-I, and Salah Sheekh, cited above, \u00a7 153). In the context of deportation, the domestic remedy for examination of allegations about serious risks of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 in the destination country must have automatic suspensive effect (see\u00a0Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 66, and M.S.S.\u00a0v.\u00a0Belgium and Greece [GC], cited above, \u00a7 293). As the prohibition provided by Article 3 against torture and inhuman or degrading treatment is of an absolute character, the activities of the individual in question, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be a material consideration with the consequence that the protection afforded by Article 3 is broader than that provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (see Saadi v.  [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7\u00a0138, ECHR 2008...). By choosing to rely on national security in a deportation order the authorities cannot do away with effective remedies (see Al-Nashif, cited above, \u00a7 137).",

It finds that the Bulgarian law and practice in relation to stays of enforcement of deportation orders issued on purported national security grounds are incompatible with Article\u00a013 as they do not guarantee automatic suspension of enforcement and do not secure a substantive, rigorous and independent examination of claims under Article 3 of the Convention prior to deportation.",
