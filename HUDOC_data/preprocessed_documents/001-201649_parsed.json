Ireland, no. 9697/82, \u00a7 57, 18 December 1986, and Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and\u00a065900/01, \u00a7 48, ECHR 2005X). Such an interpretation is based on common sense and for me it is a requirement or facet of the principle of effectiveness. It would be pointless, therefore, on the issue of compulsory military service, for member States to have a wide discretion regarding the right/prohibition guaranteed by Article 4 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 (c), but not to have such a discretion regarding the right guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention. The extent of the discretion of member States is a factor affecting the exercise of the supervisory function of the Court; the wider the discretion of member States in a given area of law, the less intrusive the Court\u2019s intervention. What is submitted here about the harmonious interpretation of Articles 9 and 4 of the Convention as regards the member States\u2019 discretion is supported by the Court\u2019s case-law on Article 9, according to which States enjoy such a margin of appreciation regarding the manner in which their systems of alternative service are organised and implemented (see, inter alia, Adyan and Others v. Armenia, no. 75604/11, \u00a7\u00a067, 12 October 2017).",

This is an issue which was decided in the affirmative, in a progressive manner and without any association with Article 4 \u00a7 3, in Bayatyan v. Armenia [GC], no. 23459/03, 7 July 2012. The Court in that case observed that Article 4 \u00a7 3 \u201c[i]n itself ... neither recognise[d] nor exclude[d] a right to conscientious objection and should therefore not have a delimiting effect on the rights guaranteed by Article 9\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 100). However, accepting that there is a right to conscientious objection under Article 9 does not preclude the need for a harmonious interpretation of Articles 9 and 4 \u00a7 3 (b) regarding the extent of the margin of appreciation afforded to member States in organising and implementing alternative civilian service under Article 9, an issue which is different from the question whether there is a right to conscientious objection. On the contrary, as has been said above, such a harmonising interpretative approach is an important aspect of the principle of effectiveness, which must be taken into account. Furthermore, the Court in Bayatyan (ibid., \u00a7 125), following case-law of the European Commission of Human Rights, accepted that exemptions from compulsory military service should be granted on the basis of \u201csolid and convincing grounds\u201d. It can be said that this strict standard of proof is borne out by reading Article 9 together with Article 4 \u00a7 3 (b); and by analogy the wide margin of appreciation of member States in organising and implementing alternative civilian service also stems from such a reading.",
