In the present case, the purpose of the applicant association\u2019s application to the Conseil d\u2019Etat was to seek judicial review of planning permission granted to a company for the expansion of a landfill site. The reasons given were based primarily on instruments such as Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27\u00a0June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste, the decree of 11 September 1985 on environmental impact assessment in the Walloon Region and the Nature Conservation Act of 12\u00a0July 1973. No comparison may be made in this regard with the arguments submitted before the French Conseil d\u2019Etat by Collectif Stop Melox et Mox (cited above).",

Moreover, all the founding members and administrators of the applicant association reside in the municipalities concerned, and can therefore be regarded as local residents directly affected by the plans to expand the landfill site. Increasing the capacity of the landfill site by more than one-fifth of its initial capacity was likely to have a considerable impact on their private life, because of the nuisance it would generate for their everyday quality of life and, in turn, on the market value of their properties in the municipalities concerned, which would be at risk of depreciation as a result.",

The Court considers, however, in view of the circumstances of the present case, and in particular the nature of the impugned measure, the status of the applicant association and its founders and the fact that the aim it pursued was limited in space and in substance, that the general interest defended by the applicant association in its application for judicial review cannot be regarded as an actio popularis.",
