On that account, the Government may be considered in principle estopped from raising their objections to admissibility at this stage (Rule 55 of the Rules of Court; see inter alia, Amrollahi v.

In this regard, the Government noted that in his original application form dated 6 August 1996 Mahmut \u00d6zkanl\u0131 alleged that G\u00f6zeler had been burned down by security forces subsequent to its evacuation, whereas in his observations of 4\u00a0November 1999, he changed his submission, this time alleging that G\u00f6zeler had been evacuated but not destroyed.

Accordingly, it must primarily have regard to the general situation prevailing in the region at the time of the alleged events. The Court observes that at the relevant time violent confrontations had taken place between the security forces and members of the PKK in the state-of-emergency region of . This two-fold violence forced many people to leave their homes and move to safer places. In similar cases, the Court has also found however that the national authorities had evacuated a number of settlements to ensure the safety of the population in the region (see, Do\u011fan and Others v. , nos. 8803-8811/02, 8813/02 and 8815-8819/02, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2004...(extracts)). The Court has further established in a number of cases that the security forces had deliberately destroyed the homes and properties of certain applicants, depriving them of their livelihood and forcing them to leave their villages (see, among many others, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV; Sel\u00e7uk and Asker v. Turkey, judgment of 24 April 1998, Reports 1998II; Mente\u015f and Others v.

Accordingly, the Court must reach its decision on the basis of the available evidence submitted by the parties (see Pardo v.

Upon the Government\u2019s finding that no house was burned down in G\u00f6zeler by either the security forces or the terrorists, they rephrased their allegation and explained that they had been forced to leave the village but their house had not been deliberately destroyed by the security forces. In his initial application form dated 6 August 1996, Mr \u00d6zkanl\u0131 also claimed that his family had been subjected to degrading and inhuman treatment in the course of the eviction. Later however, in a questionnaire he clarified that the security forces had not ill-treated them in any way (see paragraph 39 above).",

It is also true however that those inconsistencies detract from the overall credibility of these applicants. They indicated translation errors as the reason for their mistaken submissions. The Court is well aware of the fact that the applicants may face certain difficulties in getting their submissions accurately translated. It is not clear, however, why these applicants claimed in 1996, in their native language, that their homes had been burned down by security forces and corrected themselves three years later only when the Government established that there was no burned-down house in G\u00f6zeler.",

Whether or not they indeed filed such a letter, it is undisputed that they failed to lodge a complaint with the Ovac\u0131k Public Prosecutor\u2019s office or any other judicial authority with general jurisdiction. In view of the fact that the authorities have engaged in various forms of investigations upon the complaints from Cevizlidere and other villages in similar cases cited above, the Court considers that there is a rebuttable presumption that the authorities would have acted upon a complaint from G\u00f6zeler had they received one. Since the \u00d6zkanl\u0131 family failed to provide the Court with a copy of their alleged letter and failed to follow up on such complaint, if any, the Court finds that they failed to rebut such presumption.
