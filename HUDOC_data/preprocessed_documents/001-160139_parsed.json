This order had been complied with without any need for the police to resort to the use of force. None of the witnesses had been able to identify the police officer who had allegedly hit the applicant.

Even though each of these acts, taken individually, fell afoul of Article 3 of the Convention, there was no use to examine them in isolation, as the Government did not seek to justify any of them by reference to his conduct. It was true that the police operation in the course of which he was arrested had been intended to protect participants in the Sofia Gay Pride parade, and that in such circumstances the police could be given some latitude to tackle aggressive groups without assessing the dangerousness of each of their individual members in advance. However, this did not mean that they were free to flout the absolute prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment.",

However, it is settled case-law that such force will not be in breach of this Article only if it was indispensable and not excessive (see, in general, Ivan Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, \u00a7 63, 12 April 2007, with further references, and, in relation specifically to the use of force to quell mass unrest, Muradova v. Azerbaijan, no. 22684/05, \u00a7 109, 2 April 2009). The burden to prove that this was the case rests on the Government (see, in general, Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, \u00a7 72 in fine, ECHR 2000-XII, and Petkov and Parnarov v. Bulgaria, no. 59273/10, \u00a7 47, 19 May 2015, and, specifically with respect to force used by the police in connection with mass demonstrations, Bal\u00e7\u0131k and Others v. Turkey, no. 25/02, \u00a7 31, 29\u00a0November 2007; Sam\u00fct Karabulut v. Turkey, no. 16999/04, \u00a7 42, 27\u00a0January 2009; and Gazio\u011flu and Others v. Turkey, no. 29835/05, \u00a7 43, 17 May 2011). However, neither the prosecutors who decided not to open criminal proceedings pursuant to the applicant\u2019s allegations nor the Government in their observations described with any particularity the conduct of the applicant which had impelled the police to use force against him. They were content to refer generally to the backdrop against which the police arrested the applicant, which was characterised by the risk of attacks by homophobic groups against participants in the Sofia Gay Pride parade. However, this does not suffice to show that the police were justified in indiscriminately using force against any person who happened to be in the vicinity, regardless of his or her own conduct (see, mutatis mutandis, Muradova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 111 and 133). It is true that the police resorted to the use of force while trying to protect participants in the Sofia Gay Pride parade against possible attacks, and thus with a view to discharging Bulgaria\u2019s positive obligations under Articles 3, 11 and 14 of the Convention (see Identoba and Others v. Georgia, no. 73235/12, \u00a7\u00a7 66, 72 and 94-100, 12 May 2015). However, in view of the absolute nature of the protection afforded by Article 3 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7\u00a0163,\u00a0Series\u00a0A no. 25; Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 79-80, Reports 1996-V; and Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7\u00a7 137 and 140, ECHR 2008), the use of force by the police will not give rise to a breach of this Article only if it is shown that recourse to it was made indispensable by the applicant\u2019s own conduct (see, mutatis mutandis, Najafli v. Azerbaijan, no. 2594/07, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39, 2 October 2012). This is not the case: the Government have not referred to any evidence that the applicant put up resistance to the police, attempted to attack participants in the Sofia Gay Pride parade, or engaged in any other conduct that might have justified the use of force against him.",

However, this inquiry was marred by a number of deficiencies. First, part of it was delegated to the Sofia Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which could hardly be regarded as sufficiently independent vis-\u00e0-vis the officers whose conduct was being investigated. In effect, in deciding not to open a formal criminal investigation pursuant to the inquiry, the Sofia Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office appears to have chiefly relied on reports produced by officers of that Ministry (see, mutatis mutandis, El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7\u00a7 187 and 189, ECHR 2012; \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 52442/09, \u00a7\u00a7 87-90, 19 July 2011; and Najafli, cited above, \u00a7 52). Secondly, the inquiry appears to have been confined to taking written statements from the persons concerned, with no efforts being made to interview them or organise confrontations between them with a view to specifically addressing the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment rather than the general backdrop against which his arrest had taken place. Thirdly, the inquiry did not make it clear whether the police had not used any force against the applicant or had, on the contrary, used such force, but only because it had been rendered necessary by the applicant\u2019s conduct. Instead, the inquiry appears to have proceeded on the assumption that since the police were confronted with a tense situation, they were justified in using force against any person with whom they came into contact in the course of their operation. Fourthly, the inquiry did not attempt to determine the exact origin of all of the applicant\u2019s numerous bruises (see paragraphs 17-20 above). These latter points were noted by the Military Appellate Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which quashed the earlier decision not to open a formal criminal investigation and ordered an additional inquiry to elucidate them (see paragraph 22 above). However, this additional inquiry, which was again carried out by the Sofia Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, suffered from the same defects as the original one, and was even concluded by the Sofia District Prosecutor\u2019s Office with the exact same reasoning, word for word, as that with which the Sofia Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office had earlier concluded the original inquiry (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above).",

Bulgaria, no. 51284/09, \u00a7 72, 30 September 2014).

In this case, the purpose of the proceedings before the Bulgarian prosecuting authorities was precisely to obtain redress for the substantive breach of Article 3 of the Convention and to ensure compliance with the procedural limb of this Article (see, mutatis mutandis, De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, 18 June 1971, \u00a7\u00a050, Series A no. 12; Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 18, Series A no.\u00a032; and The Sunday Times, cited above, \u00a7 18). Accordingly, the costs incurred in their course are recoverable under Article 41 of the Convention. However, the same does not apply to the costs incurred by the applicant in relation to the proceedings for judicial review of the administrative fine imposed on him; these do not constitute expenses incurred in seeking redress for the breaches of the Convention found in this case (see, mutatis mutandis, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 79, ECHR 1999-II; E.M.K. v. Bulgaria, no. 43231/98, \u00a7 153, 18 January 2005; and Kashavelov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 891/05, \u00a7 59, 20 January 2011).",

EUR 1,200 of this sum is to be paid to the applicant, and the remainder \u2013 EUR 700, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant\u00a0\u2013 to the law firm in which his legal representatives are partners.",
