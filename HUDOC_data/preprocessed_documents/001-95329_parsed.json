The article suggested that B.\u0160 and E.V. had had a conversation on the staircase of the building and that B.\u0160., displeased with a recent article by E.V., had told her that she should be killed. It also reported that B.\u0160. had subsequently followed E.V. to the press room, where he had allegedly taken a handgun from a security officer and pointed its barrel at E.V., saying that he would kill her, after which he had laughed loudly at his own joke. The article was published inside the magazine in the column \u201cPolitical Terminator\u201d. The circulation of Globus at the time was some 185,000 copies.",

I did not consider that they were talking with raised voices. To the contrary, on that occasion I said to the plaintiff jokingly something like 'As long as you politicians and us journalists exist, there will always be situations where you will not be satisfied with what we write' after which I said something like 'E.V. is a good girl'. I had said that before the security officer took out the handgun. Then, as the Government meeting was approaching, the security officer came to look for the plaintiff, to which he jokingly replied: 'Did you come to apprehend me? You have the power.' When he was leaving the room he [inadvertently] touched the security officer and asked where his weapon was. The security officer took out the handgun and placed it on his palm, after which I told him that I had been taught that a weapon should always be pointed away from people. At that he said that I should not be afraid, because he had taken out the bullets. As far as I remember, the plaintiff [then] left the room, whereas I stayed with the security officer and asked about the handgun... I am certain that when I entered the press room the plaintiff and E.V. were talking. I even asked them what was going on because from the first [few] sentences I could not understand what the conversation was about. Neither of them replied to my question but I understood what the conversation was about, namely the article that E.V. had written.",

The case-law of the Supreme Court showed that that court had been awarding damages of between HRK 60,000 and 200,000 in similar cases. Accordingly, the damages awarded to B.\u0160. had been in the lower range of those normally awarded by the Croatian courts.

On the other hand, B.\u0160. and the security officer (the two individuals most responsible for the incident) and the journalist S.\u0160. had denied that assertion. Placing its confidence in their statements, the first-instance court had found that the published information was false, that is, that the applicant company had not proved its veracity. In doing so, the first-instance court attached special importance to the testimony of S.\u0160.

These allegations therefore required substantial justification, especially given that they were made in a highcirculation weekly magazine (see paragraph 6 above). The Court notes on this point that neither in the domestic proceedings nor in the proceedings before the Court did the applicant company adduce any evidence in support of its claim that the Globus journalists attempted to contact B.\u0160.'s office. Furthermore, it is clear that no attempt was made to contact any of their three journalist colleagues or the security officer D.P. who had actually witnessed the incident. The applicant company did not even claim that the Globus journalists made any efforts in that connection, although, in the Court's view, that would have been a logical step in the circumstances. Instead, they claimed to have verified the information with their source in the Government, who allegedly confirmed it but who clearly could not have had witnessed the incident and whose identity they were unwilling to reveal before the domestic courts on account of the protection afforded to journalistic sources. In these circumstances, the Court cannot but agree with the domestic courts in their finding that the applicant company did not sufficiently verify the information prior to publication.",

Whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their sources as reliable at the material time rather than with the benefit of hindsight (see, for example, McVicar, \u00a7 84; and Pedersen and Baadsgaard, \u00a7 78, both cited above). As already noted above (see paragraph 67), the accusation made in the article was a serious one. The Globus journalists relied on the journalist E.V. as their primary source of information. The Court notes, however, that she was personally involved in the incident and perceived B.\u0160.'s behaviour in general as hostile. In this connection, the Court reiterates that where particularly serious allegations have been made by one of the parties to a dispute, particular vigilance is called for. In such situations journalists, rather than automatically giving credence to such allegations, should ascertain whether they were true by obtaining further information and, if appropriate, by hearing the other side's version of the facts (see, mutatis mutandis, Harlanova, cited above). Therefore, without calling into question E.V.'s professional and moral character, the Court does not consider that she was a reliable source of information concerning the incident to a degree that no further verification was necessary. This conclusion does not change even if the situation is examined as it presented itself to the Globus journalists at the material time rather than with the benefit of hindsight (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 66 in fine and 72).

It is also aware that news is a perishable commodity and that to delay its publication, even for a short period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest (see Observer and Guardian v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 26\u00a0November 1991, \u00a7 60, Series A no. 216; and Sunday Times v. the  (no. 2), 26 November 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 217). Nevertheless, if the editor of Globus in the exercise of his editorial discretion, given the time-constraints and means available to verify the information, decided to publish it without adequately checking whether it was true or not, a more cautious approach was warranted. In that case, it should have been made clear that the information came from the journalist E.V. and it should not have been presented as uncontroversial fact. However, as already noted above (see paragraph 60), any uninformed reader could infer that B.\u0160.'s inappropriate behaviour was a firmly established fact, not open to controversy, and could not discern that the information actually came from E.V.",

Having regard to the margin of appreciation left to the Contracting States in such matters, the Court finds in the circumstances of the present case that the domestic courts were entitled to consider it necessary to restrict the exercise of the applicant company's right to freedom of expression and that ordering it to pay damages met a \u201cpressing social need\u201d.

It considers that an order to pay B.\u0160. damages amounting to HRK\u00a060,000 does not, in the specific circumstances of the case, appear excessive. The Court attaches particular weight to the fact that the payment of damages was ordered against the applicant company, the biggest newspaper publisher in the country (see paragraph 6 above), and not the editor of Globus or an individual journalist. It also notes that the domestic courts awarded less than one fifth of the damages sought by B.\u0160. Their decisions are therefore in line with the Court's caselaw that an award of damages for defamation must bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered (see paragraph 54 above).
