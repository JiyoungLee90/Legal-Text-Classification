However, that right would be illusory if a \u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; \nto construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6. It is not open to a State authority to cite lack of funds as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt.
