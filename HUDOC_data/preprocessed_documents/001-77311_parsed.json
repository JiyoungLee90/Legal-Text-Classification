Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. The Court notes that the trial court held hearings once a year and that the longest period of inactivity lasted between November 1999 and December 2001. Therefore the conduct of the court contributed to the overall delay and showed a lack of diligence in the proceedings in which there was a lot at stake for the applicant. In this connection the Court considers that the Warsaw Court of Appeal in dismissing the applicant\u2019s complaint that the length of the proceedings in her case exceeded a reasonable time failed to apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in the Court\u2019s caselaw (see Majewski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 52690/99, \u00a7\u00a036, 11\u00a0October 2005).",
