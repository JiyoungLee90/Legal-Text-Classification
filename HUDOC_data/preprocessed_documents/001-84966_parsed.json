In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3. Treatment has been held by the Court to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also \u201cdegrading\u201d because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them.",

It further considers the trial court\u2019s insistence that the applicant discover the identity of the other accused himself to be an excessive formalism. Their identity could easily have been discovered, as argued by the applicant, from the official police records. Instead, the trial court rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint as incomplete without taking any further action. Moreover, this is no explanation why the trial court did not continue the proceedings at least against Mr P.R.
