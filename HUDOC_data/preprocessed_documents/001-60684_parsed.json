Notice of each individual application was published in the Official Gazette of the province of Seville. The national and regional press carried reports that a large number of legal actions had been brought complaining about the organisation and results of the competition and that senior officials in the Andalusian government or members of their families had passed the examination as a result of the significant weighting given to one of the assessment criteria. The dispute was referred to the Ombudsman (defensor del pueblo) for Andalusia, who strongly criticised the weighting system and advised the Andalusian government to annul the competition.

A number of articles on the proceedings challenging the scale used in the competition (and the list of candidates selected to take part) have appeared in large circulation newspapers in Andalusia (the case has received extensive coverage in Diario 16 (Andalusia), ABC (Seville edition), Ja\u00e9n, El Pa\u00eds, Huelva Informaci\u00f3n and Diario de C\u00f3rdoba)). The underlying issues were also examined by the Andalusian parliament at a briefing session (held on 24\u00a0November 1994). In June 1994 the Department of Education and Science sent a memorandum to the teachers via the \u2018Sector Education Office\u2019 expressly informing them of the proceedings pending in the Andalusia Higher Court of Justice. To these considerations must be added the subjective characteristics common to all the applicants: they are all civil servants employed by the defendant authority; as teachers, they are in a category of the population that has frequent access to the media, particularly the press. Lastly, the number of people affected by the appeals is very high (4,091 teachers entered the competition and 2,014 were selected in a very specific functional environment (teaching)). In the light of the foregoing, we reach the clear conclusion that the appellants had constructive notice of the judicial review proceedings that were heard by the Administrative Division in Seville. Consequently, their failure to take part in those proceedings was not attributable to any lack of diligence by that Division. Accordingly, there has been no violation of the right to the protection of the courts (Article 24 \u00a7 1 of the Spanish Constitution).\u201d",

Knowing neither the appeal number nor the case number, she had been unable to seek leave to take part in the proceedings. In the applicant\u2019s submission, the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law on the protection of the rights of the defence in judicial review proceedings contravened Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, particularly since section 64 of the Administrative Courts Act required all interested parties in the dispute to be informed of the proceedings so that they had an opportunity to appear before the court hearing the application for judicial review. In that regard, she noted that State Counsel had said in his observations on the amparo appeal that he considered that there had been a violation of her right of access to a court. She submitted that the stance taken by the Constitutional Court undermined the principle of legal certainty, one of the linchpins of which was compliance with the rules of procedure.

The Government said that immediately after the publication in December 1993 of each candidate\u2019s assessment, more than 300 applications for judicial review had been lodged complaining of the use of the teacher-training diploma as a criterion of assessment and of the weighting given to it. Details of all the applications had appeared in the Official Gazette of the province of Seville. Personally notifying all interested parties would have required several hundred formal notices to be sent out. In addition, there had been a heated debate about the competition owing to the alleged favourable treatment given to certain members of the political party in power in Andalusia, whose applications would have been unsuccessful had it not been for the use of the teacher-training diploma as a criterion of assessment. The matter had been raised with bodies such as the Ombudsman for Andalusia, the regional parliament and trade unions; the debate had been reported in the media.

Nor did they wish to speculate on the applicant\u2019s reasons for saying that she had had \u201cthe good fortune to receive a copy of the Official Gazette of the Autonomous Community of Andalusia\u201d dated exactly the same day her appointment as a senior secondary-school teacher was annulled. The Government were surprised that the applicant had not enjoyed the same \u201cgood fortune\u201d when it came to receiving one of the Official Gazettes of the province of Seville in which notice of the numerous applications for judicial review had been published, or alternatively a trade-union bulletin, a newspaper cutting or perhaps information from the school notice board. In that connection, the Government noted that from 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1994 the applicant was the head teacher at the secondary school where she taught and that almost three-quarters of the teachers from the school had taken part in the competition for the senior teaching posts. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s husband was also her lawyer in the proceedings before the Court, so she could not claim to be unfamiliar with the rules governing constructive notice. In conclusion, the Government said that the applicant had been fully aware of the applications to the Andalusia Higher Court of Justice. It had been her decision not to take part in those proceedings. There had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. ",

The applicant has argued that that provision imposed a mandatory obligation for her to be served with a summons to appear before the Higher Court of Justice. The Government have contended that since the applicant had constructive notice of the litigation, she was required, as the case-law of the Constitutional Court on the subject confirmed, to act diligently and to apply to the Higher Court of Justice for leave to intervene in the proceedings. It is this latter interpretation that was upheld by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 23 above).",

The Constitutional Court also pointed to the very large number of people concerned by the applications for judicial review.
