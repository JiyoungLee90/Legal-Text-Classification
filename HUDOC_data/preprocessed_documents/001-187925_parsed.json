They all had to share the two bunks. When the applicant had been in a single occupancy cell, which she had initially estimated to measure about 3 to 3.5 sq. m, she had had to share with another detainee and a mattress of about 1.90 m would be placed on the dirty floor alongside her bed. This left only about 30 cm of free space between the mattress and the bed. The mattresses placed in the cells to accommodate additional detainees were filthy and sleeping on the concrete floor with only one blanket was very uncomfortable. The detainees therefore shared the bunks as they could share two blankets this way, which made it warmer.",

That meant that when there were ten detainees, the applicant would have been alone in her cell and would thus have had 5.94 sq. m of personal space. When there were eleven to twenty detainees, it was likely that she had shared a cell with another detainee, and would therefore have had 2.97 sq. m of personal space. It was not, however, possible to estimate the length and frequency of the periods during which the applicant had shared a cell with another detainee. According to the table, during the relevant period there had been fifteen days when there were eight to ten detainees in the wing, three when there were eleven detainees in the wing, and at least sixty-three days where there were between twelve and twenty detainees. The remaining sixty-five days were unaccounted for.",

The Court has already ruled that police stations and other similar establishments which, by their very nature, are places designed to accommodate people for very short durations, are not appropriate places for the detention of people who are waiting for the application of an administrative measure, such as deportation (see, for example, Thuo v. Cyprus, no. 3869/07, \u00a7 159, 4 April 2017 with further references). On that point, the Court observes that the Cypriot authorities\u2019 practice of detaining aliens subject to deportation procedures in police facilities for long periods has been explicitly mentioned by the CPT, inter alia in its 2012 report describing such establishments as unsuitable for detaining people under immigration legislation for prolonged periods (see paragraph 22 above). It is true that the CPT\u2019s visit in 2008 took place nearly three years and ten months before the applicant\u2019s detention in the present case. However, there is nothing to suggest that the material conditions at the station changed dramatically between 2008 and 2012. This is evident from the description of the facilities set out in the Ombudsman\u2019s report of 31\u00a0July 2012 following her visit on 23 May 2012 during the applicant\u2019s detention (see paragraphs 23-29 above). The Ombudsman pointed out, inter alia, that the facilities were old and totally unsuitable for long-term detention and did not provide dignified conditions of detention (see paragraph 25 above).",

The table they prepared concerning the number of detainees in the women\u2019s wing during the relevant period is also incomplete. It does appear from this table, however, that the women\u2019s wing was overcrowded for the majority of the days recorded and, overall, for more than two months during the applicant\u2019s detention. During the period of nearly five months, there are only fifteen days recorded where there were eight to ten detainees and only three when there were eleven detainees in the wing. The Government admitted that when the number of detainees exceeded the wing\u2019s capacity it was likely that the applicant would have shared a cell with another detainee, and therefore would have had 2.97 sq. m of personal space (see paragraphs\u00a014 and 42 above).",
