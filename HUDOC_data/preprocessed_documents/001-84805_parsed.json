Although the Court is not in a position to analyse the quality of the case-law of the domestic courts, it observes that, since remittal is usually ordered because of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency in the judicial system (Wierciszewska v. Poland, no. 41431/98, \u00a7 46, 25\u00a0November\u00a02003). Moreover, it is the role of the domestic courts to manage their proceedings so that they are expeditious and effective (see Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a0183, ECHR 2006-...).",
