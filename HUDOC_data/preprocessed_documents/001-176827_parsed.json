In that connection, it reiterates its relevant case-law, according to which it would not consider detention conditions as a continuous situation in circumstances where the complaint concerned an episode, treatment or a particular detention regime attached to an established period of detention (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a042525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7\u00a7 76-78, 10 January 2012). In the present case the applicant was transferred from Tbilisi Prison no. 5 to the prison hospital. He did not submit that the material conditions of his detention in the prison hospital or subsequently in Rustavi Prison no. 6 were similar to Tbilisi Prison no. 5 as far as overcrowding and the ensuing problems with sleeping and the lack of sanitation were concerned (see paragraph 43 above). Having regard to the above circumstances and to the fact that the applicant never returned to Tbilisi Prison no. 5 after 17 November 2006 (see, a contrario, R\u0103ducanu v. , no. 17187/05, \u00a7 73, 12 June 2012), the Court cannot conclude that there was a continuous situation. It therefore considers that this part of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention was introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention (see, amongst many others, Gorguiladz\u00e9 v. Georgia, no.\u00a04313/04, \u00a7\u00a7 23-24, 20 October 2009, and Mazanashvili v. Georgia, no.\u00a019882/07, \u00a7 40, 28\u00a0January 2014).",

Without such basic conduct at the domestic level by a person who wished to challenge the conditions of his or her detention, the Court would necessarily have difficulties in evaluating the credibility of the applicant\u2019s allegations of fact in that respect (see Janiashvili v. Georgia, no. 35887/05, \u00a7\u00a070, 27 November 2012, and Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v. Georgia (dec.), no. 1704/06, 26\u00a0June 2007).",

Furthermore, in the proceedings before the Court, the applicant limited his submissions to general statements, failing to submit any evidence in support (see Mur\u0161i\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia [GC], no. 7334/13, \u00a7 127, ECHR 2016, and Ananyev and Others, \u00a7 122, cited above).

Contrary to that recommendation, the applicant was placed in a normal prison cell and was not taken for chemotherapy as scheduled (see paragraph 19 above). He was not provided with chemotherapy again until July 2007 (see paragraph 24 above), a delay of over half a year. The Court finds that break in the applicant\u2019s treatment, particularly in view of the deterioration of his condition, to be deplorable.",

The Government acted accordingly, transferring the applicant to the prison hospital the next day and providing him with all the required medical examinations. In mid-April 2008 he was offered chemotherapy at the prison hospital for the first time. The applicant, however, declined that offer, arguing that as the prison hospital had no oncologist it was not adequately equipped to provide him with that treatment (see paragraph 30 above).

The applicant was transferred first to the prison hospital and then to the NCO. The Court notes that the applicant refused to have chemotherapy at the prison hospital. The Court accepts that complex treatment often requires constant supervision by specialist doctors and that having chemotherapy without such supervision can cause harm. However, it cannot overlook the fact that in 2008 a new prison hospital was opened, which according to the CPT was better equipped to provide prisoners with treatment for serious medical problems (see paragraph 46 above; in connection with the standards of treatment available at the prison hospital, see also Goginashvili, cited above, \u00a7 75). Furthermore, the case file shows that the applicant was under regular supervision of an oncologist and a chemotherapist while he was in the prison hospital (see paragraphs 30-32 above; compare also with Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, \u00a7\u00a0151, 22\u00a0December 2008). The relevant authorities explicitly committed to providing the chemotherapy under the supervision of the relevant specialists (see paragraph 33 above). In view of all of the above-mentioned factors, the three-and-a-half month gap in the applicant\u2019s chemotherapy due to his two refusals to have such treatment in the prison hospital cannot as such be attributed to the Government. The relevant authorities undertook very specific measures in order to provide the applicant with the required treatment in the prison hospital. Although the Court understands why the applicant was hesitant, it does not consider, in view of the case material, that the Government were negligent with respect to him or his serious medical condition during that phase of his treatment.",
