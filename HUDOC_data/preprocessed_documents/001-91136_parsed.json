It observes, however, that, in view of the importance of the witnesses\u2019 testimony to the proceedings, the authorities should have made a particular effort to obtain their attendance. The Court accepts that the domestic courts made a certain effort to secure the attendance of Ms M. and Ms K. They sent them summonses to attend the hearing of 27 May 2003, adjourned that hearing when confronted with the witnesses\u2019 failure to appear, and ordered that the police bring them to the courtroom on 17 June 2003. However, as was indicated by the applicant and not disputed by the Government, the police remained passive until the very date of the hearing, when for the first time they visited Ms\u00a0M.\u2019s flat and contacted Ms K. As for Ms M., the police concluded that she had left  merely on the basis of her absence from the address provided during the preliminary investigation and a neighbour\u2019s unverified supposition that she had moved out. No effort was made to establish her whereabouts. While the Court is not unmindful of the difficulties encountered by the authorities in terms of resources, it does not consider that tracking down Ms M. for the purpose of calling her to attend the trial, in which the applicant stood accused of a very serious offence and risked up to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 22 above), would have constituted an insuperable obstacle (see Bonev v. , no.\u00a060018/00, \u00a7\u00a044, 8 June 2006). As for Ms K., her belated notification of the date of the hearing resulted in her unavailability. If she had been apprised of her duty to testify in advance, she could have made arrangements for the care of her child.

Furthermore, as Ms M.\u2019s and Ms\u00a0K.\u2019s statements to the investigator were not recorded on video, neither the applicant nor the judges were able to observe their demeanour under questioning and thus form their own impression of their reliability (see, by contrast, Accardi and Others v.
