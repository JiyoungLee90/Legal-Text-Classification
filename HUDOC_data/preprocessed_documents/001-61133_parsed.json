Further, they stressed that the witnesses, in particular the applicant and his spouse, repeatedly failed to obey the summons, that the disciplinary authorities have no capacity to oblige witnesses to obey their summons under the applicable law and that, due to the fact that the disciplinary authorities are no full-time panels, the fixing of a date for new hearings was a rather difficult issue.
