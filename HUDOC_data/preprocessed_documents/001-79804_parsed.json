It recalls that for an applicant to be able to claim to be the \u201cvictim\u201d of a violation, within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, not only must he have the status of victim at the time the application is introduced, but such status must continue to obtain at all stages of the proceedings. It reiterates that a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a \u201cvictim\u201d unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, \u00a7 36).",

On 5 October 2005 the Presidium of the  quashed that part of the judgment as unlawful, finding that entitlement to compensation for non-pecuniary damage was not conditional on the existence of an official marriage. The claim was remitted for a new examination which ended in an award in the applicant's favour.",

Since the applicant and her late partner had lived and raised children together, she had a legitimate expectation of receiving compensation for non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of his death. In the Court's view, that finding amounted to acknowledgement of the breach of the applicant's Convention rights she complained about. It remains to be seen whether the applicant has been afforded redress for that breach. The Court notes that in the ensuing proceedings the District and  granted the applicant the amount of RUR 200,000 in respect of compensation for non-pecuniary damage, which amount was ten times greater than the original award made by the District Court on 13 March 2002.",
