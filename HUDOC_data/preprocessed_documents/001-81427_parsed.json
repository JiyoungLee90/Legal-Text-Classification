It follows that the State's continued retention of the applicant's vehicle after that date and, in particular after 5\u00a0November 1997 (being the date of the entry into force of the Convention in respect of ), has been unlawful (see, mutatis mutandis, Frizen v. Russia, no.\u00a058254/00, \u00a7\u00a036, 24 March 2005). This unjustified interference was only exacerbated by the excessive length of the civil proceedings the applicant had instituted in order to either recover her car or obtain compensation for it, as well as the failure of the State to return the vehicle even after these proceedings were concluded in her favour. As a result, the applicant has been left for many years in the situation of uncertainty during which she was, and still is, unable to enjoy her possessions (see, mutatis mutandis, Kesyan v. , no.\u00a036496/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a079-80, 19 October 2006).",

The Court recalls that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that an applicant as far as possible is put in the position he or she would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see, for example, Mu\u017eevi\u0107 v. , no.\u00a039299/02, \u00a7\u00a091, 16 November 2006; and Jeli\u010di\u0107 v. , no.\u00a041183/02, \u00a7\u00a053, to be published in ECHR 2006). The Court finds that this principle applies as well in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for example, Reynbakh v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 34-35). It therefore considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the in-court settlement of 11 March 2004 in so far as it relates to the return of the applicant's vehicle.",
