It appears that during the hearing the Katowice Appellate Prosecutor agreed to provide counsel with a copy of his motion for prolongation of the detention. The Court of Appeal granted the prosecution's motion and extended the applicant's detention until 31 January 2004. It noted that the investigation in the present case, which concerned trafficking in substantial amounts of drugs in a number of European countries, had been very time-consuming. It was further complicated by the need to obtain evidence from abroad and to hold a confrontation between the suspects and a certain H.S. who had been recently transferred to Poland from  to serve his sentence. The court noted that another important suspect M.O., who had lived abroad, had been arrested in September 2003. It thus considered that the investigation was being conducted without undue delays, and that the extension of the detention pending the investigation beyond the statutory time-limit was due to the exceptional circumstances. The Court of Appeal also had regard to the scale of the alleged criminal activities and the severity of the anticipated penalty. The applicant appealed against that decision.",

It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider that such an initial risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v.

It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources, including from abroad, and to determine the facts and degree of alleged responsibility of each of the co-suspects, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the applicant's detention during the period necessary to terminate the investigation. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning organised criminal gangs, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-suspects, or otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high.",

In the Szott-Medy\u0144ska decision the Court considered in particular two important limitations of the Polish model of constitutional complaint, namely its scope and the form of redress it provides. Having analysed the above-mentioned limitations of the Polish procedure of constitutional complaint, the Court observed that the constitutional complaint could be recognised as an effective remedy, within the meaning of the Convention, only where: 1) the individual decision, which allegedly violated the Convention, had been adopted in direct application of an unconstitutional provision of national legislation; and 2) procedural regulations applicable to the revision of such type of individual decisions provided for the reopening of the case or the quashing of the final decision in consequence of the judgment of the Constitutional Court in which unconstitutionality had been found. Consequently, the Court found that the exhaustion of the procedure of the constitutional complaint should be required under Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in situations in which both above-mentioned requirements had been met.",

Ts 21/01, regarding admissibility of the constitutional complaint against the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure regulating the grounds for withdrawal of a judge). Subsequently, in the judgment of 17\u00a0February\u00a02004 the  held that a constitutional complaint was allowed in the case of a prosecutor's order regarding supervision of the contacts between a suspect and his lawyer (see, the judgment of 17 February 2004, case no. SK 39/02). Later, in the judgment of 24 July 2006 the Constitutional Court (case no. SK 58/03) ruled that a constitutional complaint could be lodged in the case of exceptional prolongation of detention on remand beyond the statutory 2-year time-limit. Recently, in the judgment of 10 July 2007 (case no. SK 50/06) the Constitutional Court examined on the merits a constitutional complaint against the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure governing the committal of an accused to a psychiatric hospital for observation. The three judgments referred to above indicate that in its current case-law the Constitutional Court has accepted the admissibility of a constitutional complaint against provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure which served as a basis for various auxiliary decisions adopted within the criminal proceedings.",

According to the Court's case-law, it follows from the wording of Article 6 \u2013 and particularly from the autonomous meaning to be given to the notion of \u201ccriminal charge\u201d \u2013 that this provision has some application to pre-trial proceedings (see Imbrioscia v.

It thus follows that, in view of the dramatic impact of deprivation of liberty on the fundamental rights of the person concerned, proceedings conducted under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention should in principle also meet, to the largest extent possible under the circumstances of an ongoing investigation, the basic requirements of a fair trial, such as the right to an adversarial procedure.

In the Government's view, notwithstanding the latter fact, the applicant was given reasons for her continued detention in the relevant court orders and could thus challenge them on appeal. It is true that the Katowice District Court's detention orders gave some details about the facts grounding the suspicion against the applicant. However, the Court has established in its case-law (Lietzow, \u00a7 46; Sch\u00f6ps, \u00a7 50 and Garcia Alva, \u00a7\u00a041, all cited above) that the information provided in this way was only an account of the facts as construed by the court on the basis of all the information made available to it by the prosecutor. Thus, in such circumstances it was hardly possible for an accused to challenge properly the reliability of such an account without being made aware of the evidence on which it is based. The Court considers that it is even less realistic for an accused, such as the applicant in the present case, to contest the lawfulness of her detention on remand without having been served in advance with copies of the prosecution's motions. In the present case the applicant had no opportunity to mount an adequate challenge to the lawfulness of her detention on remand for a period of one year. The Court finds that even if the applicant was represented at the hearings concerning her detention, this possibility was not sufficient to afford her a proper opportunity to comment on the prosecution's motions (see, Osv\u00e1th v. , no.\u00a020723/02, \u00a7\u00a018, 5\u00a0July 2005).",

However, the request was not followed by an immediate action on the part of the authorities as it was only received at the Regional Prosecutor's Office on 16 May 2003 and examined on 27 May 2003. The Court also notes that counsel's request for a copy of the prosecution's motion made on 24 June 2003 was considered by the Katowice Regional Prosecutor to be equivalent to a request for access to the whole file and was subsequently refused. In the Court's view that can be seen as an over-formalistic and disproportionate response on the part of the prosecution authorities which implied that it would not be possible under Article 156 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to grant access to certain documents from the file or a part of the file. The Court recalls in that connection that it is for the authorities to organise their procedure in such a way as to meet the procedural requirements laid down in Article 5 \u00a7 4, since the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are not theoretical or illusory, but practical and effective (Sch\u00f6ps, cited above, \u00a7\u00a047).",

However, this legitimate goal cannot be pursued at the expense of substantial restrictions on the rights of the defence. Therefore, information which is essential for the assessment of the lawfulness of a detention, such as reasons which, in the prosecution's view, justify continued deprivation of liberty, should be made available in an appropriate manner to the suspect's lawyer (Garcia Alva, cited above, \u00a7 42 and Migo\u0144, cited above, \u00a7 80).",
