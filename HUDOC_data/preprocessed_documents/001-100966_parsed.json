Besides dealing with the divorce proceedings themselves, various other issues, such as maintenance claims and injunction proceedings concerning the disposal of property had had to be decided by the Austrian courts. In all these proceedings the mental condition of the defendant A. had been a decisive issue. However, since she had not been receiving regular medical treatment, this was a particularly difficult question for the experts to determine. They had arrived at divergent results, which had made it necessary for them to supplement their reports and to appoint additional experts. In order to obtain these reports as quickly as possible the District Court had made considerable efforts to urge the experts to expedite their reports. The applicant himself had repeatedly asked for the supplementing of expert reports and the appointment of further experts, which had further delayed the proceedings. Another element which had prolonged the proceedings and which could not be blamed on the Austrian courts was the refusal of A's guardian to approve the previous procedural steps at the advanced stage of the proceedings, so that part of the proceedings had to be repeated.",

As regards the conduct of the Austrian courts, the Court observes that on 7 January 2000 the District Court had to declare the previous proceedings null and void because the applicant's opponent, A., lacked legal capacity. This cannot be blamed on the District Court, but even after that the taking of evidence, in particular the obtaining of expert reports on A's legal capacity, proceeded particularly slowly and lasted for another six years and six months. In this respect the Court observes that the District Court made considerable efforts to obtain the expert report of Dr K. which had been commissioned on 18 June 2001. However, these efforts date only from 19 April 2002. Thus it took one year and five months to obtain this report and even then it had to be supplemented, which the expert eventually did on 18 June 2003. As regards the hearing of witnesses, the Court notes that the applicant first made his request for the District Court to hear witnesses on 9 January 2001, and reiterated it on 3 February 2005. The District Court started to hear witnesses on 21 April 2005 and only completed the taking of evidence on 4 July 2006, that is, approximately eight years and ten months after the initial petition for divorce had been filed. It is true that the proceedings at second and third instance were particularly speedy, but this could not make up for the extraordinary length of the proceedings at first instance.",
