However, in determining the duration of the period to be taken into consideration the Court must discount the time between January 1995, when the Sofia City Court gave its first judgment in the case, and December 1996, when the Supreme Court decided to set this judgment aside and reopen the proceedings (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). This is because in lengthofproceedings cases the Court takes into account only periods when the litigation was actually pending before the courts, that is, when there was no effective judgment determining the merits of the dispute and when the courts were under an obligation to pass such a judgment. These do not include periods when a judgment has been in force before being set aside in review proceedings, or periods when the domestic courts decide whether or not to reopen a case (see, among others, Yaroslavtsev v. , no. 42138/02, \u00a7 22, 2 December 2004; Pavlyulynets v. , no. 70767/01, \u00a7 41, 6 September 2005; and Aliu\u0163\u0103 v. , no. 73502/01, \u00a7 16, 11 July 2006).

Indeed, this was a matter on which all levels of court parted opinion (see paragraphs 14, 16, 20, 24 and 26 above). It seems that this confusion was due, on the one hand, to the changes in the State\u2019s administrative structure after 1989, which was an objective factor, and, on the other, to the persistently unclear regulation of the issue which entities were liable for various forms of alleged official misconduct (see paragraph 28 above). In a legal system governed by the rule of law, the identity of the State entities responsible for different sectors of activity and designated to answer civil claims must be transparent and easily accessible (see Dodov v.\u00a0, no. 59548/00, \u00a7 113 in fine, ECHR 2008...).",

For instance, in January 2005 the proceedings before the Sofia Court of Appeals had to be started anew due to a simple procedural mistake which could have been spotted from the outset (see paragraph 23 above). The number of adjournments due to failures to summon defendants is also striking, seeing that all of them were State entities whose addresses should have been readily available to the courts and on whom it should not have been problematic to serve process (see, mutatis mutandis, Dodov, cited above, \u00a7 113 in limine). The responsibility for the late production of expert reports may also be considered to lie with the authorities (see Rachevi, cited above, \u00a7 90, with further references).",

It is also noteworthy that when first examining the applicant\u2019s action, this court gave judgment some nine months after the case had been ready for decision. Finally, the Court observes that the Sofia City Court started examining the case for a second time some eleven months after its first judgment had been set aside by the Supreme Court, and the Sofia Court of Appeals started examining the case about a year after the second judgment of the Sofia City Court (see paragraphs 16, 17, 20 and 22 above).",
