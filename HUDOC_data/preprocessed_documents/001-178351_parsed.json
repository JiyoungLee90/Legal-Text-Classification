The Court notes in this connection that in the case of Roman Zakharov (cited above) it has already found that Russian law does not meet the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirement because the legal provisions governing the interception of communications do not offer adequate and effective guarantees against arbitrariness and the risk of abuse. They are therefore incapable of keeping the \u201cinterference\u201d to what is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0302-04). In the present case, however, the applicant\u2019s complaint was based on a specific and undisputed instance of covert surveillance. Although the Court\u2019s assessment of the \u201cquality of law\u201d necessarily entails some degree of abstraction, it cannot be of the same level of generality as in cases such as Roman Zakharov, which concern general complaints about the law permitting covert surveillance. In such cases the Court must, of necessity and by way of exception to its normal approach, carry out a completely abstract assessment of such law. In cases arising from individual applications, the Court must as a rule focus its attention not on the law as such, but on the manner in which it was applied to the applicant in the particular circumstances (see Goranova-Karaeneva, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

In particular, although Russian law requires that a judge be immediately informed of each instance of urgent interception, his or her power is limited to authorising the extension of the interception measure beyond forty-eight hours.

The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. In determining whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, regard must be had to whether the rights of the defence were respected. It must be examined in particular whether the applicant was given the opportunity of challenging the authenticity of the evidence and of opposing its use. In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a089 and 90, 10 March 2009).",

It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved so according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards the accused as guilty. The principle of the presumption of innocence may be infringed not only by a judge or court but also by other public authorities (see Allenet de Ribemont v.\u00a0France, 10 February 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 36, Series A no. 308). Whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Daktaras v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 42095/98, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000X).",

Having regard to the context in which the statement had been made, the Court considered that the prosecutor had been referring not to the question whether the applicant\u2019s guilt had been established by the evidence \u2013 which was clearly not a question to be determined by the prosecutor \u2013 but to whether the case file had disclosed sufficient evidence of the applicant\u2019s guilt to justify proceeding to trial (see Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45).",
