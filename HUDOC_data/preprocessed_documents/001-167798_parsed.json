They considered it crucial in the present case that the trial judge who had decided on the applicant\u2019s guilt had been able to see and hear the witness S.N. The fact that neither the applicant nor other parties to the proceedings had been unable to see the said witness was of no relevance. It was the judge who was to deliver the judgment in the applicant\u2019s case. The witness\u2019s testimony had been read out in the courtroom and the applicant had an opportunity to put questions to him and to know the witness\u2019s answers and, if necessary, to put additional questions to the witness. There was nothing in the materials in the case file to suggest that the applicant\u2019s defence had been put to any disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the prosecution. Furthermore, S.N.\u2019s testimony had not been either sole or decisive evidence against the applicant. S.N. had not been an eye-witness to the crime. He had learnt about it from witness Ch. The purpose of questioning of S.N. had been to assess Ch.\u2019s statements. During the trial Ch. had recanted his original statement given by him to the police officers. Lastly, the Government argued that there had been strict procedural safeguards in place. The judge assessed evidence in accordance with law and his conscience. It was incumbent on the judge to determine the relevance, admissibility and authenticity of each piece of evidence. The parties to the proceedings could question the anonymous witness and/or to challenge the statements made by such witness. It should be noted that neither the applicant nor his lawyer objected to questioning of anonymous witness S.N. by the trial judge outside the courtroom.

S.N. had been the only witness who testified during the trial alleging the applicant\u2019s guilt. Furthermore, prior to S.N.\u2019s questioning by the police, Ch. had not claimed that the applicant had murdered N. He had only admitted that he had discovered N. and called the ambulance for him. It had been only after S.N. who had made his statement, that Ch. had told the police that the applicant had admitted to having beaten up N. Lastly, the applicant considered that there had been no strong procedural safeguards in place to ensure that his trial had been fair. The trial judge had decided to question S.N. as anonymous witness without obtaining the applicant\u2019s opinion on the issue. The applicant had been unable to observe or to hear S.N. testifying. According to the applicant, such arrangement had not been in compliance with the applicable rules of criminal procedure. He also argued that it had not been necessary for the court to grant anonymity to S.N. It could have been inferred by the parties to the proceedings that it was Kuv. Accordingly, anonymity did not ensure the witness\u2019s safety and security. It had only prevented the applicant\u2019s defence from challenging the veracity of Kuv.\u2019s statement.",

The judge conducted S.N. questioning and was able to observe the witness\u2019s demeanour and to form a clearer impression of his credibility. The applicant had the opportunity to give his own version of the events, had the witnesses testified on his behalf and to cast doubt on the credibility of witness S.N. whose identity had been known to him, and to cross-examine witness Ch. who had given hearsay evidence against the applicant during the criminal investigation and recanted it during the trial.
