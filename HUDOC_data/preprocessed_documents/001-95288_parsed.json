This principle is particularly important in the criminal context, where generally there must be at first instance a tribunal which fully meets the requirements of Article 6 and where an applicant has an entitlement to have his case \u201cheard\u201d, with the opportunity inter alia to give evidence in his own defence, hear the evidence against him and examine and cross-examine the witnesses (see Jussila v.  [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2006...).",

The manner of application of Article 6 to proceedings before courts of appeal depends on the special features of the proceedings involved; account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate court therein. Provided that there has been a public hearing at first instance, the absence of \u201cpublic hearings\u201d before a second or third instance may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue. Thus, leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6, although the appellant was not given an opportunity of being heard in person by the appeal or cassation court (see Ekbatani v. Sweden, 26 May 1988, \u00a7\u00a7 27 and 31, Series\u00a0A no. 134).",
