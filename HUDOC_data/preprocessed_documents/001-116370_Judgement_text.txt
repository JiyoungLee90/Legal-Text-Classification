The case originated in an application (no. 26524/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Dimitar Krastev Krastev (“the applicant”), on 7 July 2004.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev and Ms K. Boncheva, lawyers practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Dimova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that a set of judicial review proceedings in which he had challenged a prosecutor’s decision to forfeit items seized from him had not been fair and did not involve a hearing; that the seizure and the forfeiture of those items had been unlawful and unjustified; and that two sets of criminal charges against him had not been determined within a reasonable time.
On 20 January 2010 the Court (Fifth Section) decided to give the Government notice of the application. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1 of the Convention).
The Government filed their observations on the admissibility and merits of the case on 4 June 2010. The applicant filed his observations in reply and his claim for just satisfaction on 20 September 2010. The Government filed their comments on the applicant’s claim on 4 November 2010.
Following the recomposition of Court’s sections on 1 February 2011, the application was transferred to the Fourth Section.
In a letter dated 1 August 2012 the applicant’s legal representatives informed the Court that the applicant had died on 19 March 2012 and that his widow, Ms Mariana Nedelcheva Krasteva, his son, Krasen Dimitrov Krastev, and his daughter, Ms Ralitsa Dimitrova Krasteva, wished to pursue the application in his stead.
The applicant was born in 1947 and lived in .
At the relevant time the applicant was the head of the criminal police force in one of the districts of . On 15 September 1999 his superior ordered an internal inquiry against him and a search of his office in connection with his alleged failure to note down a complaint concerning a serious offence.
On 24 September 1999 three police officers searched the applicant’s office, including his safe. They made a record of almost all the items found in the safe and seized them, despite the applicant’s protests that some of those items – jewellery and money – were his and his family’s personal belongings which he kept in the safe because he was afraid to leave them at home. The officers refused to give the applicant a copy of the record. It is unclear whether it was presented to him for signature.
On 14 February 2000 a criminal investigation was instituted in respect of the applicant on suspicion of helping offenders to evade justice and abusing his office on numerous occasions between 1997 and 1999. The Government submit, without giving further particulars as to dates, that in the course of the proceedings the authorities interviewed a total of one hundred and fortyfive witnesses; some of them had to be interviewed by delegation and some even abroad, by way of letters rogatory.
On 12 June 2000 the proceedings were stayed because it was found that one witness had gone into hiding and because four other witnesses who were Greek and Turkish nationals had to be interviewed by way of letters rogatory. It appears that by that time, most other witnesses had already given evidence.
In the following months the applicant made two requests for the return of the items seized from the safe. The prosecuting authorities refused, saying that those items had to be retained as real evidence in the case. In November 2000 the applicant enquired why the investigation had been stayed.
The proceedings were resumed on 15 November 2002. They were again stayed between 11 April and 8 May 2003 in order to establish the whereabouts of two witnesses.
On 14 May 2003 the applicant was charged with ordering, on ninetyfour occasions, his subordinates not to note down reports of criminal activity, thus preventing the prosecution of offenders. This had amounted to a breach of his duties and abuse of office. He was interviewed on 28 May and 9 and 16 June 2003.
On 7 July 2003 the investigator in charge of the case decided to split the investigation against the applicant in two: one investigation for abuse of office and another for helping offenders to evade justice.
In the following months, acting within the context of the latter investigation, the investigator interviewed the applicant, his son and wife, an acquaintance of the applicant, the officers who had carried out the search in the applicant’s office, other police officers, and three persons who had previously been victims of offences. His questions concerned, inter alia, the origin of the items found in the safe. The investigator also ordered the  police to interview twentyfour alleged offenders whose offences the applicant was being suspected of having covered up. The investigator in addition organised two confrontations between the applicant and one of the police officers who had carried out the search in his office. On 12 November 2003 the investigator asked two of the persons who had previously been victims of offences whether they could identify any of the items. The first one did not identify any, but the second identified a gold ring, and the same day the investigator handed it over to her. The investigator also obtained two expert reports on the genuineness of a number of bank notes found in the safe, and an expert report on the market value of certain items of jewellery also found in the safe.
On 7 January 2004 the investigator proposed that the investigation be discontinued.
On 11 February 2004 a prosecutor of the Plovdiv Regional Military Prosecutor’s Office agreed with the proposal and discontinued the investigation, citing insufficient evidence. He decided to return to the applicant a pistol, munitions, an air rifle, a baseball bat, binoculars, a gold ring and a pair of earrings in respect of which there existed evidence that they belonged to him and his family. He decided to forfeit 6,360 German marks (DM), 898 United States dollars (USD), 450,000 old Bulgarian levs (BGL) and 700 new Bulgarian levs (BGN), as well as eleven gold rings, two gold necklaces and two gold bracelets, all found in the applicant’s safe, because he found that their origin could not be established. The applicant’s assertion that some of the German marks and the United States dollars were his, acquired as a result of the sale of real property and a car, was not supported by evidence. According to the prosecutor, neither could the applicant prove, by producing documents showing their origin, that DM 1,500 belonged to his son, as claimed by him. The origin of the jewellery was likewise uncertain. The applicant’s assertion that it belonged to his wife had not been made out, because, when interviewed, his wife had failed to describe its characteristic features, and another witness – one of the officers carrying out the search in the applicant’s office – had said that during the search the applicant had conceded that it belonged to victims of crime. On the other hand, several years had passed and the owners of those items had not come forward to claim them. The prosecutor did not cite the provision on which the forfeiture was based.
The applicant sought judicial review of the prosecutor’s decision, arguing that the proceedings should have been discontinued not on account of the lack of sufficient evidence but on account of the lack of any criminal activity. He also argued that the forfeiture was unlawful and unjustified because, in concluding that the forfeited items were not his or his family’s, the prosecutor had disregarded his statements and had given undue weight to the officers’ statements. He asked the court to vary the prosecutor’s decision or order an additional investigation, in which he, his wife and his son could be questioned again in order to describe the jewellery in detail and provide further particulars. His wife’s mother could be interviewed for that purpose as well.
After examining the application in private and on the papers, on 11 March 2004 the  refused to vary the grounds for the discontinuance of the proceedings or to set the forfeiture aside. It summarised in detail the findings of fact made by the prosecutor. It found no substance in the applicant’s assertion that part of the money found in the safe had been acquired as a result of the sale of real property and a car, because the applicant had not produced documents proving such transactions. However, it noted that a witness interviewed during the investigation had said he had bought a car from the applicant, paying him DM 2,000 (one note of DM 500, two notes of DM 200, and the rest in DM 100 notes). That, coupled with the applicant’s assertion that a DM 200 note in the safe came from that transaction, showed that it indeed belonged to the applicant. As for the DM 1,500 alleged to belong to the applicant’s son, the two of them had made diverging statements during the investigation in respect of that money and had failed to produce evidence showing its origin. The same went for the USD 898, and for a gold necklace. As for the rings and the other jewellery, the applicant had stated during the search that he had seized them from offenders. No evidence had been gathered about their origin during the investigation, and the applicant’s wife had failed to describe them in detail.
As a result of the court’s ruling, on 15 March 2004 the same prosecutor of the Plovdiv Regional Military Prosecutor’s Office ordered the DM 200 be returned to the applicant, along with the items which he had already decided not to forfeit.
On 7 July 2003 the applicant was allowed to consult the case file. His ensuing request to the investigator to carry out additional investigative steps was turned down. On 18 September 2003 he appealed to the Military Appellate Prosecutor’s Office, but on 27 October 2003 that Office dismissed the appeal. The applicant’s further appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor’s Office on 27 April 2004.
On 10 June 2004 the Plovdiv Military Prosecutor’s Office indicted the applicant, but on 29 June 2004 the  referred the case back for additional investigation.
On 21 November 2004 the Plovdiv Military Prosecutor’s Office again indicted the applicant, and on 26 November 2004 the judge rapporteur at the Plovdiv Military Courts set the case down for trial.
The trial took place over five days in the end of January and the beginning of February 2005. It appears that the court heard one hundred and fortyone witnesses.
On 18 March 2005 the  found the applicant guilty of abuse of office and sentenced him to eighteen months’ imprisonment, suspended.
The applicant appealed. On 27 December 2005 the Military Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment.
The applicant appealed on points of law. In a judgment of 19 October 2006 (реш. № 742 от 19 октомври 2006 г. по н. д. № 197/2006 г., ВКС, ІІІ н. о.), the Supreme Court of Cassation quashed the court of appeal’s judgment and remitted the case to it.
On 29 December 2006 the Military Court of Appeal partly upheld the applicant’s conviction and partly quashed it in view of the lapse of the statute of limitations in respect of parts of the offence. It also decided to replace the applicant’s criminal liability with an administrative fine of BGN 500. It appears that none of the parties appealed and the judgment became final.
On an unspecified later date the Chief Prosecutor sought reopening of the proceedings. In a judgment of 20 March 2008 (реш. № 131 от 20 март 2008 г. по н. д. № 81/2008 г., ВКС, І н. о.), the Supreme Court of Cassation turned down his request.
At the relevant time searches and seizures of real evidence were governed by Articles 106-07 and 134-37 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1974. Article 135 § 1, as in force until the end of 1999, provided that a search and seizure could be carried out by order of the court or the public prosecutor. In urgent cases the investigating authorities could carry out a search and seizure without prior permission by the prosecutor, but in that case had to inform the prosecutor within twentyfour hours (Article 135 § 2, as worded until the end of 1999).
Article 108 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1974 provided that real evidence had to be retained until the end of the criminal proceedings. It could be returned to its owners earlier if that would not hinder the establishment of the facts (Article 108 § 2). After the end of the proceedings, items retained as real evidence and not forfeited under Article 53 of the Criminal Code 1968 (see paragraph 36 below) could be forfeited if it was impossible to ascertain their owner and they had not been claimed within one year after the end of the proceedings (Article 109 § 1). If a dispute over ownership requiring adjudication by the civil courts arose in respect of items retained as real evidence, they had to be retained until the relevant judgment became final (Article 110). In 2006 the above provisions were superseded by Articles 111 §§ 1 and 2, 112 § 1, and 113 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 2005, which are almost identical. One difference is that Article 111 § 2 of the 2005 Code speaks of the possibility of returning the evidence to “those entitled”, instead of “their owners”, the expression used in Article 108 § 2 of the 1974 Code.
There is no reported caselaw clarifying the manner of application of Article 109 § 1 of the 1974 Code. However, in a final judgment of 9 April 2010 (реш. № 47 от 10 април 2010 г. по в. н. о. х. д. № 38/2010 г. на Хасковски окръжен съд), given under Article 112 § 1 of the 2005 Code, whose wording is identical, the Haskovo Regional Court held that this provision applies only if the ownership of items retained as real evidence is unclear and no one, including the accused, is claiming their return; if no third parties assert rights to the items, they have to be returned to the person from whom they were seized.
There is no reported caselaw clarifying the manner of application of Article 110 of the 1974 Code. However, there is reported case-law under Article 113 of the 2005 Code, whose wording is identical. The courts appear to have applied that provision only in relation to competing claims by private persons to items retained as real evidence (реш. от 31 юли 2009 г. по н. д. № 175/2009 г. на Благоевградски окръжен съд; опр. № 1211 от 25 септември 2009 г. по н. д. № 1213/2009 г. на Великотърновски районен съд, II св). They sometimes insist that such items may be retained by the authorities pending the determination of such claims only if third parties have actually issued civil proceedings against the person seeking the return of the items (опр. № 24 от 7 май 2008 г. по в. ч. н. д. № 108/2008 г. на Великотърновски апелативен съд, НО; опр. № 27 от 21 май 2008 г. по в. ч. н. д. № 126/2008 г. на Великотърновски апелативен съд, НО; опр. от 18 декември 2009 г. по н. д. № 1364/2009 г. на Пернишки районен съд, IV св; опр. № 211 от 30 април 2010 г. по н. д. № 704/2010 г. на Старозагорски районен съд, VI св; опр. № 828 от 7 октомври 2010 г. по н. д. № 1382/2010 г. на Врачански районен съд, VI св; опр. № 68 от 5 януари 2011 г. по н. д. № 2067/2010 г. на Старозагорски районен съд, VIII св; опр. № 621 от 21 септември 2011 г. по н. д. № 1413/2011 г. на Врачански районен съд, VI св; опр. от 6 октомври 2011 г. по н. д. № 244/2011 г. на Разградски окръжен съд; опр. № 737 от 11 октомври 2011 г. по н. д. № 1493/2011 г. на Варненски окръжен съд; опр. от 25 октомври 2011 г. по н. д. № 280/2011 г. на Разградски окръжен съд; реш. № 44 от 26 март 2012 г. по н. д. № 74/2012 г. на Добрички окръжен съд, I св; опр. от 10 април 2012 г. по в. ч. н. д. № 60/2012 г. на Габровски окръжен съд). On other occasions, they rule that it is sufficient for the ownership of the items to be contested in some way between two private persons (опр. № 163 от 10 юни 2009 г. по в. ч. н. д. № 395/2009 г. на Софийски апелативен съд, НО, ІІ св; опр. от 8 март 2010 г. по н. д. № 61/2010 г.

The courts have refused to apply Article 113 in cases where no third party is contesting the rights of the person seeking the return of items retained as real evidence in a criminal case (реш. от 5 ноември 2012 г. по н. д. № 493/2012 г. на Благоевградски окръжен съд).
Article 53 § 1 (a) of the Criminal Code 1968 provides that things intended for or used in committing a wilful offence (instrumentum sceleris) and belonging to the accused are liable to forfeiture. Under point (b) of the same provision, things which have been the object of a wilful offence (objectum sceleris) and which belong to the accused are also liable to forfeiture, but only if this is envisaged by the provisions governing the specific offence. Article 53 § 2 (a) provides that things which have been the object or the instrument of an offence and the ownership of which is prohibited are liable to forfeiture. Under point (b) of the same provision, the proceeds of an offence (productum sceleris), unless subject to restitution, are also liable to forfeiture.
Under Article 237 § 2 of the 1974 Code, when discontinuing criminal proceedings, the public prosecutor had to determine, inter alia, what was to be done with the real evidence in the case. The accused and the victim of the alleged offence were entitled to seek judicial review of the prosecutor’s decision to discontinue the proceedings (Article 237 § 3). The application was examined by the competent firstinstance court in private (Article 237 § 4). Its decision was not subject to appeal (ibid.). In 2006 Article 237 was superseded by Article 243 of the 2005 Code, which is almost identical, but in addition allows the firstinstance court’s decision to be appealed before a higher court.
The Supreme Court of Cassation has held that in proceedings under Article 237 § 3 of the 1974 Code the courts could not take evidence, and had to base their decisions on the evidence gathered during the investigation (реш. № 339 от 7 юни 2002 г. по н. д. № 126/2002 г., ВКС, II н. о.; реш. № 538 от 24 януари 2003 г. по н. д. № 427/2002 г., ВКС, III н. о.).
Section 108 of the Property Act 1951 provides that the owner of an object may claim it from any person who possesses it or holds it without lawful grounds. This action is commonly referred to as rei vindicatio. Under the courts’ caselaw, the claimant in a rei vindicatio action must first prove that he or she has a valid title to the object whose return he or she claims (реш. № 1444 от 19 ноември 2007 г. по гр. д. № 265/2007 г., ВКС, V г. о.; реш. № 1120 от 22 октомври 2008 г. по гр. д. № 4655/ 2007 г., ВКС, II г. о.). Only then does it become relevant whether the defendant has lawful grounds to possess or hold it (реш. № 129 от 22 февруари 2010 г. по гр. д. № 658/2009 г., ВКС, I г. о.). The courts accept that the authorities have legal grounds to hold property seized as real evidence, and have on that basis dismissed claims against them under section 108 (реш. № 261 от 5 декември 2007 г. по в. гр. д. № 403/2007 г., ВтАС, ГК; опр. № 3697 от 25 ноември 2010 г. по ч. гр. д. № 2195/2010 г. Варненски окръжен съд). The former Supreme Court has held that it is not possible to contest a confiscation ordered by a criminal court by way of a claim under section 108 or a claim for judicial declaration (реш. № 1184 от 9 май 1977 г. по гр. д. № 2259/1976 г., ВС, I г. о.).
Section 1 of the Act originally called the State Liability for Damage Caused to Citizens Act 1988, renamed on 12 July 2006 the State and Municipalities Liability for Damage Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”), provides that the State is liable for damage suffered by individuals (and since 1 January 2006 also legal persons) as a result of unlawful decisions, actions or omissions by civil servants, committed in the course of or in connection with administrative action. The Supreme Court of Cassation has held that actions or omissions of the prosecuting authorities in relation to the retention and forfeiture of real evidence in criminal proceedings do not constitute administrative action within the meaning of that provision (реш. № 83 от 23 февруари 2009 г. по гр. д. № 6479/ 2007 г., ВКС, ІІІ г. о.).
Section 2(1) of the Act, as in force until 2009, provided for liability of the investigating or prosecuting authorities or the courts in six situations: unlawful detention; bringing of charges or conviction and sentencing, if the proceedings have later been abandoned or the conviction has been set aside; coercive medical treatment or coercive measures imposed by a court, if its decision has later been quashed as being unlawful; and serving of a sentence over and above its prescribed duration. In 2009 a new point 7 was added to section 2(1), providing that the State is liable for damage which the investigating and prosecuting authorities or the courts have caused to individuals through the unlawful use of special surveillance means. In 2012 a new subsection 2 was added to section 2, providing for liability of the State in respect of damage caused by judicial decisions under a newly enacted proceedsofcrime statute. The Bulgarian courts have consistently held that the liability of the investigating or prosecuting authorities or the courts may be engaged only in respect of the exhaustively listed situations under section 2 (реш. № 617 от 21 ноември 2002 г. по в. гр. д. № 1127/2002 г., ПАС, ГО; тълк. реш. № 3 от 22 април 2005 г. по т. гр. д. № 3/2004 г., ВКС, ОСГК; реш. № 462 от 25 юли 2006 г. по гр. д. № 2220/2003 г., ВКС, III г. о.; опр. № 22 от 5 февруари 2008 г. по адм. д. № 167/2007 г., ВАС, петчл. св; опр. № 6325 от 29 май 2008 г. по адм. д. № 9743/2007 г., ВАС, III о.; реш. № 11 от 2 февруари 2009 г. по гр. д. № 6244/2007 г., ВКС, III г. о.; реш. № 343 от 27 април 2009 г. по гр. д. № 5564/2007 г., ВКС, IV г. о.; реш. № 439 от 26 май 2009 г. по гр. д. № 5229/2007 г., ВКС, III г. о.; опр. № 85 от 3 ноември 2009 г. по адм. д. № 74/2009 г., ВАС, петчл. св; реш. № 775 от 16 ноември 2009 г. по гр. д. № 1053/2008 г., ВКС, III г. о.; реш. № 869 от 24 ноември 2009 г. по ч. гр. д. № 1576/2008 г., ВКС, III г. о.; опр. № 103 от 22 декември 2009 г. по адм. д. № 86/2009 г., ВАС, петчл. св; опр. № 6 от 18 януари 2010 г. по адм. д. № 97/2009 г., ВАС, петчл. св; опр. № 39 от 17 юни 2010 г. по адм. д. № 21/2010 г., ВАС, петчл. св; реш. № 457 от 25 юни 2010 г. по гр. д. № 1506/2009 г., ВКС, IV г. о.).
