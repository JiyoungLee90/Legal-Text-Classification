The applicant conceded that the head injury had been received prior to the arrest. Referring to the fact that the bruise on his chest had not been recorded in his medical record until several days after the arrest, he affirmed that that bruise had been caused by his ill-treatment at the police station. The Court is not persuaded by this argument. It transpires from the applicant's submissions that he complained of pain in the chest within a few hours of his arrest (see paragraph 9 above).

Indeed, even where an appellate court has full jurisdiction to review the case on questions of both fact and law, Article 6 does not always entail a right to be present in person. Regard must be had in assessing this question to, inter alia, the special features of the proceedings involved and the manner in which the defence's interests are presented and protected before the appellate court, particularly in the light of the issues to be decided by it and their importance for the appellant (see Helmers v.

The defendant should be able, inter alia, to explain to his own lawyers his version of events, point out any statements with which he disagrees and make them aware of any facts which should be put forward in his defence (see, for example, Stanford, cited above, p. 11, \u00a7 30; V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a024888/94, \u00a7\u00a7 85, 89, 90, ECHR 1999-IX; and S.C. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 29).

The Court is therefore satisfied that the appeal court was put on clear notice that the applicant had hearing problems. It is also to be noted that the applicant was convicted at the first level of jurisdiction of aggravated murder and sentenced to eighteen years' imprisonment. The applicant's submissions before the appeal court covered both points of fact and points of law. The applicant contested his conviction, sought recharacterisation of the criminal offence relying on the defence of irresistible impulse and pleaded for a reduction in sentence. His personal and full involvement in the appeal proceedings was therefore a matter of crucial importance for him. In such circumstances the appeal court was bound out of fairness to take additional steps, before examining the case, to reassure itself that the applicant's hearing impairment would not prejudice his effective participation in the appeal hearing (compare Cuscani, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038, and Vaudelle v. , no.\u00a035683/97, \u00a7\u00a059, ECHR 2001I). However, the appeal court did not consider taking any steps to ensure that the applicant could follow the proceedings before it. It proceeded with the hearing without requesting a medical opinion as to whether the applicant's impairment allowed him to hear the proceedings or considering the possibility of making arrangements for the provision of a hearing aid.",

The present case is therefore different from the cases of Roos, Stanford and Liebreich (cited above in paragraphs 52 to 54) where the fact that the applicants were assisted by counsel whom they could freely consult during the proceedings led the Court to find no violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c). It is true that the appeal court could not be held responsible for the omission of the applicant's lawyers, who had been properly notified of the date and time of the appeal hearing. However, the ultimate guardian of the fairness of the proceedings was the judge, who, when confronted with the lawyers' failure to appear, was required under domestic law to appoint counsel for an accused who was incapable of defending himself on account of a physical impairment (see paragraph 32 above). The Court reiterates that under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention the accused is entitled to have a lawyer assigned by the court of its own motion \u201cwhen the interests of justice so require\u201d (see Vaudelle, cited above, \u00a7\u00a059, and Padalov v. , no.\u00a054784/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054 and 55, 10 August 2006). Given that the applicant's hearing impairment undermined his ability to participate effectively in the proceedings, the interests of justice demanded that in order to receive a fair hearing the applicant should have had the benefit of legal representation during the proceedings before the appeal court.",
