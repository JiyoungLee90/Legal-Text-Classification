They also complained that the actual investigation had commenced only a significant period after the operation, that this had determined its potential and influenced its outcome, that the investigator\u2019s assessment of the evidence had in general been one-sided in favour of the official version, that his findings had been arbitrary, that he had failed adequately to examine the potential racist aspect of the case and that he had failed to investigate property the necessity and proportionality of the use of the coercive measures during the operation.",

Proceedings that can only result in the award of compensation to be paid by the State, but not in the punishment of those responsible for the ill-treatment, cannot be considered as satisfying the procedural requirement of Article 3 in cases of wilful ill-treatment of persons who are within the control of agents of the State (see, for example, Kummer v. the Czech Republic, no. 32133/11, \u00a7 47, 25 July 2013, with further references, and Mocanu and Others v.

It prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the victim\u2019s conduct (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV). In respect of a person who is deprived of his or her liberty, or, more generally, is confronted with law\u2011enforcement officers, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7\u00a7 100-1, 28\u00a0September 2015). In respect of recourse to physical force during an\u00a0arrest, Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force for effecting a lawful arrest. However, such force may be used only if indispensable and must not be excessive (see Ivan Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, \u00a7 63, 12 April 2007). The burden to prove that this was the case rests on the Government (see Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2000\u2011XII, and Boris Kostadinov v. Bulgaria, no. 61701/11, \u00a7 53, 21 January 2016). One of the criteria informing the characterisation of a treatment under Article 3 is the severity of the treatment. Even in the absence of actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering, where treatment humiliates or debases an individual, showing a lack of respect for or diminishing his or her human dignity, or arouses feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking an individual\u2019s moral and physical resistance, it may be characterised as degrading and also fall within the prohibition set forth in Article 3. It should also be pointed out that it may well suffice that the victim is humiliated in his or her own eyes, even if not in the eyes of others. Indeed, it has previously been established that, although a person does not undergo serious physical or mental suffering, an assault on his or her dignity and physical integrity may constitute degrading treatment (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 87, 90 and 112).",

These elements are interrelated and each of them, taken separately, does not amount to an end in itself, as is the case in respect of the independence requirement of Article\u00a06. They are criteria which, taken jointly, enable the degree of effectiveness of the investigation to be assessed. It is in relation to this purpose of an effective investigation that any issues, including that of independence, must be assessed (see Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a024014/05, \u00a7 225, 14 April 2015).",

It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism and racist violence, thereby reinforcing democracy\u2019s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a\u00a0source of enrichment (see Stoica v. Romania, no. 42722/02, \u00a7 117, 4 March 2008, with further references).",

Treating racially induced violence and brutality on an equal footing with cases that have no racist overtones would be to turn a blind eye to the specific nature of acts which are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention. Admittedly, proving racial motivation will often be extremely difficult in practice. The respondent State\u2019s obligation to investigate possible racist overtones to a violent act is an obligation to use best endeavours and not absolute. However the authorities must do what is reasonable, given the circumstances of the case, in particular to collect and secure the evidence, explore all practical means of discovering the truth and deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of racially induced violence (see, for example, Lakato\u0161ov\u00e1 and Lakato\u0161 v.

In particular, in so far as such matters primarily fell within the jurisdiction of any other authority, the Constitutional Court limited its jurisdiction to reviewing how that authority had handled those matters. That review had therefore been practically confined to checking compliance with the requirements of due process before the authority of final instance last-involved in the matter.
