The case originated in an application (no. 13371/06) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mrs Svetlana Ivanovna Komarova (“the applicant”), on 22 March 2006.

The applicant alleged, in particular, that her pre-trial detention had been lengthy, that she had been detained in inhuman conditions and that she had not been provided with adequate medical care.

The applicant is a lawyer. On 1 April 2004 criminal proceedings were instituted against her for allegedly attempting to bribe a judge and for fraud. On the same day the applicant was arrested.

There was also a possibility that she could hinder the investigation, put pressure on witnesses and destroy documentary evidence. The applicant already had a criminal record (it appears from the material in the case file that in 2000 she was charged on several counts of fraud but was pardoned in an amnesty). The applicant did not appear to have a permanent place of residence as she had provided three different home addresses and also did not have a permanent office. She did not have children of minor age and her state of health was considered to be compatible with detention.

The Babushkinskiy District Court of Dnipropetrovsk (“the ”) ordered the applicant to remain in custody until 9 April 2004 as there was not enough evidence to make a formal decision on her pre-trial detention. The investigating authorities had to examine the case put forward by the applicant, look for further evidence of her having committed the crimes and conduct an assessment of her personality.
On 9 April 2004 the  ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention. The court held that since the applicant had been accused of a serious crime, had given several different addresses and was also registered as a resident in Kyiv, there was a possibility that, if not detained, she could continue her criminal activities, hinder the investigation and abscond.
On 21 May 2004 the  further extended the applicant’s detention until 1 August 2004 on the same grounds as before. On 27 May 2004 the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court of Appeal quashed that decision, extending the applicant’s detention until 1 July 2004.

A submission from the applicant’s lawyer that the applicant was suffering from numerous illnesses and should therefore be released was not addressed. On 30 August 2007 the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld that decision.
On 10 October 2007 the case was again submitted to the first-instance court.
On 31 October 2007 the  sent the case back to the prosecutor to rectify various procedural errors. The court extended the applicant’s detention holding that her state of health did not render her unfit for detention and that there were “no grounds to believe that the applicant’s detention was no longer necessary”.

On 18 January 2008 the same court again sent the case back to the prosecutor for further investigation.
