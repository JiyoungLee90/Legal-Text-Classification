The Court further observes that the applicants could not be deemed responsible for the delays encountered in the handling of their case. It points out that the  gave judgment more than five and a half years after the case was brought before it and that the Government did not supply any convincing explanation for this delay, which seems manifestly excessive. In that connection, the Court recalls that, according to its constant case-law, a chronic backlog of cases in a court\u2019s list is not a valid explanation (Boca v.
