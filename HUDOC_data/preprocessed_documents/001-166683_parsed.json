Poland, no. 11562/05, \u00a7\u00a0104, 27 June 2006; Dodov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a059548/00, \u00a7\u00a083, 17 January 2008; Anna Todorova v.

While the preliminary investigation stage appears to have been conducted with sufficient promptness, the Court notes that the subsequent court proceedings were marked by delays, which effectively caused the discontinuation of the proceedings approximately eight years after their commencement, as the prosecution of the offence in question had become time-barred in the meantime. The Court notes in this regard that according to the information in the case file, the Ankara Assize Court appears to have collected all the necessary evidence by 9 July 2004, but did not deliver its initial judgment until 29\u00a0April\u00a02005 (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). The Court further notes that the Ankara Assize Court\u2019s judgments were quashed twice by the Court of Cassation and sent back for review, and once by the public prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Court of Cassation on simple procedural grounds, and on none of those occasions did the Court of Cassation or the public prosecutor act with reasonable promptness in delivering their decisions.
