On 19 July the Novgorod City Court, Novgorod Region, awarded 45,000 roubles (RUB) to D. in respect of non-pecuniary damage resulting from the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to ensure proper conditions during his pre-trial detention.

On 26 March 2007 the Tsentralniy District Court of Kaliningrad found that the correctional colonies where R. had been serving a prison sentence had failed to provide him with adequate medical assistance and awarded him RUB\u00a0300,000.

Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention, the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v.

All those factors can justify a relatively long period of detention. However, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure (see Osuch v. Poland, no. 31246/02, \u00a7\u00a026, 14\u00a0November 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-38, 4\u00a0May 2006). The fact that a person is charged with criminal conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of detention; his personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account. There is no indication in the present case that the domestic courts in any way checked whether the applicant had indeed attempted to intimidate witnesses or to obstruct the course of justice in any other way. In such circumstances the Court has difficulty accepting the argument that there was a risk of interference with the administration of justice. Furthermore, such a risk was bound to decrease gradually as the trial proceeded and the witnesses were interviewed (compare Miszkurka v.\u00a0Poland, no. 39437/03, \u00a7 51, 4\u00a0May 2006). The Court is not therefore persuaded that, throughout the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention, compelling reasons existed for fearing that he might interfere with witnesses or otherwise hamper the examination of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh the applicant\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

In the present case the domestic authorities gave no reasons why they considered the risk of the applicant absconding to be decisive. The Government submitted that the applicant had absconded from the investigating authorities in 1997 and had subsequently been in hiding for two years. However, it is not the Court\u2019s task to take the place of the national authorities who ruled on the applicant\u2019s detention and to substitute its own analysis of the facts, arguing for or against detention (see Nikolov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a038884/97, \u00a7 74, 30 January 2003, and Labita, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0152).
