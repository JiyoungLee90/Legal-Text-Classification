The Court observes that the applicant's allegations, that the medical assistance he received while in detention was inadequate, lack substantiation. In particular, judging on the basis of the applicant's medical data available from the case file, the Court notes that he did not have serious health problems and that his state of health was generally satisfactory during his detention. The Court further notes that the applicant was successfully treated in respect of the minor health problems he had in SeptemberOctober 2005 and August 2006. While it might have been preferable for the applicant to be examined by a doctor during his detention in the ITT, the lack of such an examination does not raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention in the present circumstances, in particular given the fact that the applicant was seen by doctors upon his arrival in the SIZO, who concluded that he was healthy. There is nothing in the case to suggest that the applicant's examination in the SIZO was inadequate or that he required additional examination. As to the fact that the applicant was detained in the same building as prisoners suffering from tuberculosis, this is not sufficient for the Court to conclude that the applicant's health was in danger.",
