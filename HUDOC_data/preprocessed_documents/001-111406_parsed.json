They further averred that at the material time only State agents could wear uniforms, carry weapons and park their vehicles unhindered at roadblocks. Moreover, the abductors had left their vehicle at the dugout where two Russian servicemen had been stationed.

The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. This investigation should be independent, accessible to the victim\u2019s family, and carried out with reasonable promptness and expedition. It should also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether or not the force used in such cases was lawful and justified in the circumstances, and should afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results (see Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, \u00a7\u00a7 105-9, 4 May 2001, and Douglas-Williams v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a056413/00, 8 January 2002).",

In the absence of an explanation, it considers that this delay cannot be considered acceptable. Moreover, owing to the Government\u2019s refusal to submit any documents from the case file, the Court is precluded from assessing not only what specific measures aimed at establishing Mr R.D.\u2019s whereabouts were taken by the authorities and whether they were sufficient, but whether they were taken at all.",

Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that any attempts were made to identify and interview the servicemen who had manned the Shatoy roadblock and those who had been stationed at the dugout where the abductors had left the applicants\u2019 vehicle. It is also striking that the investigators did not consider it necessary to examine the applicants\u2019 vehicle with a view to looking for, for example, the abductors\u2019 fingerprints, particularly given the applicant\u2019s submission that one of them had been driving the car.

Moreover, owing to the time which has elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative measures that ought to have been taken much earlier can no longer be usefully carried out.

In respect of the complaints to higher-ranking prosecutors the Court also reiterates that it has consistently refused to consider that extraordinary remedy as a remedy to be exhausted by applicants in order to comply with the requirements of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Trubnikov v.\u00a0 (dec.), no. 9790/99, 14 October 2003; Belevitskiy v.
