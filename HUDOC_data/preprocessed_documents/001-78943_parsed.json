The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these various conditions are satisfied. The case-law of the Court and the former Commission clearly shows that the objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies must be rejected when the respondent Government are unable to cite a single precedent establishing the effectiveness of the remedy which exists in theory in domestic law.",

She appealed on this ground in spite of the fact that the case-law of the Employment and Welfare Division of the Court of Cassation established that the procedure before the CNITAAT did not violate the rights of the defence (paragraph 20 of the judgment).",

So, in basing itself on the fact that she had what she considered to be an effective means to remedy the violations of the Convention she wished to complain of, and considering that she should have raised all her complaints in respect of the proceedings before the CNITAAT in her appeal to the domestic court, the Court is suggesting that the applicant should have anticipated the departure from case-law that came about in 1998 and in December 2000. In so doing the Court has adopted a subjective approach to the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies, an approach that could give rise to uncertainty of the law, whereas the viewpoint of an applicant alone cannot be decisive in determining whether a remedy is objectively ineffectual, theoretical or illusory.",

Had the applicant included the other complaints in her further pleadings filed on 23\u00a0October\u00a01998, the Court of Cassation might have accepted them. After all, it did depart from its case-law in its judgment of 17\u00a0December 1998, limited though it was to the question of the lack of independence and impartiality of the disability claims tribunals (paragraph 21 of the judgment), and in its five judgments of 22\u00a0December 2000 (paragraph 24 of the judgment).",
