However, since the legislator decided to replicate in section 31\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 the same conditions justifying refusal as stipulated in section 30 \u00a7 2 then the former provision could not be interpreted without taking into account these conditions.

It is important to underline that the procedure referred to above should enable an interested party to have access to all relevant and appropriate information which would allow that party to effectively counter any allegations of his or her collaboration with the security services (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of lustration proceedings, Matyjek v.

The Institute\u2019s authorities refused her access to three documents pursuant to section 31 \u00a7 1(2a) of the Institute Act on the ground that their content indicated that the applicant had been considered a secret informant or assistant in the covert gathering of information. The President of the Institute dismissed the applicant\u2019s argument that his negative decision was based on section 31 \u00a7 1(2a) whose content was identical to section 30\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02(2) of the Institute Act and which was struck down by the . The Court is struck by this approach of the President of the Institute. It notes in this respect the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 28 May 2008, given a few months before the impugned decision, clearly indicating that section 31 \u00a7 1(2) of the Institute Act, containing the same legal norm as the one set out in the unconstitutional section 30 \u00a7 2(2), and being only of a procedural character, could not justify refusal of access. It appears that those clear indications of the  were ignored in the practice of the Institute\u2019s authorities.",

This was true and symptomatic of the lack of a suitable remedy to address this very particular violation of the right to privacy.
