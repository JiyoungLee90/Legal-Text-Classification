He noted that when Mr Carabulea had arrived at the Ministry of Interior Polyclinic, he was in serious ill-health and had been vomiting blood and that by the time he was transferred to St John's Hospital, at 8 p.m., he was in a generalised life-threatening condition requiring admission to the intensive care unit with the intention of addressing, immediately, the problem of saving his life. Life-saving measures having been taken, Mr Carabulea was then transferred to  on 17 April with a diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism. A computerised tomography performed there disclosed a lesion on the surface of the liver, while an ultrasound examination revealed some emboli in the small peripheral arteries of the lung. As a result of these findings, the doctors had been faced with the following dilemma: if the medical treatment required to limit the normal clotting mechanism of the blood (the emboli) was to be administered, then this ran the risk of exacerbating the liver haemorrhage which, as a consequence, might in itself have become life-threatening. Therefore, the doctors had administered the anti-coagulant with caution in order to prevent further haemorrhage around the liver. On 24 April Mr Carabulea had developed a second severe episode of pulmonary thromboembolism for which he had received emergency treatment and had been successfully resuscitated. His recovery was slow and the physicians had planned a phlebography but before this investigation could be performed, Mr Carabulea suffered a third episode of pulmonary thromboembolism and died at 7.25 a.m. on 3 May.",

It did not meet \u201cnormally accepted standards within Europe\u201d; it originated from an institute belonging to the Romanian State; it should have been produced expeditiously; it lacked thoroughness and was too brief; it contained a number of serious omissions, such as the failure to document the state of the veins in the legs, the presence or absence of thrombus within them and the failure to give an account of the weight of a number of organs.

Having regard to the low probability (1 in 50,000) of a patient of Mr Carabulea's age developing a fatal pulmonary thromboembolism, even after a minor uncomplicated surgery, the development of such an embolism required a very thorough clinical analysis of many laboratory tests and other data.

In the first place, he noted the change of diagnosis from respiratory (pulmonary) viral infection, made at Jilava Hospital, to \u201cupper gastrointestinal haemorrhage\u201d, made at St John's Hospital, and later to pulmonary thromboembolism, although no explanation had been provided for such changes. Furthermore, the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism which had been made at St John's Hospital, at Fundeni Hospital and later referred to in the autopsy report contained no explanation of how this diagnosis had been reached since no blood clot (embolus) was ever mentioned as having been found. He also noted that it was not until 23 April that Heparin, \u201cthe immediate cornerstone treatment for pulmonary thromboembolism\u201d, was administered, despite the fact that the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism had been made one week earlier. As to the \u201cthrombophlebitis of the lower limbs\u201d mentioned as one of the causes of death in the Notice issued by Fundeni Hospital on 3 May 1996, Dr Szentmariay stated that \u201cthrombophlebitis of the lower limbs\u201d was not a deadly disease and would not \u201cat all\u201d predispose a patient to thromboembolism. He found no numerical data available to quantify the severity of the pulmonary hypertension mentioned in the said Notice and he expressed the view that the \u201cthoracic and abdominal trauma caused by the car crash\u201d was an insufficient explanation of cause of death since no specific diagnosis had been made and there was no indication of any organs having been affected or of the kind of injuries that were allegedly sustained in the accident.",

Since such diagnosis \u201calways raises the strong possibility of blunt abdominal trauma in the near past\u201d Dr Szentmariay was astonished that no other reference or observation was made in respect of this diagnosis. In his view, such a diagnosis would normally be followed very carefully \u201cbecause of the potential of sudden blood loss, hepatic rupture and many other potentially life-threatening complications\u201d. He pointed out that the scrotal lesion which could be seen on the pictures taken by the family was not described in the autopsy report although this should have formed part of the external body description. He further found the description in the autopsy report of the fracture of the ribs to be deficient since it provided no information as to the age of the fracture or as to whether it was on the right or left side, both of these elements being important in determining the causal mechanism of the rib fracture (resuscitation procedures or otherwise).",

He deplored the fact that photographs had not been taken post mortem, which would have been very helpful in determining whether there were bruises on the corpse or simply post mortem lividity, and he expressed the opinion that the pre-existing diseases of the victim described in the autopsy reports had probably not been of any importance concerning the death.

Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see, among many other authorities, Anguelova v. , no.\u00a038361/97, \u00a7\u00a7 109-11, ECHR 2002IV).",

It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. The Court has previously had before it cases in which it has found that there has been treatment which could only be described as torture (see Aksoy v.

The applicant claims that his brother's Roma ethnicity was a factor in the ill-treatment and death and that the failure to open an investigation in respect of the police officers responsible for his death was inconsistent with the requirement of non-discrimination as set forth in Article\u00a014 taken together with Articles 2 and 3.",

Taken alone, that should have triggered an obligation on the part of the authorities to open an investigation in respect of the police officers responsible for the death of this young Roma. Additionally, we are mindful of the difficulties which the applicant faces in proving that discrimination based on his brother's ethnicity was a factor in the events that transpired. Consequently, we consider that where a state is the subject of persistent criticism from international quarters for the manner in which it treats an ethnic minority, justice may require that the burden shifts to such a state to show that discrimination formed no part of the events in respect of which complaints are made. In other words, as part of its overall obligation to respond to and investigate claims of discrimination against Roma in custody, the Romanian state ought to be in a position to answer the applicant's allegations by reference to relevant and reliable information which shows that members of the Roma community who enter police custody are treated no differently than other members of Romanian society. Their failure to discharge that burden in this case gives rise, in our view, to an issue under Article 14 in conjunction with Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention.",

In its subsequent reports of 2001 and 2005 the ECRI noted that serious problems persisted throughout the country as regards police attitudes and behaviour towards members of the Roma community. More specifically, it deplored that cases of police violence against members of the Roma community continued to occur and had led to serious and sometimes lethal injuries and it advocated an independent and investigative mechanism to inquire into police abuses.

Indeed, we note that in Cobzaru (cited above, \u00a7 98) the failure on the part of the prosecutors to verify whether the policemen who inflicted violence had been involved in previous similar incidents or whether they had been accused previously of displaying anti-Roma sentiment together with the state's failure to advance any justification for this omission was an important factor to which the Court had regard in finding a violation of Article 14.

In the normal course of events it is incumbent upon the one who alleges to prove. However, the Court has previously recognised that Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (see Akta\u015f v. Turkey (extracts), no. 24351/94, \u00a7 272, ECHR 2003V). Where fundamental human rights are at issue the Court has not hesitated to develop its evidentiary law in order to assist it in its search for truth, establishing, where necessary, a shift in the burden of proof from the applicant onto the Government (see Tomasi v. France, 27 August 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 108-111, Series A no. 241A). In our view, such a shift is appropriate in the circumstances of this case precisely because it is the authorities and not the applicant who can access the relevant information which could verify or rebut the applicant's allegations that discrimination base on his brother's Roma ethnicity played a part in the treatment to which he was subjected whilst in police custody. Information concerning complaints about the ill-treatment and/or death of persons in custody, and, in particular, of Roma in custody, is wholly or substantially within the knowledge and control of the Romanian authorities.",

However, in more recent cases on the question of discrimination the Court has relied extensively on statistics produced by the parties to establish a difference in treatment between two groups (men and women) in similar situations (see Hoogendijk v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 58461/00, 6 January 2005 and Zarb Adami v.

Furthermore, it is in contradiction of the Romanian authorities' undertaking to provide adequate means of legal protection in cases of direct or indirect discrimination and to allow such discrimination to be established by any means, including, on the basis of statistical evidence. In this regard we are mindful of what the European Commission on the Situation of Roma has described as \u201ca significant misconception among researchers, as well as policy makers and government officials, to the effect that collecting data on Roma, and other ethnic minorities, violates data protection laws and would therefore not be legal\u201d.

Thus the principle reads: \u201c... [W]hen investigating violent incidents and, in particular, deaths at the hands of State agents, State authorities have the additional duty to take all reasonable steps to unmask any racist motive and to establish whether or not ethnic hatred or prejudice may have played a role in the events. Failing to do so and treating racially induced violence and brutality on an equal footing with cases that have no racist overtones would be to turn a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention. Admittedly, proving racial motivation will often be extremely difficult in practice. The respondent State's obligation to investigate possible racist overtones to a violent act is an obligation to use best endeavours and not absolute\u201d (see Nachova and Others v.

The circumstances in which the young and healthy 27-year-old man died at the hands of State authorities, as established by the Court (see paragraphs 111-125), are particularly grave. In the circumstances of the Nachova case, the Grand Chamber noted at least two reasons for the obligation to investigate possible racist motives to arise: the alleged racist language and the highly disproportionate use of force. It is true that in the case at hand there is no information about any racist language used by the police officers. It is, however, so obvious that the force used and the absolute lack of investigation into an evidently suspicious death were absolutely disproportionate to the circumstances of the case involving a young Roma man who had allegedly committed a robbery.",

I also note that the case file contains a response by the Romanian Government to the Court's specific questions on statistical data in which the Government could not provide any such data concerning investigations into violence by police officers against persons of Roma origin. The Government argued that to collect such information would be against the laws on data protection.
