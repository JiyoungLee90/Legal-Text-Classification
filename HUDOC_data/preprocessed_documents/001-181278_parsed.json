It considered that the requisition order had been issued for the property to be enjoyed by a private entity and therefore the measure had not been in the public interest. In this connection, it referred to a judgment of 30 December 1993 by the Court of Appeal concerning what it considered to be the same property (see above). Moreover, the measure had not been proportionate. The rent had been derisory, causing the applicant to suffer a disproportionate and excessive burden. She had therefore suffered a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. According to the court, the applicant had also suffered a violation of Article 14, as only her property had been requisitioned for the use of the band club. In determining the amount of compensation, the court did not take into account the fact that the applicant or her ancestors had received rent, given that the amount was derisory. Bearing in mind the values established by the applicant\u2019s expert as to the rental value and sale value of the property, which was MTL 180,000 (approximately EUR\u00a0420,000) (pg.12 of the judgment), as well as the length of time the requisition was and remained in place, the court awarded the applicant EUR\u00a060,000 in compensation (kumpens) for the requisition of the premises and the violations found, noting it was not awarding civil damages (danni \u010bivili) in this context. Three quarters of the amount was to be paid by the Director of Social Housing and one quarter by the band club.

It considered that the band club had benefited from the situation and had never attempted to fix it, despite the fact that it had not been recognised as a tenant. In relation to the amount of compensation, it considered that the disproportionality of the measure had not persisted since the start of the requisition in 1955, but had started to be so only after the 1980s. Furthermore, the applicant had received the rent paid by the department and had only instituted constitutional proceedings in 2007 (while never contesting the validity of the requisition), thus it was legitimate and in line with local case-law to reduce her compensation. It also held that the property had been taken in the public interest and therefore the compensation needed not reflect market values. It followed that the compensation had to be reduced, however, given that the property was not to be vacated, it was appropriate to retain the amount awarded by the firstinstance court. Lastly, the court held that the claim for damages for the depreciation of the property as a result of structural works did not fall within the ambit of a constitutional complaint, and it was thus not its place to award such damages.",

It had also taken into account the fact that the applicant had been receiving rent and that the requisition had been lawful and in the public interest. Thus, the domestic court had given attention to various factors and had finally been satisfied that the situation had called for less than compensation at market value. In the Government\u2019s view, in the present case there was no call for restitution in integrum. They noted that it appeared from the documents submitted that as from mid-2008 the applicant started to receive a higher rent per annum (EUR 185, which would increase every three years), in line with the amendments made to the law, in particular Article 1531C of the Civil Code (see Relevant domestic law above), which applies to the present case given that the tenement originally consisted of a residence. Furthermore, provisions for a yearly increase in the rent of clubs and for the owner\u2019s right to a share in the annual income received from a commercial activity carried out in clubs, were also put in place in 2015 by means of the Conditions Regulating the Leases of Club Regulations (see Relevant domestic law above).",

It was also comparable to awards made by the Court in similar circumstances which, when including non-pecuniary damage, amounted to, for example, EUR\u00a01,168 and 1,400 annually respectively, in Edwards v.

In this connection, she referred to the case of Chinnici v. Italy (no. 2) (no.\u00a022432/03, \u00a7\u00a040 et\u00a0sequi, 14\u00a0April 2015).

In this connection, the applicant relied on Azzopardi v.\u00a0Malta (no. 28177/12, 6 November 2014), Schembri and Others v.\u00a0Malta (no. 42583/06, 10 November 2009) and Frendo Randon and Others v.\u00a0Malta (no. 2226/10, 22 November 2011).",

Whether the redress given is effective will depend, among other things, on the nature of the right alleged to have been breached, the reasons given for the decision and the persistence of the unfavourable consequences for the person concerned after that decision (see, for example, Freimanis and L\u012bdums v.\u00a0Latvia, nos. 73443/01 and 74860/01, \u00a7 68, 9 February 2006).

The Government\u2019s calculations (see paragraph 43 above) also assume that the entire amount awarded was in respect of pecuniary damage. It follows that, if that award solely covered pecuniary damage, the applicant is still a victim of the said violation which has not been redressed, given the absence of any redress in the form of an award for nonpecuniary damage.",

This is so even in the light of the Government\u2019s own valuations which are in themselves much lower than those submitted by the applicant. Indeed, according to the Government\u2019s submitted valuations (although it is unclear whether the report they relied on is indeed in respect of the property at issue), in 2015 the property had an annual rent of approximately EUR 12,500. Thus, all considerations relevant to the present case having been made, the sum awarded cannot be said to cover pecuniary damage suffered over several years, let alone also non-pecuniary damage.",

The Court observes that the parties are in disagreement as to the applicability of the 2010 amendments to the present case, and it is not for the Court to determine such an issue, which was not even delved into by the constitutional courts. It suffices for the Court to note that even assuming those amendments were applicable (see paragraph\u00a060 below), they only slightly improved the applicant\u2019s situation, in so far as they still represented rents of less than 2% of the current market value (for example, taking as a comparator the Government\u2019s valuations, in 2015 the annual market value of the property was EUR 12,500 while, according to the amendments, the applicant would receive less than EUR\u00a0200 annually in that same year). While it is true that the Conditions Regulating the Leases of Club Regulations enacted only recently may have, since 2016, further improved the situation, this legislation has had no effect on the applicant in the four years after the Constitutional Court judgment; it is thus not for the Court to make any considerations in that respect.",

Nevertheless, that discretion, however considerable, is not unlimited and its exercise cannot entail consequences at variance with the Convention standards (see Fleri Soler and Camilleri v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a035349/05, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR\u00a02006X). However, these principles do not necessarily apply in the same manner where, as in the present case, the requisition of property belonging to private individuals is not aimed at securing the social welfare of tenants or preventing homelessness (ibid. \u00a7\u00a077). In the Court\u2019s view, in cases such as the present one the effects of the rent-control measures are subject to closer scrutiny at the European level (ibid., in connection with property requisitioned for use as government offices). Furthermore, the use of property for reasons other than to secure the social welfare of tenants and prevent homelessness has an impact on the compensation due to the owner (see Fleri Soler and Camilleri v.\u00a0Malta (just satisfaction), no. 35349/05, \u00a7\u00a018, 17 July 2008).",
