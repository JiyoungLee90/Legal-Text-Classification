This investigation should be independent, accessible to the victim\u2019s family, carried out with reasonable promptness and expedition, effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances or otherwise unlawful, and afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results (see Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a024746/94, \u00a7\u00a7 105-09, ECHR 2001III (extracts), and Douglas-Williams v. the  (dec.), no.\u00a056413/00, 8\u00a0January 2002).",

It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities\u2019 conduct (see Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, \u00a7\u00a0358, 18 June 2002).",
