The Court finds it peculiar that the Government preferred to submit the extracts for certain dates only. It reiterates the Government\u2019s argument that the number of detainees fluctuated and that they only indicated the average occupancy rate for each cell. The Court observes that the Government did not refer to any source of information on the basis of which they had made the assertion on the average numbers of inmates in the cells and did not submit any documents on the basis of which that assertion could be verified. The directors\u2019 certificates and extracts from the logs are therefore of little evidential value for the Court.

The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v.

They relied on certificates from the facility director and written statements by warders issued in June 2006 (see paragraph 26 above). These certificates cannot constitute evidential material for the Court because they did not refer to any sources of information, such as registration logs, on the basis of which those assertions could be verified. The Court reiterates the Government\u2019s submission that the registration logs were destroyed in June 2006, that is at the same time the facility director drew up his certificates and the warders made their statements.
