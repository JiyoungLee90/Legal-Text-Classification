At the same time, the Court observes that the investigators\u2019 three decisions to close the proceedings were quashed by the supervising authorities after finding that such decisions were unfounded and further investigation measures were required. The repetition of such remittal orders discloses a serious deficiency in the criminal investigation (see Oleynikova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081). In particular, the last remittal of the case for further investigation was followed by instructions from the supervising prosecutor\u2019s office, which provided a substantive list of investigative measures that had to be undertaken. Apart from the remittal orders, it appears that on several other occasions the authorities conceded that the investigation had been inadequate (see paragraphs 15, 16 and 23 above). Having examined the available material, the Court considers that the investigative authorities did not take all the necessary steps in order to carry out a thorough investigation which would be compatible with the Convention requirements.",

In this regard, the Court reiterates that the effectiveness of an investigation implies a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition. Even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in, or tolerance of, unlawful acts (see \u0160ilih, cited above, \u00a7 195).
