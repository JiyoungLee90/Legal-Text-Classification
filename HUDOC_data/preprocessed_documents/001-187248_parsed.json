The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see Ruiz Torija v. Spain and Hiro\u00a0Balani v. Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 29, Series A nos. 303-A and 303-B; Higgins and Others v.

Although Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 obliges courts to give reasons for their decisions, it cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument of the parties involved (see Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands, 19\u00a0April 1994, \u00a7 61, Series A no.\u00a0288; Milojevi\u0107, cited above). When applying legal rules lacking in precision, however, the domestic courts must show particular diligence in giving sufficient reasons as to why such a rule was applied in a particular manner, given the circumstances of each specific case. Merely citing the language of the imprecise provision cannot be regarded as sufficient reasoning (see H.\u00a0v.\u00a0Belgium, 30 November 1987, \u00a7 53, Series A no.\u00a0127B; and Milojevi\u0107, cited above).",

Also, the Court established that the Constitutional Court had already had an opportunity to deal with cases raising substantially identical issues to those brought by the applicant before this Court wherein it concluded that both the law, on the basis of which the applicants had been dismissed, and the judicial decisions, which were identical to those rendered in the applicant\u2019s case, had been arbitrary and in violation of the right to a fair trial (see Milojevi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 84). In regards to the Government\u2019s objection as to the different temporal context, the Court notes that the only difference between this case and Milojevi\u0107 is that the applicants in Milojevi\u0107 referred to the Court immediately after being dismissed, whereas the applicant in present case tried and exhausted all domestic remedies he had at his disposal (see paragraph 29). The legal grounds on which the applicant got dismissed from the police force remain the same as in Milojevi\u0107 case. Therefore, in light of almost identical factual and legal circumstances of the cases, the Court sees no reason to depart from its findings adopted in the Milojevi\u0107.",
