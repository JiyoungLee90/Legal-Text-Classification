In doing so the court relied on section 20 of the Pledge Act. It also found that the pledges had been lawful and duly registered. It was further noted that following an enforcement application on the part of the creditor, a hearing had been held only in order to establish if the pledge had been in order (perfektuirana) and if the debtor had failed to meet its obligations. It was up to the debtor to prove the opposite. The court observed that the debtor had not denied the creditor\u2019s allegations but had rather asked for additional time to meet them. The court further considered that the debtor\u2019s submissions as regards the exact amount of the debt were irrelevant at this stage of the proceedings, given the undisputed fact that the debtor had failed to meet the obligations arising from the loan agreement secured by the pledges. The debtor\u2019s submission that the court had not seen any of the originals of the submitted evidence was adjudged to be unfounded, given that the authenticity thereof had not been disputed.

Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, \u00a7 230, ECHR 2012). In laying down such regulation, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. Whilst the final decision as to observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court, it is no part of the Court\u2019s function to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities any other assessment of what might be the best policy in this field. Nonetheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (ibid., \u00a7 230; see also Cordova v.

The debtor appealed against both of them. While the applicants submitted that the rectifying decision had dealt with substantial errors of the first one and could not be considered separately, the Court notes that the debtor\u2019s second appeal did not challenge any of the rectifications contained in the second decision (see paragraph 12 in fine above), but substantially related to the main decision of 10 October 2013. Regardless of the fact that I.P. had withdrawn the debtor\u2019s second appeal, it must be noted that the Court of Appeal did examine on the merits the debtor\u2019s first appeal and dismissed it, giving a reasoned decision (see paragraph 17 above). As the two appeals were substantially the same, and in fact related to the contents of the first decision, the court thus addressed all the arguments, including those from the second appeal too. In other words, the limitation applied in respect of the second appeal did not restrict the applicants\u2019 access to a court in such a\u00a0way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right was impaired. Accordingly, the Court considers that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(a) and\u00a04 of the Convention.",

Furthermore, after the Court of Appeal rejected the appeal as inadmissible, the Ministry of Finance, in response to the applicants\u2019 appeal, annulled the decision on the new company officers registration, including I.P.\u2019s registration. It is noted in this regard that pursuant to the relevant legislation, and contrary to the Government\u2019s submission, the annulment has retroactive effect (see paragraph 51 above). Eventually, the proceedings in this connection were stayed as O.B. had withdrawn its request for registration. Therefore, the decision on I.P.\u2019s appointment had indeed never become final as it had never been upheld by a second-instance body. In addition, the Securities Commission itself found that O.B.\u2019s purchase of more than 10% of the shares had not been in accordance with the law as it had lacked that Commission\u2019s consent.",

The State may be held responsible for losses caused by such determinations if court decisions are not given in accordance with domestic law or if they are flawed by arbitrariness or manifest unreasonableness contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for example, Vulakh and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a033468/03, \u00a7 44, 10 January 2012). However, the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to verify that domestic law has been correctly interpreted and applied is limited and it is not its function to take the place of the national courts. Rather, its role is to ensure that the decisions of those courts are not arbitrary or otherwise manifestly unreasonable (see, for example, Anheuser-Busch Inc. v.

In particular, in such a case the pledgee has the right to address the courts and seek the object of the pledge. While the same section allows for an appeal against an enforcement decision given by the courts, it also explicitly provides that lodging an appeal does not have suspensive effect as regards the execution of the decision. Therefore, the fact that the State-run agency transferred the object of the pledge to the creditor \u2013 in this case the debtor\u2019s shares \u2013 while the debtor\u2019s appeals in this regard were still pending, was neither unforeseeable nor unlawful.
