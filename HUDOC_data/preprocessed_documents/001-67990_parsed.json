Moreover, the Court notes that the bailiff had a very active role in trying to persuade the Municipal Council to execute the judgment (see paragraph 12 above). Therefore, an action to complain about the bailiff's refusal to act would not have served the applicant's interest in obtaining the execution of the favourable court judgment. Moreover, even assuming that the applicant could have brought an action against the bailiff and obtained a decision confirming that the non-execution had been unlawful in domestic law, such an action would not have achieved anything new, the only outcome being the issue of another warrant enabling the bailiff to proceed with the execution of the judgment of 5 November 1997. Consequently, the Court concludes that such an action would have been ineffective and that the application cannot be rejected for non-exhaustion of the remedy provided for in Article 426 of the old Code of Civil Procedure (see Jasi\u016bnien\u0117 v.
