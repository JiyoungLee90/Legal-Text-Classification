It further stated that on\u00a0eight occasions the hearings had lasted less than two hours, which taking into account the number of co-accused and difficulties in scheduling a date convenient to all the participants, was proof of bad organisation of the proceedings on the part of the Gda\u0144sk District Court. Furthermore, the court held that on numerous occasions hearings had been adjourned as some of\u00a0the co\u2013accused had participated on these dates in another set of proceedings or because prison authorities had been given too short notice to organise transport of the accused from a remand centre to the courtroom. The court also pointed out that the Gda\u0144sk District Court did not apply any disciplinary measures against the co-accused who systematically failed to appear for hearings. Finally, the  stated that the intervals between the hearings had been too significant; in particular on one occasion the Gda\u0144sk District Court had adjourned a hearing for a period of one year without submitting exceptional reasons for its decision as required by the code of criminal procedure.
