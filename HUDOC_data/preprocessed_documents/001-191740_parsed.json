This had clearly been an adequate reaction. However, the High Court discussed whether the letter from the applicant\u2019s counsel to the Press Complaints Commission on 8 November 2010 (see paragraph 10 above) implied that Mr\u00a0Hegnar should have initiated a deletion process at that time. Having regard to the fact that the letter was formally made in a different context, namely the pending complaint against Kapital (see paragraph 6 above), and did not contain any request that the comments be removed, the High Court found it appropriate that Mr Hegnar had only considered the letter as a document in the Kapital case.",

Hegnar Online had by then already looked into the matter, as it had received a similar notification from Radio Norge on 3 December 2010, and had on that date noticed that the comment had already been deleted, presumably by a moderator at Hegnar Online. As this comment had, thus, rapidly been deleted of the staff\u2019s own motion, there was nothing to suggest liability on the part of Hegnar Online.",

She also contested the High Court\u2019s assessment of evidence concerning Mr\u00a0Hegnar\u2019s dealing with the letter of 8 November 2010 addressed to the Press Complaints Commission. The applicant pointed out that Mr Hegnar had written an editorial in Kapital on 19 November 2010, making remarks about how the applicant had complained about comments on the forum (see paragraph 14 above). Furthermore, the applicant argued that the High Court had wrongfully proceeded on the basis that the standards for the moderation of websites with user-generated content had been more lenient in 2010 than at the time of the High Court\u2019s judgment. Lastly, she appealed against the High Court\u2019s decision on litigation costs. The defendant\u2019s counsel charged an hourly rate of up to NOK 3,900 (approximately EUR 410), which was so high that there would be a chilling effect on individuals\u2019 willingness to challenge violations of Article 8 of the Convention.",

Germany, no. 59320/00, \u00a7\u00a050, ECHR 2004VI, and Paradiso and Campanelli v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a025358/12, \u00a7\u00a0159, ECHR 2017).

These obligations may also involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves. The boundary between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 does not lend itself to precise definition; the applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the relevant competing interests (see Von Hannover v.

Accordingly, the margin of appreciation should in principle be the same in both cases (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7 87, and Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos.\u00a040660/08 and 60641/08, \u00a7 106, ECHR 2012, with further references to the cases of Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s, cited above, \u00a7 41; Timciuc v.

Where the balancing exercise between those two rights has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7 88, and Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 107, with further references to MGN Limited, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0150 and 155, and Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others v.\u00a0Spain [GC], nos.\u00a028955/06, 28957/06, 28959/06 and 28964/06, \u00a7 57, 12\u00a0September\u00a02011). In other words, there will usually be a wide margin afforded by the Court if the State is required to strike a balance between competing private interests or competing Convention rights (see Evans v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, \u00a7 77, ECHR 2007I; Chassagnou and Others v.

Norway (dec.), no.\u00a060715/14, \u00a7 33, 20 February 2018, and Avisa Nordland AS v. Norway (dec.), no. 30563/15, \u00a7 48, 20 February 2018), the Court notes the considerable amount of costs imposed on the applicant. However, taking account of the nature of the claim lodged before the national courts and the subject matter, the Court does not consider that it in the instant case can call into question the domestic courts\u2019 assessment as to the imposition of costs, also in view of the High Court\u2019s examination of the \u201cparties\u2019 welfare\u201d and their \u201crelative strength\u201d (see paragraph 40 above). Against that background, the Court does not need to address the Government\u2019s argument that Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 is lex specialis, as it is in any event satisfied that the domestic courts sufficiently safeguarded the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 8 and that there has been no violation of that provision.",
