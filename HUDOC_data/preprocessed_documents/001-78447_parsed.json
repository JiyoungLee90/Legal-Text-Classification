The Court\u2019s case-law indicates that \u201cemployment disputes\u201d are not confined to those in which an applicant seeks reinstatement or a determination of his right to a pension. The notion of \u201cemployment disputes\u201d is broader and includes also other employmentrelated issues, such as recognition of a right to a professional qualification (see, Caleffi v. Italy, judgment of 24 May 1991, Series A no.\u00a0206B). In the present case the applicant sought compensation for refraining from undertaking any professional activities in competition with those of his former employer under the \u201ccompetition clause\u201d included in his contract of employment. The period during which the applicant was obliged to comply with the \u201ccompetition clause\u201d extended to six consecutive months after the termination of his contract of employment. Thus, the purpose of the \u201ccompetition clause\u201d was to provide the applicant with the means of subsistence in return for his renunciation of certain professional activities for quite a considerable time. Therefore, the Court finds that in the present case special diligence was required on the part of the authorities.",
