As to the civil head of this Article, the Government argued that the applicant\u2019s right to practise as a lawyer was not at stake in the disciplinary proceedings at issue. They pointed out that a prohibition on exercising the profession may be imposed in extremely serious cases only. In the circumstances of the case, the applicant had, at no stage of the proceedings, reason to fear that his right to practice his profession would be temporarily suspended. The penalty actually imposed on him, namely a fine, did not affect his right to practise as a lawyer and the result of the proceedings was, thus, not decisive for his civil rights. As to the criminal head of Article 6, the Government, referring to the Court\u2019s case-law, argued that the proceedings at issue are not to be regarded as criminal proceedings in domestic law, and that they are designed to ensure that practising lawyers comply with certain professional rules of conduct. Further, the nature and severity of the penalties the applicant risked incurring was not such as to bring the case into the criminal sphere. ",
