In all of those cases, both the first instance and appeal courts either failed to address this issue or at most expressed doubts and refrained from making any conclusive findings, adding that this issue was to be clarified during further investigation and refusing to release the applicants (see paragraphs 29, 31, 44, 74, 89 and 91 above). Even in those few cases in which the applicants were released, this was always done on a ground unrelated to the existence of a reasonable suspicion of their having committed an offence, namely on the ground that there were no risks that the applicants would abscond, obstruct the investigation or commit another offence (see paragraphs 20, 21, 35 and 53 above).",

The Court therefore concludes that the remedies pointed out by the Government were not effective or capable of providing redress in respect of the applicants\u2019 complaint in question and did not offer reasonable prospects of success in the particular circumstances of the case.

Furthermore, the investigating authority applied Section 21 \u00a7 2 of the Alternative Service Act which was in force at the material time. Accordingly, the investigating authority and the District Courts had issued lawful decisions and detained the applicants for having committed an act prohibited by law. Hence, the applicants\u2019 detention was lawful. They had been charged for their actions under Articles 361 and 362 of the CC. Following an examination of the applicants\u2019 cases on the merits and after additional investigation, the domestic authorities found out that the acts committed by the applicants lacked corpus delicti, the prosecutor terminated the proceedings and released the applicants. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, detention was in principle lawful if carried out pursuant to a court order. A court error under domestic law in making the order would not necessarily retrospectively affect the validity of the intervening period of detention. In conclusion, there was no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention.",

This was in fact established on the domestic level, namely acknowledged by the General Prosecutor, who, following the remittals of the applicants\u2019 cases by the domestic courts for an additional investigation, decided to terminate the proceedings against the applicants on this ground (see paragraph 101 above). Articles 361 and 362 of the CC were applicable only to servicemen and were wrongly applied to the applicants (see also paragraphs 110-113 above). It follows that the acts of which the applicants were accused and which provided the basis for their detention did not constitute an offence under the domestic law at the material time. The Court therefore concludes that the applicants\u2019 deprivation of liberty was not based on a reasonable suspicion of their having committed an \u201coffence\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention. The fact that the criminal proceedings against the applicants had been terminated and they were released from detention is not sufficient reason for finding that the applicants could not claim to be victims of a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention. No compensation for unlawful detention had been awarded to them at the domestic level, and furthermore, the Government, in their observations, did not acknowledge that the applicants had been unlawfully deprived of their liberty.",
