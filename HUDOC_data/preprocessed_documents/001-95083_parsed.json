In this regard the Court reiterates that it is not open to a State authority to cite lack of funds as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt. Admittedly, a delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances. But the delay must not be such as to impair the essence of the right protected under Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (see Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a022774/93, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 1999-V, and Burdov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a059498/00, \u00a7\u00a035, ECHR 2002-III).",

In particular, they failed to advance any plausible explanation as to why the bailiff had sought a change of the means of enforcement almost a year and a half after the enforcement proceedings had been instituted, a period which is excessively long in the circumstances of the present case, whereas it was clear ab initio that the debtor lacked available apartments to enforce the decision in timely fashion as there were a lot of other eligible persons who had already been waiting for apartments since the early 1990s.",
