In particular, it notes that the search of Mr\u00a0Magomed Kabilov\u2019s flat and the obtaining of mobile telephone data were delayed until December 2009 (see paragraphs 18 and 17 above). For unknown reasons, the investigators did not follow up on the information about the tickets allegedly bought by Mr\u00a0M.A.\u00a0Kabilov, or the mobile phone calls made from Khasavyurt, even after those shortcomings had been pointed out and criticised by the investigators\u2019 superior. Moreover, no attempt to locate Mr\u00a0R.S.\u2019s vehicle was ever made. The Court finds such conspicuous apathy to be unacceptable.",

As a result, many investigative steps, particularly the questioning of witnesses, were duplicated (see paragraphs 8, 10, 11, 37, 41 and 42). Furthermore, important circumstances established in the context of one set of proceedings were disregarded in the context of the other one (for example, the information concerning Mr R.S.\u2019s possible involvement in an illegal armed group was not taken into account in the investigation into the disappearance of the applicant\u2019s son).",
