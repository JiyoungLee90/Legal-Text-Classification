He was sentenced to one year\u2019s imprisonment, which was suspended for a probationary period of three years. The Criminal Court considered as mitigating factors that the applicant had no previous criminal record, that he had confessed to his crimes and that he had shown willingness to afford redress to the victim. Aggravating factors were that he had committed several offences, specifically a crime and two misdemeanours. In its reasoning of the judgment, the Criminal Court noted that the applicant had been notorious for excessive acts of violence and had had to change schools several times already. It observed that the applicant had virtually no age-appropriate capacity of reflection, and attested that he had an enormous tendency to act aggressively, which he used as his strategy for problem-solving.",

The Criminal Court considered the applicant\u2019s confession to be a mitigating factor, but the repeated commission of offences as an aggravating factor. It argued in its reasoning that the applicant had taken a leading role in the robberies. The applicant and his friends had deliberately targeted elderly women because they had expected they would not resist. Moreover, the Criminal Court found that the applicant had been one of the main perpetrators, which is why there was no leeway to pronounce a more lenient sentence than two and a half years\u2019 imprisonment.",

It confirmed the legality of the exclusion order, but limited it to five years. It considered that the robberies in particular had been serious offences which demonstrated the applicant\u2019s severe disrespect for the well-being and property of others. The victims had been mostly elderly, fragile women, who had been physically weaker than him and his friends. Two of the women had been severely injured. The applicant had been one of the main perpetrators. His tendency towards violence and aggression was remarkable and appeared to have even increased between the first and the second conviction. The IAP further took into consideration that the applicant had only been 14 and 15 years old at the time of the offences, and therefore had still been in the process of reaching maturity. This was however put into perspective by the fact that he had not offended only once, but multiple times, and in a particularly brutal manner.",

The applicant had worked as an apprentice during his time in prison. After his release, he had participated in several training programmes and was looking for a job. The IAP noted furthermore that the applicant had not reoffended in over a year since his release from prison. It came to the conclusion, however, that the relatively short time since his release was not enough to prove that he was not a danger to society anymore.",

It held at the outset that an expulsion of \u201csecond-generation migrants\u201d such as the applicant was subject to stricter criteria than an expulsion of other foreigners. Referring to the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases Boultif v. Switzerland (no. 54273/00, ECHR 2001IX), \u00dcner v. the Netherlands ([GC] no. 46410/99, ECHR\u00a02006XII) and Maslov v. Austria ([GC] no.\u00a01638/03, ECHR 2008), it found that \u2013 in contrast to Maslov \u2013 the applicant had repeatedly committed serious crimes of a violent nature. Because of his family and his social integration in Austria, the exclusion order constituted an interference with his rights under Article 8 of the Convention. However, he had almost reached the age of majority at the time the exclusion order had been issued. Economic integration could not be observed as he was unemployed at the time. He spoke Turkish and had last visited Turkey in 2001. His mother still lived in Turkey; he had no contact with her at the time but could get in touch with her. The serious nature of the offences and the resulting public interest in his expulsion therefore outweighed the applicant\u2019s interest in remaining in the country. However, because of his young age, the IAP concluded that a five-year exclusion order would be sufficient.",

This assessment had been in line with the Court\u2019s case-law in similar cases. The crimes committed by the applicant should be seen as particularly serious, targeting elderly women, whom he had assumed to be defenceless. In addition, the applicant had committed several crimes during a short period of two years. While it was true that he had committed the offences as a juvenile, he did so however in a manner which cannot be regarded as being due to juvenile carelessness or insufficient maturity (contrast Maslov v. Austria [GC], no.\u00a01638/03, \u00a7 81, ECHR 2008). The seriousness of his offences had been evidenced by the fact that an unconditional prison sentence of two years and six months had been imposed on him, despite his young age.

Austria, no. 36757/97, \u00a7 27, 6 February 2003, in which the exclusion order had been based on two convictions for burglary committed when a minor and where, in addition, the applicant had still been a minor when expelled; and Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 81, where one of the decisive factors for finding a violation of Article 8 of the Convention was the fact that the applicant had, with one exception, committed only non-violent offences). However, the Court has made it clear that very serious violent offences can justify expulsion even if they were committed by a minor (see Bouchelkia v. France, 29 January 1997, \u00a7 51, Reports 1997I, where the Court found no violation of Article 8 as regards a deportation order made on the basis of the applicant\u2019s conviction for aggravated rape committed at the age of 17; in the decisions Hizir Kilic v. Denmark (dec.), no. 20277/05, and Ferhat Kilic v. Denmark (dec.), no. 20730/05, both of 22 January 2007, the Court declared inadmissible the applicants\u2019 complaints about exclusion orders imposed following their convictions for attempted robbery, aggravated assault and manslaughter committed at the age of 16 and 17 respectively). On the other hand, in the case of a juvenile offender, the best interest of the child must also be taken into account, which includes an obligation on the State to facilitate his or her reintegration into society (Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 83, with reference to Article 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child).",

In such cases it is for the State to organise its system in such a way as to be able to take account of new developments (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 90-93, and Onyejiekwe v. Austria (dec.), no. 20203/11, \u00a7 43, 9\u00a0October 2012). However, the Court has found that the seriousness of an offence committed by an applicant must also weigh heavily in the balance (see Arvelo Aponte v. the Netherlands, no. 28770/05, \u00a7\u00a7 57-58, 3 November 2011).",

However, he did not reoffend after his second conviction and after being released from prison on 30 April 2007. In addition, his probation officer attested to a positive outlook for the applicant\u2019s future. Still, when the IAP assessed the applicant\u2019s case on 21 July 2008, less than fifteen months had passed since his release from prison, which explains the IAP\u2019s conclusion that it was too early at that time to assume that the applicant was not a danger to society anymore (see paragraph 17 in fine above). It is true that following that assessment and until his expulsion on 10 February 2010 the applicant did not reoffend either. However, according to the applicant\u2019s own statements, which were corroborated by his probation officer, he tried to find permanent work, but did not succeed (see paragraphs 17, 28 and 33 above). He also quit an apprenticeship because he did not get along with some people (see paragraph 35 above), which suggests that the authorities could not provide an unconditionally positive prognosis for his future at that time. Thus, even though the Court accepts that the total amount of time which elapsed between the applicant\u2019s release from prison and his actual expulsion may speak in his favour, it considers that the applicant\u2019s conduct during that period carries less weight than the serious nature of his criminal offences.",
