The fact that the applicant was informed of his constitutional right not to incriminate himself (see\u00a0paragraph 12 above), is not sufficient for an assumption to be made that the applicant waived the right to be represented by a lawyer (see, mutatis mutandis, Khayrov v.

It is true that the court viewed his statements in the light of other evidence before it. However, none of that evidence, including the confessions made by the applicant\u2019s co-accused during the investigation stage, constituted direct evidence. It is also true that the applicant made his first confession to the crime in the presence of a lawyer prior to the crime reconstruction. However, the Court notes that during the reconstruction the applicant not only confirmed that he had robbed and killed M. but also showed the crime scene to the police \u2013 specifically, the place where he had hidden the bat with which he had allegedly killed M. (he\u00a0had not mentioned anything in this regard in his earlier confession \u2013 see paragraphs 10 and 12 above). The immediate inspection made by the police uncovered a bat, bearing bloodstains, which was used as evidence in the case. The Court accepts that after the applicant became legally represented by a lawyer of his own choosing, it was open for him in principle to say \u2013 and he did so (see paragraph 22 above) \u2013 that he had not robbed and killed M.; however, it is difficult to see how it would be possible to effectively retract the statement concerning the location of the bat after it had actually been found and inspected by the police. The Court is thus of the opinion that the statements which the applicant made without a lawyer during the reconstruction on 22\u00a0August 2004 predetermined all the statements which he could make later. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the above elements overweight those, mentioned in paragraph 61 above, which could militate in favour of considering the proceedings fair.",
