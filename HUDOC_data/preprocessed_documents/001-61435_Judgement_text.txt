The case originated in an application (no. 53161/99) against the Republic of Lithuania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Lithuanian national, Raimundas Meilus (“the applicant”), on 2 November 1999.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Josefsen, a lawyer practising in Odense, Denmark. The Lithuanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs D. Jočienė.
The applicant alleged in particular that criminal proceedings against him had breached the “reasonable time” requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 § 1).
By a decision of 30 May 2002 the Court declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicant is a Lithuanian national, born in 1972 and living in Vilnius.
In November 1994 the applicant became a suspect in a criminal case of fraud. On 29 November 1994 a search was conducted in his flat in the context of the proceedings.
On 14 August 1996 the applicant was charged on five counts, including cheating and embezzlement. On 22 August 1996 he was remanded on bail. There were four other co-accused persons in the case.
On 10 September 1996 the pre-trial investigation was concluded. From 10 September 1996 until 14 November 1996 the applicant and the co-accused had access to the case-file. On 18 November 1996 the Deputy Prosecutor General confirmed the bill of indictment. On 20 November 1996 the case was transmitted to the Kaunas City District Court.
On 3 January 1997 the Kaunas City District Court committed the applicant for trial. On 23 May 1997 the court ordered further investigations in the case and returned the case-file to the investigators.
The prosecution appealed against the above decision, complaining that there was no need for further investigation, and that the trial could proceed. On 26 August 1997 the Kaunas Regional Court rejected the prosecution's appeal, holding that further investigation measures were required.
On 26 September 1997 the Prosecutor General lodged a cassation appeal against the decisions of 23 May 1997 and 26 August 1997, stating that there was no need for further investigation, and that the trial should resume. On 29 January 1998 the Court of Appeal examined the prosecuting authorities' cassation appeal. The cassation court quashed the decisions of 23 May 1997 and 26 August 1997, deciding that the trial could be resumed. It transmitted the case to the Kaunas City District Court for a new examination.
On 13 October 1998 the applicant was taken to hospital with a stomach illness.
On 15 October 1998 the Kaunas City District Court found the applicant guilty on four counts, the applicant's defence counsel being present. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
On 16 October 1998 the applicant was transferred from the hospital to the prison on the basis of the judgment of 15 October 1998.
Upon the applicant's appeal, on 22 March 1999 the Kaunas Regional Court amended the applicant's conviction insofar as it concerned damages which had been awarded against him. The applicant's sentence was not changed.
Upon the applicant's cassation appeal, on 30 September 1999 the Supreme Court quashed the conviction and the appellate decision because of numerous breaches of domestic criminal procedure. The Supreme Court found in regard to the applicant that the findings by the lower courts of his guilt on two counts had not been properly motivated, and that the question of damages against him had not been adequately resolved. The case was returned to the Kaunas City District Court for a new examination to be carried out. The Supreme Court ordered the applicant's release on bail. The applicant was not present during the cassation hearing. He was released on the next day when the decision of the Supreme Court was sent to the prison.
On 25 October 1999 the Kaunas City District Court returned the case to the prosecution for further investigations to be carried out. On an unspecified date the investigation was concluded. The applicant's trial is currently pending before the first instance court.
