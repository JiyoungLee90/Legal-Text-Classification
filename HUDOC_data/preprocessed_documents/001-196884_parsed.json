In this connection, the Court observes that the national regulations in question specify that a person suspected of having committed an administrative offence could only be \u201cescorted\u201d to a police station and detained there for the purpose of preparing an administrative-offence record, if such a record could not be drawn up at the place where the offence had been discovered.

Even though the amount of the fine may seem significant, the Court does not lose sight that the judgments ordering the applicants to pay the fine were not enforced save for in the case of Mr Vyatkin, where the bailiff recovered a negligible amount of approximately 0.60 euros (EUR). It further notes that the statutory threeyear time-limit for institution of enforcement proceedings against Ms\u00a0Lapshina and Ms Mishina has expired and the judgments against them are no longer enforceable. In Mr Vyatkin\u2019s case, the bailiff established that the recovery of the judgment debt had been impossible (see paragraph 16 above). Accordingly, the adverse effect of the judgments rendered against the applicants, if any, did not affect their life. Nor can the Court conclude that the subject matter of the complaints gives rise to an important matter of principle. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants did not suffer a significant disadvantage as a result of the alleged violations of the Convention.",
