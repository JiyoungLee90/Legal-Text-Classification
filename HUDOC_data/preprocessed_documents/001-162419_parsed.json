The six-month time-limit has a number of aims. Its primary purpose is to maintain legal certainty by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are examined within a reasonable time, and to prevent the authorities and other persons concerned from being kept in a state of uncertainty for a long period of time. It also affords the prospective applicant time to consider whether to lodge an application and, if so, to decide on the specific complaints and arguments to be raised and facilitates the establishment of facts in a case, since with the passage of time, any fair examination of the issues raised is rendered problematic (Sabri G\u00fcne\u015f v.

Special considerations could apply in exceptional cases where an applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of circumstances which make that remedy ineffective. In such a situation, the six-month period might be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware, or should have become aware, of these circumstances (see Bulut and Yavuz v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no. 73065/01, 28 May 2002 and the cases cited therein; and Mocanu and Others v.

The investigation must be, inter alia, thorough, impartial and careful (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0161-63, Series A no. 324). In that connection, the Court points out that this obligation is not confined to cases where it is apparent that the killing was caused by an agent of the State (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2000VII). A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating a use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, \u00a7\u00a0114, ECHR 2001III and the cases cited therein; see also Mocanu and Others v.\u00a0Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09, 45886/07 and 32431/08, \u00a7\u00a7 316-325, ECHR 2014 (extracts); and Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v.

As acknowledged by my colleagues, since there were significant new developments in January 2000, the procedural obligation to investigate the husband\u2019s killing was revived after that date, with the result that the complaint relating to the ineffectiveness of the investigation thereafter cannot be declared inadmissible as being lodged out of time (see paragraphs 67 to 68 of the judgment). In my opinion, the fact that the applicant is entitled to complain that the investigation as resumed after January 2000 was ineffective should result in the admissibility of her complaint relating to the specific object of that investigation, namely the killing of her husband. The applicant should have been able in principle to await the outcome of the resumed investigation to see whether it produced evidence of the State\u2019s implication in the killing of her husband, and then to refer to the results of the investigation (or the lack of meaningful results) in support of her argument that the State was in fact involved.",

According to the applicant, far from shedding light on the circumstances surrounding the death of her husband, the investigation was an attempt to obscure the truth concerning his death (see paragraph 71 of the judgment).",

With respect to the adequacy of the investigation, it limits itself to finding that the investigation was capable of identifying and prosecuting the perpetrators of the killing, that is, the members of Hizbullah who had confessed to carrying out the operation which resulted in the killing of the applicant\u2019s husband (see paragraph 78 of the judgment). To my regret, I consider that this is a very incomplete answer. The Court should have examined whether there was reason for the investigation to look into the possible involvement of the State security forces, as alleged by the applicant, and if so, whether an investigation into that aspect was actually undertaken.",
