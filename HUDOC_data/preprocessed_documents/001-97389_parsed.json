He had not been reached until 19\u00a0March 2003 for further questioning. Secondly, the second applicant had delayed the District Court proceedings by causing the cancellation of the court's oral hearing on four occasions between 15 January 2004 and 1 February 2005. On the first three occasions the applicant had failed to appear in the hearing claiming that he was ill. On the last mentioned date the hearing had been cancelled because the court had been unable to serve the summons on the second applicant. A certificate of impediment dated by the bailiff on 31\u00a0January\u00a02005 showed that the applicant had also been evading that authority at the time. The Government further submitted that the Court of Appeal had held an oral hearing on request of the applicants.

Further, in view of the lack of any documentary evidence, the Court is unable to verify whether the District Court, in cancelling the first three hearings mentioned in paragraph 24 above, had considered that the second applicant had a legitimate reason for not appearing before the court.
