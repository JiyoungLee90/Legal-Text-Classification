Recently, in connection with the events of 1993, we were reminded how cynically Yeltsin bought MPs who had not yet decided which side of the barricades to run to. He promised them a rich piece of cake, and they slyly ran for this piece, swallowing their spittle. Zhirinovskiy's party was accused of bribery many times, but all our elected representatives take [bribes] (except Vasya, of course), if we mean not only money but also greyhound puppies: favours from Western patrons, from Khodorkovskiys or Abramovichs residing in . And this is a serious school, a school of venality. This is why the accusation against Shandybin in the clandestine leaflet fell on fertile ground. Whether Vasiliy Ivanovich took bribes or not, he will have to account for all his colleagues, for the fact that he has sat next to venal MPs in the venal Duma for many years. In a way, the retribution is legitimate.",

In the Court's view, the use by the applicant of particular turns of phrase, colloquial expressions or slang words in the passages at issue did not go beyond the degree of exaggeration or provocation permitted by Article 10 (see paragraph 32 above) and consequently did not justify an imposition of restrictions on his right to freedom of expression. Furthermore, the Court notes that whereas Article 152 of the Civil Code refers to \u201cinformation\u201d, the domestic courts held the applicant liable not for the \u201cinformation\u201d contained in the passages at issue but for the language and style that he had chosen to use.

His personal opinion clearly constituted a value judgment the truthfulness of which could not be proved. The domestic courts thus failed to distinguish between a statement of fact and a value judgment. The word \u201cserf\u201d, obviously used figuratively, was ironically employed by the applicant to add a particular, admittedly rather provocative, colouration to his observations. However, like the figures of speech used in the first two passages, the Court does not find that the boundaries of the protection afforded by Article 10 were exceeded by the applicant in this regard either.",

The fact that the proceedings were civil rather than criminal in nature and that the final award was relatively small does not detract from the fact that the standards applied by the domestic courts were not compatible with the principles embodied in Article 10 since they did not adduce \u201csufficient\u201d reasons justifying the interference at issue.
