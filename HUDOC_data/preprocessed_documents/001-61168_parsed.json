This impression was strengthened by the first of the concluding questions: '... why did the vital part of the taxi driver's explanation disappear and who, in the police or public prosecutor's office, should carry the responsibility for this?'. In connection with the scenes about the two police officers they pose two questions in the commentator's narrative, to which the indictment relates; irrespective of the kind of question, viewers undoubtedly received a clear impression that a report had been made about the taxi driver's statement that she had seen X at the relevant time on 12\u00a0December 1981; that this report had subsequently been suppressed; and that such suppression had been decided upon either by the named Chief Superintendent alone or by him and the Chief Inspector of the Flying Squad jointly. The subsequent questions in the commentator's narrative do not weaken this impression, and neither does the question as to whether the Chief Constable or the Public Prosecutor were aware of the taxi driver's statement. On this basis we find that in the programme 'The Blind Eye of the Police' the applicants made allegations against the named Superintendent which were intended to discredit him in the eyes of his peers, as described in Article 267, subsection 1 of the Penal Code (Straffeloven). We find further that it must have been clear to the applicants that they were, by way of their presentation, making such allegations.",

In consequence of the ongoing proceedings for reopening the case, the applicants could not count on the Chief Superintendent and the two police officers, who had interviewed the taxi driver in 1981, being prepared to participate in the programme and hence possibly anticipate proceedings in the Court of Revision.

In assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. Thus, the Court's task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities but rather to review under Article\u00a010, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation (see, among many other authorities, Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, \u00a7 45, Reports 1999-I).",

While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article\u00a010 (see. e.g. Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no.\u00a0103, p.\u00a028, \u00a7 46 and Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991, Series\u00a0A, no.\u00a0204, p. 27, \u00a7 63). However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (Jerusalem v.\u00a0Austria, no. 26958/95, \u00a7 43, 27.2.2001).",

Austria judgment of 26\u00a0April\u00a01995, Series A no.\u00a0313, p. 19, \u00a7 38).

However, it cannot be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent to which politicians do and should therefore be treated on an equal footing with the latter when it comes to the criticism of their actions. Moreover, civil servants must enjoy public confidence in conditions free of undue perturbation if they are to be successful in performing their tasks and it may therefore prove necessary to protect them from offensive and abusive verbal attacks when on duty. Public prosecutors and superior police officers are civil servants whose task it is to contribute to the proper administration of justice. In this respect they form part of the judicial machinery in the broader sense of this term. It is in the general interest that they, like judicial officers, should enjoy public confidence. It may therefore be necessary for the State to protect them from accusations that are unfounded (see Lesnik v. Slovakia, no. 35640/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a053 and 54, 11\u00a0March\u00a02003).",

It must therefore be examined whether they acted in good faith and complied with the ordinary obligation to verify a factual statement. In this respect the Court recalls that Article 10 of the Convention protects journalists' right to divulge information on issues of general interest provided that they are acting in good faith and on accurate factual basis and provide \u201creliable and precise\u201d information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see e.g. the Fressoz and Roire judgment \u00a7 54; the Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas judgment \u00a7 58, and the Prager and Oberschlick judgment \u00a7 37, all cited above). Accordingly, Article 10 of the Convention does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern. Under the terms of paragraph 2 of the Article the exercise of this freedom carries with it \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d, which also apply to the press. These \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d are liable to assume significance when, as in the present case, there is a question of attacking the reputation of a named individual and infringing the \u201crights of others\u201d. Also of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the Court must carry out is the fact that under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention individuals have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proven guilty (see inter alia Worm v. Austria, judgment of 29 August 1997, Reports 1997-V, \u00a7\u00a050 and Du Roy and Malaurie v. France, no.\u00a034000/96, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR 2000X).",

The police is a public institution and the physical persons who constitute it and give flesh to its activities are public figures who, by no means, are immune from the public scrutin and criticism. Because of their sensitive functions, which sometimes may be very crucial for the liberty, security and the well-being of the members of a society, as a whole, policemen are in the centre of the social tension which is determined by the exercise of the State power, on the one hand, and the rights of individuals on the other hand, to be protected by excesses in the use of their power. For this reason police officers are widely exposed to the public eye, a matter which has also been accepted by the European Court of Human Rights: in a notional scale, concerning permissible interference for the protection of the rights of others, politicians seem to be the less protected, because of their particular functions, but then\n",

This general statement was followed by the question: \u201cwhy did the vital part of the taxi driver's explanation disappear \u2013 and who in the police or public prosecutor's office should carry the responsibility for this?\u201d. The applicants then proceeded with questions which cast doubt on the effectiveness or even the integrity of the actual persons:\u201d Was it the two police officers who failed to write a report about it? Hardly, sources in the police tell us, they would not dare. Was it [the named Chief Superintendent] who decided that the report should not be included in the case? Or did he and the Chief Inspector of the Flying Squad conceal the witness's statement from the defence, the judges and the jury? \u201cWhy did the Chief Inspector of the Flying Squad 'phone the taxi driver shortly after the TV programme 'Convicted of Murder'? After all, the police had taken the view that the taxi driver had no importance as a witness and had filed her statement amongst the O-reports. Why did the Chief Inspector of the Flying Squad not call her in for an interview when she repeated her original explanation on the telephone? Why was the taxi driver interviewed at the Frederikshavn police station in the presence of the Chief Superintendent, which was completely at odds with the Public Prosecutor's public statement?...\u201d",
