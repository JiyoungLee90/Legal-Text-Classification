Furthermore, the Court takes into consideration the subject matter of the proceedings. Special diligence is required in cases concerning dismissal from office. An employee who considers that he has been wrongly suspended or dismissed by his employer has an important personal interest in securing a judicial decision on the lawfulness of that measure promptly, since employment disputes by their nature call for expeditious decision, in view of what is at stake for the person concerned, who through dismissal loses his means of subsistence (ibid., \u00a7 45, and Ruotolo v.
