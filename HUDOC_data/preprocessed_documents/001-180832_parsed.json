At the same time, the authorities should have borne in mind that the measure had been applied in the context of an administrative offence and, possibly, in the context of the exercise of a fundamental right or freedom, such as freedom of expression or freedom of peaceful assembly. Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention requires that for deprivation of liberty to be considered free from arbitrariness, it does not suffice that this measure is taken and executed in conformity with national law; it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v.

However, the national authorities must attempt to keep this to a minimum (see Ruslan Yakovenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a05425/11, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2015, with further references). Administrative formalities connected with release cannot justify a delay of more than a few hours (ibid.; see also Quinn v.

In the present case the Court finds no justification for the six-hour delay. There is nothing to suggest that there were any particular difficulties in securing the applicant\u2019s immediate release as required by the appeal court (see paragraph 28 above), which was located in the same city as the detention facility (see, in a similar context, Bivolaru v.

In evaluating the overall fairness of the proceedings, the Court will take into account, if appropriate, the minimum rights listed in Article 6 \u00a7 3, which exemplify the requirements of a fair trial in respect of typical procedural situations which arise in criminal cases (see Ibrahim and Others, cited above, \u00a7 251).

Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Blokhin v. Russia [GC], no. 47152/06, \u00a7 200, ECHR 2016). Moreover, having regard to the Court\u2019s case-law (see Schatschaschwili v. Germany ([GC], no. 9154/10, \u00a7 111-31, ECHR 2015), firstly, there must be a good reason for the non-attendance of a witness at the trial and, secondly, when a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence may have been restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6. Where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance in the case.",

Furthermore, given that the concern is to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court must review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors not only in cases in which the evidence given by an absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the accused\u2019s conviction. It must also do so in those cases where it finds it unclear whether the evidence in question was the sole or decisive basis but is nevertheless satisfied that it carried significant weight and that its admission may have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair will depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors will have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see Seton v. the United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, \u00a7 59, 12 September 2016).",

There is no evidence to corroborate the applicant\u2019s argument that the defence sought, albeit to no avail, to have the arresting officers examined at the trial. Although he did not seek examination of the officers at the appeal hearing, the applicant consistently continued to raise this matter in his statement of appeal and then in his review application. He argued that he had had no opportunity to examine them or have them examined prior to or during the trial (see, in the same vein, Craxi v. Italy (no. 1), no.\u00a034896/97, \u00a7\u00a7 90-93, 5 December 2002). Furthermore, while insisting that the reports did not amount to \u201cwitness evidence\u201d under the CAO (because they did not amount to testimony given to a competent official and had not been drawn up under oath), the Government have omitted to clarify whether it was at all permissible under the CAO to assert a right to examine arresting officers in open court in relation to such reports. It is noted in this connection that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling of 2005 envisages such a possibility in relation to officials who compile the administrative-offence record, but does not mention arresting officers (see paragraph 41 above).",

The Court, for its part, is not satisfied that the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the \u201cinterference\u201d under Article 10 of the Convention were sufficient for sentencing the applicant to two days\u2019 detention. Faced with the domestic courts\u2019 failure to give reasons that would be both relevant and sufficient to justify the interference, the Court finds that the domestic courts cannot be said to have applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 or to have based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, for a similar approach, Terentyev v. Russia, no.\u00a025147/09, \u00a7 24, 26\u00a0January 2017, and Annenkov and Others v. Russia, no. 31475/10, \u00a7 139, 25\u00a0July 2017).",
