The court held that the challenged provisions did not conflict with the Constitution, because such interference with the constitutional rights granted under Articles 30 (right to rehabilitation and compensation in criminal proceedings) and 33 (right to own and inherit property) of the Constitution was indispensable for the protection of the rights of other claimants under the Denationalisation Act, who were similarly entitled to reparation for the wrongs perpetrated in the aftermath of the Second World War (a joined decision no. U-I-60/98 of 16 July 1998). The principle of the Welfare State empowered the legislator, with due consideration paid to the right of all citizens to social security, to have regard to the financial resources of the State and, in cases which were constitutionally admissible, also to restrict certain rights accordingly.",

In substance, he also invoked Article 6 \u00a7 1 in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention, alleging that the challenged amendments discriminated against those claimants for the restitution of forfeited property whose restitution proceedings were still pending before the courts when the challenged legislation introducing a less favourable restitution regime entered into force. The applicant also complained that the challenged amendments breached his right to property as guaranteed under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, arguing that from the moment the criminal judgment was quashed, he had a right to obtain the full restitution of the property forfeited by the quashed judgment, as guaranteed by the Act on Implementation of Penal Sanctions at the material time, that is, before the challenged amendments entered into force. In addition, he claimed that the challenged amendments violated his right to full compensation for the wrongful conviction as guaranteed under Article 3 of Protocol No. 7. Finally, the applicant invoked Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a07 in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention, alleging that the challenged amendments deprived him of his property on a discriminatory basis, as before the challenged legislation entered into force the successful claimants were entitled to full restitution.",
