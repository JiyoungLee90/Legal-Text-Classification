When ratifying that Protocol (P7), Switzerland had made a reservation providing, inter alia, that \"[f]ollowing the entry into force of the revised provisions of the Swiss Civil Code of 5 October 1984, the provisions of Article 5 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-5) shall apply subject to ... the provisions of Federal Law concerning the family name (Articles 160 CC and 8a final section CC) ...\".
