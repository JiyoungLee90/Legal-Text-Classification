Pursuant to section\u00a030(2) of the Inheritance Act, where the defendant to such an action is not an heir-at-law, the plaintiff must have identified the entirety of the inheritance by means of an inventory (\u201c\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u201d), an official list drawn up by the district judge on the basis of the heir\u2019s statements describing all reported items of the deceased\u2019s estate.

The right to take steps for the preparation of an inventory may be exercised within three months after the heir has learned about his relative\u2019s death. This period may be extended by the District Court by up to three months (section 61 of the Inheritance Act of 1949).",

The court noted that there had been \u201csocial and legal changes\u201d since 1964, such as the inclusion in the Inheritance Act of more distant relatives as potential heirs and the restitution of property nationalised by the communist regime. In the court\u2019s opinion, those changes could effectively prevent successors by will or deed, if not closely related to the deceased, from knowing the exact scope of his or her assets, and hence from defending themselves successfully against heirs claiming that their right to a reserved share had been infringed by such dispositions. On the basis of those reasons, the court concluded that it was necessary to change the interpretation of the term \u201cheirs-at-law\u201d for the purposes of section 30(2) of the Inheritance Act to mean only heirs of immediate priority of succession, that is to say, only the individuals who effectively succeeded to the deceased\u2019s estate. As a result, since 4 February 2005, claiming an inheritance through an inventory has been considered a pre-requisite for bringing a claim against all successors by deed or will, save those with immediate priority of succession. The interpretative decision of 4\u00a0February 2005 did not envisage any interim rules or transition period for its application to pending proceedings.",

It held that in such cases the defendant had effectively succeeded to the estate of the deceased and therefore the disinherited plaintiff had not been required to make an inventory. It based its conclusion on its well-established case-law, according to which, in cases where the plaintiff had been disinherited in favour of the defendant, the former was only required to show his status of an heir entitled to a reserved share. The particular properties comprising the estate were of no relevance and the plaintiff was not required to produce evidence in that respect; in such cases the courts would reduce the dispositions made by the deceased in proportion to the reserved share of the plaintiff (\u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 752 \u043e\u0442 10.10.1994 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440.\u0434. \u2116\u00a0628/1994 \u0433., \u0406 \u0433.\u043e. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u041a\u0421; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 187 \u043e\u0442 20.04.2011 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440.\u0434. \u2116\u00a01780/2009 \u0433., \u0406 \u0433.\u043e. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u041a\u0421; \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 829 \u043e\u0442 23.10.2012 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440.\u0434. \u2116\u00a0619/2012 \u0433., \u0406 \u0433.\u043e. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u041a\u0421).

The heir may claim such a reduction against any beneficiary. It is only when the beneficiary is not an \u201cheir-at-law\u201d that the Act adds an additional requirement for bringing a claim: the inheritance must have been claimed through the preparation of an inventory, that is, a list of the property comprising the deceased\u2019s estate. The domestic courts uphold that procedural requirement only if they are satisfied that the defendant is not an \u201cheir-at-law\u201d.

According to that definition, \u201cheir-at-law\u201d meant any potential heir specified in the Inheritance Act of 1949 (see paragraph 16 above). Therefore, the Court considers that when the applicant brought his claim, he could reasonably have expected that his uncle (a potential heir under the Inheritance Act of 1949) would be considered by the courts as an \u201cheir-at-law\u201d and that the requirement to list the property comprising the estate in an inventory would not apply to his case. It was only after the delivery of the second instance\u2019s judgment in the applicant\u2019s case in 2005 that the SCC adopted a new interpretative decision, which changed the scope of the term \u201cheir-at-law\u201d to exclude the applicant\u2019s uncle from that category. The new interpretation not only prevented him from having his claim determined by a court, but it also became an insurmountable obstacle to any future attempts on his part to recover his reserved share, given that the time-limit for preparing an inventory had long expired (see paragraphs 7 and 14 above).",

While caselaw development is not, in itself, contrary to the proper administration of justice (see Legrand, cited above, \u00a7 37),\u00a0in previous cases where changes in domestic jurisprudence had affected pending civil proceedings, the Court was satisfied that the way in which the law had developed had been wellknown to the parties, or at least reasonably foreseeable, and that no uncertainty had existed as to their legal situation (see Un\u00e9dic v. France, no.\u00a020153/04, \u00a7 75, 18 December 2008; \u015een and Others v.

In Legrand the Court emphasised that the new legal principle introduced by the Court of Cassation, and which had the effect of thwarting the applicant\u2019s pending civil action, had its origin in the need to address inconsistencies in the case-law of which the applicant was aware at the time of initiating his proceedings (\u00a7 42). In C.R. v. the United\u00a0Kingdom (22\u00a0November 1995, \u00a7 41, Series A no. 335C), the Court found that the principle of legality was not breached where the development of the law in a particular area had reached a stage where judicial recognition was reasonably foreseeable. In Hoare ((dec.), cited above, \u00a7 55), which concerned a change of the law of limitation in sexual abuse cases, the Court noted that the unsatisfactory character of the law as it stood at the relevant time had been raised long before the proceedings against the applicant, and found that the departure from the previous case-law in the applicant\u2019s case had been no more than a reasonably foreseeable development of the law of limitation, which, moreover, had been very well explained and substantiated by the domestic courts.",

In its subsequent judgments the SCC found that the courts had interpreted the formal requirement for an inventory too strictly and had applied it even in cases where the defendant had succeeded to the deceased\u2019s entire estate (see paragraph 19 above). Thus, according to the SCC, the courts had unduly disregarded the well-established case-law according to which, in cases where the defendant had inherited the entire estate, the requirement for an inventory would not apply and the disinherited plaintiff would only be required to prove that he was entitled to a reserved share in that estate (ibid.). Therefore, in view of the state of the law resulting from the Inheritance Act of 1949 and the case-law of the SCC, it appears that at the relevant time the applicant was unable to reasonably foresee that an interpretation of the subsequently amended law would require him to make an inventory in order to claim his reserved share from his uncle at the time when this possibility was open to him. The Court is not convinced that the otherwise reasonable aim pursued by that requirement (see paragraph\u00a015 above) could not have been attained in an adversarial trial rather than by barring the applicant\u2019s claim, given that the success of such a claim depended on the plaintiff\u2019s ability to show that the dispositions made by his deceased\u2019s relative amounted to a certain portion of the estate affecting that plaintiff\u2019s reserved share. In the instant case the applicant was totally disinherited in favour of his uncle (see paragraphs 6 and 19 above). The Court further notes that the interpretative decision did not contain provisions on its applicability to pending proceedings. Regrettably, the SCC gave no consideration to those factors or to a possible different approach, but applied the new interpretation automatically, regardless of its consequences on the applicant\u2019s right to have his pending case determined on the merits. The extent of the prejudice suffered by the applicant thus sets his case apart from the applicants in the above-mentioned Legrand case in which the Court emphasised that the new legal principle established by the Court of Cassation did not in the circumstances of the applicants\u2019 case have the effect of depriving them \u2013 even retrospectively \u2013 of their right to access to court (see \u00a7 41 of that judgment).",
