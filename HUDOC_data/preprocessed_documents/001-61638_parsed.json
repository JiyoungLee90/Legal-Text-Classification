It stated that from 1982 onwards it should have been possible to \u201chave a clear idea of the loss of integrity resulting from membership of the Freemasons ... because of the degeneration brought about when a number of people came together within the P2 lodge with plans to take control of the public authorities and subvert democratic institutions, and because of the collusion of certain Masonic lodges with the Mafia and organised crime\u201d. The disciplinary section added that the directives issued by the National Council of the Judiciary on 22\u00a0March 1990 and 14 July 1993 (see paragraphs 21 and 22 below), which emphasised \u2013 the second one in particular \u2013 the substantial conflict between membership of the Freemasons and membership of the judiciary, were to be seen in the context of such developments. The decision also stated that it was contrary to disciplinary rules for a judge to be a Freemason, for the following reasons: the incompatibility between the Masonic and judicial oaths, the hierarchical relationship between Freemasons, the \u201crejection\u201d of State justice in favour of Masonic \u201cjustice\u201d and, lastly, the indissoluble nature of the bond between Freemasons, even in the case of a member who wished to leave the organisation.",

The Constitutional Court subsequently reiterated that the earlier laws governing the same subject matter had included a provision of general scope alongside the provisions penalising specific conduct, that the proposals for reform in this field had always been worded in general terms and that the same was true for other professional categories. It concluded: \u201cThe provisions in this area cannot but be of general scope because specific guidelines would have the effect of legitimising types of conduct which were not expressly mentioned, but which nonetheless attracted society's opprobrium.\u201d It added that those considerations justified the broad scope of the rule and the wide margin of appreciation conferred on a body which, acting within the guarantees inherent in any judicial procedure, was \u2013 by virtue of its composition \u2013 particularly well qualified to assess whether the conduct considered in each case did or did not undermine the protected values (ibid., \u00a7 5).",

That report should have left absolutely no doubt in the bona fide conscience of any Italian judge about the irreversible conflict arising between the exercise of judicial power and membership of Masonic lodges.

The question is whether, in the case under consideration, the conduct found to be incompatible with that prohibition (membership of a Masonic lodge) in the light of the disciplinary body's factual findings was behaviour which it was reasonably possible would be considered as falling within the scope of the prohibited conduct. In this connection, it should be noted that the record shows that the disciplinary body took the following elements into account in reaching the conclusion that the applicant had engaged in prohibited conduct.",

However, this directive simply expressed formally what was already known to be the position in practice, for example the fact that the association was secretive. The fact that Masonic lodges kept their functions, ceremonies and procedures secret is a matter of public knowledge and should have been known to the applicant. The directive of 14 July 1993 did not make that fact known for the first time but simply confirmed it formally. The other elements also relied on by the disciplinary body, as mentioned above, should also have been known to any person in the applicant's position and by themselves justify the conclusion that it would not have been difficult for him in the circumstances to foresee at least that there was a risk that his membership of a Masonic lodge might reasonably be considered a disciplinary offence. That is so even if we act on the premiss that the directive of 22 March 1990 did not clearly state in so many words that membership of the Freemasons constituted a disciplinary offence for a judge.",

As I have already said, the directive in question simply expressed formally the existing position regarding conduct which any person in the applicant's position would regard as being reasonably likely to constitute a disciplinary offence. The directive did not purport to introduce for the first time a new principle. It merely clarified an already existing principle, thus removing any doubts. In any event, the other facts on which the disciplinary decision was based did exist and were undisputed at the material time and could, as I have already explained, reasonably support a finding that a disciplinary offence had been committed.",
