Other than paying the sum owed to the applicants on the basis of the final judgment, the authorities have neither acknowledged a breach of the applicants\u2019 rights, nor afforded redress for the delay in payment of more than three years. The Court has already established, including in the context of Bulgarian cases before it, that the prolonged failure of State bodies to enforce a final judgment in accordance with which they owed the payment of a sum of money breached both Article 6 \u00a7 1 and Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 (see Mancheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61\u201362 and \u00a7\u00a7 66\u201368; Sirmanov v.

The Court accordingly finds in the present case that, by failing for over three years to comply with the enforceable judgment in the applicants\u2019 favour, the domestic authorities prevented them from receiving an amount of money they could reasonably have expected to receive and deprived the provision of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of all useful effect.",
