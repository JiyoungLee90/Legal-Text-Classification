The Court's task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see Van Mechelen and Others, cited above, \u00a7 50, and De Lorenzo v. Italy (dec.), no. 69264/01, 12 February 2004). As the requirements of paragraph 3 of Article 6 are to be seen as particular aspects of the right to a fair trial guaranteed by paragraph 1, the Court will examine the present case under both provisions taken together (see, among many other authorities, Van Geyseghem v. Belgium [GC], no.\u00a026103/95, \u00a7 27, ECHR 1999-I).",

There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence; as a general rule, paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6 require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he makes his statements or at a later stage (see L\u00fcdi v. Switzerland, judgment of 15 June 1992, \u00a7 49, Series A no.\u00a0238, and Van Mechelen and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051). As the Court has stated on a number of occasions (see, among other authorities, Isgr\u00f2 v. , 19 February 1991, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 194-A, and L\u00fcdi, cited above, \u00a7 47), it may prove necessary in certain circumstances for the judicial authorities to refer to depositions made during the investigative stage. If the defendant has been given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge the depositions, either when made or at a later stage, their admission in evidence will not in itself contravene Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d). The corollary of that, however, is that the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the requirements of Article 6 if the conviction is based solely, or in a decisive manner, on the depositions of a witness whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined either during the investigation or at the trial (see A.M. v. Italy, no.\u00a037019/97, \u00a7\u00a025, ECHR 1999-IX, and Sa\u00efdi v. France, 20 September 1993, \u00a7\u00a7 43-44, Series A no.\u00a0261-C).",

It does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused's behalf: its essential aim, as is indicated by the words \u201cunder the same conditions\u201d, is full equality of arms in the matter. The concept of \u201cequality of arms\u201d does not, however, exhaust the content of paragraph 3 (d) of Article 6, nor that of paragraph 1, of which this phrase represents one application among many others. It is not enough to prove that the \u201caccused\u201d was unable to question a certain witness for the defence. He must also put forward a plausible argument that the appearance of the witness was necessary for ascertaining the truth and that the failure to examine the witness prejudiced the rights of the defence (see, among other authorities, Priebke v. Italy (dec.), no.\u00a048799/99, 5 April 2001). Accordingly, only exceptional circumstances may prompt the Court to conclude that the failure to hear a person as a witness was incompatible with Article 6 (see Bricmont v.

It cannot speculate as to the outcome of the trial had the applicant had the benefit of the safeguards set forth in Article 6 of the Convention. It accordingly dismisses the applicant's claim in respect of pecuniary damage. On the other hand, the applicant undeniably sustained non-pecuniary damage as a result of the breach, although it is difficult to quantify the damage. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41, the Court therefore awards him the sum of EUR 4,000.",

The Court reiterates that, where it finds that an applicant has been convicted after not being afforded one of the safeguards of a fair trial, the most appropriate form of redress would, in principle, be trial de novo or the reopening of the proceedings, in due course and in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v.
