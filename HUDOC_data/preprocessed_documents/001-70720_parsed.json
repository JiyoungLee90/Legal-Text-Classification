The applicants submitted that the public prosecutor's office took no action against those involved in the incidents. However, criminal proceedings for inciting discord were brought against four members of the party, including the second and third applicants, under Article 192 of the Criminal Code.

It had been used as the rallying cry of forces seeking to capture the town of Florina during the civil war in . In the Government's view, feelings of discord among the inhabitants of Florina could be provoked simply by mentioning this term, since it reminded them of the civil war which followed the Second World War, and during which lives were lost and properties destroyed. The Government added that the sign had been removed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, the applicants had put the sign back. In addition, the Government claimed that the local police had not adopted a passive attitude towards the incidents stirred up by the crowd. In this connection, they stressed that when the sign had been taken down by the police officers, police intervention had not been necessary because the tension in the crowd had subsided anyway. The police could not have predicted that the situation would deteriorate in the following hours and thus could not have acted accordingly.",

Moreover, putting the sign back had not been unlawful but had been consonant with their freedom of political expression. Concerning the attack on the party headquarters, they maintained that it had been instigated by the clergy and town council of Florina. With the aid of municipal civil servants, some of the town councillors had participated, together with the crowd, in the acts of criminal damage. Lastly, they noted that the police had failed in their obligation to intervene in order to prevent the headquarters from being ransacked and had not conducted an effective investigation with the aim of arresting and punishing those responsible.",

Turkey, judgment of 30 January 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, p. 17, \u00a7 25). It is in the nature of the role they play that political parties, the only bodies which can come to power, also have the capacity to influence the whole of the regime in their countries. By the proposals for an overall societal model which they put before the electorate and by their capacity to implement those proposals once they come to power, political parties differ from other organisations which intervene in the political arena. In view of their role, any measure taken against them affects freedom of association and therefore the state of democracy in the country concerned (see Socialist Party of Turkey (STP) and Others v. , no. 26482/95, \u00a7 36, 12 November 2003).",

The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion (see Gorzelik and Others v.  [GC], no. 44158/98, \u00a7 92, ECHR 2004-I). Accordingly, the fact that their activities form part of a collective exercise of freedom of expression also entitles political parties to seek the protection of Article\u00a010 of the Convention (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others, cited above, pp. 20-21, \u00a7 43). As the Court has often reiterated, the protection of opinions and the freedom to express them is one of the objectives of the freedom of association as enshrined in Article 11.",

Italy, judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no.\u00a037, pp. 15-16, \u00a7 33, and, more recently, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others, cited above, pp. 18-19, \u00a7 33). It follows from that finding that a genuine and effective respect for freedom of association cannot be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere; a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the purpose of Article 11 nor with that of the Convention in general. There may thus be positive obligations to secure the effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of association (see Wilson, National Union of Journalists and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 30668/96, 30671/96 and 30678/96, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2002-V) even in the sphere of relations between individuals (see Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d v. , judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 139, p. 12, \u00a7 32). Accordingly, it is incumbent upon public authorities to guarantee the proper functioning of an association or political party, even when they annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the lawful ideas or claims that they are seeking to promote. Their members must be able to hold meetings without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents. Such a fear would be liable to deter other associations or political parties from openly expressing their opinions on highly controversial issues affecting the community. In a democracy the right to counter-demonstrate cannot extend to inhibiting the exercise of the right of association (see, mutatis mutandis, Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d, ibid.).",

The emergence of tensions is one of the unavoidable consequences of pluralism, that is to say the free discussion of all political ideas. Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing political groups tolerate each other (see Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d, cited above, p. 12, \u00a7 32, and Serif v. , no. 38178/97, \u00a7\u00a053, ECHR 1999-IX).",

Its ambiguous connotations were liable to offend the political or patriotic views of the majority of the population of Florina.

They thus contributed through their conduct to arousing the hostile sentiment of a section of the population against the applicants. The Court considers that the role of State authorities is to defend and promote the values inherent in a democratic system, such as pluralism, tolerance and social cohesion. In the present case, it would have been more in keeping with those values for the local authorities to advocate a conciliatory stance, rather than to stir up confrontational attitudes.",

In this connection it notes that they could reasonably have foreseen the danger that the tension would boil over into violence and clear violations of freedom of association. The day that the sign in question was put back, groups of people had gathered in front of the party headquarters shouting insults and threats at the applicants. The State should therefore have taken appropriate measures to prevent or, at least, contain the violence. However, the Court cannot but find that the public authorities failed to take the measures necessary in the circumstances of the case. The Court thus observes that, when the headquarters were being attacked, the applicants allegedly called several times for the assistance of the police, who were located 500 metres away. They justified their failure to intervene by claiming that no officers were available to be dispatched to the scene. However, the Government gave no explanation for the lack of police manpower even though the incidents had been predictable. Further, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the public prosecutor did not consider it necessary to start an investigation in the wake of the incidents to determine responsibility. It was only once the applicants had lodged a complaint that the investigation began. In cases of interference with freedom of association by acts of individuals, the competent authorities have an additional obligation to take effective investigative measures (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem v. , no. 23144/93, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2000-III).",
