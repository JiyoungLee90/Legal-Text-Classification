As regards the qualification of that term by the domestic courts, the Court observes that they did not accept the applicant's argument that it was a value-judgment but considered it to be a statement of fact, indicating that Mr Terentyev was a member of a neofascist political party. In the Russian courts' view, being designated a \u201cneofascist\u201d was defamatory for Mr Terentyev as a public figure and the son of the Second World War veteran. As Mr Terentyev was not a member of any neofascist party and the criminal charge of incitement to ethnic hatred was not maintained against him, they held the applicant responsible for having failed to prove the truthfulness of that expression (see paragraph 16 above).",

In the applicant's publication Mr Terentyev's name was mentioned in the context of a meeting of the Russian nationalist movement. The regional prosecutor determined that the publications in Mr Terentyev's newspaper targeted the Jewish religion and symbols, describing them in an inimical way, and propagated fallacious stories about the \u201cworld Jewish masonry\u201d (see paragraph 15 above). Against this background, the Court considers that the term \u201clocal neofascist\u201d, taken in its context, should be understood in the sense given to it by the applicant, namely describing a general political affiliation with the ideology of racial distinctions and anti-Semitism (see, mutatis mutandis, Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft, cited above, \u00a7 39, and also paragraph 28 above).",

It has been the Court's constant view that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article\u00a010 (see Grinberg, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30-31, with further references). Nevertheless, even a value-judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive. The question therefore remains whether a sufficient factual basis for such a value-judgment existed (see , \u00a7\u00a7 44-45; Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft, \u00a7 40; and Feldek, \u00a7 86, all cited above). In this regard, the Court notes that the applicant offered documentary evidence, including the past issues of the Kolokol newspaper published by Mr Terentyev and several reports by independent experts. Having examined these publications, the experts unanimously concluded to their marked anti-Semitic nature and their propinquity with the ideals of the National Socialism (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above).",

The domestic courts, nevertheless, refused to consider this evidence and relied instead on a study carried out in the criminal proceedings against Mr\u00a0Terentyev on the charge of incitement to ethnic hatred. The Court is struck by the inconsistent approach of the Russian courts on the one hand requiring proof of a statement and on the other hand refusing to consider the readily available evidence (see Jerusalem, cited above, \u00a7 45). It further recalls that the degree of precision for establishing the well-foundedness of a criminal charge by a competent court can hardly be compared to that which ought to be observed by a journalist when expressing his opinion on a matter of public concern, for the standards applied when assessing someone's political opinions in terms of morality are quite different from those required for establishing an offence under criminal law (see Scharsach, loc. cit.; Unabh\u00e4ngige Initiative Informationsvielfalt v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a028525/95, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2002I; and Wirtschafts-Trend Zeitschriften-Verlags GmbH v.\u00a0, no.\u00a058547/00, \u00a7\u00a039, 27 October 2005).",

That the proceedings were civil rather than criminal in nature and the final award was relatively small does not detract from the fact that the standards applied by the Russian courts were not compatible with the principles embodied in Article 10 since they did not adduce \u201csufficient\u201d reasons justifying the interference at issue. Therefore, the Court considers that the domestic courts overstepped the narrow margin of appreciation afforded to them for restrictions on debates of public interest and that the interference was disproportionate to the aim pursued and not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",
