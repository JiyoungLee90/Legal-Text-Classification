Secondly, the detention order had also been contrary to the domestic law in so far as the applicant had provided all the relevant documentation on his arrival, and he had not been requested to provide anything further.

Moreover, such a document was not required by Regulation 9(3) of the Procedural Standards Regulations. Furthermore, no assessment as to the necessity of the applicant\u2019s detention had been carried out by the immigration authorities, and their conclusion that such document would not be provided if the applicant was at liberty had no foundation.

It considered that until a State had \u201cauthorised\u201d entry to the country, any entry was \u201cunauthorised\u201d and the detention of a person who wished to effect entry and who needed but did not yet have authorisation to do so, could be, without any distortion of language, to \u201cprevent his effecting an unauthorised entry\u201d. It did not accept that, as soon as an asylum seeker had surrendered himself to the immigration authorities, he was seeking to effect an \u201cauthorised\u201d entry, with the result that detention could not be justified under the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) (\u00a7 65). It considered that to interpret the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) as permitting detention only of a person who was shown to be trying to evade entry restrictions would be to place too narrow a construction on the terms of the provision and on the power of the State to exercise its undeniable right of control referred to above. Such an interpretation would, moreover, be inconsistent with Conclusion No. 44 of the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\u2019 Programme, the UNHCR\u2019s Guidelines and the Committee of Ministers\u2019 Recommendation (see \u00a7\u00a7 34-35 and \u00a7 37 of the Saadi judgment), all of which envisaged the detention of asylum seekers in certain circumstances, for example while identity checks were taking place or when elements on which the asylum claim was based had to be determined. However, detention had to be compatible with the overall purpose of Article\u00a05, which was to safeguard the right to liberty and ensure that noone should be dispossessed of his or her liberty in an arbitrary fashion (ibid., \u00a7\u00a066).",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 67).",

Secondly, in the Court\u2019s view, the evaluation made by the authorities upon the applicant\u2019s arrival cannot be considered unreasonable. It is noted that the applicant failed to specify what documents other than his national passport he had presented to the authorities on his arrival. However, it is not disputed that he had not supplied documentation confirming his allegation that he had already been granted refugee status in Armenia. It does not appear unreasonable for the domestic authorities to have expected such documentation to be submitted, nor is it unreasonable to consider that the applicant might abscond, given his clear intention to travel to Italy (see paragraph 8 above). It follows that the applicant\u2019s detention was closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government. Moreover, while it was true that the authorities only specified their request at a later date, the applicant had been immediately informed that not sufficient documentation had been provided (see paragraph 9 above). He could thus have provided any further documentation supporting his allegations concerning his \u201cbackground\u201d \u201ccountry and place of previous residence\u201d and/or \u201cprevious applications for international protection\u201d (elements set out in Regulation 9(3) of the Procedural Standards Regulations) of his own motion at any time prior to the specific request regarding the alleged grant of refugee status in Armenia. The Court also considers that after the overhaul in domestic law and practice which ensued subsequent to the judgment of Suso Musa, there is no reason to consider that the detention in the present case was not carried out in good faith. Furthermore, the applicant has not complained that the place and conditions of detention were not appropriate. Lastly, the Court considers that the length of the detention (less than two months) cannot be considered as having exceeded that reasonably required for the purpose pursued.",

Furthermore, the Government relied on Regulation 6(3) of the Reception Regulations which guaranteed a speedy review, i.e. a review within seven working days which could be extended only once for another seven working days. If a person is still in detention after two months, then another automatic review takes place two months after the initial review. According to the Government the speediness of this review was evident from the circumstances of the present case, where the applicant was released within two months of his detention order. The Government also referred to constitutional redress proceedings claiming that the Court should examine whether any developments occurred domestically. In particular they relied on a court decree no. 50/2013 in the case of Emmanuel Camilleri vs Inspector Louise Calleja and the Commissioner of Police, whereby the courts of constitutional competence ordered, as an interim measure, the release of a person serving a prison sentence pending the outcome of the constitutional redress proceedings.

It is not excluded that a system of automatic periodic review of the lawfulness of detention by a court may ensure compliance with the requirements of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 (see Megyeri v.\u00a0Germany, 12\u00a0May 1992, \u00a7\u00a022, Series A no.\u00a0237A).

It therefore considered that shorter intervals between reviews are necessary for detention pending deportation or extradition as compared to detention after conviction by a competent court or detention of persons of unsound mind. Indeed, the factors affecting the lawfulness of detention are likely to evolve faster in situations where the proceedings are continuing (as in cases of detention with a view to extradition) than in situations where the proceedings have been closed after the establishment of all relevant circumstances (as in cases where a conviction has been pronounced by a competent court or compulsory psychiatric treatment ordered by a court on the basis of medical reports confirming the person\u2019s dangerousness). At the same time, given the limited scope of the review of the lawfulness of detention required under Article\u00a05 \u00a7 4 in extradition cases \u2013 which does not extend, for example, to the questions whether the detention was \u201cnecessary\u201d for the prevention of crime or fleeing \u2013 the review need not be as frequent as in cases of deprivation of liberty under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 (c) (see Abdulkhakov, cited above, \u00a7 214). Thus, the Court has, for example found, that intervals between periodic reviews of detention ranging from two to four months were compatible with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Soliyev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 62400/10, \u00a7\u00a7 57-62, 5 June 2012, and Khodzhamberdiyev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 64809/10, \u00a7\u00a7 108-114, 5 June 2012). However, it is not the Court\u2019s task to attempt to rule as to the maximum period of time between reviews which should automatically apply to a certain category of detainees. The question of whether periods comply with the requirement must be determined in the light of the circumstances of each case (see Abdulkhakov, cited above, \u00a7 215).",

The Court observes that his first review was meant to take place automatically within seven working days, that is, at the latest on 20\u00a0September (as 10 and 11 and 17 and 18 September were Saturdays and Sundays respectively i.e. non-working days). However, on 20\u00a0September no review took place as a Board member was abroad. As allowed by law (Regulation 6(3) of the Reception Regulations) the Board could have extended the period by another seven working days. Given that the 21\u00a0September was a public holiday i.e. a non-working day, the next review was to be held by the latest 30 September (24 and 25 September being a Saturday and Sunday i.e. nonworking days) - date on which the Board actually convened. Therefore, the Court notes that, when the Board reconvened on 30\u00a0September they were still within the maximum domestic timelimit. On that day, given that his other lawyer of choice was abroad the case was put off to 5 October 2016. On the latter date the Board explained to the applicant why it had not been able to comply with the deadline provided by law for his first review; it considered his situation and gave reasons for its decision to continue the applicant\u2019s detention (see paragraph\u00a018 above). At the same time it also gave instructions in connection with any future assessment (see paragraph 19 above), which according to domestic law should have taken place two months after the initial assessment. However, this never took place in the present case given that the applicant was released on 8\u00a0November 2016, a little more than a month after his initial review. Thus, the Court notes that the procedural irregularity in this case was that the applicant did not have an automatic review within the first seven working days and that the period for review was not properly extended. Nevertheless, the hearing took place within the maximum timelimit provided by law and it was only adjourned because one of the applicant\u2019s lawyers of choice was abroad.",

Therefore the Court will proceed on the assumption that it is (compare Louled Massoud, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044). The Court further considers that while under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 detention which is not compliant with domestic law induces a violation of that provision, a breach of time-limits for automatic reviews established in law does not necessarily amount to a violation of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04, if the proceedings by which the lawfulness of an applicant\u2019s detention were examined were nonetheless decided speedily. The Court notes that, in the present case, despite certain irregularities (the fact that the applicant did not have his initial automatic review within seven working days of the start of his detention as provided by domestic law, nor was this period extended in line with the regular practice) the time which elapsed until his first review, i.e. twenty running days  which due to a postponement became twenty-five running days  cannot be considered unreasonable.",
