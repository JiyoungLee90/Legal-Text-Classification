In this respect, the Court notes that the Constitutional Court is obliged to reopen the proceedings, under Rule 68(2) of its Rules, following a judgment in which this Court has found a violation of the right of access to a court before the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 20 above). In this connection the Court reiterates that in detention cases where an applicant is still in custody at the time of the examination of his appeals by the domestic courts, a complaint concerning access to a court is to be examined under Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Reinprecht, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 48, 52 and 55; see also, a contrario and mutatis mutandis, Lazoroski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 4922/04, \u00a7 66, 8 October 2009, and Stephens v.

The respondent State remains, in principle, free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment (see, mutatis mutandis, Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2006 III, and Simeonovi v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 21980/04, \u00a7 149, ECHR 2017 (extracts)). This discretion as to the manner of execution of a judgment reflects the freedom of choice attached to the primary obligation of the Contracting States under the Convention to secure the rights and freedoms guaranteed (see Assanidze v.\u00a0Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 202, ECHR 2004II).",

In other exceptional cases, the nature of the violation found may be such as to leave no real choice as to the measures required to remedy it and the Court may decide to indicate only one such measure (see Assanidze, cited above, \u00a7 202, and Del R\u00edo Prada v. Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, \u00a7 138, ECHR 2013). Having regard to its finding in the instant case, the Court considers that it belongs to this last-mentioned category. Therefore, the respondent State must secure the re-examination of the applicant\u2019s case before the Constitutional Court in accordance with Rule 68(2) of the Rules of the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 20 and 38 above).",
