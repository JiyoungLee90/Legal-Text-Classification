It was established that the bruises and abrasions had been caused by a blunt hard object with a limited damage-causing surface. Traumatic force (blows and friction) had been applied to the area around the right eye, left cheek, back, intercostal space near the ninth left rib and the area around the left collar bone. All of the abrasions and bruises could have been caused either while A.T. was still alive or within a short period of his death, but there was no causal connection between the injuries and his death. The scratches had been caused by a sharp-edged object (a blade) shortly (up to twenty-four hours) before A.T.\u2019s death.

Prior to his being drafted into the army, A.T. had been examined by a panel of doctors, including a psychiatrist, and found fit for military service. During psychological aptitude testing he had been assigned to the third (second lowest) group in terms of psychological stability (the lowest group containing the least psychologically stable recruits most likely to suffer a nervous breakdown). In August 1999, during his military service, A.T. had been examined by a psychiatrist and found fit. In September 2000 he had again been examined by a psychiatrist after complaining of low mood, depression and anxiety for his future. He was diagnosed with \u201csituational neurotic (psychological) reaction\u201d. Later that month he had undergone an outpatient forensic psychiatric examination in connection with a crime he had committed on 24\u00a0September 2000 (violence against his military superior), which established that he had not been suffering from a psychiatric disorder. Having examined the case material, the expert arrived at the conclusion that A.T. had been emotionally unstable: he had suffered mood swings (as per references from the technical training college where A.T. had studied before being drafted into the army), and had had a history of disorderly conduct (as per police records). During A.T.\u2019s military service this emotional instability had shown itself in repeated breaches of military discipline and in his having committed a crime. The expert concluded that having such a personality, A.T. could have developed \u201chystero-depressive reaction\u201d and committed suicide. It transpired from the report that A.T.\u2019s elder brother, a military serviceman born in 1974, had himself committed suicide in 1996.",

His emotional state had been affected by an accumulation of negative thoughts and his character traits, which included: a high affiliative need, egoism, heightened sensitivity, impressionability, poor moral and professional judgment, an unwillingness to carry out his military service, a grudge against his parents and girlfriend, a misinterpretation of the federal legislation introducing amendments to the Criminal Code, a tendency to accumulate negative thoughts, vanity, emotional liability, concerns about strict discipline and monotonous activities, a tendency to overdramatise events, mental immaturity, a limited outlook, low adaptability and impulsiveness.

He submitted that on 13\u00a0April 2001 he had taken up his duty on watch at the canteen together with nineteen soldiers, including A.T. He had known A.T. to be a quiet, modest soldier who had never been bullied. He had been behaving quietly on duty that night and had been in a normal mood. He had made no health-related complaints and had not had any injuries prior to taking up his duties at the canteen; his appetite had also been good. Kudryashov had never noticed anything odd about A.T.\u2019s behaviour to suggest he had been suffering from any mental health issues. After cleaning up the canteen, he had been lining up the soldiers to send them to their division when he had realised that A.T. had gone missing. He had organised a search of the canteen and had then found him locked inside the toilet. He had called A.T.\u2019s name, but no response had followed. He had then ordered one of the soldiers to force open the door. When soldier V. had broken it down they had seen A.T. hanging by a belt. His face had been white. Kudryashov had then ordered soldiers V., Kob. and Bak. to remove A.T.\u2019s body from the noose. He had then reported the incident to the duty officer and called for the duty medical assistant. Soldiers V., Kob. and Bak. had removed A.T.\u2019s body and Kob. had attempted to give A.T. mouthtomouth, but to no avail. The duty medical assistant had arrived almost immediately and started giving A.T. mouth-to-mouth and injections. However, A.T. had not regained consciousness. His body had been taken to the military hospital. Kudryashov did not know the reasons or motives for A.T.\u2019s death.",

He was further instructed to question other people referred to by the applicant and to carry out all the investigative measures necessary to ascertain the applicant\u2019s arguments; to eliminate any eventual contradictions in the evidence by carrying out confrontation parades; to seize the letters sent by A.T. to his parents, to question the applicant, if necessary, regarding the contents of those letters; to check the statements of those who had been on duty at the canteen with A.T. between 13\u00a0and 14\u00a0April 2001 more thoroughly, in particular, to question Sgt Kudryashov and Ptes S., D., Vol., Bog., Sk. and Yar., using a polygraph; and to question the polygrapher about the mechanics of the polygraph machine, the method of questioning used and the reliability of the results. The investigator was further instructed to question the military unit and division command. In addition to standard questioning, the investigator was instructed to enquire, in particular, why the military command had not provided A.T. with increased and more timely attention, and what the essence of the amendments to the Criminal Code were that A.T. could have misinterpreted.",

He had known from the third disciplinary military unit that A.T. had been a calm, quiet person who had behaved normally and manifested no signs of psychiatric problems; he had never been regarded as someone inclined to behave thoughtlessly, whether by running away or committing suicide. After A.T.\u2019s death, his personnel file had been studied more closely, and it had come to light that A.T.\u2019s brother had also committed suicide, which might have suggested that suicidal tendencies had run in his family. In addition, an unsent letter had been found among A.T.\u2019s personal belongings, in which he talked about a grudge he had against his parents and girlfriend. Moreover, for reasons outside command control, A.T.\u2019s conditional release might have been considerably delayed, which might have had a serious effect on his mental state. Cdr Luzin concluded that all the above-mentioned reasons, together with A.T.\u2019s character traits, might have influenced his decision to commit suicide.",

The applicant\u2019s son\u2019s body had been subjected to a post-mortem, which disclosed multiple ante mortem injuries. Taking into account the results of that examination, the investigating authority had examined whether the applicant\u2019s son had possibly been driven to commit suicide or whether he was murdered and his death made to look like suicide. The applicant\u2019s son\u2019s fellow recruits had been subjected to polygraph testing and two independent psychological autopsies had been carried out in respect of the applicant\u2019s son. On the basis of that evidence and other material, the investigating authority had established that, being in a state of acute emotional stress which had led to depression, the applicant\u2019s son had died from suicide by hanging.

Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned, but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7 69, and Aksoy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54).",

Russia (dec.), no.\u00a049790/99, 14\u00a0October 2003). Therefore, in the ordinary course of events such an appeal might be regarded as a possible remedy where the prosecution has decided not to investigate the claims. The Court, however, has strong doubts as to whether this remedy would have been effective in the circumstances of the present case. As mentioned above, prior to the decision of 20\u00a0October 2004, the investigating authorities ordered that the proceedings be terminated on four occasions, on 16\u00a0July and 23\u00a0August 2001, 31\u00a0August 2002 and 29\u00a0May 2004, referring to the same grounds, namely lack of evidence (see paragraphs 20, 26, 29 and 35 above). Those decisions were subsequently set aside by a higher-ranking prosecutor and, on one occasion, by the court, and the case was repeatedly referred back for further investigation (see paragraphs 21, 28, 33, 34 and 37 above). In such circumstances, the Court is not convinced that another appeal to a court, which could only have had the same outcome, would have offered the applicant any redress. It considers, therefore, that such an appeal would have been devoid of any purpose. The Court finds that the applicant was not obliged to pursue that remedy, and holds that the Government\u2019s objection should therefore be dismissed (see, for example, Ryabtsev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a013642/06, \u00a7\u00a059, 14\u00a0November 2013; Nitsov v.

According to the blood alcohol level, such a concentration (0.20% to 0.29%) corresponds to rather severe alcohol intoxication which, in terms of behaviour, manifests itself in stupor, the loss of ability to understand, impaired sensations and the possibility of falling unconscious, and in terms of impairments \u2013 severe motor impairment, loss of consciousness and memory blackouts. Blood alcohol levels exceeding 0.30% are potentially fatal. The Court is struck by the fact that at no time during the investigation did the investigating authority take into account the fact that A.T. had died while severely intoxicated, nor did it try to find out how this had become possible in a disciplinary military unit. It is inexplicable why no questions to this effect had been put before the military unit command, A.T.\u2019s immediate superiors, his fellow soldiers and the experts, and why nobody referred to it during questioning.",
