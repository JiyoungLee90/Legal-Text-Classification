They further pointed out that court fees were required in order to ensure the proper administration of justice and prevent vexatious applications. In their observations the Government contended that the decisions regarding legal aid had been made by the judges on the basis of the case file and that there was no obligation for them to grant it under the domestic law. They argued that in the instant case the applicant had failed to submit the documents attesting to his poverty.

This is particularly so of the right of access to court in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial. It is central to the concept of a fair trial, in civil as in criminal proceedings, that a litigant is not denied the opportunity to present his or her case effectively before the court and that he or she is able to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2005II).",

Poland, no. 28249/95, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2001VI, and Mehmet and Suna Yi\u011fit v. Turkey, no. 52658/99, \u00a7 33, 17 July 2007). The institution of a legal aid scheme constitutes one of those means. It may therefore be acceptable to impose conditions on the grant of legal aid on the basis, inter alia, of the financial situation of the litigant or his or her prospects of success in the proceedings (see Steel and Morris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62 and Wieczorek v. Poland, no. 18176/05, \u00a7 37, 8 December 2009). The question whether the provision of legal aid is necessary for a fair hearing must be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of each case and will depend, inter alia, upon the importance of what is at stake for the applicant in the proceedings, the complexity of the relevant law and procedure and the applicant\u2019s capacity to represent him or herself effectively.",

Having found a violation of this provision (see paragraphs 17-20 above), the Court considers that there is no need to make a separate ruling on the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article\u00a03 of the Convention. In reaching this decision the Court has particular regard to the fact that the applicant\u2019s compensation claim was not examined by the Supreme Military Administrative Court and that the Court cannot determine the issue as a first instance court itself (see Mehmet and Suna Yi\u011fit, cited above, \u00a7 43).",

The Court finds that this principle applies in the present case as well. Consequently, it considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to quash or otherwise set aside the Supreme Military Administrative Court\u2019s decision dated 4 February 2009 (see paragraph 10 above) and restart the proceedings, in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, should the applicant so request (see mutatis mutandis, \u015eirin\u00a0v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 47328/99, \u00a7 30, 15 March 2005).",
