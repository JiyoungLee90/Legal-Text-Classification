The confiscation proceedings were in no way related to the applicant who bought the lorry from the company M. almost a year after the confiscation order had become final. He neither participated in the criminal proceedings against Mr I.A., nor could he have challenged the confiscation order. The lorry was de facto confiscated from the applicant almost three years after the confiscation order had become final and more than eight years after the crime had been committed (see paragraphs 7, 8 and\u00a010 above). No explanation was provided for this delay.",

In such circumstances, it appears that the applicant was deprived of any possibility to argue his case (see, mutatis mutandis, Andonoski, cited above, \u00a7 38). Indeed, the domestic courts did not consider the relationship between the applicant\u2019s conduct and the offence. Although they established that the applicant had been the bona fide owner of the lorry, notably he had not been aware at that time that the lorry had been used for commission of an offence (see paragraph 17 above), they did not examine that fact in connection with the proportionality of the impugned measure. The Court observes in this connection that domestic legislation was subsequently amended to accommodate such considerations (see paragraph 24 above). In the applicant\u2019s case, his circumstances and behaviour were considered only with regard to the possibility of initiating proceedings against Mr I.A. (see paragraph 17 above).",

Moreover, the domestic courts did not give any weight to the argument that the applicant had been lawfully making his living by using the lorry (see paragraph 14 above).\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, the Court notes the scanty reasoning that the domestic courts gave for dismissing the applicant\u2019s alternative claim for compensation of his own investments in the lorry.",

Notwithstanding that the domestic authorities were aware of that fact, they nevertheless stated that the applicant could be indemnified from him (see paragraphs 17 and 20). The respondent Government were also guided by similar considerations (see paragraph 37 above). In this connection the Court notes that it was not presented with any illustration of domestic practice that showed that a claim against heirs of a deceased seller (Mr I.A. in the present case) had been effective in similar circumstances to the applicant\u2019s case. Furthermore, the Court notes that Mr\u00a0I.A. died in Austria in 2005 and that no information was available as to the whereabouts of his heirs and whether they could be held responsible under the applicable rules (see paragraph 28 above) for his actions. In the Court\u2019s opinion, it would be an excessive burden for the applicant to seek to establish these issues in fresh proceedings.",
