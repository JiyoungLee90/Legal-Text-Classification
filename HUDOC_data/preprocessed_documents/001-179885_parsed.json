It had not been until 2006 that the Supreme Court had held that the sole fact that the storehouses had been sited on a specific plot of land, without any proof that a residential building had been sited there, did not mean that there had previously been a residential property there (see paragraph 56 below). The District Court further held that in accordance with relevant legislation in force at the time, it was possible to construct new residential buildings in the place of former buildings, as well as to reconstruct existing residential buildings and construct necessary storehouses (see paragraph 49 below). Moreover, it had been established that any construction work in the forest could only be started after having received building permission and in accordance with the relevant plans. That legislation had been repealed after the Constitutional Court had declared that the domestic regulations were in breach of the laws and, by extension, of the Constitution (see paragraph 53 below). The court thus held that the case-law on construction in the forest had been established after the building permit had been issued to the first applicant. The court further held that the applicants had built the building lawfully, there was no evidence as to any negative consequences of the construction for the environment or the public interest. The court also observed that in the applicants\u2019 case it would be unreasonable and unjust to apply the measure established in the Civil Code \u2013 to oblige the applicants to demolish the buildings (see paragraph 29 below). Moreover, the court was not convinced that the environment would be restored to its previous state if the buildings were demolished because the demolition would also cause some environmental damage.",

A summer house could not be constructed as it did not fall within the category of buildings that could be constructed in the forest. Even the Mol\u0117tai District Court had emphasised that the construction of new buildings was prohibited on that plot. The building permit had obviously been issued to the first applicant unlawfully and, in the appellate court\u2019s view, the latter had asked the court to establish a legal fact for the sole purpose of constructing a house. The court also held that neither the Law on Forests nor the Law on Land provided for any exceptions, so the right to construct buildings on the plot of forest land had never existed. The court thus ordered the first applicant to demolish the buildings at the expense of the applicants, the Mol\u0117tai Municipality and the Utena environmental protection department. The Court did not explain how the costs of demolition had to be divided between the three parties.",

                                "content": "19.\u00a0\u00a0On 27 September 2013 the Supreme Court held that relevant laws provided that the only buildings that could be constructed in the forest were timber storehouses and other buildings for forestry equipment. There were no provisions allowing construction of residential or commercial buildings in the forest. It was in certain cases possible to change the purpose of the land, but as the land in question was situated in a surface water protection zone, any such change was prohibited. The court held that although the applicants referred to the Regulation of Construction on Private Land (see paragraph 49 below, hereinafter the \u201cRegulation\u201d), none of the provisions of that Regulation could be interpreted as allowing construction of the buildings in question. There was no argument that the buildings in question had been constructed where farm buildings had previously been sited, thus the provision of the Regulation allowing construction where residential buildings had previously been sited did not allow the applicants to construct a summer house. The court thus held that the construction had been illegal. As regards the removal of the consequences of illegal construction, the court held that it was crucial to assess the consequences of the illegal construction for the environment and the public interest, the consequences of the demolition of the buildings, the possibility of restoring the environment to its state before the illegal construction, and whether the persons who had acquired property rights had acted in good faith. In cases where the construction was in breach of the territorial planning documents and/or the imperative requirements of environmental protection, heritage protection and protection of protected areas, a decision to legalise the illegal construction could not be taken. The court thus had to assess whether the construction in question should have been carried out at the relevant time. It held that legalisation of the buildings in question was impossible and that demolition had to take place (see paragraphs 46 and 47 below). As to the applicants\u2019 argument that the appellate court had breached the principle of legitimate expectations, the court held that the construction in question had been prohibited by the relevant domestic legislation in force at the time. Even if the applicants had misinterpreted the provisions of the Regulation, the Constitutional Court had found the Regulation to be inconsistent with the law, and, by extension, with the Constitution on 14 March 2006, only three months after the building permit had been issued to the first applicant. The applicants should therefore have been able to understand the consequences of constructing illegally and to avoid them. Although the authorities were partly responsible for the illegal construction, that fact per se did not mean that all illegal construction had to be legalised in order to protect the legitimate expectations and proprietary interests of the owners. The legal regulation established the responsibility of the authorities for the unlawful issue of the construction permit. As a result, the court upheld the decision of the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court (see paragraph 17 above).",

On 23 December 2015 the Utena District Court held that domestic law did not oblige the bailiff to suspend the execution of judgments if the applicants had lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights. However, the Code of Civil Procedure provided that there would be grounds for reopening the proceedings if the European Court of Human Rights found that a domestic court decision had breached an applicant\u2019s rights under the Convention or one of its Protocols (see paragraph 32 below). The court held that if the national court\u2019s order to demolish the building was executed, the possibility of reopening the proceedings after a positive outcome for the applicants in the European Court of Human Rights would become complicated. On the other hand, if the European Court of Human Rights adopted a different decision, the demolition of the buildings would still be possible. The court observed that the applicants\u2019 building did not infringe the rights of third persons as it was sited on a plot of forest land that belonged to the applicants.

The first rule, set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The three rules are not distinct in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property. They should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, for example, F\u00e1bi\u00e1n v. Hungary [GC], no. 78117/13, \u00a7 60, 5 September 2017, and Sargsyan v. Azerbaijan [GC], no. 40167/06, \u00a7 217, ECHR 2015). They must comply with the principle of lawfulness and pursue a legitimate aim by means reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised (see, for example, B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy v. Hungary [GC], no. 53080/13, \u00a7\u00a7 112-113 and 115, ECHR 2016). The requisite balance will not be struck where the person concerned bears an individual and excessive burden (see Brum\u0103rescu v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7 78, ECHR 1999-VII). Environmental conservation, which in today\u2019s society is an increasingly important consideration (see Depalle v. France [GC], no.\u00a034044/02, \u00a7 81, ECHR\u00a02010), has become a cause the defence of which arouses the constant and sustained interest of the public, and consequently the public authorities. The Court has stressed this point a number of times with regard to the protection of the countryside and forests (see Turgut and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 1411/03, \u00a7 90, 8 July 2008; K\u00f6ktepe v. Turkey, no. 35785/03, \u00a7 87, 22\u00a0July 2008; and \u015eat\u0131r v. Turkey, no. 36192/03, \u00a7 33, 10\u00a0March\u00a02009). In such complex and difficult area, the States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in order to implement their forest-protection policies. Nevertheless, the Court cannot fail to exercise its power of review and must determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicants\u2019 right of property (see Visti\u0146\u0161 and Perepjolkins v. Latvia [GC], no. 71243/01, \u00a7 109, 25 October 2012).",

The Court does not share the Government\u2019s argument that the applicants should have suspected that the building permission had been \u201cprecarious\u201d. The relevant procedures were conducted by official bodies exercising the authority of the State. The authorities that issued the applicants with the building permission and the authorities that registered the building did not refer to the ruling of the Constitutional Court where it held that the construction on forest land of buildings not related to forestry had not been allowed. The authorities did not take any action to annul the building permit. To the contrary, the applicants\u2019 summer house was registered as 97% finished in 2007 (see paragraph 13 above), more than a year after the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling had been adopted (see paragraph 53 above). There are no indications in the file that the applicants somehow contributed to the adoption of the unlawful decisions. Although the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court held that the first applicant had asked the Mol\u0117tai District Court to determine as a legal fact that some buildings had previously been sited on his plot of land solely because he wanted the authorities to grant building permission, that conclusion was not confirmed by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 19 above). The Court thus cannot see that the house was knowingly built in flagrant breach by the applicants of the domestic building regulations (compare and contrast Ivanova and Cherkezov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a075, and Saliba v. Malta, no. 4251/02, \u00a7 46, 8\u00a0November 2005) and considers that because the authorities had confirmed that the house could be constructed, the applicants did not have sufficient reasons to doubt the validity of such a decision and were entitled to rely on the expectation that it would not be retrospectively declared invalid to their detriment (see, mutatis mutandis, Gladysheva v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a07097/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07980, 6 December 2011; Tunaitis v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a042927/08, \u00a7 39, 24\u00a0November 2015; and Misiukonis and\u00a0Others v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 49426/09, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, 15 November 2016).",

Even if the building permission, issued by the authorities, had to be annulled by the authorities as a result of the fact that the Regulation was subsequently declared contrary to the laws and the Constitution, the Court considers that the applicants had legitimate expectations that they would not be ordered to demolish their summer house, the construction of which was started in accordance with the required building permission issued by the authorities, at their sole or partial expense. Even if the presumption of knowledge of the law, as interpreted and applied in domestic case-law, puts an obligation on the applicants to act in accordance with the law (see paragraphs 28 and 57 above), it does not in any way absolve the authorities of their obligation of bringing their legal acts in line with the requirements of law and of acting diligently and in due time. The Court reiterates that the authorities took no actions to annul the building permission after the ruling of the Constitutional Court of 2006 came into force. Moreover, the proceedings for demolition were not started until 2011 and the order that the house be demolished was issued in 2013 (see paragraphs 15 and 19 above). Enforcement of that order has been suspended but it is clear not only that the applicants have had their \u201cpossession\u201d for quite a long period of time (see also paragraph 65 above) but also that that the demolition would amount to a radical interference with it.",

The domestic courts did not explain how the costs of demolition had to be divided between the applicants, the Mol\u0117tai Municipality and the Utena environmental protection department (see paragraph 17 above). The domestic court rejected the bailiff\u2019s request to explain the order to enforce the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court\u2019s decision to demolish the buildings (see paragraph 20 above). When examining the case, the domestic courts did not look into the degree of responsibility of the applicants as opposed to that of several public authorities, including the Centre of Registers which registered the summer house as 97 % finished, and this registration was not challenged for four years by any authority (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above). The Court thus considers that the actions of public authorities significantly contributed to the applicants\u2019 situation and that the applicants had to bear the same, if not stricter burden as the authorities.",
