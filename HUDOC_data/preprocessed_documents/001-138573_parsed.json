Even in the most difficult circumstances, such as the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the Convention prohibits, in absolute terms, torture and inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the victim\u2019s conduct (see, among many other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a0119, ECHR 2000-IV; and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 95, ECHR 1999-V). No derogation is allowed even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation. Article 3, which has been framed in unambiguous terms, recognises that every human being has an absolute, inalienable right not to be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment under any circumstances. The philosophical basis underpinning the absolute nature of the right under Article 3 does not allow for any exceptions or justifying factors or balancing of interests, irrespective of the conduct of the person concerned and the nature of the offence at issue (see, for example, G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 107, ECHR 2010).",

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a plausible and convincing explanation of how those injuries were caused (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR\u00a02000-VII, and Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 336).",

Russia, no. 7188/03, \u00a7 50, 3 July 2008; Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, \u00a7 77, 4 October 2005; Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2006\u2011IX; and Mouisel v. France, no. 67263/01, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2002-IX). However, given the absolute nature of the protection of Article 3, whose requirements permit of no derogation, this duty to protect cannot be said to be confined to the specific context of the military or penitentiary facilities. It also becomes relevant in other situations in which the physical well-being of individuals is dependent, to a decisive extent, on the actions of the authorities, who are legally required to take measures within the scope of their powers which might have been necessary to avoid the risk of damage to life or limb (see, mutatis mutandis, Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 55, ECHR\u00a02002\u2011II).",
