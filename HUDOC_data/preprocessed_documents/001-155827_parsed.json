In any event, the Court observes that the summons for the hearing of 21 March 2013 were sent out in the beginning of February (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). Against that background, the County Court\u2019s ruling of 20 March 2013, by which the hearing was (again) scheduled for 21 March 2013 (see paragraph 10 above), has no relevance to the question whether the applicant was informed of the date of the hearing well in advance. As regards the applicant\u2019s argument that the summons was not served on anyone, the Court, having had regard to the pertinent provisions of the domestic law (see paragraph 22 above), has no reason to conclude that the summons that the County Court\u2019s security official attempted to serve on the applicant\u2019s mother, living at the address indicated by the applicant as his residence (see paragraph 9 above), were not properly served. Furthermore, there is no dispute that the applicant\u2019s counsel received summons. Thus, the Court sees no reason to doubt that the applicant was summoned to the court hearing in accordance with domestic law.

The legislature must accordingly be able to discourage unjustified absences (see, inter alia, Poitrimol v. France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7 35, Series A no.\u00a0277A; Van Geyseghem v. Belgium [GC], no. 26103/95, \u00a7 33, ECHR\u00a01999I; Van Pelt v. France, no. 31070/96, \u00a7 66, 23 May 2000; and Neziraj v. Germany, no. 30804/07, \u00a7 47, 8\u00a0November 2012). However, it is also of crucial importance for the fairness of the criminal justice system that the accused be adequately defended, both at first instance and on appeal. The Court has consistently found that the latter interest prevailed and that, consequently, the fact that a defendant, in spite of having been properly summoned, did not appear, could not \u2013 even in the absence of an excuse \u2013 justify depriving him of his right under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 3 of the Convention to be defended by counsel (see Lala v. the Netherlands, 22 September 1994, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 297A; Pelladoah v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 22 September 1994, \u00a7\u00a040, Series A no. 297B; Van Geyseghem, loc. cit.; Van Pelt, loc. cit.; Harizi v.\u00a0France, no. 59480/00, \u00a7\u00a049, 29 March 2005; Kari-Pekka Pietil\u00e4inen v.\u00a0Finland, no. 13566/06, \u00a7\u00a031, 22 September 2009; and Neziraj, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 48-49). It is for the courts to ensure that a trial is fair and, accordingly, that counsel who attends trial for the apparent purpose of defending the accused in his absence is given the opportunity to do so (see Lala, cited above, \u00a7 34; Pelladoah, cited above, \u00a7 41; and Kari-Pekka Pietil\u00e4inen, loc. cit.)",

An accused does not lose this right merely on account of not attending a court hearing. Even if the legislature must be able to discourage unjustified absences, it cannot penalise them by creating exceptions to the right to legal assistance. The legitimate requirement that defendants must attend court hearings can be satisfied by means other than deprivation of the right to be defended (see Van Geyseghem, cited above, \u00a7 34; Van Pelt, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067; Kari-Pekka Pietil\u00e4inen, cited above, \u00a7 32; and Neziraj, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051).",

However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, a waiver of the right to take part in the trial must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see Poitrimol, cited above, \u00a7 31). Furthermore, it must not run counter to any important public interest (see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a056581/00, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2006II, and H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v.\u00a0Sweden, 21 February 1990, \u00a7 66, Series A no. 171-A).",

The Court has held that the personal attendance of the defendant does not take on the same crucial significance for an appeal hearing as it does for the trial hearing (see Hermi, cited above, \u00a7 60, and Kamasinski v. Austria, 19\u00a0December 1989, \u00a7 106, Series A no. 168). However, having regard to the special features of the proceedings involved and taking account of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order (see Hermi, loc. cit.; Ekbatani v. Sweden, 26 May 1988, \u00a7 27, Series\u00a0A no. 134; and Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 56, Series A no. 115), the Court considers that the County Court\u2019s role in the present case was not the same as that of a traditional court of appeal. Although the proceedings were set in motion by the applicant\u2019s complaint against a decision by the police by which he had been sanctioned, and this decision would have become final and enforceable if not challenged or if the County Court declined to examine the complaint \u2013 as it happened in the instant case \u2013, the County Court\u2019s role, nevertheless, was similar to that of an ordinary first-instance court. It had to examine the matter in its entirety without being bound by the limits of the complaint filed or facts established by a lower instance. In these circumstances, the Court is of the view that the applicant\u2019s presence at the County Court\u2019s hearing was important in order to secure him a fair trial.",

It is not for this Court to overrule such an assessment which was reasoned, had regard to the County Court\u2019s role in the examination of the complaints in the misdemeanour proceedings and lacked any signs of arbitrariness. The Court considers that the trial court, in such circumstances, was better placed to assess whether it could proceed with the case merely with the participation of the applicant\u2019s counsel or whether it was imperative for the applicant to be present. The Court also emphasises in this connection that the proceedings conducted by the police in respect of the applicant, taken separately, did not offer the fair trial guarantees enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention. The Convention requirements could only be complied with on the condition that the applicant had an opportunity to challenge the decision of the police before a tribunal in proceedings that did offer the fair trial guarantees of Article 6. The Court has no reason to doubt that the County Court\u2019s finding that it could not resolve the case in the applicant\u2019s absence proceeded from and was in line with the fair trial requirements including the principle of immediacy (see, for example, P.K. v. Finland (dec.), no. 37442/97, 9\u00a0July 2002).",

In the light of the case-law summarised above (see paragraphs 47 and 48), the Court considers that such an outcome was not compatible with the Convention. Assuming that the applicant waived his right to take part in the hearing \u2013 an issue which the Court does not need to determine in the present case \u2013, there is nothing to indicate that the applicant waived his right to be defended through legal assistance of his own choosing, a distinct right protected under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(c) of the Convention.",

He submitted that the applicant was abroad and could therefore not take part in the hearing, and asked the court to examine the matter without the applicant\u2019s participation. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, the County Court decided to refuse to examine the complaint because of the applicant\u2019s absence. The Court has taken note of the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s complaint mainly related to factual circumstances where counsel could not have substituted the applicant. However, it is not for the Court to speculate whether the applicant\u2019s counsel would have also put forward any legal issues to be dealt with, had the hearing on the merits of the case taken place, or to what extent the factual circumstances could have been examined in the applicant\u2019s absence. It merely notes that it does not appear that the County Court asked the applicant\u2019s counsel how in his view, having regard to the arguments raised in the complaint, the case could have been resolved without the applicant being present. The Court considers that it would have been precisely in the course of the examination of the case at a court hearing when the applicant\u2019s counsel could have provided such explanations \u2013 an opportunity he was not given.",

If the domestic courts came to the conclusion that the applicant\u2019s presence was imperative \u2013 as they did in the present case \u2013, there was nothing to prevent them from adjourning the hearing and ascertaining whether the applicant\u2019s attendance could be secured regardless of his alleged residence abroad. The Court notes in this connection that pursuant to the Code of Misdemeanour Procedure a defendant who failed to appear at a hearing regardless of being ordered to do so could be subject to a fine or compelled attendance (Article\u00a043 of the Code of Misdemeanour Procedure, see paragraph 24 above).",
