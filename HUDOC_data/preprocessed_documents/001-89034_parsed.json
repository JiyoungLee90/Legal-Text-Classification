The Ministry of Finance was neither a party to the proceedings nor had the status of an intervenor in the proceedings. It was not the owner of the flat in question or lay any claim in respect of it. Neither could it provide the court with any information as to the lawfulness of the provision to the defendants\u2019 family of the new housing and the taking away of the disputed flat. Therefore, the delays caused by the non-attendance of the representative of the Ministry of Finance should be attributed to the domestic authorities. The applicant further maintained that the case was of no particular complexity. The task of the courts was limited to determining the legalities relating to the provision of municipal housing in  at the material time, evaluating whether or not the new flat provided to the defendants\u2019 family complied with the above legalities (simple arithmetical calculation) and whether the defendants\u2019 claims could be granted in accordance with the law.",
