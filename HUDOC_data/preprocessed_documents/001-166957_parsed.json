Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Assenov and Others v.

The Court further notes that between 2010 and 2012 the applicant\u2019s allegation was examined by means of a pre-investigation inquiry without a full-scale investigation being opened. However, that investigative procedure did not comply with the principles of an effective remedy because the inquiring officer could only take a limited number of steps and the victim had no formal status, meaning his effective participation in the procedure was excluded (see Davydov and Others v. Ukraine, nos.\u00a017674/02 and 39081/02, \u00a7\u00a7 310-312, and Savitskyy v. Ukraine, no.\u00a038773/05, \u00a7 105, 26 July 2012). It is noteworthy that on 10 May 2012 the domestic court quashed the decision of 29 October 2010 to refuse to initiate criminal proceedings on the grounds that the inquiry had been incomplete and that further measures had been required (see paragraph 18\u00a0above). It is regrettable, however, that it took more than one year and a half for the domestic court to reach such a conclusion.",

However, it does not affect the Court\u2019s examination of the thoroughness of the investigation which the authorities were obliged to ensure. In that regard it can be noted that the authorities were aware of the possible ill-treatment from at least 21 August 2010 when the applicant lodged a complaint for the first time. As to the applicant\u2019s complaint of 19 May 2014, the domestic authorities commenced the pretrial investigation after a three-month delay (see paragraph 21 above).

As to the police officers\u2019 statements, they were premised on a reference to the medical report of 15 December 2010, which noted that the injuries could have been inflicted by the applicant himself. However, it appears that the forensic expert made that remark in order to answer a specific question from the authorities, rather than to reflect his own opinion on the most probable manner of inflicting the injuries (see paragraph 38 above). Furthermore, in accordance with that report the injuries had been inflicted by blunt solid objects (see paragraph\u00a041 above). However, there was no suggestion at any point during the domestic inquiry that any such objects had been available to the applicant during his detention in the police cell, and no such objects were found or examined.

In doing so the investigator relied on Articles 106 and\u00a0115 of the CCP of 1960 which provided exceptional grounds for the arrest of an individual without a court decision. The Court recalls that a period of detention is, in principle, \u201clawful\u201d if it is based on a court order (see Nevmerzhitsky v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a054825/00, \u00a7\u00a0116, ECHR 2005II (extracts)).

However, before assessing those issues it had to be established whether the applicant\u2019s case fell within the scope of the exceptions providing the investigator with the power to effect an arrest without a court decision. In that regard the arrest report only repeated the relevant parts of Article 106 of the CCP of 1960 without referring to any specific circumstances explaining why that provision of domestic law could be applied to the applicant\u2019s case. Without that specific information, the arrest report did not constitute a meaningful guarantee against arbitrary depravation of liberty (compare Grinenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a033627/06, \u00a7\u00a083, 15\u00a0November 2012; Malyk v. Ukraine, no. 37198/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027-29, 29 January 2015; and Kotiy v.

It could not therefore be claimed that the authorities faced an urgent situation such as, for example, a situation of in flagrante delicto.

The danger of an accused\u2019s absconding cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the sentence risked. It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Taran v.

Moreover, the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention lasted for one year and three months and with the passage of time the applicant\u2019s continued detention required more justification, but the courts did not provide any further reasoning. The fact that he was released on 12 May 2012 before his conviction (see paragraph 32 above) does not counterbalance the previous failures by the domestic courts to make a fact-specific assessment of the applicant\u2019s preventive measure in the preceding period. The Court points out that when maintaining the applicant\u2019s detention the courts referred to the applicant\u2019s failure to admit his guilt.
