Russia, no. 17391/06, \u00a7 130, 12 June 2014). Furthermore, a demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life, including disruption to traffic. However, where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, it is important for public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 is not to be deprived of all substance (see Nurettin Aldemir and Others v. Turkey, nos. 32124/02 and 6\u00a0others, \u00a7 43, 18 December 2007, and Budah\u00e1zy v. Hungary, no. 41479/10, \u00a7\u00a034, 15 December 2015). The appropriate \u201cdegree of tolerance\u201d cannot be defined in abstracto: the Court must look at the particular circumstances of the case and particularly at the extent of the \u201cdisruption to ordinary life\u201d. This being so, it is important for associations and others organising demonstrations, as actors in the democratic process, to abide by the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others, cited above, \u00a7 155).",

However, the Court also notes that the organisers of the demonstration had undertaken not to provoke a major disruption to traffic or significant inconvenience for road-users, explaining that the number of demonstrators would be limited to fifty to 100 persons and they would only use the hard shoulder of the road, that the event would not last longer than two hours, and that it would be called off immediately if the demonstrators started to act unlawfully or if it exceeded the scope of the permit issued by the authorities (see paragraphs 6 and 8 above).",

The domestic authorities nonetheless did not embark on an assessment of whether the employees of the airport had at their disposal alternative means of protecting their interest. Instead of considering measures which could have allowed the assembly to proceed in a manner that did not cause undue disturbance to road traffic in the proximity of the airport, the authorities imposed a ban on it. They resorted to the most radical measure of denying the applicants the possibility of exercising their right to freedom of assembly.",

This meeting took place the same day, and the representative of the police department suggested that the demonstration be held at another location, since the planned venue would endanger traffic. It was argued that access to the airport would be hindered or even blocked, and that the demonstrators\u2019 physical integrity would be at risk given the intensity and speed of vehicle traffic at the requested location. However, the applicants seemed to insist on the location. Still on the same day, the police department prohibited the demonstration because it would endanger traffic, render the airport inaccessible and breach the traffic code. The High Court approved that decision and its reasoning (see paragraphs 6-11 of the judgment).",

The Court must rather look at the specific circumstances of the case and particularly at the extent of the \u201cdisruption\u201d to ordinary life (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, \u00a7 155, ECHR 2015, with further references). In this respect, it has held that restrictions on freedom of peaceful assembly in public places may serve to protect the rights of others with a view to preventing disorder and maintaining an orderly flow of traffic (see \u00c9va Moln\u00e1r v. Hungary, no. 10346/05, \u00a7 34, 7 October 2008). Since overcrowding during a public event is fraught with danger, it is not uncommon for State authorities to impose restrictions on the location, date, time, form or manner of conduct of a planned public gathering (see Primov and Others v.

On the contrary, the police department registered the request and, on the same day, invited and met with the organisers in order to clarify details regarding the demonstration and discuss possible other locations (see paragraphs 7 and 8 of the judgment).
