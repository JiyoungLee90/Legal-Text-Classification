The four appellants complained of several breaches of electoral legislation in connection with the setting up of the said polling stations and their handling of the voting: they claimed that the rule requiring a polling station to be opened for every one hundred prior statements of intention to vote had been flouted in Turkish territory; some electors had exercised their voting rights once in Bulgarian national territory and again in a polling station in Turkish territory; incorrect information had been included in the reports drawn up by the electoral committees concerning the number of voters in the polling stations in question; 23 of them had allegedly dealt with over 1,000 voters, which would have been a practical impossibility in view of the opening hours of the polling station and the time required to complete the requisite formalities for each voter, and the electoral committees attached to those polling stations had, in certain cases, reportedly allowed persons into the voting booths without valid Bulgarian identity papers. The appellants invited the Constitutional Court to verify the authenticity of the prior voting requests issued in Turkish territory, to check the electoral rolls drawn up in the region of Bulgaria where the individuals wishing to vote in Turkey had their permanent addresses, and to declare null and void the records drawn up by the electoral committees responsible for the polling stations opened in Turkish territory. According to the appellants, the large number of irregularities committed in the voting procedure in the 123 polling stations in question necessitated the annulment of the votes cast in them, which annulment would have changed the election results and led to the ousting of seven DPS deputies from their seats.",

Secondly, the DPS parliamentary group submitted that the request had been ill-founded for the following reasons: the legal conditions for setting up the 123 polling stations in question had been fulfilled; there had been very few cases of double voting, and voting secrecy precluded determining for which party exactly those persons had voted; the number of persons included on the additional electoral rolls on election day had been higher than that of preregistered voters because the number of persons wishing to exercise their voting rights had far exceeded the number of voters having previously declared their intention to vote outside the country; and in several of the out-of-country polling stations the number of persons voting had exceeded one thousand, and that had not been the case only in the polling stations in Turkey.",

Those five members voiced the opinion that the arguments put forward by the appellants and the experts\u2019 conclusions could not be used to justify annulling the votes cast in the polling stations in question. They explained in particular that the lists of persons voting in the out-of-country polling stations had been drawn up by the Bulgarian diplomatic representatives accredited on the basis of the prior declarations of intention to vote which they had received. They nevertheless stated that no prior information had been given on the distribution of the voters in question around the various polling stations, as they could attend any polling station or choose not to vote at all, which in their view explained why in some stations none of the voters on the main list had voted. The members of the Electoral Commission considered that that should not lead to the invalidation of the ballots of other electors who had voted in the same polling station. They pointed out that under domestic legislation the election documents had to be packaged and sealed by the local electoral committees and then sent to the Central Electoral Commission. However, when the election documents had arrived from Turkey, it had been noted that the packages containing the documents had already been opened and then re-sealed by the diplomatic services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At all events, the absence, attributable to the Bulgarian diplomatic services or the local electoral committees, of election documents from out-of-county polling stations could not have justified annulling votes cast in those stations, given that the election results from outside the country had been based on data transmitted via diplomatic telegrams to the Central Electoral Commission. Finally, the members of the Electoral Commission, referring to domestic legislation, submitted that the fact that a member of the Electoral Commission had not signed minutes of voting or the accompanying documents did not invalidate them and did not constitute grounds for annulling the votes cast in the station in question. They considered that the recalculation of the election results was based on arguments which had not been mentioned in the request to the Constitutional Court.",

Secondly, it observed that the case concerned the contestation of election results rather than the eligibility of an individual candidate, which enabled it to assess the case even though the deputies in question had been sworn in and were already in office. It joined to the merits of the case the third plea of inadmissibility concerning the lack of a direct link between the out-of-country votes and the election of the seven DPS deputies named in the initial request. Judges R.N. and B.P. set out separate opinions on the admissibility of the request for annulment of the election results.

Having regard to the specific mode of functioning of the Bulgarian electoral system, in which votes cast by Bulgarian citizens living abroad were taken into account solely for the proportional distribution of seats among political parties at the national level, it was impossible to determine in advance which deputies would be affected by the invalidation of some or all of the votes cast in Turkish territory. Thus, in the framework of that case, the Constitutional Court considered that it had been called upon to determine whether there had been any serious irregularities in the voting procedure in the 123 polling stations in Turkey. It held that a finding of such irregularities could lead to a change in the election results, a fresh apportionment of seats among the political parties and the annulment of the seats of deputies who had not been explicitly targeted by the initial application lodged by the leader and a number of candidates of the RZS party in the general elections.",

The Constitutional Court accordingly considered that they could not be used in evidence to demonstrate that the registered persons had voted.

Even though domestic legislation did not explicitly require the members of the out-of-country local electoral committees to sign additional electoral lists, the module additional electoral list approved by the President of the Republic pursuant to the Electoral Law provided for such signatures. The Constitutional Court therefore took the view that such signature was a legal condition for the validity of such official documents.

In addition, decisions on the results of elections must also not take too long, especially where the political climate is tense. This means both that the time limits for appeals must be very short and that the appeal body must make its ruling as quickly as possible. Time limits must, however, be long enough to make an appeal possible, to guarantee the exercise of rights of defence and a reflected decision. A time limit of three to five days at first instance (both for lodging appeals and making rulings) seems reasonable for decisions to be taken before the elections.

Similarly, the discretion enjoyed by the body concerned must not be exorbitantly wide; it must be circumscribed, with sufficient precision, by the provisions of domestic law. Lastly, the procedure for declaring a candidate ineligible must be such as to ensure a fair and objective decision and prevent any abuse of power on the part of the relevant authority (see Podkolzina, cited above, \u00a7 35; Kovach v.

However, following a Constitutional Court appeal lodged by a candidate for another political party, which was ultimately successful, a second proportional distribution of seats was organised: the DPS lost one of its two seats in the 19th multiple-member constituency but obtained a second seat in the 8th multiple-member constituency, which was assigned to Mr Riza as the second candidate on his party\u2019s list in that constituency (ibid.).

Those provisions allowed any person standing in the general elections to contest the lawfulness of the election of deputies to the National Assembly .... Such disputes often concern compliance with the rules on voting and vote-counting in one or more polling stations, and may lead to the invalidation of some of the votes and a change in the total number of votes obtained by each individual candidate or political party. In proportional election systems, changing the electoral score of political formations, sometimes just in one single polling station, can lead to a redistribution of parliamentary seats and an increase or decrease in the number of seats allocated to the various parties or coalitions. That is exactly what happened in the present case. The impugned proceedings were brought by the President of the RZS political party and three of its candidates, seeking to contest the lawfulness of the election of seven DPS deputies under the proportional system in the framework of the Bulgarian election system. The appellants complained of several irregularities in the voting procedure in the 123 polling stations in which Bulgarian citizens living in Turkey had exercised their voting rights (see paragraph 22 above). Accordingly, the Court accepts that the proceedings before the Constitutional Court had the legitimate aim of ensuring compliance with electoral legislation and therefore the lawfulness of the voting and the election results.",

The proceedings led to the annulment of the elections in 23 of the 123 polling stations in question and to the cancellation of Mr Riza\u2019s parliamentary mandate, which had not been included in the initial complaint. The Court observes that that situation is the result of the combined effect of three specific aspects of the Bulgarian electoral system: the allocation under proportional representation at the national level of 209 parliamentary seats among the different political\u00a0parties; the consideration of out-of-country votes solely for that allocation of seats at the national\u00a0level; and the subsequent allocation of seats won by each party in the 31 multiple-member constituencies in Bulgaria. Having regard to those specific features of the Bulgarian electoral system, the decisions whether to annul one or more parliamentary mandates and which mandates to annul depended on the number of votes invalidated and their apportionment among the different parties. The Constitutional Court therefore had first of all to establish whether the voting procedure had been sufficiently seriously flawed to require the annulment of the results of voting. The Constitutional Court chose to limit the territorial scope of its assessment of observance of electoral legislation to the polling stations specially opened in Turkish territory because those stations had been explicitly mentioned in the initial complaint submitted to it. The Court will not question the domestic court\u2019s choice in this respect.",

Such a possibility was not introduced into domestic legislation until 2011, and the rule was only applicable where the election results had been annulled in their entirety (ibid.). It is clear that the impossibility of holding fresh elections had at no stage been considered by the Constitutional Court in deciding whether the annulment of the election results, under the particular circumstances of the case, would be a measure proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, whose purpose is to ensure the free expression of voters\u2019 wishes.",

However, the exact content of those subjective rights must be established in the light of the objective guarantee on free elections. Electoral rights are therefore the rights to vote in the framework of free elections and to influence the composition of Parliament by voting. The passive electoral right is the right to compete for a parliamentary seat in a free election. The very notion of free elections presupposes a number of elements, including, for example, equal opportunities among candidates and parties and a voting procedure which ensures that the official results of the elections accurately reflect the votes cast by the voters. It also follows from Article 3 that universal suffrage and the limitations on the scope ratio personae of active and passive electoral rights can be analysed in accordance with the schema set out above (scope, interference, justification).

It is difficult to follow this part of their argument. The judge\u2019s decision to revise voting results declared by a national commission is a major element of the electoral process leading to proclamation of the final outcome of the elections. The fact that a candidate loses his mandate or that a party loses votes and seats as compared to the original official proclamation of the results following a decision by an electoral court does not in itself constitute an interference with the exercise of the passive electoral right. In the present case, the interference with the passive electoral rights of Mr Riza and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms did not consist of a reduction by a court of the electoral score as compared to the previously proclaimed official result but stemmed from a number of irregularities committed during the elections, which created a situation whereby the official final results did not accurately reflect the reality of the polling.",

Thus, any citizen may vote at a PEC [Precinct Election Commission] abroad upon presenting a Bulgarian passport or military identification. This was perceived by some interlocutors as a possible mechanism for multiple voting. Some 57,346 individuals pre-registered at embassies and were then deleted from the domestic voter lists\u201d.

In the light of the OSCE and Council of Europe reports, we must be careful not to underestimate the extent of the irregularities committed during the voting and the vote tallying in the polling stations in question. Those irregularities could have had an impact on the election results. It is difficult to determine the precise number of votes actually obtained by the different competing lists in the polling stations in question, or to establish whether the 18,358 ballot papers from those polling stations correspond to valid votes and accurately reflect the results of the voting. At any event, it would be safer in that case to use the expression \u201cballot papers\u201d rather than \u201cvotes\u201d.",

It faced the following choice: to accept the validity of the ballot papers in the polling stations in question, annul the elections in those stations, or accept the validity of the ballot papers in some of those polling stations and annul the elections in others. None of those three solutions would seem fully satisfactory, and therefore the judicial review was unable to remedy the irregularities committed at previous stages in the electoral process.",

Those differences are particularly acute where votes cast on different dates are tallied together at the national level with a view to apportioning seats among the candidate lists. Furthermore, in the event of fresh elections organised out of the country, regard must be had to other problems beyond the difficulties rightly highlighted in paragraph 178 of the judgment. The make-up of the out-of-country electorate can quickly change as voters move around. Effective mechanisms must also be introduced to prevent electors having already voted once in the national territory or outside the country, in polling stations in which the voting has not been annulled, from voting again.",

I failed to join the majority in this finding since I fail to discern any such causal link.

While meeting the undertaking to hold free [re]-elections would have been capable of remedying the situation of the 101 voters in directly restoring their effective opportunities to vote, it is not clear whether a new round of free elections might have resulted in the re-election of Mr. Riza and the restoration of the initial number of seats of representatives of the applicant party in Parliament. The Court may not speculate on the potential outcome of re-elections in the circumstances of the inherent lottery of the proportionate electoral system like the one in the present case.
