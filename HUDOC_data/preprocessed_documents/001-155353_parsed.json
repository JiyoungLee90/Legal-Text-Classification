The Basic Principles, which have since been updated, call, inter alia, for the return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance; a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh; a future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding referendum; the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence; and international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation. The idea is that the endorsement of these principles by Armenia and Azerbaijan would enable the drafting of a comprehensive and detailed settlement. Following intensive shuttle diplomacy by Minsk Group diplomats and a number of meetings between the Presidents of the two countries in 2009, the process lost momentum in 2010. So far the parties to the conflict have not signed a formal agreement on the Basic Principles.",

The Republic of Armenia as a Party to the Conflict). Allegedly, Armenia had even sent members of its police force to perform police duties in the occupied territories. HRW spent two days in April 1994 interviewing Armenian uniformed soldiers on the streets of Yerevan. 30% of them were draftees in the Armenian army who had either fought in Karabakh, had orders to go to Karabakh or had ostensibly volunteered for service there. Moreover, on a single day in April 1994 HRW researchers had counted five buses holding an estimated 300 soldiers of the Armenian army entering Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia. Other western journalists had reported to HRW researchers that they had seen eight more buses full of Armenian army soldiers heading for Azerbaijani territory from Armenia. According to HRW, as a matter of law, Armenian army troop involvement in Azerbaijan made Armenia a party to the conflict and made the war an international armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.",

However, Nagorno-Karabakh\u2019s (de facto) prime minister argues that part of this loan \u2013 4.259 billion drams (about $9.46 million) \u2013 is in fact Armenia\u2019s repayment of VAT, customs and excise duties that Armenia levies on goods that pass through its territory, destined for Nagorno-Karabakh. The remainder of the loan has a ten-year repayment period at nominal interest. Though Armenia has provided such loans since 1993, nothing has been repaid. According to the Armenian prime minister, Stepanakert \u2018is not yet in a position to repay ... . In the coming years we will need to continue providing this loan to help them continue building their infrastructure ... we do not envision that they will be able to go ahead on their own anytime soon\u2019.",

More specifically, none of the examples of cases given by the Government in their observations to the Chamber in July 2007 related to the right to return to enjoy properties or private and family life. Only in their July 2012 observations had the Government pointed to some constitutional remedies in Armenia and the \u201cNKR\u201d and claimed that the applicants had always been able to enter the disputed territories, at least for the purpose of exercising their legal rights. Read in conjunction with the Government\u2019s previous observations, where these remedies had not been mentioned and where the return of and compensation to displaced persons were conditioned on a comprehensive and final conflict-resolution agreement, the 2012 submissions lacked credibility.

The Court is concerned with the supervision of the implementation by Contracting States of their obligations under the Convention. It cannot, and must not, usurp the role of Contracting States whose responsibility it is to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined therein are respected and protected on a domestic level. The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection. States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system, and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 65, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV). The Court cannot emphasise enough that it is not a court of first instance; it does not have the capacity, nor is it appropriate to its function as an international court, to adjudicate on large numbers of cases which require the finding of basic facts or the calculation of monetary compensation \u2013 both of which should, as a matter of principle and effective practice, be the domain of domestic jurisdiction (see Demopoulos and Others v.

The reason for this is that the Government have not shown that there is a remedy \u2013 in Armenia or in the \u201cNKR\u201d \u2013 capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints.

Given such a denial of involvement or jurisdiction, it would not be reasonable to expect the applicants to bring claims for restitution or compensation before the Armenian courts and authorities. Regard must further be had to the political and general context. As a consequence of the war, virtually all Azerbaijanis have left the disputed territories. No political solution of the conflict has been reached. Rather, the hostile rhetoric between the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan appears to have intensified, ceasefire breaches are recurrent and the military build-up in the region has escalated in recent years.

As regards the technical passports, the applicants maintained that they, in all details, complied with the formal requirements under the domestic law in force at the material time.

The original statements were made from memory, without access to documents, and it was therefore the information contained in the passports that was correct and should be taken into account. The applicants further asserted that the passports constituted secondary evidence of their possessions.

In particular, under the socialist system of the USSR before 1991, land was under the exclusive ownership of the State. While the 1991 Law on property recognised the possibility of private ownership, it did not transfer ownership of land occupied by individuals to them. With respect to individual land users and lessees, the legislation set out that their rights were formalised through a certificate, which was registered in a land register kept by the local Soviet of People\u2019s Deputies. Thus, no rights to land could be asserted without such a registered certificate. Furthermore, the Azerbaijani 1992 Land Code stipulated that the rights of a user or lessee could be extinguished following a failure to use the land for a period of two years. As the applicants had not returned to the district of Lachin since 1992, the Government presumed that their alleged rights had been terminated before Armenia became subject to the jurisdiction of the Court in 2002. Furthermore, the applicants\u2019 claimed legitimate expectation to become owners of land was no longer a realistic expectation in 2002. Furthermore, before that date, the applicants\u2019 alleged property had been allocated to other individuals, with their names recorded on the land register in accordance with the laws of the \u201cNKR\u201d. Thus, the applicants had no \u201cexisting possessions\u201d but were merely claimants seeking to have their property restored or to receive compensation. The Government maintained that no domestic legislation or judicial decision existed which gave rise to a legitimate expectation of such restitution or compensation. However, in the same observations, the Government stated that the \u201cNKR\u201d had not adopted any legal act that deprived the applicants of the right to enter the territory of Lachin or of the right to peacefully enjoy their property.",

Nevertheless, a technical passport was classified as an \u201cinventory-technical\u201d document that served to indirectly establish the right to an individual house where the original document was missing.

As explained by the applicant in Solomonides v. Turkey (no.\u00a016161/90, \u00a7 31, 20 January 2009), his titles of ownership had been registered at the District Lands Office. However, at the time of the Turkish military intervention he had been forced to flee and had been unable to take with him the title deeds. The Cypriot authorities had reconstructed the Land Books and had issued certificates of affirmation of title. These certificates were the best evidence available in the absence of the original records or documents. It is noteworthy that in Saveriades v. Turkey (no. 16160/90, 22 September 2009) the reasons why the applicant could not submit the original title deeds were specifically taken into account. The applicant argued that he had been forced to leave his premises, where the documents were held, in great haste and had subsequently been unable to return there or otherwise retrieve the title deeds. The Court accepted that the documents submitted by the applicant (such as a sale contract, ownership certificates and a building permit) provided prima facie evidence that he had a title of ownership over the properties in issue, and continued (\u00a7 18):",

Article 10.3 of the Housing Code provided for the ownership of houses, and the Land Code, notably Articles 4, 25, 27 and 28, laid down the rules and procedures for the allocation of land to individuals for their use.

The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control, whether it be exercised directly, through the Contracting State\u2019s own armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration (see Loizidou v. Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, \u00a7 62, Series A no. 310; Cyprus v.

The controlling State has the responsibility under Article 1 to secure, within the area under its control, the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which it has ratified. It will be liable for any violations of those rights (see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 76-77, and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, \u00a7 138).",

If the message to be conveyed is that Armenia should do its utmost to engage effectively with Azerbaijan in finding a solution to the conflict through the Minsk or any other process, I can follow the finding of a violation under Article\u00a08 of the Convention and Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1. Indeed, I voted with the majority with this understanding in mind. There is no question that persons such as the applicants who cannot access or claim compensation for their property should be able to do so. To my mind, however, Armenia\u2019s responsibility lies in its positive obligations under these Articles. The Court does not have competence ratione temporis to assess how the property was lost or interfered with at the time. Today the Court can only examine whether by the time the applicants lodged a complaint with the Court, Armenia had done what is within its responsibility concerning the normalisation of the situation of those individuals.

They may overlap, but they may also be distinct. In paragraph\u00a0154 of that judgment the Court reiterated that \u201cthe test for establishing the existence of \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 under Article 1 of the Convention has never been equated with the test for establishing a State\u2019s responsibility for an internationally wrongful act under general international law (see Catan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0115)\u201d. In other words, the Court cannot assume that jurisdiction automatically leads to the responsibility of the State concerned for the alleged violations of their Convention obligations. At the same time, the absence of territorial jurisdiction does not mean that the State will never bear responsibility for those acts that it has generated, at least under general international law. The Court\u2019s case-law has been criticised for creating uncertainty or even confusion between those two concepts. The Court\u2019s argument has been that within the scope of Article 1 of the Convention it cannot proceed otherwise, since, according to the ordinary meaning of Article 1, the precondition for its assessment of responsibility is the establishment of jurisdiction of the respondent State. Within this logic jurisdiction is a threshold criterion, as the Court has always emphasised.",

The situation in northern Cyprus has been clearly defined as being contrary to the Charter of the United Nations. The situation after the demise of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), with its 14th Army remaining in the territory of Transdniestria, does not raise too many doubts as to the control of that territory. As far as our case is concerned, however, we have information which is somewhat disputed. The Court did not accept the proposal of a fact-finding mission, which, as in Ila\u015fcu and Others (cited above), might have provided it with much-needed evidence. In my view, the Court should have given proper weight to the UN Security Council assessment. The UN Security Council Resolutions have stated that \u201clocal Armenian forces\u201d are well organised and have created their own governance of the territories that they occupy. It is also apparent from the UN Security Council Resolutions cited in the present judgment that Armenia can exercise influence over the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh.

The Court may not need to do so if it adopts a different interpretation of jurisdiction and responsibility for the purposes of the Convention, even though it has always reiterated that it refers to the definition of jurisdiction traditionally employed in international law.

One would hope that they do not automatically result in the loss of jurisdiction or the acquisition of control over new territories for the purposes of international responsibility and do not in themselves represent a threat to the neighbouring countries. The letter, legal character and practical consequences of the agreement have to be examined carefully. It may well be that in terms of international law such an agreement between a State and a non-recognised entity does not have any legal value. It may also be that the international community, wishing to end the conflict in the region, does not appreciate such a document and condemns it.

There have been cases in which the Court has, on the contrary, openly refused to take into consideration arguments deriving from international law.

The Court has already done this, for example in cases that have arisen following the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and in particular in the so-called \u201cbank savings\u201d cases. The Court examined the question of attribution of responsibility with regard to the specific context of State succession (see Kova\u010di\u0107 and Others v. Slovenia [GC], nos.\u00a044574/98 and 2 others, 3 October 2008, and JudgeRess\u2019s concurring opinion therein). In the case at hand, the conclusion is that \u201cthe denial of access to the applicants\u2019 homes constitutes an unjustified interference with their right to respect for their private and family lives as well as their homes\u201d (see paragraph 207 of the present judgment). It is not previously explained by what means Armenia has denied them access to their homes, unless one considers that by the very fact that Armenia has, in the Court\u2019s view, jurisdiction over Nagorno-Karabakh it denies access to homes. It is with this in mind that I voted against finding a violation of Article 13 since in my view the Court did not have sufficient information regarding whether property claims were indeed not examined by local courts. As I have explained above, this approach fails to address the real issue in the case. To my mind, the question is whether, given that Armenia can influence the local Armenian government in NagornoKarabakh and that it is one of the parties to negotiations, it bears responsibility for not having taken positive steps for many years which would have permitted the return of displaced persons or compensation. I cannot qualify that as a denial of property rights. It is an issue of positive obligations having regard to the more general context of international law. For all these reasons I did not find that Armenia has jurisdiction over Nagorno-Karabakh in the manner indicated in the judgment but I did find that Armenia has failed to comply with its positive obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 8 of the Convention.",

I note, with satisfaction, that with the present judgment the Court has confirmed this fact, once again, by a judicial decision. The Court has come to that conclusion on the basis of irrefutable evidence indicating that Armenia, through its military presence and provision of military equipment, has been significantly involved in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict from an early date. The military support has been \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 decisive for the conquest of and continued control over the Azerbaijani territories. According to the Court, the evidence, not least the 1994 Agreement on Military Cooperation between the Governments of the Republic of Armenia and the \u201cRepublic of NagornoKarabakh\u201d, convincingly shows that the armed forces of Armenia and the \u201cNKR\u201d are highly integrated, that the so-called \u201cNKR\u201d is under the influence of Armenia and enjoys its military, financial and political support, and that Nagorno-Karabakh and all the surrounding occupied regions of Azerbaijan are under the direct control of Armenia.

Ferraro, \u201cDetermining the beginning and end of an occupation under international humanitarian law\u201d, International Review of the Red Cross, no.\u00a0885, March 2012, p. 140).

A difference in treatment in securing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention must not only pursue a legitimate aim; Article 14 will also be violated if there is not a \u201creasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised\u201d (see, for example, Rasmussen v. Denmark, 28\u00a0November 1984, \u00a7\u00a038, Series A no. 87, and Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom, 8\u00a0July 1986, \u00a7 177, Series A no. 102).",

I also agree that when considering the applicants\u2019 Article 14 claim, the standard of proof which the Court adopts should not be equated with the criminal standard of proof applicable in common-law domestic courts.

There could be no more effective a tool for ensuring that the protection against discrimination on grounds of racial or national origin will become illusory and inoperative than to expect victims to submit themselves to such a high standard of proof. In reality, the application of such a high standard is tantamount to rendering it impossible for applicants to prove that there was a violation of Article\u00a014.

In the inter-State case between Cyprus and Turkey, the Turkish Government presented a list of cases brought by Greek Cypriots in Turkish Cypriot courts, which included cases relating to trespass by other persons and unlawful cultivation of land belonging to Greek Cypriot plaintiffs in the Karpas area, and where the claims of the plaintiffs were accepted by the competent courts of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u201d (the \u201cTRNC\u201d). The Cypriot Government argued that any remedies which might exist in Turkey or in the \u201cTRNC\u201d were not practical or effective for Greek Cypriots living in the governmentcontrolled area and that they were ineffective for enclaved Greek Cypriots, having regard to the particular nature of the complaints and the legal and administrative framework set up in the north of Cyprus. As regards the caselaw of \u201cTRNC\u201d courts referred to by the Turkish Government, the Cypriot Government claimed that it related to situations that were different from those complained of in the application, namely to disputes between private parties and not to challenges to legislation and administrative action. The fate that befell the Cypriot Government\u2019s arguments is well known: the Court considered that the Cypriot Government had failed to rebut the evidence laid before the Commission that aggrieved Greek Cypriots had access to local courts in order to assert civil claims against wrongdoers, and held that no violation of Article 13 of the Convention had been established by reason of the alleged absence of remedies in respect of interferences by private persons with the rights of Greek Cypriots living in Northern Cyprus under Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The same should apply in the present case.",

It sufficed that civil claims of Greek Cypriots had been entertained by \u201cTRNC\u201d courts to conclude that these courts had to be regarded as affording remedies to be exhausted. The Government produced evidence in support of their contention that court remedies were available, and highlighted the successful claims brought by a number of Azeri and Kurdish litigants in Armenian courts and in \u201cNKR\u201d courts in civil and criminal cases.

The majority\u2019s dismissal of the legal force of this process, ultimately on the basis that it emanated from a non-recognised State and is therefore not legally valid, cannot be accepted, since it simply begs the question of the legitimacy of the privatisation process, based on the assumption of the international invalidity of all legislation of the \u201cNKR\u201d, and thus contradicting, as mentioned above, previous positions of the Court on the validity of legislation approved by non-recognised States.

Nonetheless, even if some flexibility may be admitted in terms of the Court\u2019s evidential standards in the context of property claims by particularly vulnerable persons, such as refugees and displaced persons, there should be reasonable limits to the flexible approach of the Court, since experience shows that mass displacement of people fosters improper property claims by opportunists hoping to profit from the chaos.

The Assembly observed that both Armenia and Azerbaijan had committed themselves upon their accession to the Council of Europe in January 2001 to using only peaceful means for settling the conflict, by refraining from any threat of using force against their neighbours.
