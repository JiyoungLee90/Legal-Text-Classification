In view of those facts the court president invited the President to create a \u201cNational Council for the Restoration of Ukraine\u2019s Status as a Seafaring Nation\u201d, which would be tasked with making proposals as to how to return vessels transferred by Blasco to foreign entities or to receive compensation for them.

The Court observes that the notion of the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary has assumed growing importance in its case-law.

France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2015). As to the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge\u2019s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge, or a body sitting as a bench, lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (ibid., \u00a7 76). The objective test mostly concerns hierarchical or other links between the judge and other protagonists in the proceedings. In this connection even appearances may be of a certain importance or, in other words, \u201cjustice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done\u201d. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public (ibid., \u00a7 77 and 78).",
