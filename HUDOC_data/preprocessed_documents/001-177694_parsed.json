In support of this statement, he noted that the applicant had been medicated and subjected to a psychological personality test, the MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory). The results of the test had confirmed that he could not be feigning the symptoms of a mental illness, as a healthy person would have had a very different reaction to those specific medications.

They concluded that the applicant had not been suffering from any mental illness at the time when the offences had been committed (tempore criminis). In their view, the applicant did not have any organic lesions in his central nervous system. Nor did he have a learning difficulty. They agreed that he had a dissocial personality disorder. They noted that, from an early age, the applicant had disregarded the rights and feelings of others, as well as social norms. He also failed to learn from his actions and repeated dysfunctional behaviour. However, they were of the opinion that his condition had significantly improved in recent years. While the risk that he would commit a similar offence was not very high, it could not be excluded that, in difficult situations, he might suffer from reactive disorders. It was therefore recommended that any prison sentence served by the applicant should be served in therapeutic conditions. The opinion was submitted to the Katowice Regional Court on 11 September 2012.",

The experts examining the applicant as part of a periodic review agreed with that assessment (see paragraphs 26, 32-35 above).

Equally, in their opinion of 27\u00a0August 2013 the experts noted that, while the applicant claimed to have suffered from a brief psychotic disorder in the past, at that time he only had a severe dissocial personality disorder (see paragraph 33 above).

However, later on, in the course of the third set of proceedings, another person was charged with P.A.\u2019s murder and the applicant was only charged with several counts of robbery and theft (see paragraph 46 above).

The experts opined that the risk of his committing further violent crimes was high. The domestic courts carefully addressed the mental health of the applicant as well as the severity of the applicant\u2019s dissocial personality disorder (see paragraphs 27 and 32 of the judgment). With reference to the expert opinions, the domestic courts repeatedly held that there was a risk that, if released, the applicant would commit yet another criminal offence of significant harm to the community (see paragraphs 27, 32, 36 and 38). Later on, in addition to the risk of his committing further similar offences, the court justified continuation of the applicant\u2019s detention by referring to his second suicide attempt and his consequent fragile condition (see paragraphs 36 and 39 of the judgment). The domestic courts took into consideration the evolution of the applicant\u2019s mental health, since, depending on his condition as continually assessed by experts, he was transferred between less secure hospitals and facilities with enhanced security (see paragraphs 20 and 30). When confronted with conflicting experts opinions the judge held extensive hearings in order to question the experts. Moreover, when on 30 April 2014 the experts confirmed that the applicant\u2019s condition had improved and that it was unlikely that he would commit similar offences in the future (see paragraph\u00a041 of the judgment), the court promptly set a hearing date and within one month ordered the applicant\u2019s release from hospital (see paragraphs 42 and 43).",
