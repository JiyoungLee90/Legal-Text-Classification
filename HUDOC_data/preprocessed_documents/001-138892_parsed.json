Moreover, the applicant does not complain that she was unable to have her case heard due to the relevant fine. The applicant\u2019s right of access to court was not impaired in any way as she had had the opportunity to have her case examined thoroughly before two levels of jurisdiction prior to her request for rectification. The Court reiterates that the imposition of a fine in order to prevent a build-up of cases before the courts and to ensure the proper administration of justice is not, as such, in conflict with the right of access to court (see G.L. v. Italy, no.\u00a015384/89, Commission decision of 9\u00a0May 1994, Decisions and Reports (DR) 77B, p.\u00a05).
