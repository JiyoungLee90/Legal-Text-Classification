The indictment stated that the alleged offences had primarily been committed by telephone and e-mail communications. During the investigation, the Reykjanes District Court had authorised the interception and recording of calls made using certain phone numbers registered to the three companies. The charge against the applicant was based on his receipt of a telephone call from B., an employee of Byko, on 28 February 2011, in which they had allegedly encouraged each other to commit criminal price collusion.",

The defendants submitted written observations and their representatives made oral presentations at a public hearing before the Supreme Court. In its judgment of 1 December 2016, the Supreme Court upheld the acquittal of two defendants and the conviction of one but overturned the acquittal of the applicant and seven other defendants, convicting them of breaching section 41a(1) and (2), item a of the Competition Act no. 44/2005, together with section 10 of the same Act (see paragraph 13 below). The applicant was given a suspended sentence of 9\u00a0months\u2019 imprisonment. The Supreme Court, with reference to section\u00a0114(2) second item of the Criminal Procedures Act (see paragraph 12, below), criticised the fact that the District Court had allowed the defendants to be present while their co-accused were making their oral statements, irrespective of whether they had yet to give a statement themselves. It considered that since the conduct of which the defendants were accused was similar and significantly rooted in the same circumstances, it was important (\u201cdeemed as urgent\u201d) to prevent them hearing the statements of their co-accused until after they themselves had given evidence. The Supreme Court also criticised the District Court\u2019s failure to differentiate between the defendants as accused and as witnesses, despite the different legal status, some defendants having given statements in respect of the charges against them and then having been given the status of witness when giving statements about other charges in the indictment. On the basis of those considerations, the Supreme Court concluded that the method followed for hearing the statements of the defendants was \u201cnot least improper on the grounds it significantly diminishes the evidentiary value of their testimonies in court.\u201d",

The interaction had developed from being unilateral to being mutual as the two individuals exchanged information about prices of the companies for the same or comparable types of item, and the purpose of the information had obviously been to get a clearer picture of the competition\u2019s prices than each company could have had by only examining the prices using methods that were available to customers. It was deemed that the frequent and regular interaction entailed concerted measures with the goal of distorting the competition between the companies. With regard to the applicant in particular, the Supreme Court considered that in the telephone conversation between him and B. on 28\u00a0February 2011 both of them had intentionally and seriously breached section 41a(1) and (2), item a of the Competition Act, as it was beyond doubt that during that conversation they had encouraged each other to keep up the prices of hardware items, including when making bids.",

The assessment of the applicant\u2019s guilt had thus clearly been based on tangible evidence and not on the testimonies given before the District Court. The Government added in this respect that the Supreme Court\u2019s criticism had related to procedural issues, and that it routinely criticised procedure before the District Courts in an effort to educate, but that such criticism could relate to defects which were not sufficient to require the quashing of the judgment appealed against. In the present case, the criticism had been twofold: firstly, as regards defendants having been allowed to hear the testimony of co-accused before giving evidence themselves, and secondly as regards defendants giving statements first as suspects and then as witnesses.

Accordingly, the evidence which the prosecution had submitted during the trial had been information about telephone calls, including when they took place and how long they lasted, sound recordings of some of them, e-mails and other documentary evidence. Consequently, the courts had had to assess that tangible evidence when deciding the case, and in that respect the Supreme Court \u2013 which could read and/or listen to that evidence \u2013 had not been bound by the District Court\u2019s evaluation of its value. Its conviction of the applicant and other co-accused had been based on that evidence, which the Supreme Court had considered sufficient to establish guilt; where no such evidence existed, the defendants had been acquitted. Furthermore, the Supreme Court had not been bound by the District Court\u2019s conclusions in so far as they were based on an incorrect interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Competition Act.",

It is not the function of the Court to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a domestic court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. In the determination of whether the proceedings were fair the Court does not act as a court of fourth instance deciding on whether the evidence had been obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law, its admissibility or on the guilt of an applicant. These matters, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, are the province of the domestic courts. It is not appropriate for the Court to rule on whether the available evidence was sufficient for an applicant\u2019s conviction and thus to substitute its own assessment of the facts and the evidence for that of the domestic courts. The Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly and that in a given case they were compatible with the Convention, while also taking into account the specific circumstances, the nature and the complexity of the case (Murtazaliyeva v.

As to the latter, no reference was made to the right to hear witnesses under Article 6 \u00a7 3(d) of the Convention. The Government also centred their arguments on Article 6 \u00a7 1. The Court for its part sees no need to examine any part of the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 3(d) of its own motion, as the application does not concern the right to hear witnesses \u201con the same conditions\u201d as the prosecution, but rather the scope of the general right to a \u201cfair hearing\u201d in Article 6 \u00a7 1. Thus, the Court considers that the complaint may suitably be dealt with under that provision (see Sigur\u00fe\u00f3r Arnarsson v.\u00a0Iceland, no. 44671/98, \u00a7 29, 15 July 2003).",

It may also be that the accused unequivocally has waived his right to take part in the appeal hearing (see, inter alia, Kashlev v. Estonia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051). However, the Court has held that where an appellate court is called upon to examine a case as to the facts and the law and to make a full assessment of the question of the applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence, it cannot, as a matter of fair trial, properly determine those issues without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the accused \u2013 who claims that he has not committed the act alleged to constitute a criminal offence (see Constantinescu v.

For example, in the case of Igual Coll v. Spain, no. 37496/04, \u00a7 36, 10 March 2008, the Court considered that the appeal court had not simply given a different legal interpretation or another application of the law to facts already established at first instance, but had carried out a fresh evaluation of facts beyond purely legal considerations (see also Sp\u00eenu v.

Thus, in principle the conviction of the applicant was not based on a reassessment by the Supreme Court\u2019s of the credibility of the oral evidence as such, in the sense of forming a perception of the veracity of statements, in particular on the basis of the demeanour of the person under examination; rather, the Supreme Court concluded that the evidentiary value of that evidence was \u201csignificantly diminished\u201d on technical or procedural grounds, namely the manner in which the evidence had been taken, in particular by allowing the defendants to be present while co-accused were giving evidence.",

To that extent, the Court does not discern any substantive distinction between the reliability and the credibility of the oral testimony in this context. The fact is that the Supreme Court at the very least disregarded to a considerable extent part of the evidence which had been taken into account by the District Court when it acquitted the applicant and based his conviction primarily, if not exclusively, on its own assessment of the contents of the telephone conversation between the applicant and B. While the Supreme Court was entitled under domestic law to re-evaluate the tangible evidence, its reliance on that evidence while wholly or largely discounting the explanations provided in the oral testimony inevitably meant that it \u201chad to some extent to make its own assessment for the purposes of determining whether [the facts] provided a sufficient basis for convicting the applicant\u201d (Botten v. Norway, cited above, \u00a7 49). In the Court\u2019s view, this cannot be regarded as an application of purely legal considerations to the established facts; on the contrary, it involved a fresh evaluation of the evidence as a whole, resulting in the conviction of the applicant on the basis of evidence which differed from that on which the District Court had relied in order to acquit the applicant (cf. Lacadena Calero v. Spain, no. 23002/07, \u00a7\u00a7 39-51, 22 November 2011). It follows that, as a matter of fair trial and taking into account what was at stake for the applicant, the Supreme Court could not properly examine the issues to be determined on appeal without a direct assessment of the evidence given orally by the applicant, his co-accused and one of the witnesses, which was relied upon by the District Court in its overall probative assessment of the context in which the telephone conversation between the applicant and B. on 28 February 2011 took place. In the alternative, the Supreme Court had the option of quashing the District Court\u2019s acquittal of the charges laid against the applicant and referring the case back for a retrial due to the deficient manner in which the Supreme Court considered that oral testimony had been taken at first instance.",

In this regard, the Court observes that sections\u00a0228 and 232 of the Criminal Procedures Act provide that the Committee on Reopening of Judicial Proceedings can, when certain conditions are fulfilled, order the reopening of criminal proceedings that have been terminated by a final judgment rendered in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08, 50571/08, 50573/08 and 40351/09, \u00a7 315, 30\u00a0September 2016, and Ramos Nunes de Carvalho E S\u00c1 v.

In this regard, the Court emphasises the importance of ensuring that domestic procedures are in place whereby a case may be re-examined in the light of a finding that Article 6 of the Convention has been violated. As the Court has previously stressed, such procedures may be regarded as an important aspect of the execution of its judgments and their availability demonstrates a Contracting State\u2019s commitment to the Convention and to the Court\u2019s case-law (Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no. 19867/12, \u00a7 99, 11 July 2017).",
