It does not discern any causal link between the violation of the applicant\u2019s right under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention to a hearing within reasonable time found above and the pecuniary damage alleged. The Court therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, the Court considers that the applicant must have sustained non-pecuniary damage. Ruling on an equitable basis and having regard to the circumstances of the case including the applicant\u2019s conduct in the proceedings, the Court awards her 3,000 euros (EUR) under that head.",

To be recoverable, the domestic costs and expenses must also be incurred to prevent or obtain redress for the violation found. In the present case the Court fails to see any connection between, on the one hand, the costs of the applicant\u2019s legal representation in the domestic proceedings and, on the other, the violation found. Regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court finds it appropriate to award the applicant, who was not represented before the Court by a lawyer, EUR 50 for postage and other out-of-pocket expenses which she incurred in the context of filing and pursuing her application.",
