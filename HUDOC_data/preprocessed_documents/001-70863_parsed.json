The Court reiterates that civil legislation which has a retroactive effect is not expressly prohibited by the Convention, and in certain circumstances could be justified (see, mutatis mutandis, application no. 8531/79, Commission decision of 10 March 1981, Decisions and Reports (DR) 23, pp. 203-211). However, the Secondary Education Act itself does not contain any retroactive provisions and therefore the Court fails to comprehend the grounds on which the domestic courts applied this Act to the applicant\u2019s claim for the 20% salary increase for the period of 1\u00a0January to 23 June 1999. In sum, the ultimate denial by the domestic authorities of the applicant\u2019s entitlement to this benefit for the period in question appears to be arbitrary and not based on the law.",
