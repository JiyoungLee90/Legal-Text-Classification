This interpretation was also in line with the Court's case-law (see, for example, Z\u00a0v. , 25 February 1997, \u00a7 99, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I, and P4 Radio Hele Norge ASA v.

As B. had taken an active and willing part in the events of 4\u00a0December 1996, leading to A.'s conviction and dismissal, it is difficult to see how her involvement in the events was not a matter of public interest. Even though the articles in question focused on issues other than the incident, the Court considers that these issues stemmed from it and that there was therefore a continuing element of public interest involved also in respect of B. In this connection, the Court notes that, when assessing the cases stemming from the incident of 4\u00a0December 1996, the national authorities and the national courts also reached different conclusions as to whether B. could be considered as having waived her right to privacy when choosing to become involved with a public figure and in being a party to the incident, leading also to her conviction (see Tuomela and others v. Finland, 25711/04, 6 April 2010; Flinkkil\u00e4 and others v. Finland, cited above; and Jokitaipale and others v. Finland, cited above).
