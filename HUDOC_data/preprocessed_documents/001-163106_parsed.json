In 2008-09 he had actively sought the institution of criminal proceedings against the police officers, but the domestic authorities had repeatedly refused his requests after carrying out several pre-investigation inquiries. Judicial review of the investigating authorities\u2019 refusals was inaccessible following the revocation of those decisions by the supervising authorities (see paragraph 15 above). The preinvestigation inquiry under Article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with its short time-limits and limited powers of an investigator could not be considered an effective remedy for the establishment of the facts and circumstances of his ill-treatment. The only potentially effective remedy against the violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 3 of the Convention would have been the prompt institution of criminal proceedings against the police officers and the timely carrying out of a full-scale criminal investigation. However, it was only after the application had been communicated to the Russian Government that the domestic authorities had decided to open the criminal case in March 2011. The delay in the opening of the criminal case had resulted in the failure of the domestic authorities to investigate the incident of ill-treatment while the matter was still fresh. In particular, the identification of the police officers three years after the incident of ill-treatment had been extremely difficult. Further, not all the police officers who had been on duty at the Tsentralniy OVD on 7 March 2008 had been presented to the applicant for identification. Although a doctor had been appointed by the investigator, no forensic medical examination had been conducted in the course of the preliminary investigation, which would have allowed the applicant to put additional questions to the medical expert \u2013 a right he had not been able to exercise when the forensic medical examination had been conducted in the course of the pre-investigation inquiry (see paragraph 18 above). Regardless of the above, in July\u00a02011 the preliminary investigation of the case had been suspended indefinitely due to the impossibility of identifying those responsible for the ill-treatment.",

On 8 March 2008 the applicant applied for medical assistance at the town hospital, which recorded that he had a bruised chest. On 10 March 2008 the applicant was examined by a forensic medical expert, who recorded bruises on the applicant\u2019s chest, right eye and right wrist, and scratches on the left of his forehead and both wrists. The expert concluded that the above injuries were inflicted by a blunt hard object one to three days before the examination, possibly on 7\u00a0March 2008. On 11 March 2008 the applicant was further examined at the local polyclinic, which diagnosed him as having developed periarthritis as a result of trauma of the wrist joints (see paragraphs 7-9 above). Nothing indicates that the applicant had those injuries before he was taken into custody. The Government were therefore required to provide a plausible explanation as to how those injuries could have been caused.",
