During cross-examination by the applicant, Police Officer A agreed that the human body was in itself decent and was not harmful or alarming. He accepted that nothing in the applicant\u2019s behaviour at the time of his arrest, other than his nakedness, gave the police any cause for concern. Police Officer B gave evidence that she considered the fact that the applicant had no clothes on in a public place to be very strange and unusual and that she was \u201cquite shocked\u201d by it. She explained that at the time, Edinburgh Road had been very busy with vehicular and pedestrian traffic. She had previously seen elderly people and children in the area, and there were schools and housing nearby. In cross-examination she also agreed that the human body in itself was not harmful, indecent or bad but maintained that although she had been forewarned that she would be likely to see a naked man in public she had still been shocked. She confirmed that no complaints had been received from members of the public.",

The appellant was walking along a public street in full view of anyone passing and he was completely naked with his private parts entirely on show. Such conduct would be severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people especially when it was being carried out in an ordinary public street. It might be different if he had been naked somewhere in private, even in a public place which was remote or where fewer people would be congregated, but in or near one of the main streets of a busy town his appearance in that state would be alarming.",

[I]t is, in our view, clear that what is required to constitute the crime is conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and threaten serious disturbance to the community ...

As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. However, it has been said that the six-month time-limit does not apply as such to continuing situations because, if there is a situation of ongoing breach, the time-limit in effect starts afresh each day and it is only once the situation ceases that the final period of six months will run to its end (Chiragov and Others v.

States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see, amongst many authorities, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16\u00a0September 1996, \u00a7 65, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011IV; and Blatchford v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 14447/06, 22 June 2010).",

The national authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in matters of morals, since there is no uniform European conception of morals. Accordingly State authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of the requirements of morals as well as on the necessity of measures intended to meet them (see Handyside, cited above, \u00a7 48; and Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v. Ireland, 29 October 1992, \u00a7 68, Series A no.\u00a0246A). A narrow margin of appreciation applies in respect of debates on questions of public interest and the freedom of expression enjoyed by the press when exercising its vital role as a public watchdog (Animal Defenders International, cited above, \u00a7 102). While they do not benefit from the special protection afforded to the press, even small and informal campaign groups must be able to carry on their activities effectively. There exists a strong public interest in enabling such groups and individuals, outside the mainstream, to contribute to the public debate by disseminating information and ideas on matters of general public interest such as health and the environment (Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2005-II and, mutatis mutandis, Bowman v. the United Kingdom, 19\u00a0February 1998, Reports 1998\u2011I).",

These duties and responsibilities must be taken into account in the Court\u2019s assessment of the necessity of the measure (see Handyside, cited above, \u00a7 49; and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s v. France, no. 71111/01, \u00a7 42, 14 June 2007).

This being so, it said, it may be considered necessary in certain democratic societies to sanction or even prevent improper attacks on objects of religious veneration, provided always that the penalty imposed be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see Otto-Preminger-Institut v.

The measures taken against him were not the result of any blanket prohibition: each incident was considered on its facts and in light of the applicant\u2019s own history of offending. Following his early arrests, he was generally released with no further action being pursued (see paragraphs 8 to 31 above). On the occasions when he was prosecuted, the courts demonstrated a similarly individualised approach. The applicant was only convicted after it had established at trial, on the basis of evidence as to his conduct in a particularly public place, that the offence of breach of the peace had been made out, namely that he had caused alarm to other people and serious disturbance to the community (see paragraph 101 above) On one occasion the Sheriff found on the prosecution evidence that there was no case to answer and three times the applicant was found not guilty, either following acceptance of a not guilty plea or after a trial of the facts (see paragraphs 19, 24, 36 and 48 above). Following the applicant\u2019s 2011 trial, at which he also appeared naked (see paragraph 76 above), the Sheriff was satisfied that the applicant\u2019s appearance naked on a public road outside HMP Perth was sufficiently severe to cause alarm to ordinary people and serious disturbance to the community (see paragraph 80 above). Although the applicant could have avoided arrest outside HMP Perth by complying with the police officers\u2019 request that he put on clothes, he refused to do so (see paragraph 75 above). The Sheriff commented that had the applicant appeared naked in a more remote place or in a place where fewer people would be congregated, rather than \u201cin or near one of the main streets of a busy town\u201d, he might have reached a different conclusion (see paragraph 80 above).",

It was only after a number of convictions for public nudity that the courts began to impose more substantial custodial sentences on the applicant. Even then, efforts were made to reach a less severe penalty. When sentencing the applicant for breach of the peace in 2009, the Sheriff explored the possibility of a non-custodial sentence if the applicant would agree to wear clothes, and only imposed a one-year sentence when the applicant refused to accept a condition of remaining clothed (see paragraph 60-61 above). By the time of his 2011 conviction and sentence of 330 days, together with a requirement to serve in addition 237 days outstanding for a previous sentence (see paragraph 81 above), he had been arrested over thirty times for public nudity and convicted almost twenty times. In assessing the proportionality of the penalty imposed, the Court is therefore not concerned with the respondent State\u2019s response to an individual incident of public nudity but with its response to the applicant\u2019s persistent public nudity and his wilful and contumacious refusal to obey the law over a number of years (see for example the Sheriff\u2019s comments as to sentence in respect of the June 2009 conviction at paragraphs 60-61 above).",

At the point at which he subsequently left Scotland on 9 October 2012, he had spent almost six and a half consecutive years in prison with less than a dozen days at liberty throughout the entire period. The cumulative period of imprisonment in Scotland since 2003 for the repeated instances of his refusal to dress in public stands at over seven years. While the penalty imposed for each individual offence, taken on its own, is not such as to raise an issue under Article 10 in terms of lack of proportionality, the cumulative impact on the applicant of the measures taken by the respondent State, which was undeniably severe, is otherwise. However, the applicant\u2019s own responsibility for the convictions and the sentences imposed cannot be ignored. In exercising his right to freedom of expression, he was in principle under a general duty to respect the country\u2019s laws and to pursue his desire to bring about legislative or societal change in accordance with them (see, mutatis mutandis, T\u0103nase, cited above, \u00a7 167). Many other avenues for the expression of his opinion on nudity or for initiating a public debate on the subject were open to the applicant. He was also under a duty, particularly in light of the fact that he was asking for tolerance in respect of his own conduct, to demonstrate tolerance of and sensibility to the views of other members of the public. However, the applicant appears to reject any suggestion that acceptance of public nudity may vary depending on the nature of the location and the presence of other members of the public. Without any demonstration of sensibility to the views of others and the behaviour that they might consider offensive, he insists upon his right to appear naked at all times and in all places, including in the courts, in the communal areas of prisons and on aeroplanes (see, for example, paragraphs\u00a022, 29, 33, 53, 76 and 93 above).",

However, the applicant\u2019s imprisonment is the consequence of his repeated violation of the criminal law in full knowledge of the consequences, through conduct which he knew full well not only goes against the standards of accepted public behaviour in any modern democratic society but also is liable to be alarming and morally and otherwise offensive to other, unwarned members of the public going about their ordinary business. Having regard to the considerations set out above and to the wide margin of appreciation, the Court finds that the reasons for the measures adopted by the police, the prosecuting authorities and the courts, and in particular those adopted in respect of his arrest in 2011, were \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d and that the measures met a pressing social need in response to repeated anti-social conduct by the applicant. It cannot be said that the repressive measures taken in reaction to the particular, repeated form of expression chosen by the applicant to communicate his opinion on nudity were, even if considered cumulatively, disproportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued, namely the prevention of disorder and crime. In particular, Article 10 does not go so far as to enable individuals, even those sincerely convinced of the virtue of their own beliefs, to repeatedly impose their antisocial conduct on other, unwilling members of society and then to claim a disproportionate interference with the exercise of their freedom of expression when the State, in the performance of its duty to protect the public from public nuisances, enforces the law in respect of such deliberately repetitive antisocial conduct. Even though, cumulatively, the penalties imposed on the applicant undoubtedly did entail serious consequences for him, the Court cannot find in the circumstances of his case, having regard in particular to his own responsibility for his plight, that the public authorities in Scotland unjustifiably interfered with his exercise of freedom of expression. Accordingly, no violation of Article 10 of the Convention has been established.",

In general terms, it secures to the individual a sphere within which he can freely pursue the development and fulfilment of his personality (see Sidabras and D\u017eiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480/00 and 59330/00, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2004VIII; and Shtukaturov v. Russia, no. 44009/05, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2008). In S.A.S. v.

The notion of private life also protects a right to identity and to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world. There is, therefore, a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d (see P.G.\u00a0and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2001-IX; Peck\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2003I; Perry\u00a0v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 63737/00, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2003\u2011IX (extracts); and Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, no. 4158/05, \u00a7\u00a061, ECHR 2010 (extracts)).",

However, the fact that behaviour is prohibited by the criminal law is not sufficient to bring it outside the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d (see A.D.T. v. the United Kingdom, no. 35765/97, \u00a7 23, ECHR 2000IX; and Pay v. the United Kingdom (dec.). no. 32792/05, 16\u00a0September 2003). Finally, the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the guarantee afforded by Article 8, (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a02346/02, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2002III; and Gillan and Quinton, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061).",

The Court has found that his conduct amounted to a form of expression protected by Article 10 (see paragraph\u00a0150). It has previously indicated that a distinction must be drawn between carrying out an activity for personal fulfilment and carrying out the same activity for a public purpose, where one cannot be said to be acting for personal fulfilment alone (see Friend and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a042). Furthermore, as concerns in particular an individual\u2019s personal choices as to his desired appearance in public (as referred to in S.A.S., cited above), on analogy with the applicability of Article 9 of the Convention to religious beliefs (text of Article 9 cited below at paragraph 185), Article 8 cannot be taken to protect every conceivable personal choice in that domain: there must presumably be a de minimis level of seriousness as to the choice of desired appearance in question (see, mutatis mutandis, in relation to Article\u00a09, Bayatyan, cited above, \u00a7 110; and Eweida and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 48420/10, \u00a7 81, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). Whether the requisite level of seriousness has been reached in relation to the applicant\u2019s choice to appear fully naked on all occasions in all public places without distinction may be doubted, having regard to the absence of support for such a choice in any known democratic society in the world. In any event, however, even if Article 8 were to be taken to be applicable to the circumstances of the present case, the Court is satisfied that those circumstances are not such as to disclose a violation of that provision on the part of the public authorities in Scotland. In sum, any interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life was justified under Article 8 \u00a7\u00a02 for essentially the same reasons given by the Court in the context of its analysis of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 10 of the Convention (see paragraphs 171-176 above).",
