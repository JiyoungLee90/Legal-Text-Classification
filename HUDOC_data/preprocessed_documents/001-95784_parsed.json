Thus the complaint intended to be made subsequently to the Court must first have been made - at least in substance - to the appropriate domestic body in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down \nin domestic law (see Cardot v. France, 19 March 1991, \u00a7 34, Series A no.\u00a0200). As soon as the Court is satisfied that the domestic legal system provided such a remedy and that the applicant has not used it, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him from the requirement (see Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR 1999-V). A mere doubt as to the prospect of success is not sufficient to exempt an applicant from submitting a complaint to the competent court (see, for example, Elsanova v.

However, the judgments delivered in the proceedings made no reference to M.C.V., except to mention him as among those who had introduced the action, and confined their operative part to the other plaintiffs. Moreover, an appeal by his three heirs, who are the above-mentioned applicants, was upheld by the Bucharest County Court, but even so that court did not mention them among those whose action had been admitted (see paragraph 12 above). Those three applicants also made no reference in their grounds for appeal to the fact that M.C.V. had not been mentioned in the operative part of the first-instance court; they only appealed on grounds related to the seizure and the sale of the property.",
