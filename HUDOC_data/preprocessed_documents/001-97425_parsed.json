Furthermore, the court considered that the term \u201cin absentia\u201d should be interpreted in the light of the reasons for absence of the person concerned from the court proceedings. The court observed that there could be plausible reasons for the absence of the accused and considered that the legislature had had such situations in mind when it made the reservation in the law on ratification of the European Convention on the International Validity of Criminal Judgments. On the other hand, if the accused knowingly absconded, such a person could be sentenced in absentia. The court noted that it could not question what had been established by the Prague City Court, which had stated in its decision that the applicant had absconded and had therefore been sentenced in absentia.

He noted that the applicant's trial had been conducted in his absence and that there was nothing to indicate that the Czech authorities had tried to inform the applicant about the trial or to use the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters to involve him in the proceedings. He further noted that neither international treaties nor Ukrainian law rendered the application of provisions about judgments rendered in absentia dependent on reasons for absence before the courts and that the Court of Appeal had adopted its own interpretation of the term \u201cin absentia\u201d, in contravention of the law. He also criticised the analogy used by the court in comparing the trial in absentia in the  with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine. He further noted that the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the Additional Protocol thereto were inapplicable in the applicant's case, because the judgment against him had been rendered in absentia and the Ministry of Justice of the Czech Republic had not made a request for the applicant to be transferred as a sentenced person. He noted that the Czech Republic and Ukraine had agreed on the application of the European Convention on the Transfer of Proceedings in Criminal Matters, and the Court of Appeal had merely to decide on the agreement between the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine and the Ministry of Justice of the Czech Republic by declaring their reference to the European Convention on the Transfer of Proceedings in Criminal Matters erroneous. Furthermore, Article 22 of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons clearly stipulated that it was for the central authorities to decide under what treaty on international legal assistance their requests should be treated. He further noted that the court had not verified that the judgment of the Czech court was final and enforceable. He requested the Supreme Court to quash the decision of the Court of Appeal and to reject the request of the Czech authorities concerning the applicant.",
