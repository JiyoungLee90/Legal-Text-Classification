Since then, however, the relative importance of these two opposing interests had changed; in particular, following the judgment of the European Court in the Marckx v. Belgium case (13 June 1979, Series A no. 31), legal differences between \"legitimate\" and \"illegitimate\" children had to a large extent disappeared. In view of these developments, it could no longer be said that in cases where, for the purposes of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, there was a relationship between the child and its biological father amounting to \"family life\", the importance of maintaining a child\u2019s \"legitimate\" status overrode the interest protected by section 1:198 (3) CC.",

This principle of \"evolutive and creative\" interpretation (see Luzius Wildhaber, \"Nouvelle jurisprudence concernant l\u2019article 8 (art. 8) CEDH\", in M\u00e9langes en l\u2019honneur de Jacques-Michel Grossen, 1992, p. 106), which allows the Convention to be adapted to the changing circumstances of our democratic societies, thus making it \"a living instrument\", means however that in practice the Court is confronted with a difficult dilemma: that \"of guarding against the risk of exceeding its given judicial role of interpretation by overruling policy decisions taken by elected, representative bodies who have the main responsibility in democratic societies for enacting important legislative changes, whilst not abdicating its own responsibility of independent review of governmental action\" (see Paul Mahoney and S\u00f8ren Prebensen, \"The European Court of Human Rights\", in The European System for the Protection of Human Rights, R.

In my opinion, this conclusion involves a dangerous generalisation of the special circumstances of the instant case and one which imposes on the Contracting States an obligation not included in the text of Article 8 (art. 8), based on changeable moral criteria or opinions on social values.",

These reforms have achieved a certain approximation of national laws but not their uniformity, particularly in regard to the regulation of procedures for denying legal paternity, which still take many different forms.

In matters of this type, I believe that it is a principle of good law to hold that the interests of the child are paramount. In the present case, the child Samir will be seven years old when the judgment of this Court will be delivered. He is listed as an \"applicant\" together with the mother and his auto-proclaimed \"father\". The interests of the child were never looked after by an independent person, a \"curator ad litem\", and in fact they are not mentioned in the judgment.

The exception to this refers to circumstances related to necessity, i.e. separations brought about by reasons of work, illness or other necessities of the family itself. Forced or coerced living apart, therefore, is clearly an accepted exception. But, equally clearly, this does not apply when the separation is completely voluntary. When it is voluntary, then clearly the member or members of the family who do so have opted against family life, against living together as a family. And since these are the circumstances of the instant case where the first two applicants have voluntarily opted not to have a \"family life\", I cannot understand how they can call upon  law to respect something which they have wilfully opted against. The artificiality of this approach is in strident contradiction with the natural value of family life which the Convention guarantees. The judgment moreover fails to explain how \"a relationship [which] has sufficient constancy to create ... family ties\" can be made equivalent to \"a relationship which has sufficient constancy to create family life\" - as manifestly these two propositions are by no means the same or equivalent.",

In conclusion therefore, I cannot agree with the majority of my colleagues because: (a) in the legislation of a substantial number of Contracting States rules similar to those of the impugned Netherlands law are principally concerned with the protection of the rights and interests of the child (even against the \"opportunist\" wishes of the parents) and this vital and important factor has not been given sufficient consideration in a matter which may have a substantial impact as to where exactly the margin of appreciation lies which each one of the Contracting States enjoys in this matter; and (b) there is no \"family life\" in the instant case, even if there are biological reasons for holding that there are \"family ties\". Moreover, in paragraph 40 of the judgment, reference is made to \"social reality\" as one of the factors which should prevail over the legal presumption of paternity. In my opinion, ever mindful of the frequent appeals and invocations made to \"social reality\" in justification of certain notorious laws enacted in Soviet Russia (1920-1989) and in Nazi Germany (1933-1945), it is dangerous and unsafe to bring such criteria into the field of family rights. The approach to those rights should be made from steadier and more stable platforms.",
