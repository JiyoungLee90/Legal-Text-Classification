The Court in particular found the main investigation to be procedurally defective, particularly by reason of its excessive length and long periods of inactivity, as well as because of the lack of involvement of the victims or their relatives, respectively, in the proceedings and of the lack of information to the public about the progress of the inquiry. Identifying similar shortcomings in the present case, the Court cannot therefore depart from its previous approach on the matter.",
