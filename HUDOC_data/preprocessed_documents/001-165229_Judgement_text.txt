The case originated in an application (no. 67587/11) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Ms Andrásné Dénes (“the applicant”), on 25 October 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr E. Kiss, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent at the Ministry of Justice.
On 31 August 2015 the applicant’s complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention concerning the imposition of 98% tax on her severance pay was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Budapest.
From 1 July 2002 the applicant was employed as a civil servant at the Prime Minister’s Office. Her service was terminated by the employer on 15 May 2010.
Under new legislation (see paragraph 7 below) the applicant’s severance pay was subject to special tax at a 98% rate in its part exceeding 3,500,000 Hungarian forints (HUF). Accordingly, special tax was levied upon her severance pay in the amount of HUF 5,511,909 (approximately 18,400 euros (EUR)).
