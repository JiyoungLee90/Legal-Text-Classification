As to the applicant\u2019s conduct, it observes that the hearings of 7\u00a0October 1993, 22\u00a0September 1994 and 3 July 1995 were adjourned, respectively, to 18\u00a0November 1993, 14 October 1994 and 9 January 1996 at the request of the counsels of the accused. These events, which caused a delay of more than eight months, are objectives facts, not imputable to the State\u2019s authorities and to take into consideration in order to assess whether the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement contained in Article 6 \u00a7 1 has been complied with. Nevertheless, even if these adjournments were requested by the counsels of the accused and the applicant may be considered partly responsible for the delay which resulted, this cannot justify the length of the periods in between individual hearings and certainly not the total length of the proceedings (see the Zana v. Turkey judgment of 25 November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p. 2552, \u00a7 79). The Court moreover notes that the hearings of 19 June 1992 and 23 June 1994 were postponed, respectively, to 10 October 1992 and to 22 September 1994 because of lawyers\u2019 strikes. In this respect the Court recalls that a delay in the criminal proceedings caused by a lawyers\u2019 strike cannot be attributed to the State, whereas the period of time elapsed between the end of the strike and the new hearing is to be imputed to the conduct of the authorities (see the Portington v. Greece judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2633, \u00a7\u00a033). The Court is not unaware of the complications which strikes may cause by overloading the list of cases to be heard by courts (see, mutatis mutandis, the Papageorgiou v. Greece judgment of 22 October 1997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 2291, \u00a7 48). Nevertheless, having regard to the fact that the following hearings were fixed, respectively, after three months and twenty-one days and after three months, the Court considers that these periods must be imputed, at least in part, to the State\u2019s authorities.
