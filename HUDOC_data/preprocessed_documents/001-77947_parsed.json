It thus held a total of 63 iron-ore mining concessions in  on the date when it announced that it was to shut down its mining operations. Iron-ore mining had been in constant decline since 1963. The company was forced to discontinue its mining activity because worldwide competition meant that it was no longer profitable to mine iron-ore in . The applicant company's iron-ore production had thus fallen from 13,940,000 tonnes in 1978 to 4,300,000 tonnes in 1991. As the demand for the applicant company's phosphoric pig iron had slowly dwindled away, it decided in 1991 to halt production. The closure of the various pits was staggered between 30 June 1992 and 31 July 1993. The applicant company had to stop all extraction operations in July 1993. It underwent privatisation in 1995 and in 1997.",

It ends when the authorities are able to confirm that the requirements have been fulfilled. The renunciation procedure terminates the concession with the result that its holder is no longer bound by the special mining regulations and is released from the presumption of liability in respect of any damage which occurs above ground. At the time when the cessation of the company's operations was announced, the abandonment and renunciation procedures were governed by Articles 83 and 84 of the Mining Code and by Decree no. 80-330 of 7\u00a0May 1980 concerning mining and quarrying regulations. Law no. 94-588 of 15 July 1994, amending certain provisions of the Mining Code, repealed Articles 83 and 84 and replaced them by Articles 79 and 84. Decree no. 95-696 of 9\u00a0May 1995, issued after consultation of the Conseil d'Etat, pertaining to the opening of mines and mining regulations, was adopted for the implementation of those provisions. Lastly, Law no. 99-245 of 30\u00a0March 1999 concerning liability for damage resulting from mining and the prevention of mining-related risks after discontinuance, brought about further amendments to mining law (see paragraphs 29 to 33 below).",

In this connection it pointed out that for two concessions the renunciation had been accepted (Valleroy and Moutiers), whilst in the other cases, the abandonment had become effective after the completion of the work prescribed by the prefect in 1995 and 1996 or was still in progress. It lastly considered that, in respect of the former concessions in question, the declarations of abandonment and applications for renunciation had been filed with the prefecture before the entry into force of the Law of 15 July 1994 (see paragraph 31 below) amending certain provisions of the Mining Code and that those concessions could only therefore fall within the statutory and regulatory framework that existed prior to the entry into force of that Law (former Articles 83 and 84 of the Mining Code, see paragraph 29 below).",

They were also entitled, on account of the urgency, without consulting the mine operator and as soon as the report had been issued by the experts appointed in the order of 26\u00a0May 1997, to require the company, in the order of 18 July 1997, to ensure that a network of building experts was permanently available.

Article 49 of the decree of 9\u00a0May 1995 provides: 'The administrative supervision and the mining regulations shall cease to take effect on the date that the operator is issued with formal confirmation that the work has been completed ... / However, the prefect shall be empowered ... to take ... any measures that may be rendered necessary by incidents or accidents that can be attributed to former mining work, when such events are capable of damaging the interests protected by Article 79 of the Mining Code, until the expiry of the mining concession'. Article 119-4 of the Mining Code provides: 'renunciation, whether total or partial, of rights to mine or quarry prospecting or exploration shall become final only after being accepted by the minister responsible for mining'. Article 34 of the decree of 19 April 1995 provides: 'Applications for renunciation of a mining concession shall be lodged with the minister responsible for mining. / ...

It follows from the documents in the case file that, whilst some of the mines enumerated in Article 2 of the order appealed had been the subject of an abandonment procedure, as had been confirmed by the Regional Director for Industry, Research and the Environment, none of the corresponding concessions, at the date of the order appealed, had expired or had been the subject of a renunciation procedure accepted by the minister, such express acceptance alone being capable, contrary to what has been argued in a new memorial filed the day before the hearing, regardless of the date of that acceptance, of giving full effect to any renunciation.

In particular, the applicant explained that the Conseil d'Etat had fully participated in the legislative reforms of mining law and that it could not be independent or impartial with regard to questions concerning the implementation of those reforms. The applicant further stated that this lack of independence and impartiality was illustrated by the fact that, on 26 May 2000, one of the members of the bench which delivered the judgment of 19\u00a0May 2000 had been appointed to the post of Secretary General in the ministry responsible for mining. Secondly, the applicant company complained that the Conseil d'Etat had consecutively exercised advisory and judicial functions, explaining that the Public Works Division had issued an advisory opinion in response to a request from the Secretary of State for Industry concerning various questions of mining law, whilst it had also been requested to rule on an administrative appeal against the order of 18 May 1997, and that the Judicial Division had then simply adopted the findings of the administrative division. The applicant company thus concluded that the Conseil d'Etat, in its judgments of 19\u00a0May 2000 and 5 April 2002, had not given an independent and impartial ruling.",

The function in question was exercised by the largest formation, the General Assembly, made up at least of the six division presidents and thirty-five senior members (conseillers d'Etat). The applicant pointed out that it was not disputed by the Government that the members of the benches which delivered the judgments of 19 May 2000 and 5 April 2002 had also participated in the work of the administrative arm which prepared those legislative reforms. In the applicant's submission, it was realistic and pragmatic to consider that the position adopted by the administrative arm would inevitably have influenced the Judicial Division. The Conseil d'Etat could not be privy to government secrets and then rule as an independent and impartial tribunal on appeals against administrative decisions taken by the executive on the basis of legislation that it had helped to prepare. An institution which exercised a legislative function and prepared enactments that drastically amended the Mining Code, thereby imposing unforeseeable constraints and excessive burdens on the holders of mining concessions, could not then rule as an independent and impartial tribunal on questions concerning the implementation of such reforms. This was also the case where the institution intervened in secondary legislation: it considered itself to be the co-author of government decrees, as was apparent from legal writings and confirmed by the case-law of the Conseil d'Etat itself, since, where it had not been properly consulted, a decree would be set aside because of disregard for the \u201cauthority exercised by the Conseil d'Etat jointly with the Government\u201d (see Conseil d'Etat, full court, 9 June 1978, SCI Boulevard Arago, Recueil, p. 237). Given the close relationship between the Government and the Conseil d'Etat, the applicant considered that the lack of independence and impartiality verged on failure to comply with the separation of powers (see McGonnell\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a028488/95, ECHR 2000II) and went far beyond the basic lack of impartiality identified in Procola\u00a0v. Luxembourg (judgment of 28 September 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0326). In the present case, the Conseil d'Etat had itself decided, jointly with the French Government, on the regulatory measures applying to the legislation that it had prepared.",

Within the Conseil d'Etat there was no group of civil servants acting exclusively in a judicial capacity. During their careers, members of the Conseil d'Etat held other senior positions in the civil service. Decree no.\u00a063-766 of 30 July 1963 concerning the organisation and functioning of the Conseil d'Etat provided for an intermingling of its members between the administrative divisions and the Judicial Division. This principle of operation meant that a litigant could not be guaranteed a truly independent judge. Thus, in the present case, Mr Bernard P\u00eacheur, a senior member of the Conseil d'Etat who sat on the bench which delivered the judgment of 19\u00a0May 2000, had been appointed, by a decree of 26 May 2000, to the post of Secretary General in the Ministry for Economic Affairs, Finance and Industry, the very ministry which bore responsibility for mining policy, at a time when the judgment had not even been notified. In the applicant's submission, such a practice by the Government was likely to cast serious doubt on the independence of the Conseil d'Etat when ruling in its judicial capacity, thus undermining the necessary confidence that justice should inspire in the public. It could be inferred that, while the deliberation was in progress, one of the members of the bench had been under consideration for appointment to a particularly senior position in the ministry against which the concession-holder had brought proceedings. There had thus been a lack of separation between the executive and the Conseil d'Etat \u2013 a situation which, to be sure, constituted one of the essential features of the institution. The problem stemmed from the absence of any statutory definition of a status capable of guaranteeing the independence and impartiality of the members of the Conseil d'Etat when acting in their judicial capacity. That shortcoming constituted in itself a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Co\u00ebme and Others\u00a0v.

The Government referred to the guarantees of independence inherent in the status of the members of the French Conseil d'Etat, as described by the Court in the above-mentioned Kress judgment. They submitted that this status entailed sound safeguards that could be compared to those of the Council of State in the , which the Court had examined in connection with the right to be heard by an independent tribunal in its above-mentioned Kleyn and Others judgment.

They firstly pointed out that \u201cthe personal impartiality of a judge [had to] be presumed until there [was] proof to the contrary\u201d (see Morel\u00a0v. France, no.\u00a034130/96, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2000VI). They explained, moreover, that the member in question was admitted to the Conseil d'Etat in 1985 and that he had initially acquired considerable experience within the administrative Finance Division, then as a member of the sixth section of the Conseil d'Etat responsible for supervising financial-market authorities, public finance courts, planning law and environmental matters. It was solely on the basis of this judge's experience that the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Finance and Industry proposed to the President of the Republic, in April 2000, that he be appointed to the newly-created post of Secretary General in the ministry concerned. The Government added that the process of judicial review in the Conseil d'Etat comprised a series of individual examinations (by the reporting judge, reviser, Government Commissioner and the president of the bench) and collegiate examinations (preparatory stage and judgment stage) which were spread over a period of time. Thus, in view of the safeguards arising from the actual organisation of this process and the secrecy of the voting in deliberations, a connection between the collegiate resolution of a dispute and the subsequent assignment of one of the members of the bench to a post outside the Conseil d'Etat could not be regarded as a factor capable of influencing the opinions of persons participating in that resolution. Lastly, and more generally, the Government claimed that the participation of members of the Conseil d'Etat in other public-service duties, far from undermining the independence or impartiality of the Conseil d'Etat, in fact enhanced its capacity for supervision of the executive as it gave its members precise knowledge of the workings of the civil service.",

This function therefore provided an important safeguard for everyone to whom the proposed texts would be applicable. Moreover, it could not be inferred from the advisory role of the Conseil d'Etat that it was itself the author of the primary or secondary legislation submitted to it for consideration. The Government pointed out that the SCI Arago precedent cited by the applicant company was no longer relevant and that more recent decisions had omitted reference to authority being exercised by the Conseil d'Etat jointly with the Government. The lack of proper consultation of the Conseil d'Etat, when mandatory, vitiated the very authority of the text's author (see Conseil d'Etat, full court, 15 April 1996, Union nationale des pharmacies et autres, Recueil, p. 127), thus maintaining the possibility for this ground to be raised proprio motu without any need to treat the Conseil d'Etat as a co-author of the text, which it was not.

One of the members of the judicial bench had been appointed to the post of Secretary General at the Ministry for Economic Affairs, Finance and Industry, and the Public Works Division had issued an advisory opinion, as requested by the Minister, which directly concerned the measures of mining administration that could be imposed on holders of mining concessions upon the termination of their activity.

Through its opinions, the Conseil d'Etat in fact sought to prevent any illegality that, in any event, a court would only be able to condemn subsequently, once the administrative decisions had been taken and perhaps also implemented. The aim of such prior scrutiny of legality was to improve the quality of the decision and it was also a guarantee of greater stability in the legal rule.",

The examination of such questions differed significantly between the context of the advisory function and that of the judicial function, and a difference of position between the two could not be seen as the overruling of one by the other.

It is of the opinion that the impugned appointment was capable of casting doubt on the impartiality of the Conseil d'Etat. At the time of the deliberation in question, or even perhaps well before, one of the members of the bench had been under consideration for appointment to a senior position in the very ministry with which the applicant had a large number of significant disputes (see paragraph 11 above).

In the Kleyn and Others case, the French Government, intervening as a third-party, considered that \u201cthe fact that the same point of law [had been] submitted successively to the Conseil d'Etat in its advisory capacity and its judicial capacity did not as such constitute a ground, given its independence in both capacities, for an objective doubt in the mind of an appellant that could undermine the impartiality of the Judicial Division.\u00a0The impartiality of a body where advisory and judicial responsibilities coexisted did not pose a problem where an advisory opinion concerned merely a point of law. Where it concerned a question of fact, the assessment of the question whether an appellant could have objectively justified fears of bias depended on the merits of each case\u201d (see Kleyn and Others, cited above, \u00a7 189).

The litigation in question consisted in examining whether mining regulatory measures could still be imposed on the applicant company since it had claimed that declarations of abandonment and applications for renunciation had been made in respect of its concessions. Without denying the existence of a relationship between the legal questions raised in the opinion of 29\u00a0September 1997 and those arising in the litigation brought by the applicant company, the Court is unable to find that the issues involved in the opinion, having been addressed in a general and abstract manner, entailed any bias on the part of the members of the Judicial Division when they came to examine, three years later, the issues concerning the applicant company's concrete interests in the management of the termination of its mining operations, its disused mines being numerous and in different legal situations. Under those circumstances, the advisory opinion and the subsequent proceedings involving appeals against the inter-prefectoral orders providing for regulatory measures in the mining sector cannot be regarded as representing the \u201csame case\u201d or the \u201csame decision\u201d (see, mutatis mutandis, Kleyn and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 200 and 201).

Accordingly, agreeing with the applicant company, the majority were of the opinion that the impugned appointment was \u201clikely to cast doubt on the impartiality of the Conseil d'Etat\u201d. They consider that, in view of the fact that during the deliberation, \u201cor even perhaps well before\u201d \u2013 and we emphasise that point \u2013 one of the members of the judicial bench had been under consideration for appointment to a senior position in the ministry which was its opponent in a large number of major disputes, he could not appear as a neutral figure in the eyes of the applicant company. The majority considered that in the circumstances the company had no safeguards \u201cagainst possible extraneous influence\u201d on account of the impugned appointment \u201cat the time he exercised his judicial function in April\u201d, and that this was capable of giving rise to \u201cobjectively justified misgivings ex post facto about the independence and impartiality of the bench on which the member in question had sat\u201d (paragraph 69).",

In this connection, the Court has constantly held that the objective test consists in determining whether, irrespective of the judge's personal conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his impartiality. In this respect even appearances may be of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public. Accordingly, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw. In deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of a party is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see, among other authorities, Castillo Algar v. Spain, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998VIII, \u00a7\u00a045, and Morel v. France, no.\u00a034130/96, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2000VI). Similarly, the Court has held with equal consistency that a judge's final analysis in a given case is carried out when judgment is delivered and is based on the evidence produced and argument heard at the hearing (see, for example, Hauschildt v.\u00a0Denmark, judgment of 24 May 1989, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0154, \u00a7\u00a050; Nortier v.\u00a0the Netherlands, judgment of 24\u00a0August 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0267, \u00a7\u00a0332; Saraiva de Carvalho v. Portugal, judgment of 22 April 1994, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0286B, \u00a7\u00a035; and Morel, cited above, \u00a7 45).",

First, we consider that the applicant company did not produce any evidence to suggest that the guarantees of independence of members of the supreme French administrative court, as emphasised by the Court in Kress v. France (\u00a7\u00a7 31-37 and 71), could be called into question in the present case. On the contrary, as the present judgment points out, the position of the Conseil d'Etat among French institutions does not preclude the existence of guarantees as to its independence (paragraph 66). Secondly, we consider that, appearances notwithstanding, the appointment of the member of the Conseil d'Etat in question cannot in itself undermine the finding concerning the general judicial practice of the Conseil d'Etat for the simple reason \u2013 which is not in dispute and indeed unquestionable \u2013 that it took place after the member had exercised his judicial function. In addition, the applicant company failed to show how that appointment could have aroused suspicion of a link between the member of the Conseil d'Etat and the other party in the proceedings, or could have revealed the existence of any extraneous influence on the performance of his duties. In our opinion, the factors on which the majority have based their finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in this respect \u2013 that is to say the fact that discussions concerning the appointment were said to have begun \u201cprobably\u201d at least a certain time before the deliberation, in view of the importance of the vacancy to be filled, \u201cor even perhaps well before\u201d, and that those discussions concerned a member of the bench who was under consideration for a senior post in the ministry against which the applicant company had brought proceedings \u2013 appear to us to amount to pure conjecture. Appearances have their own limits and have to be based on objective facts, which we consider not to be the case here. In conclusion, it would have been better for the Court, in a case where it did have the opportunity to do so, to have set limits on an extreme attachment to the theory of appearances \u2013 a theory that could result in a form of general suspicion and, in the end, generate legal insecurity.",
