The judge considered there to be two ways to meet that need: the provision of a night-time carer or the provision of incontinence pads. The statutory scheme requiring that the applicant\u2019s needs be met allowed the local authority some flexibility about how that was to be done and the local authority was therefore quite entitled to meet the need in the most economic manner.

Other service users have held similar views when such measures were initially suggested but once they have tried them, and been provided with support in using them, they have realised that the pads/sheets improve the quality of life by protecting them from harm and allowing a degree of privacy and independence in circumstances which, as the result of health problems, are less than ideal.

In particular, she argued that if forced to use incontinence pads she would \u201close all sense of dignity\u201d and, as a consequence, she would suffer considerable distress. The local authority submitted that the provision of a night-time carer would cost GBP 22,270 per year, which would have to be paid out of the adult social care budget from which all other community care services for adults in the applicant\u2019s borough were funded. The local authority also argued that the use of pads would ensure the applicant\u2019s safety and provide her with greater privacy and independence in her own home. Finally, the local authority submitted that the weekly funding of GBP 450 could be used according to the applicant\u2019s preferences.

But it cannot possibly be argued that such respect was not afforded here. As already indicated, the respondents went to great lengths both to consult the appellant and [her partner] about the appellant\u2019s needs and the possible ways of meeting them and to try to reach agreement with her upon them. In doing so they sought to respect as far as possible her personal feelings and desires, at the same time taking account of her safety, her independence and their own responsibilities towards all their other clients. They respected the appellant\u2019s human dignity and autonomy, allowing her to choose the details of her care package within their overall assessment of her needs: for example, the particular hours of care attendance, whether to receive direct payments in order to employ her own care assistant, and the possibility of other options like extra care sheltered housing. These matters are all fully covered in paras 5, 42 and 66 of Rix LJ\u2019s judgment below. Like him, I too have the greatest sympathy for the appellant\u2019s misfortunes and a real understanding of her deepest antipathy towards using incontinence pads. But I also share Rix LJ\u2019s view that the appellant cannot establish an interference here by the respondents with her Article 8 rights. I add only that, even if such an interference were established, it would be clearly justified under Article 8(2) \u2013 save, of course, for the period prior to the 2009 review when the respondent\u2019s proposed care provision was not \u2018in accordance with the law\u2019 \u2013 on the grounds that it is necessary for the economic well-being of the respondents and the interests of their other service-users and is a proportionate response to the appellant\u2019s needs because it affords her the maximum protection from injury, greater privacy and independence, and results in a substantial costs saving.\u201d",

In this regard, the Court has previously held that the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 is a broad concept which encompasses, inter alia, a person\u2019s physical and psychological integrity (see Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 251\u2011B and Botta v.

In a number of cases the Court has held that Article 8 was relevant to complaints about public funding to facilitate the mobility and quality of life of disabled applicants (see, for example, Zehnalov\u00e1 and Zehnal v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 38621/97, ECHR\u00a02002V and Sentges v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 27677/02, 8 July 2003).",

Although the facts of the present case differ significantly from those of Pretty, insofar as the present applicant believed that the level of care offered by the local authority would have undignified and distressing consequences, she too was faced with the possibility of living in a manner which \u201cconflicted with [her] strongly held ideas of self and personal identity\u201d. In the Supreme Court, Baroness Hale, in her dissenting opinion, appeared to accept that considerations of human dignity were engaged when someone who could control her bodily functions was obliged to behave as if she could not (see paragraph 25 above). The Court agrees with this general assessment of the applicant\u2019s situation and it does not exclude that the particular measure complained of by the applicant in the present case was capable of having an impact on her enjoyment of her right to respect for private life as guaranteed under Article\u00a08 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. It therefore finds that the contested measure reducing the level of her healthcare falls within the scope of Article 8.",

Moldova, both cited above). Those cases concerned the refusal by the State to provide funding for medical equipment and/or treatment. In the present case, however, the local authority had initially provided the applicant with a night-time carer, albeit, in the description of the Supreme Court, as a \u201cconcession\u201d granted on a \u201ctemporary basis\u201d (see paragraph 11 above). The applicant is therefore complaining not of a lack of action but rather of the decision of the local authority to reduce the care package that it had hitherto been making available to her. As such, a more appropriate comparator would be the case of Watts v. The United Kingdom (dec.), no. 53586/09 of 4\u00a0May 2010, in which the Court was content to proceed on the basis that a decision to close the care home where the elderly applicant was resident and to transfer her to another home constituted an interference with her rights under Article 8.",

He further noted that the applicant\u2019s personal feelings and desires had properly been balanced against the local authority\u2019s concern for her safety, independence and respect for other care-users. Finally, he concluded that even if there had been an interference with her right to respect for her private life, save for the period prior to 4 November 2009 review when the proposed care provision was not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, the interference would have been necessary for the economic well-being of the respondents (that is, the local authority) and the interests of their other careusers and would therefore have been a proportionate response to her needs because it would have afforded her the maximum protection from injury, greater privacy and independence, and would have resulted in a substantial costs saving (see paragraph 24 above).",
