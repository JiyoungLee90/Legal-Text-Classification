Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2010). In cases of wilful ill-treatment by State agents in breach of Article 3, two measures are necessary to provide sufficient redress. Firstly, the State authorities must have conducted a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 115-16). Secondly, compensation for the nonpecuniary damage flowing from the breach should in principle be part of the range of available remedies (see Stanev v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a036760/06, \u00a7 218, ECHR 2012).",

For six hours the following day they continued to ill-treat him, punching him numerous times in the head and threatening to detain him. Such treatment caused the applicant bodily injuries and serious physical and mental suffering. The police officers acted intentionally with the aim of humiliating him, driving him into submission and making him confess to the crime. The Court considers that such treatment amounted to torture (see, for instance, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a096105, ECHR 1999V, and G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 90).",

However, it notes that their sentences were suspended in view of, in particular, positive references from their places of work and residence, their lack of previous convictions and their law-abiding behaviour after committing the crime. The Court, however, cannot accept those arguments as justifying the imposition of lenient sentences on the police officers, who had been found guilty of violent acts which amounted to torture (see, mutatis mutandis, Kopylov v. Russia, no. 3933/04, \u00a7 141, 29 July 2010). It considers that such punishment is manifestly disproportionate to a breach of one of the core rights of the Convention and does not have the necessary deterrent effect in order to prevent further violations of the prohibition of torture (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 121, 123 and 124).",
