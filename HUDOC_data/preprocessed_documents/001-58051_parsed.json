As to the applicant\u2019s complaint about the decision-making procedures of the Board, it is to be noted that section 14 of the Administrative Act 1986 expressly provided for the possibility of an oral hearing (see paragraph 28 above). It is significant that the applicant was aware of the fact that the Board seldom had recourse to oral hearings and for this reason he could have been expected to request a hearing if he considered it important that one be held either when lodging his claim or when requesting the Board to reconsider its decision to reject it. He did not do so. It may thus reasonably be considered that he waived his right to a hearing before the Board (see the H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 171-A, p. 21, para. 67; and the Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no.\u00a0263, pp. 19-20, para. 58). Furthermore, it does not appear that there were any reasons of expediency which would have required the Board itself to convene the applicant since it had before it his complete case file. The Board could properly determine in the absence of a hearing whether or not the elements in the file established that the applicant had been the victim of a criminal act either at the hands of L. or of the two other suspects whom he mentioned to the police. For the same reason the Court cannot accept either the applicant\u2019s arguments that his claim was only given scant and routine consideration. Furthermore, the reasons given by the Board were sufficient in the circumstances to justify its rejection of the applicant\u2019s claim and its subsequent confirmation of that rejection.",

Thus, it transpires from the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment that that court did not find it established that the applicant was a victim of criminal offences, which was also the conclusion subsequently reached by the Board in two successive decisions (see paragraphs 16 and 19 of the judgment).",
