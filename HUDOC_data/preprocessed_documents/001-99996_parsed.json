The court referred to a letter from the Ministry of Interior which acknowledged that at the time of the applicant's detention H\u00eence\u015fti police station had been insufficiently equipped to offer appropriate conditions of detention, including proper ventilation. The court awarded the applicant 100\u00a0Moldovan lei (MDL) (6 euros (EUR) at the time) for non-pecuniary damage caused. The applicant appealed.",

The court confirmed the findings of the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal concerning the failure to give the applicant required medical treatment and to provide the applicant with adequate conditions of detention. In reaching this conclusion, the court referred to Article 3 of the Convention and the Court's judgments such as Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC] (no. 30210/96, ECHR\u00a02000XI), Sarban v. Moldova (no. 3456/05, 4 October 2005) and Ostrovar v. Moldova (no.\u00a035207/03, 13 September 2005). The court added that while there was no domestic legislation giving the applicant a right to compensation, the Convention should be applied directly as it was part of the domestic legal system and had precedence over domestic legislation by virtue of the express provisions of Article 4 of the Constitution. The same conclusion had been reached by the  in a judgment of 14 October 1999. The court also relied on the findings of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment made during its visits in 1998, 2001 and 2004 concerning the substandard conditions of detention in the H\u00eence\u015fti police station. The court held that the denial of medical treatment combined with the conditions of detention, which had aggravated the applicant's medical condition, had amounted to inhuman treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The court increased the award made to the applicant in compensation for non-pecuniary damage to MDL 10,000 (EUR\u00a0600 at the time) and awarded him MDL 210 (EUR 12.6) in compensation for pecuniary damage.",

In this connection it emphasises that it falls first to the national authorities to redress any alleged violation of the Convention. The question whether a person may still claim to be the victim of an alleged violation of the Convention essentially entails on the part of the Court an ex post facto examination of his or her situation. A decision or measure of the domestic authorities favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a \u201cvictim\u201d unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention. The question whether he has received reparation for the damage caused \u2013 comparable to just satisfaction as provided for under Article 41 of the Convention \u2013 is an important issue. It is the Court's settled case-law that where the national authorities have found a violation and their decision constitutes appropriate and sufficient redress, the party concerned can no longer claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention (see Scordino v.

It recalls its constant case-law to the effect that where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see, for example, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7\u00a087, ECHR 1999V). However, in the present case the applicant was not in entirely good health when he was taken into custody. He was arrested only two days after being released from hospital following abdominal surgery. The applicant alleges that he was beaten by police officers and that this caused the incision to reopen. The medical evidence submitted to the Court does indicate that the applicant experienced problems linked to the surgical wound while in custody, but there is no medical evidence of any other injury which could have been caused by a beating. The prosecutor who investigated the applicant's allegations was told by the doctors who saw him during his detention at the police station that they had been called twice to attend the applicant on the night of his arrest but that this had been in connection with a post-surgery problem and that the applicant had made no complaint to them of ill-treatment. The applicant was examined by a doctor on 6 November 2000 and found to be in a \u201cpost-surgery\u201d condition. Moreover, to the extent that the condition of the applicant's abdominal wound deteriorated during his time in detention, the Government have provided a plausible explanation. The applicant has a history of self-harm in prison; on 7 November 2000 he needed an operation to remove a nail that he had swallowed and this was the first of ten operations made necessary by incidents of self-harm. The medical evidence indicates that the applicant could have reopened the wound by picking and scratching at it. On the basis of the material before it the Court does not find the applicant's allegations of torture to be substantiated.",
