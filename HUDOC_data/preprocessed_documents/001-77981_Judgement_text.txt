The case originated in four applications (nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four British nationals, Mr Thomas William Hobbs, Mr Ian Richard, Mr Paul Walsh and Mr David Nigel Geen (“the applicants”), on 27 October 2000 (Mr Hobbs), 26 September 2000 (Mr Richard), and 29 September 2000 (Mr Walsh and Mr Geen).
The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, . Mr Richard, Mr Walsh and Mr Geen were represented by Ms P. Glynn, a solicitor practising in . Mr Hobbs was not represented before the Court.
By decisions dated 18 June 2002 (application no. 63684/00) and 8 April 2003 (nos. 63468/00, 63475/00 and 63484/00), the Court declared the applications partly admissible. In September 2003 the applications were adjourned pending the conclusion of related domestic proceedings (see paragraph 26-28 below). On 1 July 2005 the Court invited the parties to submit observations on the merits.
The Government and the applicants represented by Ms Glynn requested a hearing on the merits. On the date of the adoption of the present judgment the Court decided that a hearing would not be necessary.
By a letter dated 2 August 2006, Mr Walsh, Mr Geen and Mr Richard informed the Court that they had reached a friendly settlement with the Government in respect of their claims for Widowed Mother’s Allowance and/or Widow’s Payment, for the following sums: GBP 19,164.94 damages plus GBP 2,469.84 costs for Mr Richard; GB 7,767.59 damages plus GBP 2,699.40 costs for Mr Geen; GBP 11,783.98 damages plus GBP 1,860.00 costs for Mr Walsh.
By a letter dated 24 July 2006, the non-governmental organisation  sought leave to submit third-party observations in the case. The request was rejected by the President of the Chamber on 28 August 2006.
The facts of each case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
Mr Thomas William Hobbs is a United Kingdom national, born in 1921 and living in Southampton.
The applicant’s wife died on 25 February 1998. On 11 October 2000 he contacted the Inland Revenue (“IR”) and applied for widow’s bereavement allowance (“WBA”: see paragraph 21 below) for the years 1998/9 and 1999/2000. He was informed that he did not qualify for the tax allowance, since he was a man and the law provided only for payments to widows.
Mr Richard was born on 21 May 1957 and lives in Dunfermline. He was widowed on 14 October 1995. There were two children of the marriage, born in 1987 and 1993.
In around November 1995 the applicant telephoned the IR requesting an allowance equivalent to that received by a widow. The IR told him that he was ineligible for WBA. The applicant applied again by letter dated 19 July 2000, but by a letter dated 3 August 2000 he was informed the WBA was not available for widowers.
In around June 1997 the applicant applied to the Benefits Agency (“BA”) for social security benefits equivalent to those to which a widow would have been entitled (see paragraphs 29-37 below). His claim was refused by the BA on 18 June 1997. The applicant wrote on 22 June 1997 requesting an appeal against this decision and requesting that the appeal be heard after the Court had decided the lead case on widowers’ benefits. On 8 May 2000 the applicant requested that his appeal be proceeded with. It was rejected on 15 May 2000.
The applicant began living with another woman in October 1999. In August 2000 he reapplied for widows’ benefits and was refused again on 16 August 2000.
Mr Walsh was born on 19 July 1955 and lives in . He was widowed on 1 March 1997. There were two children of the marriage, born on 22 February 1991 and 29 December 1992.
On 30 May 2000, the applicant applied to the BA for social security benefits equivalent to those which a widow in his circumstances would receive. He was refused by a letter dated 6 June 2000.
On 3 July 2000 the applicant applied to the IR for a WBA or equivalent. He was refused by a letter dated 11 July 2000.
The applicant was born on 20 October 1958 and lives in Maidenhead. His wife died on 17 October 1995. There were three children of the marriage, born 18 November 1987, 22 August 1989 and 22 April 1992.
In his application form, which was lodged with the Court by facsimile under cover of an introductory letter dated 29 September 2000, there was a general complaint about the discriminatory nature of the widow’s social security and taxation systems, in standard paragraphs included in all the widowers’ applications submitted by the applicant’s solicitors. In the section dealing with the particular facts of the applicant’s case, there was no mention of any contact with the IR concerning WBA. An amended application form was sent to the Court under cover of a letter dated 15 March 2001. A paragraph had been added, stating that in or around December 1995 or January 1996 the applicant had made enquiries at his local tax office about entitlement to tax rebates or allowances following bereavement, and had been told that he had no entitlement. Reference was made in the amended application form also to “the decision of the Inland Revenue made in July 1996 which is ongoing”, and on 26 March 2001 the applicant sent the Court a copy of a letter of refusal from the IR dated 9 July 1996.
On 30 May 2000 the applicant applied to the BA for survivor’s benefits. He was refused by a letter dated 5 June 2000. This information was included in the application form lodged on 29 September 2000.
In their observations on admissibility dated 4 October 2002, the Government informed the Court that the applicant had also made a formal claim to the IR for WBA on 29 September 2000, which had been refused on 3 October 2000. This was confirmed by the applicant in his observations dated 28 November 2002.
Widow’s bereavement allowance (“WBA”) was governed by section 262(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which provided:
“Where a married man whose wife is living with him dies, his widow shall be entitled –
(a)  for the year of assessment in which the death occurs, to an income tax reduction calculated by reference to an amount equal to the amount specified in section 257A(1) for that year, and
(b)  (unless she marries again before the beginning of it) for the next following year of assessment, to an income tax reduction calculated by reference to an amount equal to the amount specified in section 257A(1) for that year.”
A widow had six years from the end of the tax year in which her husband died to claim the allowance.
WBA was introduced by the Finance Act 1980, at a time when married couples were taxed as a single entity, with the man receiving an allowance in respect of his wife’s earnings (the married man’s allowance: “MMA”). When a married man was widowed, he could continue to claim MMA in the year of his wife’s death. The aim of WBA was to enable widowed women to claim the equivalent of the MMA in the year of bereavement, rather than being restricted to a single person’s allowance (“SPA”).
Independent taxation of married men and women was introduced from 1990/91. Thereafter each married partner was entitled to claim a personal allowance, although the husband retained the right to claim a married couples allowance (“MCA”), which was the difference between the old MMA and the SPA.
With effect from 1993/94 a married woman became entitled (subject to certain conditions) for the first time to share the MCA with her husband, or the couple together could elect that the wife could set the full amount of the MCA against her income. From 1994 the Government began successively to reduce the value of WBA and MCA, so that the WBA was worth a maximum of GBP 285 in 1998/99 and GBP 197 in 1999/2000.
Section 34 of the Finance Act 1999 abolished WBA in relation to deaths occurring on or after 6 April 2000.
The question whether a claimant who had been refused widow’s bereavement allowance after 2 October 2000 on the basis of his male sex could have the decision overturned under the Human Rights Act 1998 (“the Act”) was examined by the House of Lords in R. v. Her Majesty’s Commissioners of Inland Revenue ex parte Wilkinson [2005] UKHL 30. The IR accepted that the WBA fell within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, did not attempt to justify the difference in treatment between male and female bereaved spouses and admitted that the refusal of allowances to widowers was a breach of their Convention rights. However, the IR argued—and the House of Lords accepted—that it had not been unlawful under the Act for the IR to refuse to grant the WBA to men because it would have been contrary to primary legislation so to do (section 6(2)(b) of the Act).
Lord Hoffmann, with whom the other Law Lords agreed, went on to consider the hypothetical question of what damages Mr Wilkinson could have recovered if his claim had not been barred by section 6(2)(b) of the Act. Since the purpose of an award of damages under the Act was to allow claimants to recover in an English court what they would have recovered in Strasbourg, Lord Hoffmann discussed the Court’s approach to just satisfaction in discrimination cases (§§ 26-28):
A general principle applied to affording just satisfaction is to put the applicant so far as possible in the position in which he would have been if the State had complied with its obligations under the Act. In a discrimination case, in which the wrongful act is treating A better than B, this involves forming a view about whether the State should have complied by treating A worse or B better. Normally one would conclude that A’s treatment represented the norm and that B should have been treated better. In some cases, however, it will be clear that A’s treatment was an unjustifiable anomaly. Such a case is Van Raalte v  ..., in which the Court found a breach of Article 14 read with Article 1 of the First Protocol because the law exempted unmarried childless women over 45 from paying contributions under the General Child Benefits Act without exempting unmarried childless men. The exemption for women was abolished in 1989 but judgment was not given until 1997. The court rejected a claim for repayment of the contributions from which the applicant would have been exempt if he had been a woman.
In my opinion the reason for the rejection of this claim is that if the State had complied with its Convention obligations, it would done what it did in 1989 and not exempted either men or women. It follows that the applicant would have been no better off. He would still have had to pay. In the circumstances, the judgment itself was treated as being sufficient just satisfaction.
The same is true in this case. There was no justification whatever for extending the widows’ allowance to men. If, therefore, Parliament had paid proper regard to Article 14, it would have abolished the allowance for widows. Mr Wilkinson would not have received an allowance and no damages are therefore necessary to put him in the position in which he would have been if there had been compliance with his Convention rights”.
Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood dealt with the two contrasting cases of Van Raalte and Darby v  and continued (§§ 47 – 53):
“... In any claim against a public authority for financial compensation in respect of past discrimination it must be remembered that the general public (often the general body of taxpayers) will be footing the bill. In determining the requirements of just satisfaction, just as in the application of the Convention as a whole, regard should be had not only to the victim’s rights but also to the interests of the public generally. Take a case where A establishes discrimination on the basis that he should have been placed in the same class as B, both of them advantaged financially over class C. To compensate A for his past financial disadvantage vis à vis B would be costly for C (the non-benefiting class of taxpayers)—disproportionately so if class A is large, classes B and C comparatively small. Whether this would be fair to C would depend upon the justification for advantaging A and B over C in the first place and indeed for doing so to the extent that B was originally advantaged over A and C. It might well be fairer overall to leave A uncompensated in respect of the past discrimination against him. At the very least, bearing in mind that class A are taxpayers too, fairness to C might require that class A’s compensation be reduced to reflect the fact that they too would have had to pay more tax to fund their own additional benefits. Just these considerations, indeed, may yet arise in the parallel case of Hooper were a claim for just satisfaction now to be advanced in .
Moreover, by the same token that it will not invariably be right to compensate the complainant even where there is a case for preferential treatment of one class and A falls into it, it will not invariably be inappropriate to compensate the complainant even though there was no case for anyone to be treated preferentially in the first place. Take, for example, the case of a public body unjustifiably paying its male employees more than women doing the same job. It could not then reasonably be argued that the men’s excess wages represented an unjustified windfall which should not properly be paid to the women also. Such an argument, indeed, would almost certainly fail even if the employer proved that, had all employees been paid the same, this would have been at the women’s (lower) rate—a plausible case if, say, the women employees substantially outnumbered the men. This example, I may say, formed the bedrock of Miss Rose’s argument in respect of just satisfaction in the present appeal.
What, then, distinguishes the employee case from Van Raalte itself? The critical feature of the Van Raalte case which to my mind distinguishes it from the employee case is that the complainant in Van Raalte was in essentially the same position as all other contributors to the scheme (save only for the wrongly exempted group). Realistically the discrimination was no more against him than against the others: there was simply no case for exempting anyone. It would thus have been most unfair to the general body of contributors (category C) to have required them to subsidise not merely the exempted class of women but also the equivalent men. That, however, is not the position in employment cases. In the postulated employment case the discrimination can clearly be seen to have been against the less well-paid women. If the men doing the same work were thought to be worth the higher wage, so too were the women. There can be nothing unfair in making the employer compensate the women in respect of the past discrimination against them (although, of course, in the case of a public authority, the compensation will indirectly fall to be paid by the general public).
Into which category, then, does the present appeal fall? Is the situation here akin to that in Van Raalte or to the employment type of case? To my mind there can be only one answer to this question: the position here is just as it was in Van Raalte. The Court of Appeal rightly characterised the widows bereavement allowance as ‘an anachronistic relic of a tax regime abandoned by 1994’ and rightly concluded that the discrimination ‘provided widows with an unjustified advantage not merely over widower taxpayers but over all taxpayers.’
In a case like this, therefore, the past discrimination suffered by widowers is less (and less deserving of compensation) than would be the discrimination suffered by the general body of taxpayers were they now required to fund this unjustified benefit not only for qualifying widows but for widowers too .
Even though, as the House was told, the issue of just satisfaction only arose at the reconvened hearing before the Court of Appeal and at the prompting of the Court itself, in my judgment it provides an ample basis for declining now to pay out to this appellant.”
Under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”) “widows’ benefits” (Widow’s Payment, Widowed Mother’s Allowance and Widow’s Pension) were paid for out of the National Insurance Fund. By Section 1 of the 1992 Act, the funds required for paying such benefits were to be provided by means of contributions payable to the Secretary of State for Social Security by earners, employers and others, together with certain additions made to the Fund by Parliament. Male and female earners were obliged to pay the same social security contributions in accordance with their status as employed earners or self-employed earners. The eligibility criteria for each benefit were as follows:
Under Section 36 of the 1992 Act, a woman who had been widowed after 11 April 1988 was entitled to a widow’s payment if:
(i) she was under pensionable age (60) at the time when her husband died, or he was not then entitled to a Category A retirement pension;
(ii) her husband satisfied certain specified social security contribution conditions set out in a Schedule to the 1992 Act.
The benefit was not payable to a widow if she and a man to whom she was not married were living together as husband and wife at the time of her husband’s death.
According to section 19(6) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (and see also section 1(2)(a) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992), a widow had to claim the Payment within twelve months of her husband’s death. As from April 1997 the time-limit was reduced to three months (Social Security (Miscellaneous Amendments No.2) Regulations 1997).
Under Section 37 of the 1992 Act, a woman who had been widowed was entitled to a Widowed Mother’s Allowance if her husband had paid the required National Insurance contributions and she was either pregnant by her late husband or entitled to child benefit in respect of a child of the marriage. Child benefit is available in respect of a child for any week in which he or she is under the age of 16, or under 19 and studying full-time up to A-level or equivalent, or aged 16 or 17 and registered for work or training (section 142 of the 1992 Act).
 34.  This benefit was not payable for any period after the widow remarried or in which she and a man to whom she was not married were living together as husband and wife.
According to section 19(6) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (and see section 1 (2)(b) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992), a widow had to make a claim to receive the benefit, which could be backdated 12 months from the date of claim. As from April 1997, the benefit could be backdated only three months from the date of claim (Social Security (Miscellaneous Amendments No.2) Regulations 1997).
Under Section 38 of the 1992 Act, a woman who had been widowed was entitled to a Widow’s Pension if her husband satisfied the contribution conditions set out in a Schedule to the Act; and
(i) at the date of her husband’s death she was over the age of 45 (40 for deaths occurring before 11 April 1988), but under the age of 65; or
(ii) she ceased to be entitled to a Widowed Mother’s Allowance at a time when she was over the age of 45 (40 for deaths occurring before 11 April 1988), but under the age of 65.
This benefit was not payable for any period after the widow remarried or in which she and a man to whom she was not married were living together as husband and wife, or for any period in which she was entitled to a Widowed Mother’s Allowance.
The Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (“the 1999 Act”) came into force on 9 April 2001. Section 54 of this Act introduced the Bereavement Payment which replaced the Widow’s Payment. The same conditions applied, except that the new payment was available to both widows and widowers whose spouse died on or after 9 April 2001.
Section 55 of the 1999 Act introduced the Widowed Parent’s Allowance. Identical conditions applied as for Widowed Mother’s Allowance, except that the new allowance was available to:
(i) widows and widowers whose spouse died on or after 9 April 2001 and who were under pensionable age (60 for women and 65 for men) at the time of the spouse’s death, and
(ii) widowers whose wife died before 9 April 2001, who had not remarried and were still under pensionable age on the that day.
Section 55 also introduced a Bereavement Allowance for widows and widowers over the age of 45 but under pensionable age at the spouse’s death, where no dependant children existed. The deceased spouse had to have satisfied the relevant contribution conditions and died on or after 9 April 2001. The Bereavement Allowance is payable for 52 weeks from the date of bereavement, but is not payable for any period after the survivor reaches pensionable age or remarries or lives with another person as husband and wife, or for any period for which the survivor was entitled to Widowed Parent’s Allowance.
