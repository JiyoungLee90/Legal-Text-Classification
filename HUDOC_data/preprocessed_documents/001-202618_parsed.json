Lastly, it is to be noted that the first applicant requested her pension from the Croatian authorities at a time when the Social Insurance Agreement with Serbia had not yet entered into force (see paragraphs 7 and 58 above). In those circumstances, she could have reasonably believed that, as she was seeking her pension from the Croatian Pension Fund, her employment in Serbia was irrelevant and thus did not have to be mentioned.",

Moreover, the Court notes that the domestic courts themselves established that the first applicant had received the pension payments in good faith. It was precisely because of her good faith that she was ordered to pay statutory default interest only from the date when the civil proceedings had been instituted, rather than from any earlier date (see paragraph 23 above).",

Moreover, the refusal to grant her a pension for the period between 1 May 1998 and 30 April 2002 was ultimately based on the Croatian Pension Fund\u2019s lack of jurisdiction rather than her omission to declare the pension which she had been granted abroad (see paragraphs 32 and 38 above).",
