The Court observes that following the discontinuation of the proceedings by the Supreme Court on 25 June 2008, the applicant brought a separate civil action against a different respondent. The duration of this procedure cannot therefore be added to the overall length of the proceedings as it constitutes a separate action.

Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or convincing argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present circumstances. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.

Therefore it should be evaluated solely from the standpoint of Article 6 \u00a7 1, no arbitrary deprivation of property being identifiable in the circumstances. The Court reiterates that it is not a court of fourth instance and it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court, unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.  [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999I). Accordingly, in light of all the material in its possession, the Court finds that there is no appearance of any violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.
