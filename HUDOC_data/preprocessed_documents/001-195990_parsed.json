Firstly, the Court reiterates that it has already found that the dispersal of the demonstration of 2 April 2011 was not justified under Article 11 of the Convention having regard, in particular, to the fact that the authorities had been notified of the demonstration and it had been intended to be peaceful and had been conducted in a peaceful manner until the moment of its dispersal by the police (see Ahad Mammadli, cited above, \u00a7 35, and Bayram Bayramov and\u00a0Others v. Azerbaijan ([Committee] nos. 74609/10 and 5 others, \u00a7\u00a052, 16\u00a0February 2017). Secondly, as regards the criminal proceedings against the applicants under Article 233 of the Criminal Code, it is apparent from the domestic decisions that the applicants were arrested, detained and convicted for participation in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration and chanting non-violent slogans. Nothing in the material before the Court suggests that the applicants committed any reprehensible acts during the demonstration. Notably, the accusation that the applicants behaved aggressively during the demonstration and disobeyed the orders of the police was not supported by any specific individual facts. Furthermore, the Court notes that the situation in the present cases is aggravated by the fact that the applicants were subjected to criminal prosecution, pre-trial detention and prison terms.",

In this context, the Court reiterates that where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Uzunget and Others v. Turkey, no. 21831/03, \u00a7 53, 13\u00a0October 2009). As far as can be discerned from the domestic decisions, the applicants were not responsible for the deterioration of the assembly\u2019s peaceful character, which was rather caused by the forceful intervention of the police to disperse and arrest demonstrators. The applicants\u2019 violent conduct was sporadic in nature and appeared to be a spontaneous reaction to the force used by the police to arrest protestors, the majority of whom had been peaceful. It therefore did not attain the degree of violence which the Court has found in other cases that would call for lengthy prison terms (compare Lutskevich v. Russia, nos.\u00a06312/13 and 60902/14, \u00a7 100, 15 May 2018, and Barabanov v. Russia, nos. 4966/13 and 5550/15, \u00a7 74, 30 January 2018; and contrast, Primov and Others v.
