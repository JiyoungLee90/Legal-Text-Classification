That criterion was \u201cobjective\u201d and was applied without any examination of the merits of the appeal. Its purpose was to avoid legal aid being granted in cases where the appeal was manifestly bound to fail. Thus, in the instant case, the letters sent by the applicant to the Legal Aid Office showed that he intended to challenge the factual findings of the trial courts, an issue that could not be raised before the Court of Cassation. In short, the authorities who dealt with the applicant's application had not examined the merits of his appeal on points of law in detail, such that the circumstances of the present case were distinguishable from those in the case of Aerts v. Belgium (judgment of 30\u00a0July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-V), in which similar bodies had ruled on the issue whether the applicant's appeal was \u201c[currently] well-founded\u201d. In addition, the Legal Aid Office was composed of judges, lawyers, civil servants and members of the public, thus avoiding any bias or risk of the applicant's being unfairly deprived of access to the Court of Cassation. That safeguard was reinforced by the fact that applicants for legal aid could appeal to the President of the Court of Cassation against decisions of the Legal Aid Office.",

The applicant refused to submit to the therapy ordered by the Special Minors' Division of the Lyons Court of Appeal, that being the only condition with which he had to comply for visits to resume. In the light of the reports of the experts appointed by the courts, the Division's reluctance to expose the child to visits which he would find disturbing is quite understandable. Furthermore, refusing to accept his son's placement even in principle, the applicant had flown into a rage on several occasions at the caseworkers of the body responsible for the child and for organising the visits and had generally shown himself disinclined to cooperate with it in arranging contact with his son. In that connection, the Court notes that, notwithstanding the applicant's refusal to undergo the therapy that had been recommended for him, the Special Minors' Division of the Lyons Court of Appeal ordered on 9\u00a0December 1996 that \u201cattempts should be made to arrange contact at a neutral location\u201d at regular intervals until 31 March 1997.

It is not, however, in our view sufficient by itself to justify the continued prohibition on contact since, as he becomes gradually more distant from his family of origin, it is understandable that the child should develop notions adapted to his new home. In addition, that situation may have put the foster home where the child was placed in a difficult position, since under the foster system the foster parents are not substitute parents, but short-term auxiliary parents. Therefore, maintaining links between the child and the family of origin plays an integral role in this form of placement, which must cope with the triangular relationship between the child and both his families, with equal rights for all. Severing those links may amount to a form of \u201csocial ill-treatment\u201d for the child. That consideration obviously also applies, albeit in a different form, when children are placed in institutional care.",

The effectiveness of an \u201corder to undergo therapy\u201d and especially the legitimacy of making compliance with the order a condition for contact when the effect, in the present case, was for a right guaranteed by the Convention to be suspended, is questionable. Furthermore, the case-law of the Court indicates that the attitude of the person concerned is not wholly decisive (see the Olsson v.\u00a0Sweden (no. 1) judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130, pp. 36-37, \u00a7\u00a7 81 and 83). The fact that in the instant case the judicial authorities knew that the applicant could not come to terms with the separation and that, in such circumstances, the very idea of co-operation was illusory, made it that much less decisive.",

Sweden (no. 2), 27\u00a0November 1992, Series A no. 250, pp. 35-36, \u00a7 90; Hokkanen v.\u00a0Finland, 23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, p. 22, \u00a7 58; and Ignaccolo-Zenide v. Romania, no. 31679/96, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2000-I), we do not agree with the majority's opinion that the relevant authorities \u201cmade genuine efforts\u201d or that the failure of the measures \u201cwas due solely to the applicant's behaviour\u201d (see paragraph 63 of the judgment). In the present case, the efforts to which the Court refers are the measures described in paragraph 61 of the judgment, that is to say, an invitation to undergo psychotherapy in 1994 and the organisation of three visits at a neutral location in December 1996, January 1997 and March 1997. That, in our view, is very little indeed for a period of more than seven years.",

While the Court is obviously precluded from substituting its own assessment for that of the relevant national authorities \u2013 which are best placed to assess the situation \u2013 it is nonetheless under an obligation under paragraph 2 of Article 8 to assess the relevance and adequacy of the reasons asserted for the interference and whether due weight has been given to the respective interests. It cannot avoid that assessment merely by invoking the margin of appreciation, just as a reference to the interest of the child can be no substitute for proper argument. As the Court has recently reiterated, it has a duty to examine in the light of the Convention decisions taken by the national judicial authorities in the exercise of their discretion (see Glaser v. the United Kingdom, no. 32346/96, \u00a7 64, 19 September 2000, unreported).",
