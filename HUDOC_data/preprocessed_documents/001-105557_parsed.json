However, a publicly made statement not only could be an instrument of an infringement, but could also be unlawfully distorted. This was why the legislature decided to grant additional protection to statements made in the context of interviews by creating the authorisation requirement. Assuming that this requirement amounted to a restriction on freedom of expression as it obliged journalists to obtain authorisation from the author of literally quoted statements, its necessity in a democratic society has to be examined. [The] freedom of expression is not ius infinitum and could therefore be limited. However, it is necessary that restrictions on its exercise are compatible with the principle of proportionality set out in Article 31 of the Constitution. This provision allows for restrictions imposed on individual rights only when they have statutory legal basis and are necessary in a democratic state in the interests of national security or public safety, for the protection of environment, health or morals, for the protection of rights of others.

The relevant provisions do not fix any time-limit within which the authorisation is to be granted or refused. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that their application may also result in slowing down the flow of information from the press to the public and burden journalists with additional work and costs.\u00a0 The Court reiterates in this context that news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication, even for a short period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest (see, for example, Observer and Guardian, cited above, p.\u00a030, \u00a7\u00a060; Sunday Times v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (no.\u00a02), judgment of 26\u00a0November 1991, Series A no.\u00a0217, pp.\u00a029 et seq., \u00a7\u00a051; and Association Ekin v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a039288/98, \u00a7\u00a056, ECHR 2001VIII). Consequently, a journalist cannot in principle be required to defer publishing information on a subject of general interest without compelling reasons relating to the public interest or the protection of the rights of others (see, for example, Editions Plon, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053, with further references).",

It also reiterates that in its examination to date of the measures in place at domestic level to protect Article 8 rights in the context of freedom of expression (and even assuming that such rights were at issue in the present case), the Court has so far accepted that ex post facto damages provide an adequate remedy for violations of Article 8 rights arising from the publication by a newspaper of private information (see Von Hannover v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a059320/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07274, ECHR 2004VI; Armonien\u0117 v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a036919/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045048, 25\u00a0November 2008). Moreover, the provisions of the Press Act itself afforded additional protection against inaccurate rendering of statements and judgments made in the context of an interview. Section\u00a031 of that Act provided, at the material time, for the obligation for a newspaper to publish a disclaimer submitted by a person who wished to have inaccurate information published about him or her rectified, or a more elaborate reply if his or her personal rights had been breached by an article (paragraph\u00a029 above). It has not been argued, let alone shown, that these instruments were generally ineffective or that in the specific circumstances of the present case recourse to them would not have offered a sufficient level of protection. In these circumstances, recourse to a criminal sanction was not, in the Court\u2019s opinion, justified.",

However, the provisions of sections 14 and 49 of that Act, on which the applicant\u2019s conviction was based, were never subject to any amendments, in spite of the profound political and legal changes occasioned by Poland\u2019s transition to democracy. It is not for the Court to speculate about the reasons why the Polish legislature has chosen not to repeal those provisions.

In the present case, the original transcript ran to forty pages and the published text amounted to only three pages. This is usual practice: a journalist prepares a selection of what has been said and publishes only what he or she considers relevant. But selection may also mean manipulation and it is not difficult to recall situations in which several quotations have been merged into one statement with the content completely distorted. It seems that there is some force in the Constitutional Court\u2019s argument that once an interview is going to be edited, it may be reasonable to allow the interviewed person to have a look at the final version of his \u2013 purported \u2013 statements.",

There have been numerous situations in which, particularly in the course of a political debate, a person\u2019s statements have been quoted in a malevolently inaccurate manner. It is, unfortunately, not uncommon for journalists to denigrate political opponents and we must be aware that political journalism sometimes degenerates into an instrument of annihilation rather than of information. The authorisation requirement attempts to address at least one aspect of that process by preventing inaccurate or manipulated \u2013 in short, false \u2013 quotations.",

More and more often, the press abuses its powerful position and, deliberately and malevolently, undermines the good name and integrity of other persons.
