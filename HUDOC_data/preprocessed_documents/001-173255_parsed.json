In particular, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of individuals within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the version of events given by the victim. In the absence of such an explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government. That is justified by the fact that those in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (ibid., \u00a7 83).",

The Court finds it problematic that the investigating authority disregarded the fact that the applicant had retracted the above statement as having been given under coercion (see paragraph 14 above), and that decisive weight was given to the statements of the police officers who had allegedly ill-treated the applicant. Furthermore, the applicant was not examined by the forensic medical expert until more than two weeks after the alleged ill-treatment, by which time most of the traces of that alleged ill-treatment had disappeared. The forensic medical expert was not asked to assess the possibility of the injuries being the result of a single fall down a flight of stairs and the scene of the alleged incident was never examined.",
