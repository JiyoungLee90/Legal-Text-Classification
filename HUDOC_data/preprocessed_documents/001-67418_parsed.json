Although it was indeed intended to have a deterrent effect, it did not contain any probationary element. In that respect, it differed from other provisions of French law that were designed either to alleviate the risk of social exclusion or to encourage the social reintegration of offenders, such as those on suspended sentences with or without probation. That fundamental difference explained why, contrary to what the applicant maintained, the expiry of the period within which recidivism was possible under the law as worded in 1984 was not irrevocable; the new rules were to apply where the second offence had been committed after the legislation had been amended.",

That judicial interpretation, the Government stressed, was justified by the fact that the factor of recidivism followed from the second offence and the consequent increase in the sentence related to the commission of that offence alone. Accordingly, the applicant had been fully aware of the consequences when he had committed the 1995 offence; he had known what penalty he faced, in accordance with the law applicable at that precise time. The approach taken by the Court in the case of Co\u00ebme and Others v. Belgium (nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, ECHR 2000-VII) could therefore not be applied to the instant case. Unlike suspended sentences with probation, which were governed by rules laid down by the court at the time of the conviction, recidivism was solely governed and defined by the law, which specified the conditions in which it was applicable. In other words, there was no comparison between recidivism and suspended sentences with or without probation. The requirements for taking recidivism into account had been satisfied in the instant case; furthermore, they did not allow for the possibility of recidivism being unlimited in time.",

The rules on recidivism were therefore intended to contribute to reforming convicted persons; that aim, which formed one of the main trends in modern crime policies, accordingly had some bearing on the determination of issues concerning the application of successive laws.

Besides this initial difficulty, it must be noted that there was no overlap between these two periods. In the eyes of the law, the first period ended on 12 July 1991, in accordance with the legal rules in force at the time. The new ten-year period, however, did not become law in  until three years after that date, on 1 March 1994.",

In the instant case this effectively caused the trial and appeal courts to impose a heavier penalty, as the statutory maximum penalty may be doubled in the event of recidivism; the applicant was sentenced to twelve years' imprisonment because the circumstance of recidivism was taken into account, whereas the statutory maximum sentence in the absence of recidivism was ten years (see, mutatis mutandis, Jamil v.

This increased severity is open to question on a general level; some criminologists believe, on the contrary, that mitigating circumstances should be taken into account in the case of recidivists, who have been corrupted by the crowded conditions and bad influences to which they have been exposed in prison.

It may be limited in time (as in Mr Achour's case) or unlimited (as in the case of serious crimes: an offender who commits a second serious crime, irrespective of the time that has elapsed, is classified as a recidivist, but that was not the case here). According to that legal approach, it is the second offence which makes a person a recidivist, just as a persistent recidivist is a person who breaks the criminal law three, four or any number of times.

The courts (and also, it would seem, most legal writers) have consistently taken the view since the late 19th century that the new law, in so far as it predates the commission of the second offence, is not retrospective (and hence does not infringe Article 7 of the Convention). The offender, who is or should be aware of the new law, knows the penalties he faces if, after its entry into force, he commits a second offence entailing his classification as a recidivist and, consequently, aggravating circumstances in personam. The penalty imposed on him, to be increased where appropriate on account of the factor of recidivism, will not be heavier than the one applicable at the time when the second offence was committed, since by definition that time will be after the date on which the new law came into force, in this case 1 March 1994.",

Any new law entailing harsher criminal sanctions will affect the penalties which may be imposed for offences committed after the law comes into force, irrespective of whether the offenders are recidivists. Obviously, the Convention does not prevent States from taking tougher measures against certain criminal offences in the context of their policy on crime, having regard to criminal developments and the need for an appropriate reaction in society. It is always regrettable that the criminal-law system should become more punitive, but that does not in itself necessarily entail a breach of the Convention (see, in this connection, the Commission's decision of 9 April 1996 in the case of H.M.A. v.

Such a measure accordingly exempts the convicted person from having to serve the sentence, such exemption being subject to the condition that, within a period specified by law, he does not commit a further offence resulting in a second conviction. The president of the court must, when imposing a suspended sentence, warn the convicted person of the consequences of his reoffending (Articles\u00a013229 and 132\u00ad40 of the new Criminal Code). A suspended sentence is therefore probationary, unlike a conviction constituting the first component of recidivism, and this is a significant difference.",

Nothing of the kind occurs in relation to a recidivist's initial conviction (except in the event of rehabilitation or an amnesty, neither of which occurred in the present case).

Greece, judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no.\u00a0260-A, p. 19, \u00a7 40, or Streletz, Kessler and Krentz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, \u00a7 82, ECHR 2001-II). ",

The case-law cited in the judgment is not decisive. In other recent judgments (see Ecer and Zeyrek v. Turkey, nos.\u00a029295/95 and 29363/95, ECHR 2001-II, or Gabarri Moreno v.
