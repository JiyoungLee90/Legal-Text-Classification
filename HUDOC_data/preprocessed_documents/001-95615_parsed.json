Indeed, according to the Bulgarian Supreme Court of Cassation, the reason underlying the rule that the trial court should deal with appeals against detention in the same composition in which it examines the merits of the criminal charge is that changes in the composition would adversely affect the judges' capacity to appraise the need to detain or release the accused (see paragraph 31 above).
