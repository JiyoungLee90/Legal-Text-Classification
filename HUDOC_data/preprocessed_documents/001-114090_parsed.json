In this connection the Court reiterates that in cases of wilful ill-treatment by State agents a breach of Article\u00a03 of the Convention cannot be remedied exclusively through an award of compensation to the victim. The State authorities are also under an obligation to conduct an investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see, mutatis mutandis, Vladimir Romanov v. , no. 41461/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a078 and 79 in fine, 24 July 2008).

The first complaint was dismissed three days after it was lodged on 12\u00a0August 2003.

The Court finds it striking that the complaint was assigned by the prosecutor\u2019s office to the investigator whom the applicant named as being among the alleged perpetrators of the ill-treatment.

Nevertheless, having regard to the material in its possession, the Court cannot but note that the efforts of the prosecutor\u2019s office were focused rather on the dismissal of the applicant\u2019s complaint than on a thorough verification of the substance of his allegations. In the course of over seven years, the applicant\u2019s complaint was dismissed on thirteen separate occasions. Each time, the applicant appealed and a supervising prosecutor or a court quashed the relevant decision and ordered a further inquiry noting the relevant investigator\u2019s failure to fully determine the circumstances of the case.
