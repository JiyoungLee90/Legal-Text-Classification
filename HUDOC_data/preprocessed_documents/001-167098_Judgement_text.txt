The case originated in an application (no. 41501/08) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Radivoje Šmigić (“the applicant”), on 30 July 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr B. Đukanović, a lawyer practising in Belgrade. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Ms V. Rodić, and subsequently by their current Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 1 September 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Beograd.
On 19 September 1996 certain A.N. (hereinafter “the debtor”) was sentenced for fraud in criminal proceedings and ordered to pay 18, 425 Serbian dinars (RSD) to PP Reprek, a company based in Serbia and owned by the applicant.
On 17 December 1998 the said company filed with the District Court in Belgrade a request for enforcement based on the judgment in said criminal proceedings. Following an order to specify a motion for enforcement, the decision on enforcement was adopted on 29 April 1999.
On 15 October 1999 the enforcement court ordered the Ministry of Interior to provide the exact address of the debtor.
On 7 February 2000 the bailiff noted that the debtor had moved away to an unknown address.
On 27 October 2000 the case was adjourned.
On 7 May 2005 the applicant requested the continuation of the enforcement proceedings on behalf of his company.
On 4 October 2005 the enforcement court again ordered the Ministry of Interior to provide the exact address of the debtor.
By letter of 21 October 2005, the Ministry informed the enforcement court of the debtor’s address.
On 18 November 2005 the bailiff went to the address provided by the said Ministry and established that the debtor was no longer living there and that he had moved away to an unknown address.
On 20 January 2006 the enforcement Court requested the Ministry of Interior to provide the exact address of the debtor and his latest known place of residence.
On 24 October 2006 the enforcement court informed the applicant that the Ministry did not establish the exact address of the debtor nor did it initiate misdemeanour proceedings against the debtor in accordance with Article 25 of the Domicile and Temporary Residence Act (see paragraph 22).
On 31 May 2007 the insolvency proceedings against the applicant’s company “Reprek” were completed. The said company ceased to exist and all its assets were transferred to the applicant.
The enforcement court adjourned the case on 31 March 2010.
This Act was in force from 22 February 2005 until 17 September 2011.
Article 5 provided that the court had to conduct the enforcement proceedings urgently, failure of which made the judge liable for unconscientious or unprofessional conduct.
On 17 September 2011 the new Enforcement Procedure Act came into force thereby repealing the Enforcement Procedure Act 2004. Article 358 provides that the enforcement proceedings instituted before this Act came into force will be continued pursuant to the provisions of the Enforcement Procedure Act 2011.
Article 25 provided that failure to inform the police of the change in domicile or residence is punishable by a fine up to RSD 30,000 in misdemeanor proceedings.
