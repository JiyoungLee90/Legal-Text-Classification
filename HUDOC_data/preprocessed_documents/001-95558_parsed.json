Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or convincing argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present circumstances. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.

In support of her damages claim, she submitted that, because of the litigation, she had had to take out a 4-million-Hungarian-forint (HUF) mortgage, lost HUF 12.8 million in outstanding rents, taken a HUF-6-million private loan and spent HUF 10 to 15 million on renovation. The Government contested these claims. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. However, it considers that the applicant must have sustained some non-pecuniary damage. Ruling on an equitable basis, it awards her EUR 5,600 under that head. Furthermore, having regard to the fact that the proceedings in question are still pending before the domestic courts, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to bring them to a conclusion as soon as possible, by conducting them in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, U\u011fuz v. Turkey, no. 31932/03, \u00a7 30, 13 December 2007).",
