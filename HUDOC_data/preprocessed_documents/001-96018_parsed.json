The applicant in that case was a candidate in the elections of 6 November 2005 for the single-seat Saatli-Sabirabad-Kurdamir Electoral Constituency No.\u00a065. One of his opponents, G.A., was the Head of the Saatli Regional Executive Authority (\u201cthe SREA\u201d). Heads of regional executive authorities were appointed and removed from their posts by the President of the Republic. Following his formal registration as a candidate, G.A. was temporarily relieved of his official duties, without pay, until 16 November 2005, pursuant to an SREA decision of 5 September 2005 signed by G.A. himself. This decision was duly notified to the electoral authorities and the President's Office. G.A. also submitted an undertaking to terminate any activities incompatible with the office of member of parliament, if elected as such. The applicant challenged the lawfulness of the election process in the constituency before the domestic authorities, arguing that G.A. should have been definitively removed from his post by a presidential order prior to his formal registration as a candidate. The electoral authorities and courts dismissed the applicant's claims, noting that G.A. had been temporarily relieved of his duties in full compliance with Article 69.2 of the Electoral Code and that, therefore, he was not in a position to unduly influence the electoral process in his capacity as a high-ranking civil servant. For these reasons, G.A. was allowed to stand as a candidate. Subsequently, G.A. won the election in the constituency. On 2 December 2005 G.A. was definitively removed from his post by a presidential order.",

Belgium, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 47, Series A no. 113). The Court has established that this provision guarantees individual rights, including the rights to vote and to stand for election. As important as those rights are, they are not, however, absolute. Since Article 3 recognises them without setting them out in express terms, let alone defining them, there is room for \u201cimplied limitations\u201d, and contracting States have a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere. In their internal legal orders they may make the rights to vote and to stand for election subject to conditions which are not in principle precluded under Article 3 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 51-52; Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a024833/94, \u00a7 63, ECHR 1999I; and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a0201, ECHR 2000IV). The concept of \u201cimplied limitations\u201d is of major importance for the determination of the relevance of the aims pursued by the restrictions on the rights guaranteed by this provision. Given that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 is not limited by a specific list of \u201clegitimate aims\u201d such as those enumerated in Articles 8-11, the States are therefore free to rely on an aim not contained in that list to justify a restriction, provided that this aim is compatible with the principle of the rule of law and the general objectives of the Convention. Moreover, in examining compliance with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Court does not apply the tests of \u201cnecessity\u201d or \u201cpressing social need\u201d; instead, it has focused mainly on two criteria: whether there has been arbitrariness or a lack of proportionality, and whether the restriction has interfered with the free expression of the opinion of the people (see Yumak and Sadak v. Turkey [GC], no. 10226/03, \u00a7\u00a0109\u00a0(iii), 8 July 2008).",

Greece, 1 July 1997, \u00a7 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV). In particular, any conditions imposed must not thwart the free expression of the people in the choice of the legislature \u2013 in other words, they must reflect, or not run counter to, the concern to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of an electoral procedure aimed at identifying the will of the people through universal suffrage (see Hirst v. the  (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, \u00a7 62, ECHR\u00a02005IX). The Court also reiterates its approach in recent cases where, in the context of its examination of the compliance of statutory restrictions on electoral rights with the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, it also had regard to the importance of the notion of \u201clawfulness\u201d inherent in the Convention (see \u0100damsons v. Latvia, no. 3669/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011619, 24 June 2008, where the Court, at the outset of its analysis, assessed the lawfulness of a legislative restriction on passive electoral rights; see also, mutatis mutandis, Yumak and Sadak, cited above, \u00a7 118, where the Court, at the outset of its analysis, noted that the issue of the foreseeability of the legislative measure complained of was not in dispute in that particular case).",

Ukraine, no. 17707/02, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2004X). States have broad latitude to establish constitutional rules on the status of members of parliament, including criteria for declaring them ineligible. These criteria vary according to the historical and political factors specific to each State. For the purposes of applying Article 3, any electoral legislation must be assessed in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned, so that features that would be unacceptable in the context of one system may be justified in the context of another (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, \u00a7 54; Podkolzina v. Latvia, no. 46726/99, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2002II; and Melnychenko, cited above, \u00a7 55). While it is true that States have a wide margin of appreciation when establishing eligibility conditions in abstract, the principle that rights must be effective requires that the eligibility procedure contain sufficient safeguards to prevent arbitrary decisions (see Podkolzina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035, and Russian Conservative Party of Entrepreneurs and Others v.

Where the domestic legislation in issue is sufficiently clear and precise as to the definition of the categories of persons affected and as to the scope of application of the impugned statutory restriction, it is necessary only to determine that the statute's underlying purpose is compatible with the proportionality requirements of the Convention. As long as the statutory distinction itself is proportionate, the task of the domestic authorities may be limited to establishing whether a particular individual belongs to the impugned statutory category (see \u017ddanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0112-14 and 125, ECHR 2006IV, with further reference to Rekv\u00e9nyi v.\u00a0Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, \u00a7\u00a7 34-50 and 58-62, ECHR 1999III). In such cases, the Court's remaining role is simply to assess whether the procedures applied in the applicant's individual case, or the conclusions reached by the domestic authorities in applying the relevant domestic legislation, could be considered arbitrary (see \u017ddanoka, cited above, \u00a7 127). Where the definition of the impugned statutory category is wide or imprecise, it may be necessary to take an \u201cindividualised\u201d approach in restricting the electoral rights of a person belonging to that category and to assess whether, in the specific individual case, his or her personal political involvement represented a possible danger to the democratic order (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0100damsons v. Latvia, no. 3669/03, \u00a7\u00a7 125, 24 June 2008).",

Accordingly, the main thrust of the applicant's complaint concerns the quality of the law on which this restriction was based. In particular, the foreseeability of the restriction is in dispute in the present case (contrast Yumak and Sadak, cited above, \u00a7 118).",

The Court reiterates, however, that conditions imposed on the individual rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 may not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness (see paragraph 28 above). In the light of this principle, as well as the general Convention requirement that rights must be effective and not illusory, the Court considers that where, as in the present case, restrictions on eligibility to stand for election are provided for by law, such law should satisfy certain minimum requirements as to its quality, such as the requirement of foreseeability. In this connection, the Court reiterates that a rule is \u201cforeseeable\u201d if it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable any individual \u2013 if need be with appropriate advice \u2013 to regulate his conduct (see, mutatis mutandis, Rotaru v.

The Court notes that, indeed, regard being had to the literal wording of the various relevant provisions of domestic law, the latter may appear to be mutually inconsistent on the point whether clergymen were deprived of their passive electoral rights (that is, the right to stand as a candidate for elections), or whether they were only subject to disqualification due to simultaneously holding incompatible positions (that is, combining \u201cprofessional religious activity\u201d with the office of member of parliament, if elected). In particular, Article 85 (II) of the Constitution and Articles 13 and\u00a0144 of the Electoral Code stated that clergymen could not \u201cbe elected\u201d as members of parliament (\u201cdeputat se\u00e7il\u0259 bilm\u0259zl\u0259r\u201d). On the other hand, Article 14.2.4 of the Electoral Code and Article 5 of the Law on Freedom of Religion provided that, during the period when they were engaged in \u201cprofessional religious activity\u201d, clergymen could not \u201cbe [serve as] a member\u201d of the Milli Majlis (\u201cMilli M\u0259clisin deputat\u0131 ... ola bilm\u0259zl\u0259r\u201d) and that clergymen's religious activities were to be \u201csuspended\u201d for the period during which they occupied elected government office. In this connection, the Court also notes that the same legal provisions, and in particular Article\u00a014.2 of the Electoral Code, provided for restrictions of electoral rights not only of the \u201cclergymen\u201d, but also other categories of persons such as civil servants, under essentially the same wording. However, having regard to the relevant domestic practice (see paragraph 19 above), the Court notes that there have been cases where civil servants were actually registered as candidates for the same parliamentary elections in 2005 where they had submitted an undertaking to resign from the State service if elected (in accordance with Article 53.3 of the Electoral Code) and had been temporarily released from their official functions during the election period (in accordance with Article 69.2 of the Electoral Code). Therefore, in so far as the scope of the restriction is concerned, there appears to be a possible lack of consistency in applying the relevant legal provisions to different categories of persons listed therein.",

It is not the Court's task to substitute its own interpretation for that of the national authorities, and notably the courts, as it is primarily for the latter to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among many other authorities, Kruslin v.\u00a0France, 24 April 1990, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 176A). The Court observes that, in this particular case, by deciding to refuse the applicant's request for registration as a candidate on the basis of the relevant legal provisions, the domestic authorities implicitly held that those provisions restricted the very right of \u201cclergymen\u201d to stand as a candidate for election. Therefore, for the purposes of the present case, the Court will proceed with its further analysis on the basis of the above approach taken by the authorities.",

In particular, the domestic law did not provide for any definition of who qualified as \u201cclergymen\u201d and what constituted \u201cprofessional religious activity\u201d. The existence of a large variety of religious denominations which organise themselves internally in different ways may potentially result in different views as to who can be considered as a \u201cclergyman\u201d in respect of a specific religion, faith or belief. Moreover, since the term \u201creligious activity\u201d is rather ambiguous and lends itself to quite a broad interpretation, it is not clear whether this term included only the primary activities of persons occupying ordained or otherwise formalised clerical positions (such as, inter alia, imams, priests or rabbi) or, as may have been implied in the Government's submissions (see paragraph 24 above), whether it also extended to a range of other activities connected with religion which could not be described as clerical or involving direct links with the mass of religious followers (such as, for example, activities of publicists writing on religious topics or pedagogical activity focusing on religious subjects). The connotations of the term \u201cprofessional\u201d as used with the term \u201creligious activity\u201d are also unclear. In particular, it is not clear if this meant an official position or formal employment involving the provision of remunerated religious services, or some other form of full-time or part-time activity which did not necessarily constitute remunerated employment in its ordinary meaning. While it could be argued that the drafters of the Constitution and the Electoral Code might have deliberately left the issue open to some extent to further judicial interpretation and clarification, the Court notes that the Government have not argued that there existed any domestic judicial decisions defining and clarifying the above terms and have not submitted any examples of such decisions. The domestic courts in the present case have not provided any definition or clarification either (see paragraph 38 below).",

The relevant legal provisions were not sufficiently precise to enable the applicant to regulate his conduct and foresee which specific types of activities would entail a restriction of his passive electoral rights. The lack of any definition of the terms \u201cclergyman\u201d and \u201cprofessional religious activity\u201d allowed an excessively wide discretion to the electoral authorities and left much room for arbitrariness in applying the restriction based on Article 85 (II) of the Constitution and Article 14.2.4 of the Electoral Code. This is precisely what happened in the present case as, despite the applicant's resignation from all the positions that could be construed as \u201cprofessional religious activity\u201d, the domestic authorities arbitrarily refused his request for registration without even specifying any factual grounds for their finding that he was still a \u201cclergyman\u201d engaging in \u201cprofessional religious activity\u201d.",

He in fact resigned from all the above positions, believing that this would make him eligible to stand for election. However, his resignation from these positions was not deemed sufficient by the electoral commissions, who considered that he was still a professional clergyman. In finding that the applicant \u201cwas continuing his activities as a professional clergyman\u201d, the ConEC failed to explain what activities were meant specifically. Likewise, the CEC summarily rejected the applicant's arguments to the contrary without providing any substantiation or explanation. Upon reviewing the electoral commissions' decisions, the domestic courts merely noted that the fact that the applicant had resigned from the positions in question \u201c[did] not rule out his engaging in professional religious activity\u201d. The courts, like the electoral commissions, failed to offer any explanation as to what other specific activity conducted by the applicant precluded him from standing for election and on the basis of what definition and evidence he was still considered to be a \u201cclergyman\u201d within the meaning of Article 85 of the Constitution and Article 14.2.4 of the Electoral Code. As to the Government's argument that the applicant continued to fulfil the function of editor-in-chief of a religious journal, the Court notes that neither the electoral authorities nor the domestic courts ever explicitly referred to this specific function in finding that the applicant continued to engage in \u201creligious activity\u201d. In sum, it appears that no legal reasoning was offered as to why the applicant was considered to fall into that category.",
