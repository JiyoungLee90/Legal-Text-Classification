This also concerned applications raising issues under Article 5 of the Convention.

In his view, he had a legitimate interest in pursuing the application lodged by his deceased mother under Article 34 of the Convention.",

In the latter cases, the Court has accepted that the next of kin, close family member or heir may in principle pursue the application, provided that he or she has sufficient interest in the case (see Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu v. Romania [GC], no. , \u00a7 97, ECHR 2014; Fartushin v. Russia, no. , \u00a7 33, 8 October 2015; and Ivko v.\u00a0Russia, no. , \u00a7 67-70, 15 December 2015). It is not only material interests which the successor of a deceased applicant may pursue by his or her wish to maintain the application. Human rights cases before the Court generally also have a moral dimension, and persons near to an applicant may thus have a legitimate interest in ensuring that justice is done, even after the applicant\u2019s death (see Malhous v. the Czech Republic (dec.) [GC], no. , ECHR 2000-XII). Thus, in cases where the direct victim has died after the application was lodged, the decisive factor is not whether the rights at issue are transferable to heirs willing to pursue an application, but whether the persons wishing to pursue the proceedings can claim a legitimate interest in seeking that the Court decide the case on the basis of the applicant\u2019s desire to use his individual and personal right to lodge a case before the Court (see Ergezen v. Turkey, no. , \u00a7 29, 8 April 2014; Va\u0161\u010denkovs v. Latvia, no. 30795/12, \u00a7 27, 15 December 2016; and Barakhoyev v.

However, by the time the Court of Cassation examined and allowed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law, quashing the decision of the Court of Appeal and ordering an examination of her appeal (28 November 2008), the contested detention period had long expired and the applicant\u2019s detention had already been extended for an indefinite period by the trial court on 8 July 2008 (see paragraph 36 above). More importantly, the applicant had already been released on bail by then and a subsequent examination of her appeal in such circumstances would have been ineffective and pointless (see, mutatis mutandis, S.T.S. v. the Netherlands, no. 277/05, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2011). Thus, the quashing of the decision of the Court of Appeal was unable to provide any immediate redress to the applicant. Furthermore, even if the Court of Cassation, in its decision of 28 November 2008, appears to have acknowledged \u2013 if not explicitly, then at least in substance \u2013 the Convention violation in issue (see paragraph 40 above), no compensation was \u2013 or even could be \u2013 awarded to the applicant for the breach of her Convention right, in view of the absence of non-pecuniary damage as a form of compensation at the material time (see Khachatryan and Others v. Armenia, no. 23978/06, \u00a7 158, 27\u00a0November 2012; and, mutatis mutandis, Gavril Yosifov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a074012/01, \u00a7 41, 6 November 2008; Moskovets v. Russia, no. 14370/03, \u00a7\u00a050, 23 April 2009; and S.T.S. v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7 61). In the Court\u2019s opinion, a simple acknowledgement would not have been enough in the circumstances of the case to deprive the applicant of her victim status. The Court therefore concludes that the applicant can still claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.",

The Court cannot speculate on the reasons why the lawyer, Mr Zohrabyan, did not answer his telephone.

Under Article 414.2 \u00a7\u00a01 of the CCP, the Court of Cassation only admitted an appeal for examination on the merits if it found that: (a) it raised a matter important for the uniform application of the law, (b) the contested judicial decision prima facie conflicted with an earlier decision of the Court of Cassation or (c) the lower court had made a prima facie judicial error resulting in serious consequences. Thus, in view of the jurisdiction of the Court of Cassation, whether or not the procedure before that court was an effective remedy depended on the particular circumstances of the case, namely the issues raised in the appeal and whether the Court of Cassation found them to be in compliance with the above-mentioned admissibility grounds. If it admitted and examined an appeal, then the Court of Cassation procedure became an effective remedy. However, if an appeal did not meet the admissibility requirements and was not admitted for examination, then the Court of Cassation procedure could not be considered an effective remedy.

In particular, in the case of Grigoryan, in which the Court of Cassation had left without examination an appeal on points of law lodged against a judicial decision ordering the applicant\u2019s detention, the Court agreed with the Government that, following the constitutional amendments of 6 December 2005, the applicant did not enjoy a right under domestic law to bring an appeal on points of law against a detention order and declared his complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of lack of access to the Court of Cassation manifestly ill-founded (see Grigoryan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011215). In the case of Arzumanyan, in which the Government claimed non-exhaustion because the applicant had not lodged appeals on points of law against his detention, the Court confirmed its earlier finding that an appeal procedure before the Court of Cassation in detention matters was not prescribed by the CCP. The Court took note of the fact that, at around the same time the applicant\u2019s detention case was pending before the courts, in two unrelated detention cases the Court of Cassation had admitted for examination appeals on points of law lodged by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office. The Court concluded, however, that this did not signify a decisive shift on that matter since this had happened in the absence of any amendments to the CCP or any explanation by the Court of Cassation for its decisions to do so and dismissed the Government\u2019s non-exhaustion objection (see Arzumanyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 31-33).",

Similarly, none of the decisions of the Court of Appeal, which the applicant attempted to contest before the Court of Cassation, stated that they were amenable to appeal.
