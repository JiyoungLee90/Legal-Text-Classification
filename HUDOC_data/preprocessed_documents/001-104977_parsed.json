Secondly, the main aim when organising the press conference was to inform the public that the water pumped into the system had been filtered and was thus safe for use. Thirdly, even though he also criticised the Chief Inspector, this criticism concerned his behaviour and attitudes in his capacity as an official, rather than his private life. As noted above, senior civil servants acting in an official capacity are subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals (see paragraph 37 above). For the Court, the applicant\u2019s remarks, even if it is accepted that they were a statement of fact rather than a value judgment, were not a gratuitous attack on the Chief Inspector but rather, from the applicant\u2019s perspective, a robust clarification of a matter under discussion which was of great public interest.",

In this regard, the Court also recalls the Resolution of the Council of Europe, which was adopted in the meantime, calling on the member States which still provide for prison sentences for defamation, even if they are not actually imposed, to abolish them without delay (see paragraph 25 above). In the present case, the Court notes with concern that the applicant was given a suspended sentence, which could, under certain circumstances, have been transformed into a prison sentence (see paragraphs 12 and 22, in particular section 54 quoted therein).",
