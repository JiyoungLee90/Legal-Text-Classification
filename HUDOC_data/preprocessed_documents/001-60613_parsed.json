He pointed out that, despite the fact that the proceedings were commenced on the very last day of the two year limitation period, the Secretary of State had failed to comply with the requirement to file his evidence at the same time, and therefore needed the leave of the court to file it out of time. That application, together with the applicant's cross-application to have the proceedings struck out, was first before the court on 20 May 1993, when it was adjourned to 29 July 1993, and again until 27\u00a0January 1994, that is, over a year and a half after the proceedings were commenced. The applicant appealed against the Registrar's decision, but the appeal was adjourned pending the criminal trial of his co-defendants. At the conclusion of the trial the applicant and his co-defendants wrote to the Secretary of State asking whether he still wished to pursue the disqualification proceedings; the Secretary of State took five months to reply to that letter. The applicant's appeal was not therefore heard by the High Court until 2 May 1995 (15 months after the Registrar's decision). The applicant then appealed to the Court of Appeal, which, in its judgment on 24\u00a0May 1996, found that the Secretary of State's reasons for failing to file his evidence in time were \u201cfar from satisfactory\u201d. The proceedings were finally concluded only when the applicant agreed to make various admissions so as to reach a \u201cCarecraft\u201d settlement in other proceedings against him under the CDDA. By that time the Blackspur proceedings had lasted five and a half years, coming to an end almost seven and a half years after the events on which they were based.",

In the present case, the Court must also bear in mind that, given that the applicant was a company director and that disqualification proceedings would have had a considerable impact on his reputation and his ability to practise his profession, special diligence was called for in bringing the proceedings to an end expeditiously (see the above-mentioned E.D.C.

The proceedings came to an end on 12 January 1998, when they were discontinued following the conclusion of a \u201cCarecraft\u201d settlement in another case against the applicant under the CDDA (see paragraph 17 above). The proceedings were, therefore, in progress for approximately five and a half years.

In addition, the applicant delayed some five months before appealing to the Court of Appeal against the High Court's rulings on the preliminary application and cross-application, and was two months late in filing his evidence in response to that of the Secretary of State.",

The Secretary of State's failure to comply with this time-limit was described by the Court of Appeal as \u201cfar from satisfactory\u201d. In the event, the evidence was served some five months later, on 14 December 1992, but the Secretary of State's application for leave to serve the evidence out of time, together with the applicant's cross-application to have the proceedings struck out, were not decided at first instance until 27 January 1994. The applicant appealed against the Registrar's order, but this appeal was not finally determined by the Court of Appeal until 24 May 1996 (almost four years after commencement). For four months (March-June 1994) the civil proceedings were adjourned whilst a criminal trial against some of the co-defendants - but not the applicant - took place. A further five months elapsed after the criminal proceedings had come to an end while the Secretary of State decided whether or not it was in the public interest to continue the disqualification proceedings against the applicant.",
