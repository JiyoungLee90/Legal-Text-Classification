There had been specific facts warranting the conclusion that it had been necessary to prevent them from committing an offence in the imminent future. The applicants had been found by the police standing next to a van in a car park in front of Waldeck prison in the company of seven other people one day after violent riots in  city centre. The first applicant had violently resisted the police\u2019s identity check. The police had found folded-up banners bearing the inscriptions \u201cFreedom for all prisoners\u201d and \u201cFree all now\u201d in the van. In these circumstances, it had been reasonable for the police to assume that the applicants had been about to join the ongoing demonstrations in  and to display the banners to demonstrators, some of whom had been violent. This would have amounted to an incitement of others to free prisoners, punishable under Article 120 of the Criminal Code.",

The first applicant had violently resisted the identity check and proceedings had previously been brought against the second applicant for dangerous interference with rail traffic arising in the context of the transport of castor containers. Therefore, it had to be assumed that the applicants had wanted to disturb the summit by violent means and had wanted to incite other violent demonstrators present in Rostock to free prisoners held in the holding pens which had been set up in the city centre or individuals arrested during a demonstration by force. The applicants had not explained in the proceedings before the domestic courts that the inscriptions on their banners had had a different meaning.",

It concerns cases where the law permits the detention of a person to compel him to fulfil a real and specific obligation already incumbent on him, and which he has until then failed to satisfy (see Engel and Others, cited above, \u00a7 69; Guzzardi, cited above, \u00a7 101; Ciulla, cited above, \u00a7 36; and Epple, cited above, \u00a7 37). The arrest and detention must be for the purpose of securing the fulfilment of the obligation and not punitive in character (see Gatt v. Malta, no. 28221/08, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2010). As soon as the relevant obligation has been fulfilled, the basis for detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) ceases to exist (see Vasileva v.

The applicants, represented by counsel in the proceedings, had explained that the slogans had been addressed to the police and the authorities, urging them to end the numerous detentions of demonstrators, and had not been meant as a call to others to free prisoners by force. It is also uncontested that the applicants had not themselves carried any instruments which could have served to liberate prisoners violently.

In this connection, the Court refers to its case-law, cited above, under which the \u201cobligation prescribed by law\u201d, for the purposes of the said provision, must be real and specific, already incumbent on the person concerned and not yet satisfied by that person at the time of the detention (see paragraph 73 above). It notes that the applicants were detained under section 55(1), paragraph 2, of the PSOA, which authorises detention if \u201cthis is indispensable in order to prevent the imminent commission ... of a criminal offence\u201d (see paragraph 37 above), such as an offence under section 120 of the Criminal Code. The Court considers that the duty not to commit a criminal offence in the imminent future cannot be considered sufficiently concrete and specific, within the meaning of the Court\u2019s case-law, to fall under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b), at least as long as no specific measures have been ordered which have not been complied with. It reiterates in that connection that a wide interpretation of sub-paragraph (b) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 would entail consequences incompatible with the notion of the rule of law, from which the whole Convention draws its inspiration (see Engel and Others, cited above, \u00a7 69). Moreover, the applicants cannot be considered to have previously failed in their duty not to commit such an offence. The applicants\u2019 detention was therefore not covered by sub-paragraph (b) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 either.",

The Government submitted that, under its wording, that provision had also covered court decisions ordering detention for preventive purposes. The Court, however, refers to its wellestablished case-law stating that a \u201cconviction\u201d, having regard to the French text (\u201ccondamnation\u201d), has to be understood as a finding of guilt in respect of an offence (see paragraph 74 above). It observes that in the proceedings at issue, the domestic courts did not find the applicants guilty of any criminal offence, but rather ordered their detention in order to prevent them from committing an offence in the future. Their detention thus did not fall under sub-paragraph (a) of Article 5 \u00a7 1.",

In the case at hand, however, even taking into account the general situation before and during the G8 summit, it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that the liberation of prisoners had been imminent. Therefore, the commission of that offence could not have justified an interference with the right to liberty, especially as less intrusive measures could have been taken (see paragraph 78 above). The Court reiterates that, in any event, the Convention obliges State authorities to take reasonable steps within the scope of their powers to prevent criminal offences of which they had or ought to have had knowledge. However, it does not permit a State to protect individuals from criminal acts of a person by measures which are in breach of that person\u2019s Convention rights, in particular the right to liberty as guaranteed by Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 (see Jendrowiak v. , no. 30060/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 14 April 2011, with further references) and as at issue in the applicants\u2019 case.",

It also observes that no weapons were found on the applicants. It further takes note of the Court of Appeal\u2019s finding that a crowd which was ready to use violence might be incited by the banners to liberate prisoners by force, but further notes that that court conceded that the slogans on the banners at issue in the present case could be understood in different ways (see paragraphs 19, 21 and 22 above). It also takes into account the declaration made by the applicants, represented by counsel, in the proceedings before the domestic courts. They had explained that the slogans on the banners had been addressed to the police and the authorities, urging them to end the numerous detentions of demonstrators, and had not been meant as a call to others to attack prisons and to free prisoners by force (see paragraphs 18 and 25 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the applicants gave a plausible interpretation of the inscriptions on their banners, which themselves clearly did not openly advocate violence. Having regard also to the domestic court\u2019s finding of the slogans\u2019 ambivalent content allowing for different interpretations, the Court considers that it has not been proved that the applicants deliberately intended to incite others to violence. Neither could such a conclusion, in the Court\u2019s view, be drawn from the fact that one of the applicants was considered to have resisted the police\u2019s identity check by force and thus to have used force himself \u2013 in different circumstances and in a different manner from the display of banners to others at a demonstration. It further notes in this connection that neither of the applicants was shown to have previous convictions for violent conduct during demonstrations or in comparable situations.",

Even if their freedom of expression would then have been restricted to a certain extent, their taking part in the demonstrations would not have been made impossible from the very outset.",
