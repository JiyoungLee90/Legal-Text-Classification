There was no reason why unification of parcels only with regard to land registered in the border register was subject to the consent of its owner.

A certificate of a Surveyor's Office was therefore not a request to be examined by the courts but a formal statement about its official acts (Amtshandlungen).

As the border register relied on technically more advanced methods of surveying than the previous land tax register it was more reliable and merited a higher degree of protection. At present the land tax register had only a transitory function until border registers had been drawn up for all municipalities. The Supreme Court further noted that a later partition of the parcels which had been united might not be possible in view of their size. However, this effect could not constitute an interference with the applicant's right to property because it was in accordance with the intentions of the legislator who wished to avoid the creation of parcels of land which were too small.",

For the preparation of the new border register the Feldbach Surveyor's Office had carried out an investigation according to which on the applicant's land the former building area on parcel No. 66/2 no longer existed in nature. However, in its vicinity, on parcel No. 772/1, two buildings had been erected. Since the situation in nature therefore no longer corresponded to the presentation in the map, the two parcels were united and the newly established building areas were depicted in their actual shape and position as areas dedicated to the same use. This had been necessary for reaching the aims of the new border register, namely to show in a reliable manner the size of the parcels of land and the use to which they are put. The unification of the parcels therefor merely constituted an administrative measure, comparable, for instance, to the change of the numbering of a parcel and it neither affected the applicant's right to use his possession nor his contractual relations to third persons nor did it restrict his business activities.

He had promised to give to his son the (old) parcel No. 772/1 - apparently without transferring at the same time ownership over the old parcel No. 66/2 - but as a consequence of the unification of the parcels he could no longer keep this promise. The Court observes that parcel No. 66/2 is situated in the middle of parcel No. 772/1 and is completely surrounded by the latter. There is no building erected on parcel No. 66/2 but two buildings are erected on parcel No. 772/1, one of them partly reaching into parcel No. 66/2. It seems that at the time when these buildings were erected by the then owner, no distinction had been made between the two parcels. Given that one of the buildings is situated on both parcels, it appears quite artificial to maintain that these parcels, as recorded in the former land tax register, could be used in a completely independent way. It is true that the parties have not ruled out that in theory the two parcels could be separated again. The Supreme Court, however, in its judgment of 29 June 1993 has pointed out that such a measure, because of practical obstacles, might not be possible in view of their size. On the basis of this decision and the decision of the Regional Court and the situation under Austrian law as presented therein, the Court is not persuaded that there is an arguably genuine and serious issue to be determined in these proceedings.",

Moreover, the Court found that the criteria for considering a claim as \u201carguable\u201d cannot be construed differently from the criteria applied when declaring claims \u201cmanifestly ill-founded\u201d, thus rejecting the Commission's interpretation of that term according to which there may be claims which are arguable notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding substantive complaint has been declared \u201cmanifestly ill-founded\u201d (Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, \u00a7 33). However, the mere fact that a corresponding substantive complaint has been declared admissible does not necessarily mean that the claim under Article 13 is arguable. Whether that is so has to be determined in the light of the particular facts and the nature of the legal issues raised.",
