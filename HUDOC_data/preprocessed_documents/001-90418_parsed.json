The Government stated that the statutory exclusion of the courts\u2019 jurisdiction to handle the applicants\u2019 case had served the transition to a market economy. However, the Court observes that they did not give any reason as to why it had been necessary to remove all protection for the particular type of property related to the applicants\u2019 claim. The domestic courts involved in the applicants\u2019 case only referred to administrative and accounting disputes stating that these fell within their jurisdiction. Furthermore, neither the courts nor the Government gave any suggestion that the applicants could have vindicated the rights they were trying to protect in any other way, for example by identifying which body would be competent to decide the case. Finally, it is to be noted that the applicants\u2019 claim was rejected seven years after the Act had entered into force. In this later context, the Court finds no explanation as to why it took so long for the courts to reach such a decision.",
