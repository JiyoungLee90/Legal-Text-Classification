In the evening of 5 September 2007 they arrived first in IvanoFrankivsk but did not stay there before going on to the Tlumach police station. There, at an office on the second floor, he met the head of the criminal investigations unit and three police officers: G., Pav. and Gon. They accused him of the sexual assault and murder of P. and demanded his confession to those crimes, stating that his accomplices had been questioned and had implicated him. When the applicant refused to confess, the police officers started beating him about his head, kidneys and ears. During the beating they provided him with the details of the crime which he was supposed to state in his confession. He was also suffocated by means of a polyethylene bag. Then they handcuffed him to a radiator and left the room. Officer Gon. then returned and instructed a young officer to \u201cpractise on the applicant\u201d. The applicant was beaten about his head with a plastic bottle filled with water until he lost consciousness. When he regained consciousness, he was vomiting. The officers again demanded that he confess and beat him when he refused.

The prosecutor concluded that the bruise on the applicant\u2019s face, recorded by the forensic expert, had been caused by the applicant\u2019s careless use of tools at his workplace in Yalta and that the applicant had invented his ill-treatment complaint in order to protract the criminal proceedings and to escape criminal responsibility. She relied on the police officers\u2019 denial of any ill-treatment and on their statements that the applicant had been brought directly to Ivano-Frankivsk from Yalta on 6 September 2007 and, on the same day, having made his statement of voluntary surrender to the police, had been allowed to go home, although he had been requested to attend before the investigator the next day; that the applicant had raised no complaints during the investigative actions of 6 and 7 September 2007; that at the beginning of September 2007 the applicant had briefly visited the Tlumach police station, accompanied by the police officers and that once the bruise on the applicant\u2019s face had become visible, the applicant had explained to officer\u00a0G. that he had sustained the injury during his careless use of a drill in Yalta. The prosecutor further referred to the fact that the logbook of the Tlumach police station contained no entries that would confirm that the applicant had been taken there in September 2007. The applicant\u2019s father appealed against this decision to the Tlumach prosecutor but to no avail.",

His conviction was primarily based on his confession of 6 September 2007, the confessions made by his co-defendants, the records of his questioning as a witness, the reconstruction of the crime and the face-to-face-confrontation, all of 7 September 2007. The court found that evidence to be reliable, admissible, adequate and sufficient since it had all been consistent, had been corroborated by other evidence in the case, and had been obtained by lawful methods of investigation, without any significant violations of procedural rules. Thus, according to the court, the applicant\u2019s and B.\u2019s confessions had been corroborated by statements made by their cellmates in police custody, who had said that the applicant and B. had told them that they had participated in a crime; by the statements of other attesting witnesses and police officers to the extent that the defendants had given their statements of their own free will during the investigative steps taken; and by indirect evidence given by other witnesses. It noted that the details of the crime provided by the defendants, including the place of the murder and construction features of the building where the body had been hidden would only be known to them if they had been the perpetrators. It also found that it was not prohibited by law to question defendants about a murder while they were being held on administrative detention. The inconsistencies between the defendants\u2019 statements were declared insignificant and explained by the amount of time that had elapsed since the crime had been committed in addition to the effects of alcohol on the defendants at the time it had been committed.",

The Court further concluded that in such circumstances it had been reasonable for the applicant to wait for the completion of the trial before raising the complaints before the Court and he had accordingly complied with the six-month rule provided in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 99).

The very fact that he confessed after being held in undocumented detention for at least two days, in a setting lacking procedural guarantees, such as the availability of a lawyer, and retracted his confession soon afterwards, creates the appearance that his confession may not have been given freely. Corroborated by evidence of physical injuries, this gives rise to a strong presumption that the police officers resorted to physical ill-treatment as a means of breaking the applicant\u2019s psychological resistance in order to obtain self-incriminating statements (compare Belousov v. Ukraine, no. 4494/07, \u00a7 63, 7 November 2013). It was for the State to refute these allegations.",
