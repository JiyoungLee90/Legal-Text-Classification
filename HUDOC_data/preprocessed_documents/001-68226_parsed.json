Moreover, each summons contained a printed reminder that the applicant was to submit the original documents to the court. The applicant did not comply with this request. The Court recalls in this context that it is incumbent on the interested party to display special diligence in the defence of his interests (see Teuschler v. Germany (dec.), no. 47636/99, 4 October 2001). It considers that, in the circumstances of the present case, the authorities\u2019 assumption that the applicant had lost interest in pursuing his claim had a sufficient basis and that the decision of 24 December 1998 did not as such violate the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court.",

Furthermore, they did not produce any evidence, apart from a handwritten note on the back page of the file, showing that on 19 February 1999 the decision had indeed been served on the applicant.

It makes no award in this respect. However, it considers that the applicant may be considered to have suffered some non-pecuniary damage as a result of the breach of his right of access to a court which cannot be compensated by the Court\u2019s finding of a violation. The particular amount claimed is, however, excessive. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41 of the Convention, the Court awards the applicant the sum of 1,500 euros (\u201cEUR\u201d), plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
