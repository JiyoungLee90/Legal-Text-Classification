The Court considers that it was for the authorities to properly establish that the applicant had been forewarned of the search. However, the Court has not been presented with convincing material to that effect.

Remarkably, the authorities subsequently admitted that they had seized the mobile phones, which had initially not been included on the list of seized items. Only belatedly did they return the phones and some other items of property irrelevant to the criminal case to the applicant. In that regard, the Court observes that the attesting witnesses and the representative of the building maintenance organisation, invited by the police to participate in the search did not ensure that the seized items were accurately listed in the report, or that the seizure fitted the scope defined in the search warrant.",

Ukraine, no.\u00a041716/06, \u00a7\u00a075, 5 July 2012). The Court notes that neither the inquiring officer nor the courts reviewing the decision of 16 June 2005 considered whether the search had been conducted within the scope defined by the search warrant. As noted above, the number of seized items meant that the search went beyond the limits established by the court in its search warrant. Furthermore, it does not appear that appropriate measures were taken to examine whether the police officers had indeed forewarned the applicant, and whether they had complied with their duty of care as stated in Article\u00a0183 of the CCP. In particular, no attempt was made to verify the police officers\u2019 statements that they had informed the applicant of the search operation.",
