(first-instance) public prosecutor\u2019s office notified, under section 288 of the Criminal Proceedings Act (see paragraph 33 below), the HCHR that by a decision of the same date it had rejected the criminal complaint against those accused of crimes, namely the director of B. Social Welfare Centre, the director of the RIBBS and five carers from the RIBBS (V.M., Z.K., V.B., P.M. and K.D., all identified by their full names). The decision found that their actions had not contained any elements of the alleged crimes or any other crime subject to State prosecution. The public prosecutor established: that the RIBBS was responsible for persons with physical disabilities, but in practice also accommodated mentally disabled people; that it had sought the applicant\u2019s transfer to an appropriate institution, since its staff had not been adequately trained to provide him with the requisite care; that the applicant, notwithstanding his medical diagnosis, had not had any physical disability, but had instead been a very active child who had required constant care from the staff; that the applicant had received the daily care he required, but the results of the work with him had been limited, owing to his speech disability; that there had been incidents where the applicant had left the RIBBS; and that occasionally the applicant had been tied to his bed with a rope. The prosecutor held that the aim of that measure had not been to illtreat or degrade him, but to prevent him from running away from the RIBBS and putting himself in danger or harming himself. In those circumstances, the public prosecutor concluded that the act of tying the applicant to his bed could not be considered an act of unlawful use of force or threats intended to extract a confession or cause suffering. The prosecutor found that there had been a lack of intent on the part of the suspects to subject the applicant to inhuman or degrading treatment, a subjective element of the reported crimes. The applicant had been tied to his bed in order to prevent him from harming himself. Furthermore, L.R. could not be regarded as falling within any category of victims specified under Article\u00a0142 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 34 below). A copy of the decision (containing an instruction on legal remedies) was served on B. Social Welfare Centre, the applicant\u2019s guardian. The guardian did not appeal against the decision.",

The mandate has previously declared that there can be no therapeutic justification for the use of solitary confinement and prolonged restraint of persons with disabilities in psychiatric institutions; both prolonged seclusion and restraint may constitute torture and ill-treatment (A/63/175, paras. 55-56). The Special Rapporteur has addressed the issue of solitary confinement and stated that its imposition, of any duration, on persons with mental disabilities is cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment (A/66/268, paras. 67-68, 78). Moreover, any restraint on people with mental disabilities for even a short period of time may constitute torture and illtreatment. It is essential that an absolute ban on all coercive and non-consensual measures, including restraint and solitary confinement of people with psychological or intellectual disabilities, should apply in all places of deprivation of liberty, including in psychiatric and social care institutions.

Both this mandate and United Nations treaty bodies have established that involuntary treatment and other psychiatric interventions in healthcare facilities are forms of torture and ill-treatment. Forced interventions, often wrongfully justified by theories of incapacity and therapeutic necessity inconsistent with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, are legitimized under national laws, and may enjoy wide public support as being in the alleged \u2018best interest\u2019 of the person concerned. Nevertheless, to the extent that they inflict severe pain and suffering, they violate the absolute prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment (A/63/175, paras. 38, 40, 41). Concern for the autonomy and dignity of persons with disabilities leads the Special Rapporteur to urge revision of domestic legislation allowing for forced interventions.",

It appears that an inaccurate diagnosis preceded that placement, given that the findings that the applicant had the most severe form of a physical disability (cerebral palsy) contradicted the first-hand and direct information from the members of staff of the RIBBS, based on their personal experience and subsequent medical evidence. The RIBBS was in no way an institution for mentally disabled persons like the applicant. Furthermore, its personnel were not qualified to communicate with the applicant, who was deaf and unable to speak. The facilities in the RIBBS were not suited to his hyperactivity, which necessitated regular supervision that staff could not ensure. Such treatment led to the applicant\u2019s overall condition worsening. In this connection, it is to be noted that after his admission to the RIBBS, the applicant started injuring himself, apparently for the first time (see paragraph 10 above). Furthermore, as noted in the medical report drawn up soon after his discharge from the RIBBS, he showed a \u201clow level of functionality [and] communication difficulties ... [and had] undeveloped communication skills ...\u201d The report further stated that \u201cowing to insufficient stimulation and early treatment, [the applicant] had a very low level of development\u201d (see paragraph 24 above). The Court finds it particularly striking that the applicant\u2019s guardian and the other competent authorities were aware from the outset that the RIBBS could not provide the applicant with the requisite care (even before his admission), but nevertheless took no measure in reply to those serious alerts and pursued that placement for a considerable period of time.

The Court finds it particularly worrying that such a \u201cmeasure\u201d, which in itself is incompatible with human dignity, was used for approximately a year and nine months in respect of an eight-year-old child. On numerous occasions it has stressed the particular vulnerability of minors in the context of Article 3 of the Convention, given that treatment within the meaning of this Article is liable to have a greater impact  especially in psychological terms \u2013 on a minor than on an adult (see Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7 109, ECHR 2015). The applicant was even more vulnerable because of his disability, which meant that he could not complain at all about how he was affected by such treatment (see Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a027229/95, \u00a7 111, ECHR\u00a02001III).",

The Court further notes that, as established by the prosecuting authorities and confirmed by the Government, the applicant was tied to his bed for \u201csafety reasons\u201d, namely to prevent him from running away and thus putting himself in danger. Although the risk of a person running away or causing injury or damage is a factor to be taken into consideration (see Julin v.\u00a0Estonia, nos. 16563/08 and 3 others, \u00a7 120, 29 May 2012), the Court is not convinced that tying the applicant to his bed by his leg in order to prevent him from running away from the premises of the RIBBS and thus endangering himself was the least intrusive measure available in the context of his safety. There is no indication that any alternatives (apart from the removal of the handles of the window of the applicant\u2019s room, see paragraph 18 above) were considered or applied before or during the application of that \u201cmeasure\u201d. The Court cannot but note that the \u201cmeasure\u201d was not necessitated by any reason related to the applicant\u2019s medical condition, but, as established by the prosecuting authorities (see paragraphs\u00a025 and 72 above), was a consequence of his inappropriate placement in the RIBBS. In this connection further reference is made to the relevant international materials (see paragraphs 36-40 above).",

They rejected the HCHR\u2019s complaint, finding that there were no grounds to hold that a criminal offence subject to State prosecution had been committed. The main reason for that finding was that they considered that there had been no intent (\u0443\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430, \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430) on the part of suspects to subject the applicant to inhuman or degrading treatment, which was, as a matter of domestic law, as interpreted in the applicant\u2019s case, a compulsory element of the reported crimes under Articles 142 and 143 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 20, 34 and 35 above). In this connection, the Court recalls that it is not its task to substitute itself for the domestic jurisdictions. It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation (see Nencheva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 134). Furthermore, the fact that those suspected of ill-treatment were not charged (and punished) is not sufficient in itself to find a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, as the procedural obligation under Article 3 is not an obligation of result, but of means (see \u0110eki\u0107 and Others v.

In the instant case, in spite of having established the existence of systemic failures, the majority have decided not to suggest any individual or general measures. Instead, the majority prefer to limit themselves to finding a violation of the procedural limb of Article 3, invoking the absence of measures which would have constituted an appropriate reaction in the instant case. This moves the issue of appropriate measures from the domain of adequate redress to the core of the procedural limb of Article 3.

Had the parties known that this different standard would be applied, they would have probably pleaded the case differently; in particular, the Government would have been able to address the issue whether the various measures taken by the national authorities in reaction to the facts of the case were generally adequate.

Once proceedings have been initiated, however, the representation of a minor by a non-governmental organisation at subsequent stages may be problematic. Firstly, the instant case reveals the potential risks of conferring parental rights to an institution (namely B. Social Welfare Centre) instead of to a specific physical person. It seems preferable that guardianship of a minor be exercised by a physical person who is personally accountable for his actions and omissions. Secondly, non-governmental organisations have their own views, objectives and interests, which are not necessarily identical with the best interests of the minor they represent. They are involved in numerous cases and are often engaged in lobbying for the promotion of their views as well as the interests they have decided to defend. Even if, apparently, this did not occur in the instant case, there is a risk that the case of a minor may be instrumentalised for the sake of achieving the organisation\u2019s general objectives, for instance for the purposes of strategic litigation, which is by its nature directed towards general issues. For these reasons, if an application is lodged by a non-governmental organisation on behalf of minor who does not remain under the authority of his parents and the person appointed by the domestic authorities to exercise parental rights finds himself in a situation of a conflict of interests, it is preferable to appoint a physical person as curator ad litem to represent the child throughout the proceedings before the Court.",
