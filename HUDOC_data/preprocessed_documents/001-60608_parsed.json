Maze Prison Board of Visitors ([1988] 1 AC 379) had made adjudication of prison disciplinary matters virtually indistinguishable from matters of summary jurisdiction and, therefore, legal representation ought to have been allowed as of right. On 1 August 1997 a single judge of the High Court refused leave to both applicants. He observed that there was no right to legal representation in adjudication hearings and that the Governor\u2019s exercise of his discretion not to allow such representation was not irrational or perverse given the facts of the cases. In Mr Ezeh\u2019s case he added that there was therefore no good reason for extending time.",

Forfeiture of remission had the effect of causing the detention to continue beyond the period corresponding to that legitimate expectation (R. v.

In the first place, section 4 of the 1986 Act required an intention that the subject of the threats should be made to fear that immediate violence would be used and this was not a necessary element of the offence under Rule 47(17) of the Prison Rules. A threat of violence was considered, in itself, inherently disruptive and contrary to good discipline and should therefore be controlled even though the restraints of prison meant that it might be, in fact, impossible for the prisoner to carry out the threat. Secondly, it was not necessary to establish against whom the threatening behaviour was aimed to prove an offence under Rule 47(17), whereas section 4 of the 1986 Act required proof that a particular person feared violence. Thirdly, the offence under Section 4 of the 1986 Act could not be committed where the accused and the alleged victim were within a dwelling (as defined), whereas Rule 47(17) foresaw offences taking place within a prison or even within a cell where prisoners dwell.

Relevant indicators were the seriousness of the matter and whether the illegality of the acts turned on the fact that they were committed in prison. Conduct which constituted an offence under the Rules might also amount to an offence under the criminal law so that, theoretically at least, there was nothing to prevent conduct of this kind being the subject of both criminal and disciplinary proceedings. However, in explaining the autonomous nature of the concept of \u201ccriminal\u201d in Article 6 of the Convention, the Court has emphasised that the Contracting States cannot at their discretion classify an offence as disciplinary instead of criminal, or prosecute the author of a \u201cmixed\u201d offence on the disciplinary rather than on the criminal plane as this would subordinate the operation of the fundamental clauses of Article 6 to their sovereign will.

Prior to the 1991 Act, remission was, as a technical matter, characterised as a privilege, But the rules for calculating remission were standardised and were invariably applied and, if remission were granted, the prisoner had a legal right to be released before he had served the full term of his sentence on the basis of his legitimate expectation that the remission system would be correctly applied. In the event of the commission of a disciplinary offence a prison Governor could order a reduction in the period of remission and such reduction would postpone the date when the prisoner would be released and thereby operate as an award of additional days to be served before release. By the 1991 Act the previous remission system was replaced by a clear statutory code governing remission of sentence. The change in the law effected by the Act, in the interests of accessibility and transparency, did not in any way change the nature of the power which a prison Governor exercised when deciding that a person should be awarded \u201cadditional days\u201d of detention.",

Application of the \u201cappreciably detrimental\u201d test might lead to different results in respect of prisoners serving different sentence periods, but this was not arbitrary: the award of 10 additional days in the case of a prisoner serving a 20 day sentence may be detrimental in the context of such a sentence but would clearly not be appreciably detrimental in the context of a prisoner serving a 20 year sentence.",

In addition, the sentencing court had to take account of the actual term which the prisoner would serve under the 1991 Act when fixing the initial sentence because the release date was enshrined in statute (Practice Statement (Crime: Sentencing) WLR 1992, at \u00a7 9), whereas previously the sentencing court simply fixed the sentence appropriate to the offence since any remission was, in principle, a matter of executive discretion. Moreover, prior to the 1991 Act, additional detention consequent on an erroneous calculation of remission would not have given rise to a claim in compensation whereas, since the 1991 Act, remission was considered a right. Thus such an error would give rise to an award of compensation for the tort of false imprisonment (the above-cited case of R v. Governor of Brockhill Prison, ex parte Evans (No. 2)).",

However, prior to the 1991 Act, the domestic courts had already come to reject the notion that remission was a privilege and that prisoners who had lost remission had not lost anything to which they were entitled. The courts considered that, if remission was not a legal \u201cright\u201d, prisoners had at least a legitimate expectation of release on the expiry of the relevant period (see paragraph 32 above). The Court in its Campbell and Fell judgment (\u00a7 72) accepted that the practice of granting remission was such that it created in the prisoner a legitimate expectation that he would recover his or her liberty before the end of the term of imprisonment and that forfeiture of remission had the effect of causing the detention to continue beyond the period corresponding to that expectation.

The applicants considered that the second limb of Article 6 \u00a7 3(c) was unqualified in its protection (by the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d criterion or otherwise) and, accordingly, the refusal of legal representation for their hearings violated Article 6 \u00a7 3(c).",
