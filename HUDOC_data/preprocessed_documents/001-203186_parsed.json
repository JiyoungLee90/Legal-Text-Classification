Mr\u00a0Uzhakhov and Mr T. had been under police surveillance, but according to the authorities, the special operation against them had not been planned.

The witness statements had contained significant inconsistencies on the key circumstances of the special operation, such as whether Mr Uzhakhov\u2019s car had been chased by the agents when the suspects had allegedly opened fire or the police had blocked it and then the suspects had started shooting. Moreover, in the applicants\u2019 submission, the authorities had failed to take basic steps to establish the true circumstances of the incident, such as carrying out a forensic examination of the bullets collected from the scene and explaining the failure to locate Khamzat Uzhakhov\u2019s and Mr\u00a0T.\u2019s fingerprints on the firearms found in their car.",

However, in spite of the evidence contained in those files and the applicants\u2019 consistent complaints that the actual circumstances of Mr Uzhakhov\u2019s killing had been in contradiction to the official version, the authorities not only limited themselves to taking a very few formal steps, but they failed to coordinate the material and information collected therein (see, for example, paragraphs 44 and 48 above) and refused to investigate the applicants\u2019 allegations.

The Court observes further that the first applicant consistently requested that the authorities take measures aiming at opening of a criminal case and grant him victim status in those proceedings (see paragraphs 23, 24, 45 and 50 above).

However, despite the officers\u2019 statements to the contrary, from the crime-scene-examination report it is apparent that their version of the events has not been sufficiently supported by the evidence available.

Secondly, neither any of the officers involved, nor their vehicles, belongings or equipment had been grazed, perforated or damaged in any way by the gunfire allegedly issuing from their car (see paragraphs 26, 42 and 43 above). Moreover, no other traces of bullets or gunshots had been found at the alleged skirmish, while the same report indicated that Mr\u00a0Uzhakhov\u2019s car had been shot at from the back (see paragraph 26 above). Therefore, the documents submitted do not demonstrate that the officers\u2019 version was substantiated by the evidence. While bearing in mind the limitations on the scope of its review, as mentioned above, the Court neither finds elements to conclude that the conduct by the State agents was compatible with the requirement to minimise the risk to life of individuals in need of protection, nor can it support the conclusion that the use of lethal force was absolutely necessary, as the Government seem to suggest.",

According to the documents submitted, not a single person who could have shed light on the events in question, other than the possibly implicated officers, was questioned by the investigators despite their superiors\u2019 direct orders to this end (see paragraph 29 above).

In such circumstances, the second applicant\u2019s complaint regarding the arrival at her house of the group of law-enforcement agents and her degrading treatment by them did not appear either far-fetched or unsubstantiated. Thus, when the applicants complained, it was for the investigators to take steps to verify whether their allegations had factual basis by promptly taking such essential measures as the examination of the crime scene in the house and its basement, and questioning of the second applicant and other witnesses in order to establish whether the events had occurred and whether the alleged ill-treatment could have taken place.",
