It considered that the applicant\u2019s own submissions, according to which he could not have been present at the crime scene as he first entered Swiss territory in January 2002 \u2013 and thus after the victim had been killed \u2013 were contradictory and thus lacked credibility.

There was, in particular, witness and circumstantial evidence allowing the conclusion that the applicant had been residing in the  region since August 2001, that he had known the victim and that he had engaged in drug trafficking with him. As regarded the shooting of the victim, the court considered that the statements made by the witness Z. L., who had declared in a credible and convincing way to the police that the applicant had explained to him some days after the incident that he had killed N.B. before the latter could kill him, weighed heavily against the applicant, notwithstanding the fact that Z. L. did not repeat these allegations during the court proceedings, but stated that he could not remember what had happened. The testimony given by Z. L. during the police investigation was supported by the convincing submissions made by the anonymous witness, and by testimony given by a witness who had presumably met the applicant immediately after the crime. Relying on all available evidence, the jury court concluded that there was no doubt that N.\u00a0B. had been shot by the applicant. With regard to the concrete factual circumstances, the jury court considered that the prosecution based its submissions mainly on testimony given by the anonymous witness. It followed that, for formal reasons, these circumstances could not be taken into account and that it had to be assumed in the applicant\u2019s favour that the concrete circumstances had not been proven. It followed that there was no sufficient factual basis which would allow the conclusion that the applicant acted with a particular degree of scrupulousness (besonders skrupellos) which would lead to the crime being characterised as murder.",

Neither the applicant nor his counsel had ever seen the witness, whose personal details remained secret. The court further noted that the witness refused to answer a number of questions which the defence considered important (see paragraph 11, above). The court did not call into question that the legal conditions for granting anonymity were fulfilled in the instant case and confirmed the first instance court\u2019s finding that it had been necessary to protect X against possible reprisals.",

The fact that the prosecution and the presiding judge were aware of the witness\u2019 identity could not be regarded as a counterbalancing factor as such. Given the fact that all judges were accountable for the judgment, and that it was the role of the defence to examine the findings of the prosecution from the defendant\u2019s point of view, it appeared problematic that the presiding judge had knowledge that was superior to that of the other members of the court, including the jury, and that the latter had more knowledge than the defence.

It noted that the anonymous witness was the only direct witness of the crime at issue, as the remaining witnesses only gave evidence by hearsay. It was thus obvious that the anonymous witness\u2019 testimony had more than only minor relevance for the assessment of the evidence. Even though the evidence given by other \u2013 indirect \u2013 witnesses carried a certain weight, the anonymous witness had to be regarded as the decisive evidence (\u201cmassgebliches Beweismittel\u201d), and was decisive to an extent which, under the Court\u2019s case-law, excluded the possibility of having recourse to this evidence in order to establish the applicant\u2019s guilt.",

In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 84, 16 November 2010, with further references therein). In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole, having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victim(s) that crime is properly prosecuted (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7 175, ECHR 2010) and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see, amongst many authorities, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, \u00a7 70, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II). It is also notable in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 162, and the references therein).",

As to the content of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d), the Grand Chamber explained that it enshrines the principle that, before an accused can be convicted, all evidence against him must normally be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of proceedings (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 118 and Van Mechelen and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051). In the context of absent witnesses, the Grand Chamber set out two considerations in determining whether the admission of statements was compatible with the right to a fair trial. First, it had to be established that there was a good reason for the nonattendance of the witness. Second, even where there was a good reason, where a conviction was based solely or to a decisive extent on statements made by a person whom the accused had had no opportunity to examine, the rights of the defence might be restricted to an extent incompatible with the guarantees of Article 6. Accordingly, when the evidence of an absent witness was the sole or decisive basis for a conviction, sufficient counterbalancing factors were required, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards, which permitted a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 119 and 147).",

Accordingly, in assessing the fairness of a trial involving anonymous witnesses called to give oral evidence before the court, this Court must examine, first, whether there are good reasons to keep secret the identity of the witness. Second, the Court must consider whether the evidence of the anonymous witness was the sole or decisive basis of the conviction. Third, where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of anonymous witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. If the defence is unaware of the identity of the person it seeks to question, it may be deprived of the very particulars enabling it to demonstrate that he or she is prejudiced, hostile or unreliable. In view of this, the Court must be satisfied that there are sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards, to permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 147, and Ellis, Simms and Martin, cited above, \u00a7 78).",

The Court further notes that the applicant knew the witness X by sight, that the crime at issue was set in the drug-trafficking scene and that the jury court had considered that X\u2019s fears that his life was in danger in case he testified was in line with the overall picture conveyed by the other witnesses, who showed acute fear when it came to making any concrete incriminating statements (compare paragraphs 12 and 13, above). As this assessment of the threats does not appear far-fetched (also compare Doorson, cited above, \u00a7 71), the Court accepts that there had been relevant reasons to keep the witness\u2019 identity undisclosed.",

While in the latter case the interrogation of anonymous witnesses took place under similar circumstances as in the instant case, the Court considered that the Government had failed sufficiently to establish as to why it had been necessary to maintain the police officers\u2019 anonymity (see Van Mechelen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60 et sequ.). Conversely, in the instant case, the Court does not have reason to doubt the necessity of protecting the witness X\u2019s anonymity.",

However, the jury court also relied on other evidence corroborating X.\u2019s account. There was, in particular, witness and circumstantial evidence allowing the conclusion that the applicant had been residing in the  region at the time of the crime, that he had known the victim and that he had engaged in drug trafficking with him. As regarded the shooting of the victim, the court considered that the statements made by the witness Z. L., who had declared in a credible and convincing way to the police that the applicant had explained to him some days after the incident that he had killed N.B. before the latter could kill him, weighed heavily against the applicant, notwithstanding the fact that Z. L. did not repeat these allegations during the court proceedings. The testimony given by Z. L. during the police investigation was supported by testimony given by a further, non-anonymous witness who had presumably met the applicant immediately after the crime. Relying on all available evidence, the jury court concluded that there was no doubt that N. B. had been shot by the applicant.",

While the Federal Tribunal put the importance of X\u2019s testimony in perspective, it did not state as a certainty that the remaining evidence, taken on its own, would have been sufficient for establishing the applicant\u2019s guilt. The Court further observes that, while X was the sole witness who directly observed the shooting and was ready to testify, the jury court could rely on other evidence corroborating X.\u2019s testimony. Having regard to these circumstances, the Court considers that the testimony given by X. was not the sole evidence against the applicant, but did carry considerable weight in the establishment of the applicant\u2019s guilt.",

The Court notes in this context that the trial court was well aware of the necessity of counterbalancing the restrictions imposed on the defence by the hearing of the anonymous witness. It enumerated the following measures taken in order to safeguard the rights of the defence. Firstly, the witness had not been examined by the regional prosecutor, but by the president of the court. Secondly, the identity of X had been confirmed by the police-officer in charge of the investigation and had been known to the regional prosecutor and to the president of the court. Thirdly, the police officer and the regional prosecutor gave testimony about X\u2019s reputation, his criminal record and credibility. Furthermore, X had been interrogated before the complete court and all persons participating in the decision-making process could gain a personal impression of the witness and of his reaction to the questions put to him. Lastly, the jury court took into account that, under the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights as applicable at the relevant time, a conviction could not be exclusively based on testimony given by an anonymous witness. Consequently, the jury court did not rely on X\u2019s submissions with regard to the immediate circumstances of the crime.",

The defence was thus prevented from observing X\u2019s demeanour under direct questioning, and thus from testing his reliability (see Van Mechelen and Others, cited above, \u00a7 59 and Kostovski v. the Netherlands, 20 November 1989, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 166). On the other hand, the applicant\u2019s counsel was able to put questions to the witness via a sound link, which the witness answered as long as he did not risk betraying his identity. All members of the jury court were able directly to observe the witness\u2019 reactions.",
