The department therefore recommends that the current sanction measure be modified from a sentence of forensic psychiatric care to treatment at a psychiatric department under supervision by both the Prison and Probation Service and the department following his discharge so that, in consultation with the consultant psychiatrist, the Prison and Probation Service may make a decision on readmission under section 72(1) of the Penal Code. ...\u201d",

Around March he claimed to have progressive symptoms, and his doses of antipsychotics were increased, whereas his doses had been lowered a bit some months before. Since the patient\u2019s anger was found to be increasing despite the increase in doses, it was decided that he was to be transferred to a closed ward on 5 April 2013; however, he left the area and an alert had to be circulated, but he quickly returned again by himself. Having been moved back, he absconded again briefly on 18 April 2013, but returned and did not appear to be under the influence of drugs. On 21 April 2013, [the applicant] threatened and beat a carer in the head without any warning. The following day he had to be immobilised by belts because of new threats. On 5 May 2013, he attacked and beat a carer without any warning, and he was found severely psychotic. Immobilisation by belts applied until 12 May 2013, and during that period he was severely fluctuating, at times severely psychotic and aggressively threatening. He willingly accepted a change in medications to Leponex tablets with simultaneous stepping down of treatment with Cisordinol (antipsychotics). The patient\u2019s condition quickly improved, and he now appears to have his usual condition, is friendly, cooperative and motivated for continuing therapy. The patient\u2019s abuse is very limited and he only uses cannabis, although he cannot distance himself from continuing to use that substance.",

It is a clear fear that [the applicant] will not have the resources to continue the necessary psychiatric therapy, including pharmacotherapy, if deported from Denmark. In this connection there is deemed to be a high risk of pharmaceutical failure and resumed abuse and consequently the worsening of his psychotic symptoms and a risk of aggressive behaviour. It should be noted that the current medication in the form of Leponex tablets is an antipsychotic that must be administered on a daily basis, which is deemed to constitute a risk of pharmaceutical failure and consequently the worsening of his psychotic symptoms and a greater risk of aggressive behaviour if he is deported from Denmark. It is the overall assessment that a potential interruption of the treatment would give rise to a significantly higher risk of offences against the person of others due to a worsening of his psychotic symptoms.",

He first met [the applicant] in June 2013. He has followed [the applicant\u2019s] development ever since as the physician in charge. Since [P.L.] made his medical statement on 13 January 2014, [the applicant] has been doing well in the safe environment at the department. He has kept to the agreements made, and he has been able to have a job. In the assessment of [P.L.], [the applicant] will lose focus if he does not have a solid framework. [The applicant\u2019s] personal history shows this. [The applicant] has shown violent behaviour for a long time, including at school and while in forensic psychiatric care. The violent behaviour has diminished as a result of the treatment. The medical treatment of [the applicant] is an expert task. He is given complex treatment, and the treatment plan has to be carefully followed, including the taking of blood samples for somatic reasons on a weekly or monthly basis. [The applicant] needs to get his medicine to avoid serious relapses. It is a condition for making a recommendation to amend the sanction measure, that [the applicant] is taken care of through a range of treatment initiatives, in addition to the correct administration of medicines and the necessary arrangements for blood sampling. Some of the other treatment initiatives are a regular contact person for supervision of [the applicant], a follow-up scheme to make sure that [the applicant] pays attention to the medical treatment administered, assistance from a social worker to deal with any dependence and other problems and assistance for making sure that he is in the right environment and is offered an occupation. These elements of his treatment are essential to prevent relapses. These initiatives are taken as an element of his treatment in Denmark. It is the assessment of [P.L.] that the same treatment offers will not be available to [the applicant] in Turkey. If [the applicant] relapses, it may have serious consequences to himself and his environment. [P.L.] believes that [the applicant] may become very dangerous if he relapses, which is likely to happen if he is not given the right medication and support as he is currently receiving. [P.L.] believes that there are highly-skilled psychiatrists in the cities in Turkey, but probably not in a small village in which [the applicant] is likely to settle, and that [the applicant] will not be taken care of like in Denmark. ...\u201d",

He referred in particular to the conclusion reached by the City Court in its decision of 14\u00a0October 2014 (see paragraph 27 above) and the statement by the Consultant Psychiatrist, P.L., who had followed his treatment and progress (see paragraph 25 above). P.L. had pointed out that, besides medication, in order to prevent a relapse it was essential that the applicant had a regular contact person for supervision, that a follow-up scheme was in place to make sure that the applicant paid attention to the medical treatment administered, that he had assistance from a social worker to deal with any dependence and other problems, and assistance for making sure that he was in the right environment and was offered an occupation. If the applicant suffered a relapse, it might have serious consequences for him and his environment, and the applicant might become very dangerous. The applicant also contended that Leponex can have a side effect that leads to a malfunction in the immune system. Therefore, he needed to undergo blood tests on an ongoing basis to be meticulous aware if such malfunction should occur. In that case, he would have to be taken of that medication immediately. He would not be able to recognise such a development in his immune system, and hence would not be able to seek medical attention in time.",

However, the Court observed that the applicant faced the risk of relapse even if he were to stay in the United Kingdom, as his illness was long term and required constant management. The Government noted that in the present case, the applicant will have about 100 km to travel to the nearest hospital (thus only 20 km more that in the case mentioned), he can continue the same medical treatment in Turkey as he received in Denmark, and psychiatric treatment is available at public hospitals and from private healthcare providers who have concluded an agreement with the Turkish Ministry of Health.

The High Court also had before it the statement of 13 January 2014 by Consultant Psychiatrist P.L., setting out that the applicant\u2019s recovery prospects were good if he could be reintegrated into society by being offered a suitable home and intensive outpatient therapy in the following years, whereas his recovery prospects were bad if he were to be discharged without follow-up and control. Before the City Court on 7\u00a0October 2014 Consultant Psychiatrist P.L. added that the medical treatment of the applicant was an expert task. Moreover, in his opinion, besides medication, in order to prevent a relapse, it was essential that the applicant had a regular contact person for supervision, that a follow-up scheme was in place to make sure that the applicant pays attention to the medical treatment administered, that he had assistance from a social worker to deal with any dependence and other problems, and assistance for making sure that he was in the right environment and was offered occupation. Those initiatives were part of the applicant\u2019s treatment in Denmark. In addition, on 6 January 2015, before the High Court, P.L. pointed out that the applicant needed to undergo blood tests regularly in order to verify that he had not developed an immune disorder, which could be a side-effect of Leponex.",

The Court has deliberately decided to apply a strict test with a very high threshold in such cases, and we are not convinced that this threshold has been reached in the present case. More importantly, the approach of the majority represents a lowering of the requirements established in the recent judgment of the Grand Chamber. Whether such a change or further development in the Court\u2019s case-law is called for and justified should, in our view, have been left for the Grand Chamber to decide. Therefore, in our assessment, the present case raises a serious question affecting the interpretation and application of the Convention, and the majority\u2019s reasoning will have significant implications for the member States in cases concerning the removal of persons suffering from mental illnesses. In addition, the approach adopted by the majority in the present case will have implications for the Court\u2019s practice concerning requests for interim measures under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court from applicants suffering from mental illnesses who challenge expulsion orders. Finally, and even though this has not had a bearing on our assessment of the present case, we find it relevant to point out that a physical medical condition relies more on objective elements than mental illness, which can sometimes be assessed subjectively, or even wrongly, owing to symptoms being simulated. Thus, in the context of the criminal proceedings against the applicant, the Medico-Legal Council stated that a medical assessment had found that the applicant\u2019s \u201ccomplaints of auditory hallucinations could be characterised as simulation\u201d (see paragraph 10 of the judgment).",
