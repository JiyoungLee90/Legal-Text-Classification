Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were delayed and were eventually taken only after the communication of the complaint to the respondent Government in 2009, or not at all. Furthermore, the Court notes that, as can be seen from the decisions of the supervising prosecutors (see paragraphs 50, 57, 62 and 73 above) and the town court decision (see paragraph 89 above) prior to November 2009 the investigators had not established the identity of the owners of the UAZ vehicles used by the abductors; nor had they questioned the applicants\u2019 relatives and all the neighbours who had witnessed the abduction (see paragraphs 75, 77, 81 and 83 above). It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own volition but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

It does not appear that the investigators had attempted to question the head of the local administration about events following the abduction (see paragraphs 16 and 74 above) or elucidated the contradictory information which had served as the basis for the opening of the criminal investigation of the abduction (see paragraph 41 above).",

The Court observes that the applicants did in fact make use of that remedy, which eventually led to the resumption of the investigation. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined in its early stages by the authorities\u2019 failure to take necessary and urgent investigative measures. Moreover, the town court\u2019s instructions to the investigators to investigate the crime effectively did not bring about any tangible results for the applicants. The investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, but it appears that no significant investigative measures were taken to identify those responsible for the abduction. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants could not be required to challenge in court every single decision of the district prosecutor\u2019s office. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances, and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee, as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",
