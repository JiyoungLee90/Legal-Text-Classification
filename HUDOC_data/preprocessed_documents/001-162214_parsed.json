On this latter point the Court has explained that where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim. In the absence of such explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government.

Therefore, the Court cannot but conclude that the use of force was unnecessary and excessive (see Rizvanov v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a031805/06, \u00a7\u00a050, 17 April 2012). The Court considers that the injuries sustained by the applicant must have caused him physical pain and suffering, as well as considerable mental suffering, diminishing his human dignity.",

In addition, the Court notes that the expert medical report was based only on the applicant\u2019s medical records (see paragraph 17 above).

Recourse to physical force which has not been rendered strictly necessary by the person\u2019s own conduct diminishes human dignity and is an infringement of the rights set forth in Article 3 of the Convention (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0101).",

At the same time, both the Internal Security Office of the State Police and the prosecution service failed to examine whether the measures applied against the applicant had been indispensable and not excessive. Such assessment was even more important given the applicant\u2019s medical condition at the time, in particular the fact that he had been in pain and was suffering from kidney stones and a renal colic (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). Furthermore, he had been given painkillers a couple of hours prior to the use of force (see paragraph\u00a07 above).",

In his decision of 29\u00a0May 2009 the prosecutor noted that it was impossible to establish when the injuries on the applicant had been caused (see paragraph 48 above), and that the Internal Security Office of the State Police had taken all investigative steps requested by the prosecution service (see paragraph\u00a049 above).",

This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that investigation becomes more problematic with the passage of time (see Holodenko, cited above, \u00a7 81).
