Abortion being illegal, she decided to ask her second cousin, a university assistant at the time, to help her find a doctor. The cousin took advantage of the girl\u2019s desperate situation. He might have told her that he would tell her mother if she did not let him \u201ctaste\u201d her at least once. The atmosphere at the time may be inferred from the black and white photos attached. They were taken ... by the cousin himself. Apparently, even from a young age, Ion C\u00e2rstea had unorthodox habits. After satisfying his needs, C\u00e2rstea remembered that in fact he could not help his cousin, and advised her to sell some jewellery in order to raise money for a doctor. To develop the photos, C\u00e2rstea appealed to a repeat student and amateur photographer ... \u201cIn your fourth or fifth year you will have an exam with me and won\u2019t pass\u201d C\u00e2rstea said, according to the photographer. The student gave in to the blackmail, but after developing only gave C\u00e2rstea 24 photos instead of 36. The gesture had its logic, because in 1990, when our student managed to proceed to the fifth year, C\u00e2rstea tried to raise the stakes, by asking for a non-reimbursable loan of 130 [German] marks to pass an exam. The student was upset and went to the prosecutor\u2019s office: \u201cI made a complaint to the prosecutor\u2019s office in [19]90, accusing him of blackmail. I submitted the relevant evidence, namely the first [set of] photos, because he later came to me with six more films, also porn ... the prosecutor said that we were dealing with a university professor and should leave him alone, not amplify the case.",

That would be another case of blackmail, because we heard that C\u00e2rstea\u2019s obsession with audio-video recordings remained unchanged ... As for the prosecutors who received a complaint from the blackmailed photographer, they were in no hurry to go to talk to the girl in the photos. That would have obliged them to open an investigation ex officio. Instead they sent the victim, the photographer-student, to take statements.

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private and family life, even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see Odi\u00e8vre v.

Spain, no. 34147/06, \u00a7 47, 21\u00a0September 2010).

On the contrary, in the current case, failing to identify and subsequently correctly summon the journalist who wrote the article, the domestic courts automatically regarded his sources as credible and assumed that he had acted in good faith (see paragraphs 13 and 16 above). In this respect the Court notes that, in the course of the proceedings before the domestic courts, no material was produced in order to support the allegations made in the article and no witnesses testified that the applicant was involved in the activities described by the journalist (see Lavric v. Romania, no. 22231/05, \u00a7 44, 14 January 2014).",

Norway, no. 28070/06, \u00a7 64, 9 April 2009, Mikolajov\u00e1 v.\u00a0 Slovakia, no. 4479/03, \u00a7 55, 18 January 2011 and Roberts and Roberts v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, (dec.), no. 38681/08, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 5 July 2011). In view of the above, the Court is therefore not convinced that the national courts attached the required importance to the questions whether the article contributed to a debate of general interest and whether the applicant should have been regarded as a public figure. It considers therefore that the national courts did not carefully balance the journalist\u2019s right to freedom of expression against the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life.",
