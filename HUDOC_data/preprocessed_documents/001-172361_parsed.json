However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State\u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions. To construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see Hornsby v. Greece, 19\u00a0March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II, and Burdov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 59498/00, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2002III).",

The judgment was subject to recognition and execution by the Armenian authorities. As K. did not comply with the terms of the agreement, the District Court issued a writ of execution and on 13 June 2005 the bailiff instituted enforcement proceedings. As the bailiff could find no other funds or property belonging to K., apart from a house she had inherited, the applicant instituted new proceedings against K. in order to have her ownership of the house legally recognised. On 24 October 2007 the District Court granted the applicant\u2019s claim and established K.\u2019s ownership of the house in question. Finally, in 2008 the applicant lodged a claim with the Administrative Court against the Real Estate Registry and the bailiff to oblige the former to register K.\u2019s ownership of the house and the latter to confiscate that house from her. On 1\u00a0December 2008 the Administrative Court accepted the applicant\u2019s claim in a final judgment.",
