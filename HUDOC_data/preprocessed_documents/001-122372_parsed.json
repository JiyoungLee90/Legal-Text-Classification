It noted that one of the court proceedings in which V.B. had been accused of beating the first applicant had been discontinued after the parties\u2019 settlement of the case, while another had been discontinued because of the expiry of the time-limit for imposing a fine. In one of the remaining four decisions it had been mentioned that the applicant herself had provoked V.B.\u2019s violence. The other three decisions were insufficient to prove systematic violent behaviour. Moreover, it had not been proved that V.B. suffered from alcohol or drug dependency. According to a certificate from the local apartment owners\u2019 association, V.B. had not been known for causing trouble. In addition, V.B. had proposed to the first applicant that they privatise the apartment and sell it so that they could buy separate apartments, but the first applicant had refused. The court also found that the parties could continue living in their apartment and that V.B. could take one of the rooms, leaving the two other rooms to the applicants. There would be no change to the common areas. The judgment was final.",

Almost a third of the women interviewed indicated having been subjected to multiple forms of violence. The study notes that domestic violence runs across lines of class and education; however, women with a higher level of education or economic status may tend not to disclose incidents of violence. Sexual violence remains the least reported form of violence. This may be due to lack of recognition of sexual abuse within the family as a wrongdoing or the fear among victims that they will be held responsible and become outcasts.",

In the present case, the authorities did not make an analysis of whether the seriousness and number of attacks which the first applicant had suffered on the part of V.B. and the seriousness of the first allegation of rape had required to pursue the criminal investigation, despite her withdrawal of that complaint. Moreover, despite a clear second allegation of an attempted rape on 21 August 2011, coupled with medical evidence at least partly confirming that allegation (see paragraph 16 above), it appears that the authorities did not institute of their own motion any investigation of that matter, again limiting themselves to administrative proceedings.",

The Court agrees with the first applicant\u2019s argument, also made before the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal (see paragraph 19 above), that allowing V.B. to live in the same apartment as his victim rendered ineffective other measures in the protection order and exposed her to the risk of further ill-treatment.",

To that end they are to maintain and apply in practice an adequate legal framework affording protection against acts of violence by private individuals (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 22 and 23; Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1993, \u00a7 36, Series A no.\u00a0247-C; D.P. and J.C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 38719/97, \u00a7 118, 10\u00a0October 2002; M.C. v. , no. 39272/98, \u00a7\u00a7 150 and 152, ECHR 2003XII; A v.
