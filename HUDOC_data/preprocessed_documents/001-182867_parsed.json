It stated that although the procedures relating to search and seizure of documents that were allegedly covered by legal professional privilege had not been solved expressly in the Code of Criminal Procedure, in practice Article 205 \u00a7 3 had been applied by analogy, in line with its decision of 14 October 1986 (Rt.\u00a01986 page 1149). By way of this analogy, such documents should not be immediately examined by the police. Instead they should first be submitted to the City Court for that court to decide whether they may in principle be seized (as had also been stated in Rt. 2008 page 645) \u2013 following which they would be made available to the prosecution for search \u2013 or whether they would be exempt from seizure due to legal professional privilege \u2013 following which they would be returned to the lawyer without having been searched. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, the primary competence to decide on seizures lay with the prosecuting authority; it was, accordingly, also for that authority to first search materials with respect to whether they could have evidentiary value. The court\u2019s examination of legal professional privilege was in reality a step in the search-process; only after the court\u2019s initial filtering had been completed could the prosecution authority begin its proper searching of the material for evidence.",

In these situations the City Court would also have to examine the relevance of the document as part of its examination of what should be made available to the prosecution. Lastly, the Supreme Court examined Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention. It had already (in Rt. 2008 page 158, where reference had been made to Sallinen and Others v. Finland, no. 50882/99, 27 September 2005) been established that Article 8 applied to searches and seizures of a lawyer\u2019s materials. As to the proportionality-test, the Supreme Court noted that the case before it concerned evidence in relation to a suspicion that a lawyer and a client had cooperated in serious financial crime. Even where the exception in Article\u00a0204 \u00a7 2 applied, it would not be a matter of making a complete exception from the duty of confidentiality, only from the rule that documents containing confidences between lawyers and clients could not be seized. It would be for the court to decide on which documents that were subject to legal professional privilege, and, where Article 204 \u00a7 2 applied, which documents that were to be seized.",

In a sphere covered by statutory law, the \u201claw\u201d is the enactment in force as the competent courts have interpreted it. Domestic law must further be compatible with the rule of law and accessible to the person concerned, and the person affected must be able to foresee the consequences of the domestic law for him or her (see, for example, Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, \u00a7 228, ECHR\u00a02015; and K.S. and M.S v. Germany, no. 33696/11, \u00a7 34, 6 October 2016). The Court reiterates, moreover, that in the context of searches and seizures, the domestic law must provide some protection to the individual against arbitrary interference with Article 8 rights. Thus, the domestic law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in and conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to any such measures (see Sallinen and Others, cited above, \u00a7 82). Furthermore, \u201c[g]iven that search and seizure represent a serious interference with rights protected under Article 8, they must be based on a law that is particularly precise\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 90).",

Moreover, the Court has previously acknowledged the importance of specific procedural guarantees when it comes to protecting the confidentiality of exchanges between lawyer and client and of legal professional privilege (see, inter alia, Sommer, cited above, \u00a7 56; and Michaud v. France, no. 12323/11, \u00a7 130, ECHR 2012). It has emphasised that, subject to strict supervision, it is possible to impose certain obligations on lawyers concerning their relations with their clients, for example in the event that there is plausible evidence of the lawyer\u2019s involvement in a crime and in the context of the fight against money-laundering. The Court has further elaborated that the Convention does not prevent domestic law allowing for searches of a lawyer\u2019s offices as long as proper safeguards are provided, for example the presence of a representative (or president) of a bar association (see, for example, Sommer, cited above, \u00a7 56; with references to Andr\u00e9 and Another v.

Furthermore, there is no information that the prosecuting authority may have overstepped any limits drawn up by that court in its decision. The Court cannot, accordingly, find that there have been any violations of Article 8 in this respect. The Court adds in passing that, as there was a reason for the indiscriminate collection of documents, namely that of protecting legal professional privilege, the case differs from that of Miailhe v.

However, this procedural error was subsequently rectified when the Supreme Court declared in Rt.\u00a02013 page 968 that the prosecuting authority\u2019s handling of those copies had not been lawful and that the courts should instead examine the material (see paragraphs 30-31 above) and, against that background, the Court cannot now find that the domestic authorities violated the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 8 for reason of this original mistake alone.",

In their submissions, the parties have not specifically focussed on this delay, which therefore is largely unexplained. However, the Court has also taken note of how the City Court in its letter of 11 May 2011 \u2013 of its own motion \u2013 set out that it would ensure an expedite inspection of the documents since considerable time had already passed (see paragraph 14 above). It is thus apparent that the City Court sought to compensate for the delay in the prosecuting authority\u2019s transmission of the material, and on 22 July 2011 \u2013 some six months after it had received the material \u2013 it stated that it was in the process of completing the work (see paragraph 15 above).",

Its decision was made on 11 May 2012 (ibid.), after slightly less than four months, and the applicant applied to the Court approximately one week thereafter (see paragraph 1 above). Furthermore, the Court notes that proceedings on the handing over of material to the prosecution continued at appellate levels after the complaint to the Court had been lodged (see paragraphs 25-28 above), in addition to other proceedings subsequently instigated by the applicant in order to have materials returned to him (see paragraphs 29-34 above).",

The proceedings subsequent to the City Court\u2019s decision on which documents that were to be made available to the prosecution authority, were not characterised by delays. The electronic documents were available to the applicant while the search process was ongoing, in so far as the hard disk and the laptop were returned to him two days after the initial search at his premises (see paragraph 9 above).
