The District Court was not wrong in believing this witness, who proved the defendant\u2019s guilt of the criminal acts. The testimony of the victim was not the only convincing evidence against the applicant on which the District Court based its conclusion about the defendant\u2019s guilt, since the defendant\u2019s criminal acts are also proved by a chain of indirect evidence corroborating the testimony of the victim and confirming the credibility of her statements. This includes, in particular, the testimony of her mother ... in whom the victim confided during a phone call on 6 June 2006 in which she described the defendant\u2019s actions, including the way he had tied her up in his apartment, threatened her and sent her threatening emails. The testimonies given by [C.] and her mother ... regarding the relevant facts correspond to the content of the criminal complaint filed by the victim at the police station in Surrey, United Kingdom ... on 7 June 2006. The defendant\u2019s complaint that the unreliability of the victim is proved by the fact that she did not confide earlier in her mother or a close female friend about his alleged behaviour is ill-founded: the evidence taken clearly shows that the victim and her mother did not previously have a particularly close relationship since she did not confide in her mother about her relationship with the defendant. This is understandable given that she was allegedly abused by the mother\u2019s partner (as the victim confided in the defendant). Furthermore, the victim was already back in the United Kingdom at the relevant time (as of 3 January 2006) and her contact with the defendant was conducted solely via mobile phone calls and email correspondence. In these circumstances, the behaviour of the victim appears rather logical and understandable, i.e. confiding in her mother and brother concerning the threats to their health and her life in an SMS message. ... The reliability of the victim and the veracity of her testimony is also corroborated by the emails included in the ... These emails, which were submitted to the police by the victim, correspond case file to her testimony as to the timeframe and the contents ... It is hardly possible for the Municipal Court to believe that the victim would systematically and for many months beforehand prepare all the evidence ... in order to be able to file a criminal complaint against the defendant. In addition to the above, the defendant\u2019s contacts with the victim (which he himself did not deny) and her reliability are also clearly shown in the defendant\u2019s affidavit of 2 June 2006 ..., in which the defendant declared he did not have any financial claims against the victim. Finally, one should not disregard the statement of an impartial witness ... namely the victim\u2019s psychotherapist, who confirmed that the victim came to her because of relational problems with the defendant, confided in her about having been held by the defendant against her will and driven off somewhere in his car, and about his emails threatening to harm her if she left him. All this indirect evidence is interrelated and consistent with the victim\u2019s testimony. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s complaint concerning the unreliability of the victim is ill-founded ... As a result, the District Court correctly believed the testimony given by the victim in relation to this matter, considering her testimony in general to be credible ...",

According to the Government, the procedure had been fully justified in this case because the witness had been residing abroad on a long-term basis in her place of work and, according to her statement, had no intention of coming back to the Czech Republic in the foreseeable future. Consequently, it had been impossible to summons the witness properly before the District Court and secure her questioning in person, even though the District Court had made significant efforts to do so. Moreover, C.\u2019s residence abroad had also been motivated by her wish to avoid any confrontation with the applicant which was plausible, taking into account the circumstances of the present case. Moreover, according to the expert opinion concerning the applicant\u2019s personality, the applicant displayed aspects of instability, passive aggression and excessive persecution.

In the present case, the request by the police to the prosecutor to apply this measure contained a very detailed justification, explaining that the applicant had forcibly coerced C. in the Czech Republic as well as in the United Kingdom where she had been living and working and that she had returned to the Czech Republic for the purpose of the interview, where she did not feel safe given the prior events (see paragraph 12 above). The Court further notes that the conduct of the investigation at this early stage, including recourse to the measures under Article 158a of the CCP was entirely within the hands of the police and prosecutor. However, C.\u2019s interview was conducted in the presence and under the supervision of a judge. While this is not in itself a substitute for the defendant\u2019s right to examine those who accused him (see Tseber, cited above, \u00a7 62), and does not compensate for the failure to have recourse to international legal assistance where a witness resided abroad and such mechanisms were available (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7121), the Court considers that, by ensuring the lawfulness of the procedures followed by the police, it constituted one of the procedural safeguards for the right of a fair trial.",

However, just as in B\u00e1t\u011bk and Others, the national authorities applied the standard that as long as the witness is abroad, it is impossible for his or her statements to be reproduced at the trial. When you think that this dismissive attitude takes place in relation to witnesses residing in another member State of the European Union, within which judicial cooperation should be effective, we believe that our concerns are very much justified.",
