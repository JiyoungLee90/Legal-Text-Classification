To control the crowd, a police cordon forced the protestors to remain within the barriers. There were numerous clashes between the police and protesters.

It does not appear from any submissions that the applicants were among those responsible for the initial acts of aggression which contributed to the deterioration of the protest\u2019s originally peaceful character. As regards the breaking through the police cordon imputed to the applicants, they denied having pushed through the cordon, and even if the applicants found themselves beyond the cordon, there is no evidence that it had been the result of their deliberate effort. According to the material in the case file, the cordon rupture had resulted from the pressure of the crowd which had built up because of the unexpected and unannounced change by the authorities of the venue layout (see also Frumkin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 113-16 and 132). Apart from that, the applicants\u2019 behaviour remained strictly peaceful, including the chanting of political slogans by the first applicant. The Court therefore considers that the applicants enjoyed the protection of Article 11 in the present case.",

At the same time, the applicants were not arrested and sanctioned for breaching the rules on public assembly. Even if their presence at the meeting venue after its closure were to be considered as a manifestation of their objection to the termination of the protest, that was not the offence with which they were charged.

In the overall context of clashes between the police and protesters that happened at Bolotnaya Square, it was incumbent on the domestic courts to establish whether the first applicant had indeed participated in breaking the police cordon. Moreover, other acts imputed to him included chanting anti-government slogans, which were peaceful and constituted protest, a form of expression protected by Article 10 of the Convention (see Taranenko v. Russia, no. 19554/05, \u00a7 70, 15 May 2014). The domestic courts did not take into account that if the first applicant had overstayed the allocated time-slot, he had done so in connection with the exercise of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. Quite to the contrary, they penalised him for the political message he intended to express by his presence at the venue and by chanting non-violent political slogans (see Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, \u00a7 178).",

The Court notes that even if, according to the authorities, the second applicant was arrested at 8.10 p.m., the description of his offence (see paragraph 19 above) sits ill with the fact that the venue had been fully cleared of all protestors by 7.30 p.m. (see paragraph 7 above).
