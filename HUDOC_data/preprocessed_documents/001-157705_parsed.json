The problems mainly stem from the interpretation of Article 5 of the law. This Article provides for a \u201cnotification\u201d procedure before convening an assembly. In 2006, the Venice Commission welcomed the confirmation by representatives of the Government that the requirement in the law was for notification and not for a prior permission to hold the assembly, noting that \u201cother provisions of the Law could, as they currently stand, encourage the competent authorities to issue a blanket prohibition as soon as the notification process proves incomplete.\u201d In 2007, the Venice Commission added that a system of notification is in itself admissible so long as it is only meant to help the authorities cope more easily with the practical problems involved with the holding of an assembly; it also stressed that it is indeed important that assemblies can be held with a presumption of legality so as to avoid any chilling effect on organisers and participants.",

The term \u201crestrictions\u201d in Article 11 \u00a7 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, \u00a7 39, Series A no. 202). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see B\u0105czkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, \u00a7\u00a7 66-68, 3\u00a0May 2007). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to interference as well (see Djavit An v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 20652/92, \u00a7\u00a7 5962, ECHR 2003III). So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 30, ECHR\u00a02006XIII, and Hyde Park and Others v.

Also, the Law vested it with the rights to restrict or change the place, route and/or time of a gathering, and to designate specific areas for public assemblies (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above). A number of international reports have stressed that a system of notification set forth by the Constitution has been replaced in practice by a system of authorisation (see paragraphs 40-42 above). The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe in his Report of 6 August 2013 stated, in particular, that \u201cpeaceful protesters have ... been effectively banned from demonstrating in central Baku since 2006, despite advanced notification of the assemblies\u201d (see paragraph 41 above).

In such circumstances, reference by the authorities to Article 310.1 of the CAO as a ground for the applicant\u2019s arrest and conviction appears to be unsubstantiated. Despite being formally charged with failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, the applicant in fact was arrested and convicted for his participation in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration. The Court notes that at the material time, no penalty in the form of deprivation of liberty was provided for under the CAO for participating in an unauthorised public assembly or generally for violation of rules on holding public assemblies. Nevertheless, the applicant was sentenced to five days\u2019 \u201cadministrative\u201d detention on charges that he \u201chad failed to stop participating in the unauthorised demonstration\u201d.

This Convention provision speaks of \u201cassistance\u201d and not of \u201cnomination\u201d: mere nomination does not ensure effective assistance, since a lawyer may be prevented from providing such assistance for various practical reasons, or shirk his or her duties. A State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes. However, if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or is sufficiently brought to the authorities\u2019 attention in some other way, the authorities must take steps to ensure that the accused effectively enjoys the right to legal assistance (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7\u00a7 33-37, Series A no. 37, and Kamasinski v.\u00a0Austria, 19 December 1989, \u00a7 65, Series A no. 168). Moreover, where it is clear that the lawyer representing the accused before the domestic court has not had the time and facilities to organise a proper defence, the court should take positive measures to ensure that the lawyer is given an opportunity to fulfil his obligations in the best possible conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, \u00a7\u00a031, Series A no. 76).\u00a0The Court notes that a State-funded lawyer joined the proceedings at the trial stage; it is not clear whether, before the opening of the first-instance court hearing, he was afforded the time and facilities to organise a proper defence. However, the Court observes that during the hearing the State-funded lawyer did not submit any written objections, complaints or motions on the applicant\u2019s behalf. His oral submissions consisted of a brief repetition of the applicant\u2019s statement and a request addressed to the court to consider the applicant\u2019s age and the fact that he had children. These circumstances give reason to believe that the representation by the State-funded lawyer was of a formalistic nature.\u00a0Furthermore, the Court of Appeal failed to reply to the applicant\u2019s complaints about lack of effective legal assistance both at the pre-trial proceedings and at the first-instance court hearing.",

Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see Bozano v.

While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute \u201carbitrariness\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis (see Mooren v.

While he was formally charged with failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, the applicant was in fact detained for his participation in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration (see paragraphs 56 and 62 above). Furthermore, there are sufficient elements to conclude that the domestic courts that imposed the administrative detention also acted arbitrarily in reviewing both the factual and the legal grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention. They failed to examine whether the police had invoked the correct legal basis for the applicant\u2019s arrest or to examine the legality of the police\u2019s interference with the demonstration (see paragraph\u00a086 above). In such circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty as a whole was arbitrary and therefore contrary to the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
