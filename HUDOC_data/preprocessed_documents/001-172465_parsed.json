However, Article 2 cannot be interpreted so as to impose a requirement on the authorities to launch a prosecution irrespective of the evidence which is available. A prosecution, particularly on such a serious charge as involvement in unlawful killings, should never be embarked upon lightly, as the impact on a defendant who comes under the weight of the criminal justice system is considerable, being held up to public obloquy, with all the attendant repercussions on reputation and private, family and professional life. Given the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, it can never be assumed that a particular person is so tainted with suspicion that the standard of evidence to be applied is an irrelevance. Rumour and gossip are a dangerous basis on which to base any steps that can potentially devastate a person\u2019s life (compare to Pali\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a065, where the Court held that the investigation was effective, despite the fact that there had not been any convictions; G\u00fcrtekin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 27; Mujkanovi\u0107 and Others v.

The Court accepts that obstacles in the investigation into the killings during the war and post-war recovery were attributable to the overall situation in Croatia, a newly independent and post-war State which needed time to organise its apparatus and for its officials to gain experience (compare to Pali\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 70, 15 February 2011; and Nje\u017ei\u0107 and \u0160timac, cited above, \u00a7 71).",

A further global measure by the State Attorney\u2019s Office occurred in October 2008 when it instructed the County State Attorney\u2019s Offices to favour impartial investigation of all war crimes, irrespective of the ethnicity of those involved (see paragraph\u00a012 above).

Further to this, the investigation in the present case has not been closed and were any new leads to be discovered, the investigation could at any time be resumed.
