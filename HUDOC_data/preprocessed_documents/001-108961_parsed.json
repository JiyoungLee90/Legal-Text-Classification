The Court observes that on 27 January 2003 the Industrialniy District Court authorised the applicant\u2019s detention, finding that the gravity of the charges against him and his presenting a danger to society in view of his mental illness warranted the deprivation of liberty. On 18 February 2003 the District Court found that the applicant had committed extortion. It, however, concluded that the applicant\u2019s mental illness precluded him from bearing criminal responsibility and serving a sentence. He was to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for compulsory treatment. Accordingly, the Court considers that the detention of the applicant from 27 January to 18\u00a0February 2003 falls within Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention as it was effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on criminal charges based, as was not disputed by the parties, on a reasonable suspicion of his having committed the offences he was charged with. In turn, the period from 18 February to 18\u00a0August 2003 falls within subparagraph (a) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as it resulted from a \u201cconviction\u201d by a \u201ccompetent court\u201d. Furthermore, as follows from the Government\u2019s submissions, since the applicant \u2013 who was suffering from a mental disorder \u2013 was to be detained after 27 January 2003 in a psychiatric institution, his detention starting from that date until 18 August 2003 also falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) of the Convention (see, for similar reasoning, Erkalo, cited above, \u00a7 51, and Morsink v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a048865/99, \u00a7 62, 11 May 2004).",

The applicant lodged his application with the Court on 21 August 2003 \u2013 that is, more than six months after the first period of detention came to an end on 18\u00a0February 2003. He, however, challenged the grounds for his detention during the first period by lodging an appeal statement before the . The appeal was never examined (see paragraph 28 above). The applicant was not apprised of the outcome of the appeal proceedings and he was not served with any decision explaining the reason for the Regional Court\u2019s silence. In fact, he only learned about the fate of his appeal from the Government\u2019s submissions. In those circumstances, the Court considers that the later date should be regarded as the final decision for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The applicant, therefore, has not failed to comply with the six-month requirement and his complaint concerning the lawfulness of his detention from 27 January to 18\u00a0February 2003 cannot be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",

However, since under Article 5 \u00a7 1 failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether the law has been complied with (see N.C. v. Italy, no.\u00a024952/94, \u00a7\u00a042, 11 January 2001, with further references). The Court notes that the Government did not indicate any legal provision that permitted the District Court to simultaneously issue two decisions authorising the applicant\u2019s detention in a psychiatric hospital and in an ordinary detention facility. The Government also did not argue that it was possible under domestic law to alter the operative part of a detention order after it has been read out in open court. In these circumstances, the Court is bound to conclude that the situation created by the District Court on 27\u00a0January 2003 left the applicant in a state of uncertainty as to the legal basis for his detention, a state incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see, mutatis mutandis, Shukhardin v. , no. 65734/01, \u00a7\u00a084, 28 June 2007, and, by contrast, Douiyeb v. the  [GC], no. 31464/96, \u00a7 52, 4\u00a0August 1999). Without speculating on the motives which drove the presiding judge to amend the operative part of the detention order, the Court is mindful of the Government\u2019s submission that there was no psychiatric institution in the Perm Region suitable for detention of individuals such as the applicant (see paragraph 64 above). However, whatever the reasons on which the presiding judge\u2019s decision to amend the detention order of 27\u00a0January 2003 was based, the Court finds that his actions were arbitrarily disregarding the fundamental principle of fairness.",

The Court reiterates the Government\u2019s argument that pending the transfer of the applicant to a psychiatric hospital he had been kept in a cell for mentally ill inmates in detention facility no. 1. The Government did not explain the difference in detention arrangements in a cell for mentally ill detainees and from that of a regular cell of the detention facility. Further, they did not argue that the applicant had received either regular medical attention in respect of his illness or that the conditions of his detention had constituted a therapeutic environment. Given this fact, the Court considers that the cell where the applicant was detained could not be regarded as an institution appropriate for the detention of persons of unsound mind (see, for similar reasoning, Aerts v. Belgium, 30 July 1998, \u00a7 49, Reports 1998V).",

At the same time, the Court has stressed that a reasonable balance must be struck between the competing interests involved. On this point, reiterating the importance of Article 5 in the Convention system, the Court has been of the opinion that in striking this balance particular weight should be given to the applicant\u2019s right to liberty, taking into account that a significant delay in admission to a custodial clinic and thus the beginning of the treatment of the person concerned would obviously affect the prospects of the treatment\u2019s success. In particular, the Court has found that, in the absence of exceptional and unforeseeable grounds, a delay of six months in the admission of a person to a custodial clinic was impermissible (see Brand, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066).",

It cannot find that, in the circumstances of the present case, a reasonable balance was struck.

Without encroaching on the State\u2019s right to determine an appropriate psychiatric institution for the applicant, the Court cannot accept the authorities\u2019 determination, for such a long period and despite the impossibility of obtaining a Lithuanian transit visa, to admit the applicant to a hospital in . The Court is particularly mindful of the absence of an argument on the Government\u2019s part that other hospitals in  were unable to accommodate the applicant. It further goes without saying that the authorities\u2019 failure to comply with the rather pedestrian task of serving the applicant with appropriate identification papers cannot be accepted as grounds for delaying the applicant\u2019s placement in hospital.",

It is therefore of the opinion that a delay of six months in the admission of the applicant to a psychiatric hospital cannot be regarded as acceptable. To hold otherwise would entail a serious weakening of the fundamental right to liberty to the detriment of the person concerned and thus impair the very essence of the right protected by Article 5 of the Convention (see Morsink, cited above, \u00a7 69).",

It observes that this legal provision only identifies those with the standing to appeal against a decision by which a trial court has authorised the compulsory psychiatric treatment of a defendant who had committed a crime and whom the trial court has found unable to bear criminal responsibility and to serve a sentence on account of mental illness (see paragraph 45 above). The Government did not rely on any other provision curtailing the applicant\u2019s right to state his case as regards the deprivation of his liberty before an appeal court. The Court therefore finds that it was open to the applicant under Russian law to personally lodge an appeal against the detention order of 27\u00a0January 2003 (see paragraph 42 above).",

However, his appeal was never examined.\u00a0 The Court would like to reiterate that Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention requires that certain procedural rights of a detained person must be respected. These need not be the same as the guarantees of \u201ca fair hearing\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention and they should take account of the possibility, in the context of the deprivation of liberty of persons of unsound mind, that those persons may be personally incapable of using their procedural rights. Accordingly, the prescribed minimum must ensure that that the mentally ill person has access to the courts and the opportunity to be heard either in person, if possible, or through a legal representative, where his condition demands this (see Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7\u00a060). The Court is prepared to tolerate certain limitations on the exercise of this right where justified by the circumstances (see, for instance, X. v. Belgium, no.\u00a06692/74, Commission decision of 13\u00a0March 1975, Decisions and Reports (DR) 2, p.\u00a0108, concerning the introduction of a time limit on applications for release). In the present case, the Government did not cite any justification, apart from the applicant\u2019s mental illness, for the court\u2019s silence towards his appeal against the detention order. However, it would be inconceivable, in the opinion of the Court, that Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention should afford procedural guarantees to a party whose detention matter is pending before a court without also protecting what makes it in fact possible to benefit from such guarantees \u2013 that is, the possibility to access the court by making an application to review the lawfulness of the detention. The effective and expeditious characteristics of judicial review of the lawfulness of detention are of no value at all if there are no judicial proceedings. The Court will not accept the state of mind of a detained person, on its own, as an implied and blanket limitation on his right to institute judicial review proceedings for the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, particularly so when, as in the present case, no assessment of his ability to be personally involved in the proceedings leading to his detention was performed by the court and no formal court decision explaining the reasons behind the refusal to examine the appeal was issued. The importance of what is at stake \u2013 personal liberty \u2013 compels this conclusion.",

The State is under an obligation to secure the attendance of an accused who is in custody (see, mutatis mutandis, Goddi v. , 9 April 1984, \u00a7\u00a029, Series A no. 76). It is of capital importance that a defendant appear, both because of his right to a hearing and because of the need to verify the accuracy of his statements and compare them with those of witnesses (see Van Geyseghem v.  [GC], no. 26103/95, \u00a7 33, ECHR 1999I).

Denmark (dec.), no. 28972/95, p.\u00a0351, ECHR 1999-V). However, where proceedings involve an assessment of the personality and character of the accused and his state of mind at the time of the offence and where their outcome could be of major detriment to him, it is essential to the fairness of the proceedings that he be present at the hearing and afforded the opportunity to participate in it together with his counsel (see Kremzow v. Austria, 21 September 1993, \u00a7 67, Series A no.\u00a0268-B; Pobornikoff v. Austria, no. 28501/95, \u00a7 31, 3\u00a0October 2000; and Zana v.

The Court also observes the Government\u2019s submissions that the loss of legal capacity by the applicant, either on 20 February or 6 May 2003, resulted in the domestic courts\u2019 decision not to bring him to the hearings. The Government later amended their claim, arguing that the applicant\u2019s procedural rights, including that to a hearing, were automatically transferred to his mother and lawyer following his being declared mentally ill by the psychiatrists from the Serbskiy Centre in November 2002. While noting that it was not until 6\u00a0May 2003, i.e. almost a month after the termination of the criminal proceedings, that the applicant was pronounced legally incapacitated (see paragraph 34 above), the Court considers this to have no bearing on the case. It believes that, although not having an absolute character, the right of being heard enjoys such a prominent place in a democratic society and has such a fundamental value for the protection of an individual against arbitrariness on the part of public authorities, that the mere fact of the individual suffering from a mental illness, as well as his being declared legally incapacitated, cannot automatically lead to the exclusion of the exercise of that right altogether. It is the very weakness of a mentally ill defendant which should enhance the need for supporting his rights. In this context, authorities must show requisite diligence in ensuring the accused\u2019s right to be present in an effective manner and must act particularly carefully when infringing upon that right, so as not to place the mentally ill at a disadvantage when compared with other defendants who do enjoy such a right (see, mutatis mutandis, F.C.B. v. Italy, 28 August 1991, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 208B). The Court is not convinced that the Russian courts complied with that responsibility in the present case.",

The Court does not believe that this meeting was sufficient for the District Court to decide that his attendance at the trial hearings was undesirable. The absence of a formal decision dealing with the issue of the applicant\u2019s attendance also does not escape the Court\u2019s attention. Furthermore, the applicant never appeared before the appeal court judges.

Their argument that the applicant\u2019s presence was not required purely on the grounds of his being a mentally disturbed person is striking, given that it was for the courts to determine whether he had committed the offence in a deranged state of mind and to assess whether his mental condition required compulsory medical care (see, Romanov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 63993/00, \u00a7\u00a0109, 20 October 2005). The Court strongly believes that sentencing decisions concerning placement or treatment for mental disorder should be made by courts on the basis of valid and reliable standards of medical expertise and after taking into consideration the need for persons with a mental disorder to be treated in a place appropriate for their health needs. The Court considers that in a situation where the trial court was unconvinced by the expert findings of the Serbskiy Centre, considered another psychiatric examination of the applicant a necessity, but did not receive the results of the new expert assessment in time for conviction (see paragraph 31 above), it was particularly important that the judges should hear the applicant in person and be satisfied as to his condition. In view of what was at stake for the applicant the courts could not, if the criminal proceedings were to be fair, have decided on his case without observing the applicant\u2019s demeanour and directly assessing the evidence submitted by him. The presence of the applicant\u2019s lawyer and mother could not compensate for the applicant\u2019s inability to state his own case by appearing before the court (see, for similar reasoning, Romanov, cited above, \u00a7 112, and, mutatis mutandis, Mamedova v. Russia, no.\u00a07064/05, 1 June 2006, and Duda v. Poland, no. 67016/01, 19\u00a0December 2006).",
