Then the State appealed against some of the judgments before the Court of Audit, sitting as a full court. In order to fill the gap existing in the legislation in force at that time, the legislator adopted Law No.\u00a02512/1997, which interpreted certain provisions relating to civil and military retirement pensions. Law No.\u00a02512/1997 did not intend to apply in the proceedings instituted by the applicant. Its provisions were of a general and objective character and aimed merely at regulating similar situations which had already arisen or could arise in the future. Its retroactive effect was necessary to meet the legislator\u2019s will in this respect.
