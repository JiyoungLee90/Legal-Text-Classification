One of the factors, which drove the Court to that conclusion, was the limited period of validity of each decree imposing the special regime (no. 25498/94, \u00a7\u00a7 9496, ECHR\u00a02000X; see also Enea v.

Even if these examples were taken from decided cases \u2013 and this is not clear from the aforesaid paragraph 17 \u2013 there is nothing in these examples which could even remotely justify, by application of the eiusdem generis principle, the conclusion that detaching part of a ribbon and disposing of it in the manner described in paragraphs 8 and 9 amounts to offensive behaviour or to a breach of the peace, or to action or actions which disturb public order, as contemplated in the above-mentioned Article 173. There was no \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d element in the applicant\u2019s conduct; and even if it was \u201ca provocative gesture likely to disturb or insult some of the many people who witnessed it\u201d, which I do not believe to be the case, it certainly did not amount to a breach of the peace (actual or reasonably apprehended) or to a disturbance of public order.
