In particular, she submitted that she could not have been brought to the police station at 11.10 p.m. as alleged by the Government because the medical certificate confirmed that at 10.45 a.m. she was provided with medical assistance at the police station. In this connection she noted that a representative from the police station had also confirmed in the domestic proceedings that she had been provided with medical assistance at the police station.

What is at stake here is not only the \u201cright to liberty\u201d but also the \u201cright to security of person\u201d (see, among other authorities, Bozano\u00a0v.\u00a0, 18 December 1986, \u00a7 54, Series A no. 111, and Wassink\u00a0v. the Netherlands, 27 September 1990, \u00a7 24, Series A no. 185A).

In this connection, the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that such a record was not compiled because the applicant was not arrested in an administrative sense, as the Court had already found that the applicant had been deprived of her liberty on 19 November 2010 (see paragraph 102 above). Moreover, the Government\u2019s argument was contradicted by the letter of 30 November 2010 from the Head of Nasimi District Police Station No. 22 who implicitly confirmed the applicant\u2019s administrative arrest, indicating that the applicant\u2019s detention at the police station had not exceeded the three-hour period provided for by law (see paragraph 34 above). In fact, this period of three hours corresponded precisely to the time limit for an administrative arrest under domestic law (see paragraph 77 above).",
