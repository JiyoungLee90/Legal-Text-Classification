The court found it curious that the applicant had given a detailed explanation as to the origin of each item, and yet a number of the victims of the thefts had identified the objects as belonging to them. During the investigation stage the applicant had admitted to the police that because of his fascination with antiques, he would purchase items even though he would have been aware that they had been stolen. During the proceedings, other than declaring that such statements were false, the applicant did not contest the statements or explain why he had made them in such detail and precision, and why he eventually showed the police where the items were kept. The police also confirmed that such statements had been made. Moreover, the court observed that, even though the applicant was a coin collector, the fact that he had been found in possession of tools for melting down metals such as silver and of a number of pieces of silver bullion did not favour his credibility. Furthermore, although not all the items stolen had been found in the applicant\u2019s possession, in the court\u2019s view it was curious that all the items found had been connected with specific, well-organised thefts, where it was clear that the robbers knew what they were looking for and were well aware of where they would place the merchandise. Indeed, the court had no doubt that the applicant had been aware of the illicit origins of the items in his possession. It sentenced him to five years\u2019 imprisonment.",

It affirmed the applicant\u2019s innocence in respect of the theft charges, as there had not been a shred of evidence in that respect, and it reversed the part of the judgment concerning the majority of the remaining charges of receiving stolen goods (see below for detail). It disagreed with the first-instance court\u2019s conclusion that the applicant could not but have been a receiver of stolen goods on the ground that since a number of people had recognised the items they could not all have been lying, and therefore it must have been the applicant who was wrong and was therefore responsible. The Criminal Court of Appeal observed that the applicant was a collector of and dealer in antiques, who appeared to purchase any item of interest without enquiring in detail into its legitimate origins. It appeared, from both the case file and the fact that certain items had been hidden, that the applicant was aware that some items had previously been stolen. However, the appeal court considered that the applicant should not suffer prejudice as a result of his inability to prove the origins of certain items, since this was a result of negligence on the part of the police, who had lost the relevant documentation (and some of the items). Moreover, no inferences could be drawn from the fact that he possessed certain tools, as it was normal for a coin collector to melt down coins which had become worthless. Examining the records of the proceedings, the court concluded that the crime of receiving stolen goods had only been proved in respect of objects of antiquarian value stolen from three specific venues, A., B., and C., (during two burglaries) and found in the applicant\u2019s possession. His sentence was in consequence reduced to a two-year suspended sentence.",

Thus, contrary to the applicant\u2019s testimony, it could be inferred that certain objects had not come into the applicant\u2019s possession by proper means. Although the court was convinced that the applicant had been involved in the antiques trade for a number of years, he had not been able to put forward any evidence in relation to the items at issue or any detail as to his trade. By contrast, the claimants had identified as theirs the items which had previously been stolen. The court thus, having to choose between the two versions, opted for that of the claimants. The court considered that the fact that numerous people had been to the police station and identified various objects of which they claimed to be the owners and which had been seized from the applicant\u2019s house was enough evidence to discredit the applicant\u2019s testimony.",

From the evidence submitted it appeared that the claimants had suffered two burglaries at venue P. and that the police had seized some of the stolen items from the applicant, amongst many other items identified by various third parties as theirs. While the applicant was able to show that he had been a collector since his youth, he had not managed to prove ownership of the relevant items. As to their origin, he vaguely mentioned names of individuals, some of whom were deceased. He referred to receipts which were currently with the police and which could not be exhibited to the court. The applicant submitted declarations by individuals with whom he had traded. As to his trading, however, it appeared that the applicant had not hesitated to purchase items with dubious or suspicious, if not illicit, origins. Indeed, the applicant had been investigated and various items found in his possession had been seized. The origins of the items gave rise to more than a simple suspicion that they had not been acquired legitimately. According to police officer G., the applicant had even admitted this. During the criminal proceedings G. had been asked whether the applicant had admitted to the theft and the police officer had replied \u201cyes\u201d. G. further stated that the applicant had referred to the dishonest purchase of a sofa (\u201cDan mhux bis-sewwa\u201d) and had only shown receipts in respect of certain items in connection with which the applicant had been charged, but not all of them. In that light, the court was not satisfied that the applicant had submitted sufficient proof to show that he was the owner of the said items. Moreover, the fact that numerous people, apart from the applicant, had claimed to be the owners of the items did not suffice to support the view that the applicant was the owner.",

In his testimony he gave the names of people from whom he had purchased each item. He also submitted a receipt dated 1983, the year of the burglary, which indicated that he had bought a number of objects for the sum of 8,800 Maltese liri (MTL, approximately 20,500 euros (EUR)) from a certain S.A. Nevertheless, the court considered the claimants\u2019 version to be more reliable, as it was corroborated by photos and other witnesses. Moreover, police officer G. had testified that the applicant had stated that various items seized from his house \u201chad not been purchased honestly\u201d and this could not but weaken the applicant\u2019s testimony.

Indeed, during the criminal proceedings G. had testified, inter alia, that \u201cat no time had the applicant stated that he had stolen the items from here or there, but he had mentioned that he had bought certain items from T., and that he knew about their dubious origins (kienu \u0121ejjin bil-\u0127azin)\u201d.

However, all the evidence advanced indicated the probability that the relevant items belonged to the claimant\u2019s heirs \u2013 they had been stolen from venue BC, and had been identified by the claimants, even though third parties had also claimed ownership of some of the items. Although the applicant had testified under oath that he had purchased the items legally, his testimony had not been consistent and had lacked veracity. In particular, he had given the impression that he was a trader in antiques and that he had traded with various lawyers, but when questioned in respect of each of them, it transpired that he had not bought any of the items relevant to the case.

Neither could the applicant submit receipts for those purchases, giving as the reason for this that they had been seized by the police and were being held as evidence in the criminal proceedings against him.

Indeed, the applicant had not denied that the items could have been previously owned by the claimants. During the criminal investigations the applicant had admitted that he had previously purchased stolen items. The declarations used in the criminal proceedings were exhibited before the court and the applicant only contended that police officer G. had invented certain things. Having re-read the witness statements, the experts took the view that the applicant rarely acquired items lawfully and in good faith. He actually was perfectly well aware of their dubious origins, as he was told by the sellers that the items had been stolen. This could not be ignored, especially as the applicant never stated that he had sale receipts for the relevant items. The items were found in his possession, he did not remember from whom he had bought them and he had no receipts. In consequence, it could not be said that he had purchased them in good faith. The court held that the applicant\u2019s statements used in the criminal proceedings were admissible evidence (Article 632 (1) of the Code of Organisation and Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe COCP\u201d \u2013 see Relevant Domestic Law below)). Officer G. presented five statements made by the applicant during the investigation, and the applicant explained which parts of those statements he agreed with and which parts he contested. The court considered that in doing so the applicant was picking and choosing, and yet there existed contradictions. For example, in one statement the applicant said that he had purchased two chalices from a taxi driver, and he subsequently confirmed that statement. In another statement he repeated this in more detail and subsequently stated that he had never made such a statement. At a later date he repeated the story, but differently, saying that he had bought more items. The court noted that the taxi driver had not been called as a witness to corroborate the applicant\u2019s version. While the applicant stated that he had purchased the items from various persons, only one of those persons had been called as a witness and the latter only testified to the effect that the applicant had an interest in antiques. Another witness confirmed that the applicant was also a moneylender. Indeed, the applicant submitted a number of documents in evidence of this, but did not submit any evidence in relation to the origins of the items at issue. The court therefore concluded from the totality of the evidence that the claimants had been burgled, that they had identified the stolen items, and that the applicant had not proved that he had acquired the items in good faith. The court found it of particular relevance that in one of the applicant\u2019s statements, which he did not contradict, he had said \u201cwhen I see an antique, whatever it may be ... I go blind. I want it for myself in order to be able to take pleasure in looking at it\u201d. Thus, the court considered that any other comment would be superfluous. The court found in the applicant the very image of a receiver of stolen goods (ricettatur).",

Indeed, it had been shown that the bullion seized from the applicant was home-made and not pure. Thus, although there was no proof that the applicant had stolen the items, there was sufficient proof to hold that the claimants were indeed the owners of the relevant items, that those items had been in the applicant\u2019s possession in bad faith and that the applicant had previously melted down silver. Indeed, both the bullion and the tools for making it had been found in his possession. The applicant gave an explanation about the bullion, but it was not corroborated by any witness statement. The applicant gave no credible explanation for the clearly home-made bullion. It was therefore very probable that objects stolen from the claimants and acquired in bad faith had, together with other items, been melted down to hide their identity. The court further highlighted, of its own accord, the absence of corroboration as regards the bullion, and the presence of tools used to melt down silver. Thus, the claimants\u2019 case had been made out on the balance of probabilities. The applicant was therefore liable for damages because he had been in possession of stolen goods and because of the damage he had caused by melting down such items. The amount of damages was fixed at MTL 64,870 (approximately EUR 151,100).",

It held, however, that the applicant could not be ordered to return items which were no longer in his possession. It further considered that Article 632 (1) of the COCP (see Relevant Domestic Law below) applied to the statements made by the applicant during the criminal investigation, even though they had not been signed by him. It sufficed that officer G. had witnessed those statements being made by the applicant for them to be admissible in evidence. It was for the first-instance court to assess them and reach its conclusions. Moreover, Article 6 of the Criminal Code (see Relevant Domestic Law below) did not imply that evidence used in criminal proceedings could not be used in analogous civil proceedings. Furthermore, the applicant had not objected to the use of that evidence before the firstinstance court. Having examined in detail the evidence produced, the Court of Appeal further considered that the first-instance court had not made an incorrect assessment and that it would therefore not interfere with its finding. It found it pertinent to point out that the fact that only eleven silver bars had been found in the applicant\u2019s possession, despite the fact that the items melted down should have amounted to many more bars, was not a thesis favourable to the applicant. Indeed, the applicant could easily have disposed of the other bars resulting from the melted-down items before the police found the bars. He was, thus, responsible for the damage caused by the melting down of the items, in accordance with the estimates provided by the expert. Any difficulties in evaluating the original items were of the applicant\u2019s own making, as it had been his choice to melt them down.",

In the context of the applicant\u2019s various complaints, it held that the civil proceedings against the applicant had not amounted to a repetition of the criminal proceedings, as the intention of the civil proceedings had not been to find whether the applicant was guilty of any charge, but solely to secure the return of the property to its owners and, where that was not possible, to determine the level of compensation due. Moreover, the different proceedings were not comparable in relation to the burden of proof required. Indeed, each of the proceedings was capable of resulting in different findings of responsibility, including findings which conflicted with each other. The court noted that in the civil proceedings the applicant had not been found guilty of any crime. The civil courts had assessed the evidence in relation to the complainants\u2019 ownership rights to the property against the applicant\u2019s explanation as to how the items had been found in his possession, within the relevant parameters of civil proceedings of that nature. Considering the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, it held that the provision could not be applicable, since the applicant was no longer accused of a criminal offence, and his complaints were directed against civil proceedings which, save for one, had also been concluded. At a later stage, in relation to Article 6 \u00a7 2, the court also considered that the conclusions reached by the civil courts were based on a proper assessment of evidence which did not violate the applicant\u2019s presumption of innocence. Those conclusions were based on the principle of juxta allegata et probata (delivering a judgment on the basis of what has been alleged and proved), as expected in this type of proceedings. The court considered that the applicant\u2019s case could not be compared to any of the cases cited by him under Article 6 \u00a7 2 concerning the request of acquitted applicants for compensation for detention, and therefore the principles enunciated therein did not apply.",

During criminal proceedings various rules played in favour of the accused, who might be found innocent simply because there was not sufficient evidence. This should not deny any third party the possibility of access to court to obtain relevant redress on the basis of a different burden of proof. The applicant had been cleared of all charges except those of receiving certain goods stolen from certain properties. However, that did not mean that the items in question, found in the applicant\u2019s possession, were his own. The civil proceedings instituted by individuals claiming certain items against the possessor were independent of the defendant\u2019s good or bad faith. The Court of Appeal had in each case found for the claimants, after considering that the latter had proved that they were the owners of the stolen items and that the applicant had not proved his ownership. The cases had dealt solely with the establishment of the ownership of the items, and nothing more, and if the outcome was that the items were not his own, then he was bound to give them back to their rightful owners, regardless of how they came to be in his possession.",

However, if the national decision on compensation were to contain a statement imputing criminal liability to the respondent party, this would raise an issue falling within the ambit of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Ringvold, cited above, \u00a7 38; Y. v.

Norway, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 43-46; O. v. Norway, no. 29327/95, ECHR 2003-..., \u00a7\u00a7 39-40; Hammern v.

Thus, in a case where the domestic court held that it was \u201cclearly probable\u201d that the applicant had \u201ccommitted the offences with which he was charged\u201d, the Court found that it had overstepped the bounds of the civil forum and had thereby cast doubt on the correctness of the acquittal (see Y. v. Norway, cited above, \u00a7 46; and Diacenco, cited above \u00a7 64). Similarly, where the domestic court indicated that the criminal file contained enough evidence to establish that a criminal offence had been committed, the language used was found to have violated the presumption of innocence (see Panteleyenko, cited above, \u00a7 70). In cases where the Court\u2019s judgment expressly referred to the failure to dispel the suspicion of criminal guilt, a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 was established (see, for example, Sekanina v. Austria, 25 August 1993, \u00a7\u00a7 29-30, Series A no. 266A, and Rushiti v. Austria, no. 28389/95, \u00a7\u00a7 30-31, 21 March 2000). However, when regard is had to the nature and context of the particular proceedings, even the use of some unfortunate language may not be decisive. The Court\u2019s case-law provides some examples of instances where no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 has been found, even though the language used by the domestic authorities and courts was criticised (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 126, and the case-law cited therein; A.L.F. v. the United Kingdom, (dec.), no. 5908/12, 12 November 2013, \u00a7 24, and Adams v. the United Kingdom, (dec.), no. 70601/11, 12 November 2013, \u00a7 41).",

This was evident given that the first-instance civil judgments in the three cases had been delivered before the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. In the appeal proceedings of which the applicant complains, the Court of Appeal was also not required to examine or re-evaluate the criminal judgment which had by then been delivered, its role being to determine solely whether the first-instance court had made a proper non-arbitrary assessment of the evidence in the civil proceedings. In substance, the role of the courts in these civil proceedings was to determine whether the claimants were the rightful owners of the items at issue and, in the Baroness case, the court was specifically required to rule on the civil responsibility of the applicant. Although the Court of Appeal had the benefit of a final criminal judgment, it did not, in effect, base its decision on that final judgment, despite the fact that the criminal jurisdictions had found the applicant guilty of some of the offences. Instead, as in the other two cases, the civil jurisdictions determined the issue on the basis of the evidence presented before them. While some of that evidence had also been the evidence presented before the criminal jurisdictions, the civil jurisdictions did not base their finding on the contents of the criminal file as presented before the Criminal Courts. In the present case, in conformity with domestic law, the relevant evidence was brought before the civil jurisdictions and in some cases also reiterated by the witnesses before those courts. It was also accompanied by other evidence, the totality of which was brought to the courts\u2019 attention in adversarial conditions, and it was on the basis of that totality of evidence that the first-instance courts relied on in the judgments that were then upheld by the Court of Appeal.",

In the present case, those jurisdictions found against the applicant because he had failed to discharge the relevant burden of proof that he was indeed the owner of the items at issue (see paragraphs 15 and 19 in fine), a burden which had, on the other hand, been discharged by the claimants. The courts\u2019 findings were based on a \u201cprobability\u201d resulting from the evidence put forward. The Court of Appeal had also commented that had the Civil Court based its decision solely on testimony given in criminal proceedings and stopped there, the relevant burden of proof might not have been satisfied (see paragraph 19). Furthermore, a finding to the effect that the claimants were the rightful owners of the items at issue, and in the Baroness case, that the applicant was liable for damages (including for the smelted silver bullion), cannot be equated to a finding of guilt. Indeed, if the mere finding of liability for damages despite an acquittal were to raise such an issue under this provision, one would have to abolish such civil liability actions, which are in fact present and popular in many judicial systems and which are in principle compatible with the Convention, as evidenced by case-law (see, for example, Ringvold, cited above, and Y. v. Norway, cited above). Indeed, as noted by the Government, the Court has previously accepted that the presumption of innocence should not preclude the establishment of civil liability to pay compensation arising out of the same facts on the basis of a less strict burden of proof. However, in reply to the Government\u2019s last submission, the Court emphasises that even in such proceedings the innocence of the person in question must be respected (see, by implication, Allen, cited above, \u00a7 103).",
