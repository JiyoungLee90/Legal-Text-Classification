The legislation pursued a legitimate aim, namely to ensure the proper organisation of courses and use of resources. The school\u2019s decision not to enrol the applicant had been proportionate. The authorities had duly analysed the applicant\u2019s request, but had rejected it in view of his failure to provide his record and the insufficient number of students to set up a class. However, even if the applicant had provided the necessary document to complete his file, an obligation to arrange courses for a grade V group of only three or four prisoners would have imposed an excessive financial burden on the authorities. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s right to education had not been affected in its essence. It had only been in 2010 that the domestic authorities had been objectively prevented from organising the courses that would have been accessible to him. In any case, he had failed to provide any information on whether he had continued his studies after his release in August 2011.",

Contrary to the Government\u2019s submissions, he had not been in a position to provide his academic record. That was why he had given his consent to the prison administration to request them on his behalf. Moreover, it followed from the reasoning of the post-sentencing judge that the prisoners\u2019 files, including his file, had been complete, and that the schools inspectorate had given its approval for the courses to be organised. As all the admission conditions had been met, it had not been open to the Government to invoke restrictions on the right of education on the basis of the needs and resources of the community and the distinctive features of different levels of education.

The Court considers that the Government have not provided a convincing explanation as to why, despite this fact being established, the prison administration did not take any further steps to ensure that the applicant and other prisoners could be enrolled in secondary education.

It only mentioned why a number of other prisoners could not be enrolled in the higher grades of secondary education (see paragraph 12 above). In addition, although the post-sentencing judge and the Bucharest County Court both endorsed the school\u2019s argument that there were not enough prisoners to set up a secondary education class (see paragraphs 13-14 above), they did not explain how the legislation concerning the minimum number of students per class had been applied to the facts of the case before them.

It is also true that in deciding how to regulate access to education, a State must strike a balance between, on the one hand, the educational needs of those under its jurisdiction and, on the other, its limited capacity to accommodate them (see Ponomaryovi v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a05335/05, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2011).",

Indeed, in today\u2019s \u201cknowledge-based\u201d society, secondary education plays an ever-increasing role in the successful personal development and in the social and professional integration of the individuals concerned (see Ponomaryovi, cited above, \u00a7 57).",

While the Government have argued that the applicant\u2019s request to be enrolled was properly considered, they have not provided any example of how his right to receive secondary education was balanced with any legitimate reason to keep him out of education for an entire year. On this point, the Court is also unable to reach a conclusion as to the impact of this measure on the applicant\u2019s right in the light of the lack of information regarding his educational path following his conditional release in August 2011. In any event, the Court cannot but note the information provided to it by the Government, which shows that there were no secondary education classes organised for inmates of Jilava Prison in the 2011/2012 academic year either.",
