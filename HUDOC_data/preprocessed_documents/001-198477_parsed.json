Since 2014 it has been fully operational and functions as a national preventive mechanism within the meaning of the OPCAT. As such, the NPM assists the anti-torture efforts of the Kyrgyz authorities, acts as a liaison between international and non-governmental organisations, issues recommendations, makes unannounced visits to places of detention, and informs prosecution authorities about all identified cases of illtreatment. The NPM issues annual reports, which are around one hundred pages long, containing detailed information of the yearly activities. Reports are submitted for review to and endorsed by the Kyrgyz Parliament.",

Each visit necessarily included individual interviews with persons detained in a specific facility, and the number of interviews rose from 1,283 in 2015 to 1,829 in 2018. During the visits the NPM staff examined documents justifying detention, medical records and records of sanctions imposed by the facility management. After each notification concerning alleged ill-treatment (via a hotline, from an NGO, or following the death of a detainee), the NPM visited the relevant facilities, issued recommendations and made follow-up visits monitoring the progress achieved. The reports also include information on the number of torture and ill-treatment complaints received (around 120 in 2018), statistics on the criminal inquiries into those cases, as well as individual tracking of open criminal investigations.",

Although there was no official format for diplomatic assurances in the region, a mutually accepted and somewhat uniform format appeared to exist. The assurances often contained guarantees against the risk of ill-treatment, securing fair trial rights, and declarations on the absence of political grounds for prosecution. Sometimes they provided for a monitoring mechanism, but in practice it was usually limited to monitoring by diplomatic staff and did not provide for any independent system.",

In respect of the second applicant, his claims were weighed against the fact that he had travelled several times from Russia to Kyrgyzstan in 2011-14 without any hindrance; that in his statements to the migration authorities he had expressly stated that he had not taken part in any inter-ethnic clashes in 2010 and that he had not been persecuted on political grounds; that he had never participated in any political or social movement; and the efficiency of the monitoring mechanism (see paragraphs 31-32 above). It appears that the Russian courts considered significant that the applicants had been charged with common crimes, unrelated to their ethnicity, that their claims had had certain inconsistencies and there had been no evidence of any ulterior political motives behind their prosecution in Kyrgyzstan.",

According to the Russian Government in response to the problems identified by this Court, the monitoring mechanism was created through cooperation between the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Russian diplomatic staff in Kyrgyzstan and the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of the Kyrgyz Republic. Information exchanged through the mechanism has revealed that in up to 45% of cases, the criminal proceedings against extradited individuals of all ethnicities have been discontinued on various grounds. Individuals whose criminal prosecution had been pursued by the authorities in the south of the country were visited by Russian diplomatic staff, who questioned them about possible duress, ill-treatment and conditions of detention, as well as respect for their defence rights. The individuals visited appeared to have been satisfied with their treatment by the Kyrgyz authorities, while in one case the Russian diplomats recommended that the medical assistance provided to the detainee be improved (see paragraphs 55-59 above).",

By contrast, I would refer to my concurring opinion in the case of Kislov v. Russia (no. 3598/10, 9 July 2019), where I readily accepted, based on the facts, that the applicant\u2019s extradition to Belarus would not be in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.",

As has been pointed out, the mere possibility of ill-treatment on account of the situation in the receiving country does not in itself give rise to a breach of Article 3. That is why the Court went on to examine the applicant\u2019s specific allegations and the Russian domestic authorities\u2019 responses to the latter. However, in my view, it is not only for the applicant to prove the allegations and for the Government to refute them, it is also the Court\u2019s responsibility if the fact of sending a person to a given country is deemed to entail a risk of illtreatment or torture.",

In paragraph 11 it is said that the first applicant was charged in absentia with misappropriation of approximately 18,500 euros. Although I have asked for more information about this fact, I have not received any convincing proof that would justify the necessity of extradition. Of course, it is for the domestic Russian courts to look into this information. However, I do not see in the domestic legal reasoning or in the facts before the domestic courts any available material that would enable me to vote in favour of the extradition. There is even a lack of coherence between the findings of the different domestic courts. The applicant T.K. applied for refugee status, referring to risks of persecution in Kyrgyzstan on ethnic grounds, whilst the migration authorities and courts rejected the application (see paragraphs 22-24).",

Concretely, in relation to the content of T.K.\u2019s allegations, the applicant responded to the Government\u2019s observations by saying that there was a strategy to take away the property of Uzbeks in the relevant area on the basis of false accusations. The domestic courts did not weigh up the concrete circumstances or address this argument in their reasoning. In relation to the second applicant S.R., the Chamber judgment also contains many contradictions. It is said that the applicant was charged in absentia with violent crimes related to the June 2010 events, including the murder of law-enforcement officers (paragraph 26). But later the Regional Court of Belgorod found that \u201cin his statements to the migration authorities he had expressly stated that he had not taken part in any interethnic clashes in 2010 and that he had not been persecuted on political grounds\u201d (see paragraph 31). That is what the Russian court said, but it contradicts what the applicant said in his observations before the Court, according to which he had been persecuted on account of belonging to an ethnic group and the discrimination against this group. On the other hand, the reason why the Kyrgyzstan Government applied for his extradition was indeed because he had participated in the events of 2010.",

Contradictory propositions cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time. That is why the Court has to be clear about the party to which it should attribute credibility, but it is not logical to describe everything without a final evaluation of the real facts. Consequently, if we are not able to know the facts we cannot derive a conclusion of no violation.
