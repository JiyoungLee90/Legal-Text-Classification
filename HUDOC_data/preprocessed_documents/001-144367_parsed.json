The defence arguments that the detention could be replaced by preventive measures and that D.G. is a citizen of Serbia and has not come to Croatia since 11 January 2012 are of no relevance at this stage of the proceedings. It should be noted that that the suspects at issue were police officers who most certainly knew a lot of people and could therefore easily get in touch with the second suspect, D.G. This risk could not be averted by the seizure of their passports, because they could travel to certain countries with their identity cards alone and could easily meet the second suspect somewhere else. The analysis of the telephone conversations shows that the fifth suspect [Bruno Margareti\u0107] previously contacted the second suspect and that therefore he more or less knows where to find him and how to reach him, while the sixth suspect is his colleague and friend, and [therefore] they could both get in touch with the second suspect without difficulty. That risk can be averted only by their detention and therefore the conditions under Article 123 \u00a7 1(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been met.\u201d",

The particular problem in his case was a manifest lack of diligence on the part of the prosecuting authorities in the conduct of the proceedings and the failure of the courts to address that problem effectively. Therefore, he was able to accept that the complexity of the case and the need to question the witnesses could have warranted his detention for the two initial months, but after that there had been no relevant reasons for not questioning the witnesses and for keeping him in detention for a further year. The applicant also pointed out that the Supreme Court had recognised that bail on condition of payment of a surety was not appropriate in the circumstances of his case and that the lower courts had not given proper consideration to the possibility of releasing him under preventive measures until they had been forced to do so by the Supreme Court.

Its amount must be assessed principally by reference to the accused and his assets. Thus the authorities must take as much care in fixing appropriate bail as in deciding whether or not the accused\u2019s continued detention is indispensable. They must duly justify the amount in the decision fixing bail, and they must take into account the accused\u2019s means and his capacity to pay the sum required (see Mangouras v. Spain [GC], no. 12050/04, \u00a7\u00a7 78-80, ECHR 2010).",

Therefore, after the re-examination of the case on 25\u00a0July 2012, the investigating judge extended the applicant\u2019s detention only on the grounds that the applicant might suborn the nine witnesses who still had to be questioned, and not the second accused.

Moreover, in the meantime, the higher State Attorney\u2019s Office had been informed of the course of the proceedings, which resulted in it extending the time-limit for the investigation (see paragraph 24 above).

Moreover, the judge noted that a period of fourteen days would be sufficient for the questioning of the witnesses, given that there were only nine of them (see paragraph 29 above). The judge, however, made no other decision addressing further the question of reasonableness of the applicant\u2019s detention although he had been detained throughout that period only on the grounds of fear that he might suborn the witnesses.",

Croatia, no. 67341/10, \u00a7 134, 25 September 2012). The domestic courts gave no relevant reasons in their decisions on the applicant\u2019s detention which could have prompted them to change their previous position. The Court observes that the request for the applicant\u2019s detention on the grounds that he might coordinate his defence with the second defendant was rejected by the investigating judge owing to the fact that the applicant had been questioned and could not therefore coordinate his defence with the second suspect. In such circumstances no consideration was given to the question of whether the two defendants could contact each other or not (see paragraph 18 above). However, when subsequently reaching the opposite conclusion, the investigating judge focused only on the possibility of the applicant contacting the second suspect, without referring to the fact that the applicant had been questioned and without explaining the relevance of this fact in the light of the change from her previous decision (see paragraphs 38 and 40 above).",

This had resulted in him being detained without relevant and sufficient reasons for a considerable period of time. In the applicant\u2019s view, the Constitutional Court\u2019s practice of declaring complaints against decisions on detention inadmissible merely because a new decision on detention had been adopted in the meantime had had detrimental consequences for the effective respect for human rights in Croatia. In his particular case, that practice had allowed the lower courts to continue to extend his detention without relevant reasons, which had rendered the protection he was entitled to before that court ineffective.",

As the applicant had lodged his constitutional complaint against the decisions on his detention of 25 July 2012 and 23 August 2012 after the adoption of a new decision on his detention on 21 September 2012 (see paragraph 31 above), the Constitutional Court had declared his complaints inadmissible without examining them on the merits.",

The answer to this question was relevant for the interpretation and application of the relevant provisions of the Police Act, namely, section\u00a0112, which allows for the possibility of suspension (see paragraphs 60 and 63 above).",
