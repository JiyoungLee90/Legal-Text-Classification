The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Although measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element, in accordance with Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092-94, ECHR 2000-XI).",

In those cases applicants usually disposed of less than three sq. m of personal space (see, for example, Kantyrev v. , no.\u00a037213/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050-51, 21\u00a0June 2007; Andrey Frolov v. , no. 205/02, \u00a7\u00a7 47-49, 29\u00a0March 2007; Mayzit v. , no.\u00a063378/00, \u00a7\u00a040, 20 January 2005; and Labzov v.\u00a0, no.\u00a062208/00, \u00a7\u00a044, 16 June 2005). By contrast, in other cases where the overcrowding was not so severe as to raise in itself an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court noted other aspects of physical conditions of detention as being relevant for its assessment of compliance with that provision. Such elements included, in particular, the possibility of using the toilet in private, availability of ventilation, access to natural light or air, adequacy of heating arrangements, and compliance with basic sanitary requirements. Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue \u2013 measuring in the range of three to four sq. m per inmate \u2013 the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Babushkin v.\u00a0, no.\u00a067253/01, \u00a7\u00a044, 18\u00a0October 2007; Trepashkin v. , no.\u00a036898/03, \u00a7\u00a094, 19\u00a0July 2007, and Peers v. , no.\u00a028524/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-72, ECHR 2001III).",

The passenger cabins of those vans were designed for the transportation of twenty-five detainees on a floor space measuring less than nine square metres, which left an area of approximately fifty by fifty centimetres for each detainee. The height of the cabin (1.6 m) was not sufficient for a man of normal stature to enter or stand up without hunching, which required the detainees to remain in a seated position at all times while inside the van. In addition to the already cramped conditions, it appears from the table compiled by the applicant that the van was occasionally occupied by a total number of detainees exceeding the design capacity (see paragraph 66 above). In their post-admissibility submission the Government relied on a report prepared in 2006 which purported to certify that the design capacity of prison vans had not been exceeded in 2001 or 2002 (see paragraph 64 above). This report is of little evidential value for the Court because it does not refer to any sources of information, such as registers of detainees or other records, on the basis of which it was compiled and by which that assertion could be verified. Moreover, other domestic documents which are less remote in time from the period under consideration than the report drafted in 2006 convince the Court otherwise. Thus, it appears that overcrowding of prison vans transporting prisoners in Moscow in 2002 was one of the problems reported by the authority in charge of remand centres as a result of an inquiry carried out in 2003 (see the letter of 26 November 2003 from the head of the Moscow Directorate for the Execution of Punishments, cited in Starokadomskiy v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a042239/02, 12\u00a0January 2006).",

It follows from the table compiled by the applicant that he had been often taken to the \u201cwaiting cubicle\u201d before breakfast time and that he had returned to the remand centre too late for dinner.

On the other hand, the proceedings were delayed owing to the conduct of the domestic authorities. After the case had been submitted for trial in July 2001, the trial would not be able to begin for almost one year because of the domestic courts\u2019 disagreement on the existence of defects in the investigation documents and the need for further investigative actions.

Such restrictions as limitations imposed on the number of family visits, supervision over those visits and, if so justified by the nature of the offence, subjection of a detainee to a special prison regime or special visit arrangements constitute an interference with his rights under Article 8 but are not, by themselves, in breach of that provision.

The interference was based on section 18 of the Custody Act and the Internal Rules for Remand Centres which provided for investigator\u2019s discretion to authorise up to two family visits per month (see paragraphs 72 and 73 above). The Court is therefore satisfied that the refusal of family visits had a basis in domestic law. It reiterates, however, that the expression \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d does not merely require that the impugned measure should have a basis in domestic law but also refers to the quality of the law in question. The law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are entitled to resort to the impugned measures. In addition, domestic law must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law for legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, in order to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, for instance, Lupsa\u00a0v. Romania, no.\u00a010337/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a032 and 34, ECHR 2006-...., and Al-Nashif\u00a0v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a050963/99, \u00a7\u00a0119, 20 June 2002).",

However, they fell short of the requirement of foreseeability because they conferred unfettered discretion on the investigator in this matter but did not define the circumstances in which a family visit could be refused. The impugned provisions went no further than mentioning the possibility of refusing family visits, without saying anything about the length of the measure or the reasons that may warrant its application. No mention was made of the possibility of challenging the refusal to issue an authorisation or whether a court was competent to rule on such a challenge (see also the Court\u2019s findings below under Article 13 of the Convention). It follows that the provisions of Russian law governing family visits did not indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities, so that the applicant did not enjoy the minimum degree of protection to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society (compare Ostrovar v. , no.\u00a035207/03, \u00a7\u00a0100, 13 September 2005, and Calogero Diana v. Italy, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33). In view of the above, the Court considers that the interference at issue cannot be regarded as having been \u201cprescribed by law\u201d. In the light of this finding, it is not necessary to assess whether the other conditions set out in paragraph 2 of Article 8 have been complied with.",
