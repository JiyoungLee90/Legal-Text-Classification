Bulgaria, no. 69855/01, \u00a7\u00a7 111 and 117, 7\u00a0January 2010), in the instant case no such authority was envisaged by the relevant law (see Ivanova and Others, cited above). Nevertheless, the Court considers that the general wording of the 1992 Act, coupled with the municipality\u2019s continued recognition of the applicants\u2019 title for almost ten years, gave rise to a proprietary interest protected under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Zwierzy\u0144ski v. Poland, no. 34049/96, \u00a7\u00a7 6364, ECHR 2001VI; \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012729, ECHR 2004XII; Bruncrona v.

In addition to that, although the courts later decided that the property in question was not subject to restitution under domestic law, it cannot be overlooked that the applicants had a right to compensation in lieu of restitution, which could be regarded as another proprietary interest protected under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It is true that this right became time-barred before the applicants could exercise it. However, the only reason for their failure to file a compensation claim within the statutory time-limit was the continued recognition \u2013 later found erroneous \u2013 of their title by the authorities. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is therefore applicable.",

The time taken by the authorities to intervene is a factor to be taken into consideration in assessing the proportionality of an interference with possessions (see Jahn and Others, cited above, \u00a7 116, and Althoff\u00a0and\u00a0Others v. Germany, no. 5631/05, \u00a7 70, 8 December 2011). The passage of time is especially relevant in the present case as the 1997 Act, which provided for compensation in cases where property could not be restituted because it belonged to the public domain, laid down a time-limit, expiring one year after the Act\u2019s coming into force, for submitting applications for compensation (see paragraph 36 above). In this connection, the Court observes that compensation terms under the relevant legislation are likewise material to the assessment whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicants (see Jahn and Others, \u00a7 94, and Althoff and Others, \u00a7 63, both cited above).",

With regard to the claim for legal fees for the  proceedings, the Court considers that the claim has been substantiated only for the amount of EUR 1,300. The Court makes no award in respect of the costs and expenses incurred in the domestic proceedings. The attempt to obtain judicial review of the governor\u2019s decision (see paragraph 22 above) was bound to fail and therefore does not appear to have been an effective remedy that the applicants had to exhaust. As for the proceedings for the payment of rent, they are still pending (see paragraph 21 above). It is therefore unclear whether the applicants will have to bear the costs and expenses incurred for them. With regard to the remainder of the claim, the Court considers it reasonable to award the whole sum claimed, namely EUR\u00a0377.79. In conclusion, the Court awards jointly to the applicants EUR\u00a01,677.79, of which EUR 1,300 are to be paid directly into the bank account of the applicants\u2019 representative, Ms S. Margaritova-Vuchkova.",
