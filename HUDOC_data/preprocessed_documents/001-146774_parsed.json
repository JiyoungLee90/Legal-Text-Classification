The court reiterated that the debtor company had been set up by the district administration, which, as its owner, had been entitled to decide on its restructuring and liquidation under Article\u00a0295\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Civil Code. The owner could not be held liable for the insolvent company\u2019s debts unless the insolvency had been caused by the owner\u2019s actions. The court established that as a result of the administration\u2019s tariff-setting policy (see paragraph\u00a033 above) the company had been put in a pre-insolvency situation. Furthermore, the court emphasized that the district administration had withdrawn all assets from the company except for its authorized capital, which resulted in the company\u2019s inability to continue its activity in accordance with the goals and objectives assigned to it. With reference to the Court\u2019s case-law (Shlepkin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a03046/03, 1\u00a0February 2007; Grigoryev and Kakaurova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a013820/04, 12\u00a0April 2007; and Aleksandrova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 28965/02, 6\u00a0December 2007) the District Court found that the administration had subsidiary liability for the insolvent company\u2019s debts, ordered that the judgment debt be recovered from the district administration at the expense of the district treasury and rejected the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claims. In particular, the court found that the newly created company was not liable for the debts of the applicant\u2019s employer since they had not been transferred to it in the spin-off procedure.",

Turning to the tariff-setting issue (see paragraph\u00a033 above), the regional court noted that under the domestic law the owner was not obliged to finance the company directly. The regional court further considered that the assets had not actually been withdrawn from the company which employed the applicant, but that the company itself had transferred them to the newly created company on the spin-off balance sheet after the restructuring. There was nothing in the case to suggest that the lawfulness of the transfer of the assets had at any point been challenged in court. Furthermore, Russian employment law had not contained any provisions on the subsidiary liability of owners for the debts of municipal unitary enterprises. On the other hand, the first-instance court had failed to examine the issue of MUP \u201cMTS\u201d\u2018s liability for the debts of the restructured company.",

For instance, by final judgment no.\u00a0\u04241893/08-C06 of 25\u00a0March 2008 the Federal Commercial Court of the Ural Circuit summarised the lawful grounds for the removal of assets as follows: (a)\u00a0the liquidation or (b)\u00a0the restructuring of a unitary enterprise with the right of economic control, (c)\u00a0the use of the assets in noncompliance with the unitary enterprise\u2019s statutory purpose and aims or (d)\u00a0the unitary enterprise\u2019s renouncement of the assets. In that case, the court disallowed the liquidator\u2019s action lodged within the insolvency proceedings in respect of municipal unitary enterprise N. challenging the owner\u2019s decision to restructure the company and to transfer its assets to a different unitary company. The court noted that the company itself had requested the assets to be withdrawn from its economic control, and therefore the owner had lawfully decided to transfer the assets within the meaning of Article\u00a0299 of the Civil Code taken in conjunction with Article\u00a0236 (see paragraph\u00a075 above). The same test was also applied by the Federal Commercial Court of the East-Siberian Circuit in case no.\u00a069576/08-\u042402-847/2009 concerning municipal unitary company \u201cHotel\u00a0K.\u201d\u2018s challenge of a lease agreement concluded by the owner and a private company in respect of property placed under the hotel\u2019s economic control, although in that later case the court found no evidence of the company\u2019s renouncement of the assets, and found that the owner had not been competent to enter into the agreement in question.",

First, neither the Civil Code nor the Unitary Enterprises Act provided for the owner\u2019s right to withdraw the assets. Second, section\u00a018(3) of the Unitary Enterprises Act prohibited a unitary enterprise with a right of economic control to renounce title to assets since as a result of such a renouncement and the ensuing removal of the assets the company would no longer be able to perform its statutory activities in compliance with its designated purpose and aims. For instance, in case no.\u00a032-4047/2008-4/99 a liquidator of a municipal unitary company in charge of water supply for the area requested that the owner\u2019s decision of 2006 to withdraw the company\u2019s assets be declared invalid. The firstinstance court rejected the action on the ground that the transfer had taken place pursuant to the company\u2019s own request and had therefore been lawful within the meaning of Article\u00a0299 in conjunction with Article\u00a0235\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Civil Code (see paragraph\u00a075 above). However, the appeal court \u2013 and subsequently the Federal Commercial Court of the North Caucasus Circuit acting as a cassation instance \u2013 granted the company\u2019s claim and declared the withdrawal unlawful since it precluded the company from a possibility to further perform its statutory activities (cassation judgment no. \u042408-2397/2009 of 9 June 2009). By decision no.\u00a0\u0412\u0410\u042111340/09 of 16\u00a0September 2009 the Supreme Commercial Court rejected the owner\u2019s application for supervisory review, having found the cassation court\u2019s interpretation to be both correct and consistent with the Supreme Commercial Court\u2019s recent case-law. Similar reasoning was applied by the Supreme Commercial Court in a number of subsequent cases (see, for instance, decisions no.\u00a0\u0412\u0410\u0421-6841/11 of 16\u00a0June 2011 and no.\u00a0\u0412\u0410\u0421-7685/11 of 30\u00a0June 2011 rejecting applications for supervisory review, and several other cases).",

Referring to the company\u2019s financial difficulties, the owner ordered that all its assets be removed for further transfer to a different legal entity, and instructed the head of the enterprise \u201cto prepare orders for the employees\u2019 dismissal\u201d. The court rejected that argument and set aside the owner\u2019s order, since it had not been demonstrated that the company\u2019s management of the assets had not been economically rational, or that it had failed to meet its statutory goals. The withdrawal prevented the company from further performing its statutory activities and resulted in the \u201cmass dismissal\u201d of employees in violation of their employment rights.",

Referring to Article\u00a056\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Civil Code and section\u00a010(4) of the Insolvency Act, the court summarized the factors to be taken into account as follows: (a)\u00a0whether there was a right to give binding instructions or otherwise determine the debtor\u2019s actions; (b)\u00a0whether a specific action had been taken in the exercise of that right; (c)\u00a0whether there was a causal link between the action and the insolvency; and (d)\u00a0whether the owner was at fault.

The court found that, although the owner had indeed removed assets from the company and transferred them to a different legal entity, the following elements were to be proved to hold the owner subsidiary liable: a causal link between the removal and the insolvency, and the owner\u2019s fault. The claimant\u2019s argument that the aggregate value of the removed assets would have been be sufficient to pay the company\u2019s debts was rejected by the court, for his failure to demonstrate the causal link between the assets removal and the insolvency. On 2\u00a0March 2009 the Supreme Court of Russia rejected an application for supervisory review of that judgment (case no.\u00a02245/09). In a number of domestic judgments and decisions, mostly adopted since late 2010, regional commercial courts were satisfied that there existed a causal link between the removal of the assets and the insolvency of the company and, accordingly, held the owner to have subsidiary liability for the insolvent companies\u2019 debts under Article\u00a056\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Civil Code. For instance, by a final judgment of 4\u00a0September 2012 the Commercial Court of the Kareliya Republic granted the liquidator\u2019s claim for the subsidiary liability of the municipality, the owner of assets allocated to the municipal unitary company which supplied the heating in the respective district. The court found that though the company was operating in compliance with its purpose and aims, at some point the owner had withdrawn the major assets from its economic control and transferred them to other legal entities. As a result, the company had become unable to perform its statutory functions and had had to dismiss nearly all its personnel (judgment no.\u00a0A264073/2011). On the other hand, where a unitary enterprise had had considerable financial difficulties and the withdrawal of its assets by the owner had not had a decisive impact on its insolvency, the company\u2019s creditor\u2019s claims were rejected by the domestic courts (and upheld on 19\u00a0April 2013 by the Supreme Commercial Court\u2019s rejection of an application for supervisory review; case no.\u00a0\u0412\u0410\u0421-5058/13).",

It goes on to specify that such companies \u201ccannot make the majority of their transactions without the owner\u2019s approval. Furthermore, unitary enterprises may dispose of their assets only in so far as the respective transactions do not deprive them of the possibility to conduct their activities in accordance with their purpose and aims. Otherwise, the transactions may be declared void (section\u00a018(3) of the Unitary Enterprises Act). As a result, other parties to the contracts [involving the] enterprises are under a constant threat in that any transaction may be challenged by the owner of the assets, whilst the owners themselves are virtually free of liability for the results of their \u2018management\u2019. The very notion of the \u2018enterprise\u2019 as a subject of law was inherited from the Soviet legal system, [which was] based on the State planning economy. The existence of unitary enterprises is therefore deprived of any future prospect and it would be preferable to replace them with other types of commercial organisation.

Once the assets are placed under a company\u2019s economic control, they are withdrawn from the owner\u2019s actual possession. For instance, execution upon the debtor unitary enterprise\u2019s assets in insolvency proceedings is made irrespectively of the owner\u2019s consent, as confirmed by the domestic judgment of 15\u00a0March 2006 (see paragraph\u00a0105 above). Even though municipal unitary enterprises cannot, in accordance with Article\u00a0295 of the Civil Code, conduct any transaction leading to encumbrance or alienation of real estate, they enjoy sufficient independence across the wide range of their activities. They may possess, use and dispose of movable estate without any restrictions. Furthermore, according to the findings of the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court of 21\u00a0April 1998, where real estate is acquired by the unitary enterprise as a result of its economic activity, the owner\u2019s consent for a transaction involving such real estate is not required either (see paragraph\u00a078 above). On the other hand, the owner is formally prohibited from disposing of the assets placed under the economic control of a unitary enterprise, and any such transaction should be declared void (see paragraph\u00a076 above). The unitary enterprise has the right to lodge court actions to protect its assets against the owner (see paragraph\u00a077 above).",

It therefore requires that the States provide a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief (see Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7\u00a0152, ECHR\u00a02000XI). Article\u00a013 thus requires the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although the Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision (see T.P. and K.M. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a028945/95, \u00a7\u00a0107, ECHR 2001V (extracts)).

At the same time, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred. Even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a013, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Burdov v.

In Gadzhikhanov and Saukov the Court found that if for any reason an applicant obtained the writ of execution from a court him or herself, it would appear logical to require that he or she submit it to the competent authority. The authorities in that case could not be held responsible for the applicants\u2019 unexplained failure to follow the domestic enforcement procedure and, notably, for their deliberate and persistent refusal to provide the writs of enforcement (see Gadzhikhanov and Saukov v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a010511/08 and 5866/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027-31, 31\u00a0January 2012). However, the present case is different in two respects: first, when the second award in the applicant\u2019s favour became enforceable the insolvency procedure was already in progress, and, accordingly, the enforcement proceedings had to be suspended, as required by section\u00a022 of the Enforcement Act of 1997 (as in force at the material time, see paragraph\u00a0112 above). It therefore appears that it was no longer the bailiffs\u2019 service but the liquidator who was responsible for the execution of the award. Second, as the copy of the writ of execution in respect of the judgment in question clearly shows, at some point the liquidator received it and made a note on it regarding its enforcement status (see paragraphs\u00a01920 above). Therefore, the Court considers that the applicant discharged her duty of cooperation by forwarding the writ to a competent person and rejects the Government\u2019s objection.",

It notes that the first judgment in favour of Ms\u00a0Liseytseva entered into force six days before the liquidation procedure in respect of the debtor commenced (see paragraphs\u00a011 and 13 above), and all the other judgments in both applicants\u2019 favour were issued when the liquidation in respect of the debtor enterprises was underway. In that situation, the bailiffs\u2019 duty was confined to forwarding the writs of execution to the liquidator in due time (see paragraphs\u00a017 and 41 above). At no point did the applicants allege in their complaints to the Court that the bailiffs had unduly delayed the transfer of the writs or, for instance, failed to verify the correctness of their execution as they were required to do by virtue of section\u00a096(6) of the Enforcement Act of 2007 (see paragraph\u00a0114 above), or otherwise failed to carry out their duty properly. The crux of the applicants\u2019 grievance is rather the debtor companies\u2019 inability to satisfy their respective claims, which were confirmed by the final judgments in their favour. The Court notes that by the time the applicants were placed on the lists of the respective companies\u2019 creditors and notified thereof by the liquidators, the insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor enterprises had commenced in both cases, and the debtor companies had already been unable to meet the creditors\u2019 claims for some time. The Court concludes that, in these circumstances, a complaint to the bailiffs\u2019 service or a civil action against the bailiffs would not have brought the applicants closer to their goal, that is, the payment of the judgment debt (see Yershova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a065, and Grigoryev and Kakaurova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a029).",

In the absence of any further clarification, a copy of the court\u2019s decision or any minimum explanation by the Government on either the scope of the claim or the proper procedure to be followed by the applicant, the Court does not consider it necessary to assess the suggested remedy in abstracto.

In the Court\u2019s view, their submissions are somewhat self-contradictory. First, the Court notes that the clarifications contained in the abovementioned ruling concern an application by the insolvency creditors and the competent authorities only (see paragraph\u00a0115 above), whilst it appears that the applicant did not belong to either category. In fact, as pointed out by the applicant \u2013 and not disputed by the Government at that point \u2013 his claims concerned \u201ccurrent payments\u201d and therefore he could not be considered a party to the insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the Insolvency Act (see paragraph\u00a090 above). Secondly, the Government themselves noted that in any event the applicant\u2019s claims had been included in the register of creditors\u2019 claims (see paragraph\u00a042 above). In those circumstances, the Court does not consider that the applicant lodging a separate court action with the aim of having his claims included in that very register would have had any meaningful purpose.

As regards the Government\u2019s reference to Article\u00a01070 of the Civil Code, the objection is clearly inapplicable, since that provision deals specifically with damage caused by unlawful conviction, prosecution, detention or prohibition on leaving the place of residence, and the case files do not contain any evidence of any such action having been taken in the present two cases. As regards the remaining provisions of Chapter\u00a059, the Court has already found on several occasions \u2013 albeit in the context of judgments given against the State authorities \u2013 that, while the possibility of such compensation was not totally excluded, this remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, notably because it requires the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities (see, among many others and in the context of judgments against the State, Burdov (no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7\u00a0110, and Moroko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a020937/07, \u00a7\u00a7 28-29, 12\u00a0June 2008). The Government did not contest in the present cases that compensation under Chapter\u00a059 was subject to this condition. The Court notes that the Civil Code lists a very limited number of situations in which compensation for non-pecuniary damage is recoverable irrespective of whether the respondent is at fault (notably, Articles\u00a01070\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 and 1100, cited in paragraphs\u00a0122-23 above). Delays in the enforcement of judicial decisions against unitary enterprises do not appear on this list (see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov\u00a0(no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7\u00a0112). It was not contested by the Government that at no point had the fault of the authorities been established in the two cases at hand. On the contrary, in both cases the domestic courts \u2013 albeit in the subsidiary liability proceedings \u2013 summarily assessed the respective local authorities\u2019 actions as having been taken in accordance with the law (see paragraphs\u00a023 and 2627 relating to Liseytseva and paragraph\u00a050 relating to Maslov). In sum, it has not been demonstrated that such an action would have had any prospects of success in the present two cases.

They omitted to suggest, for instance, who the respondent in such proceedings would be or to outline, even briefly, the procedure to be followed by the applicant. In the absence of further clarifications from the parties, the Court considers that a claim for execution on the debtor\u2019s property under section\u00a0142(11) of the Insolvency Act is \u2013 as the wording of the respective provision suggests \u2013 conditional on the \u201cunlawfulness\u201d of the third person\u2019s possession (ibid.). As in paragraph\u00a0165 above, the Court observes that at no stage of the proceedings did the domestic courts establish that the debtor\u2019s property had been unlawfully acquired by any persons, including the local administration \u2013 the founder of the debtor enterprise and the owner of its property. On the contrary, the domestic courts emphasized that the restructuring of the enterprise and the transfer of the assets under its control had been the owner\u2019s right (see paragraphs\u00a023 and 26-27 above). In the light of the above, the Court is not persuaded that the remedy suggested by the Government offered any reasonable prospect of success.",

This position was formulated by the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Commercial Court of 1996 (see paragraph\u00a097 above) and upheld by the domestic courts (see paragraph\u00a0106 above). As regards the procedure set out by the 2009 amendments to the Insolvency Act (and, arguably, applicable in the Maslov case, see paragraph\u00a0103 above), the domestic law clearly stipulates that such proceedings may only be initiated by the liquidator, a competent authority, or the insolvency creditors (see paragraph\u00a0101 above). Accordingly, it appears that the applicants \u2013 who were not \u201cinsolvency creditors\u201d within the meaning of the Insolvency Act \u2013 could not bring such a claim since the liquidation proceedings in their cases were already underway.

On the other hand, the Court notes from the recent domestic case-law that claimants may, in principle, be barred from making use of that procedure after the debtor company\u2019s liquidation (see paragraph\u00a0107 above), and also takes note of the Government\u2019s submission that such a claim can only be brought by a liquidator (see paragraph\u00a0141 above).

The Court further observes that in the present two cases the domestic courts established the facts in so far as the removal of the companies\u2019 assets by their respective owners was concerned (see paragraphs\u00a023 and 4850 above), as well as regarding the debt accumulated by various authorities towards the applicant\u2019s employer in Liseytseva (see paragraph\u00a023 above) and the effect of the tariff-setting policy on the company\u2019s activity in Maslov (see paragraph\u00a048 above). Furthermore, the courts admitted that the owners\u2019 specific actions had had a certain impact on the debtor enterprises\u2019 financial situation (see paragraphs\u00a023 and 50 above). Therefore, it may be said that the domestic courts addressed the issue of the actual State control over the debtor municipal unitary enterprises in the two present cases, and these findings are highly relevant for the Court\u2019s assessment of the debtor companies\u2019 operational and institutional independence (see paragraphs\u00a018792 and 204-19 below).",

Without determining at this stage whether the judgment debts in the present cases are attributable to the State, the Court notes the following. The applicants\u2019 arguments as regards the authorities\u2019 fault were, in their turn, rejected for the reason that the authorities\u2019 respective actions had been lawful. In fact, in both Liseytseva and Maslov the domestic courts rejected the applicants\u2019 arguments, having found that the owners\u2019 disposal of the assets \u2013 notably, their removal \u2013 had been in compliance with domestic law. The Court notes that at some point the municipal companies, the liquidator or, for instance, a prosecutor, as in the rare case before the Regional Court of the Yevreyskaya Autonomous Region (see paragraph\u00a082 above) \u2013 but, in any event, not the applicants themselves \u2013 could, in principle, have challenged the removal under the relevant provisions of the Civil Code taken in conjunction with the Unitary Enterprises Act (see, for the respective domestic case-law, paragraphs\u00a080-81 and 111 above). However, the relevant persons\u2019 actions challenging the acts of the local authorities could only result from the exercise of their discretionary powers and could hardly be initiated by the individual applicants. Be that as it may, none of the above-mentioned persons made use of that right in the present two cases, and the domestic courts in the subsequent subsidiary liability proceedings confined their findings to a conclusion that the respective owners had acted lawfully (see paragraphs\u00a023 and 26 above as regards Liseytseva and paragraphs 50 and 53 as regards Maslov). That finding, in its turn, excluded any further consideration by the domestic courts of the question of whether the debtor companies had actually enjoyed sufficient operational and institutional independence in the present cases (see paragraphs 187-92 and 204-19 below); or, even less, whether the delays in execution of the judicial awards in the applicants\u2019 favour had been reasonable, or whether the respective interference with the applicants\u2019 rights to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions had been justified (see paragraphs\u00a0220-24 below) \u2013 the criteria which lie at the heart of the Court\u2019s analysis of the applicants\u2019 respective complaints (see, in so far as relevant, Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7\u00a0138, ECHR 1999VI). In the Court\u2019s view, the limited scope of review in the applicants\u2019 cases did not satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a013 of the Convention in conjunction with Article\u00a06 of the Convention and Article\u00a01 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01.",

In fact, the applicants found themselves at a distinct disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the owners in so far as access to information about the company\u2019s assets and financial situation was concerned (see, albeit in the context of the Insolvency Act dealing with the obligation to produce financial documents, the Explanatory Note to Federal Law no.\u00a073 FZ, paragraph\u00a0102 above; see further, for the requirement of conformity with the principle of fairness, and in so far as relevant, the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a0158 above). The complexity of the claimants\u2019 task in discharging the burden of proof in the proceedings under Article\u00a056\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Civil Code was amply demonstrated in Maslov. In that case, the applicant explicitly submitted that he had not had access to the documents on the debtor company\u2019s assets (see paragraph\u00a052 above). Moreover, it was not contested that, according to the report of 1\u00a0February 2009, the company\u2019s financial records had not been produced even to the liquidator (see paragraph\u00a045 above).

In the case of CostelloRoberts v. the United Kingdom (25 March 1993, \u00a7\u00a027, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0247), the Court held that a State could not absolve itself from responsibility by delegating its obligations to private bodies or individuals (see also Storck v.\u00a0Germany no.\u00a061603/00, \u00a7\u00a0103, ECHR 2005-V).

The Court thus concluded that Radio France was a non-governmental organisation for the purposes of Article\u00a034 of the Convention. Similarly, the Court found that the applicant company in Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines was a nongovernmental organisation, despite the fact that it was wholly owned by the Iranian State and that a majority of the members of the board of directors were appointed by the State, since the applicant company was legally and financially independent from the State and was run as a commercial business (see Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a040998/98, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR 2007V). In RENFE the former Commission, in its reasoning leading it to find that the applicant lacked capacity to introduce an application under Article\u00a025, considered that the applicant was a public law corporation, created by the State in order to run the State rail network as an industrial company; its board of directors was answerable to the Government and the applicant was the only undertaking with a licence to manage, direct and administer the State railways, with a certain publicservice role in the way it did so (see RENFE v.\u00a0Spain, no.\u00a035216/97, Commission decision of 8\u00a0September 1997, DR\u00a090-B).",

For instance, the Court has found that legal entities could be considered \u201cgovernmental organisations\u201d if they performed specific public duties under the supervision of the State authorities (see Novoseletskiy v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a047148/99, \u00a7\u00a082, ECHR 2005II (extracts)), or were public enterprises operating in various areas of State activity, including the mining, energy and transportation sectors (see Romashov v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a067534/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046-47, 27\u00a0July 2004; Kucherenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a027347/02, \u00a7\u00a025, 15\u00a0December 2005; Lisyanskiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a019; and Yershova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a057-62).

In R. Ka\u010dapor and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a097) the Court established that the debtor company was owned by a holding company predominantly comprised of social capital and that, as such, it was closely controlled by the Privatisation Agency, a State body, as well as the Government. In the aforementioned Cooperativa Agricola (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a018-19) the Court noted that the State exercised significant control over the company\u2019s assets. In Kotov the Grand Chamber concluded that liquidators, at the relevant time, enjoyed a considerable amount of operational and institutional independence, as State authorities did not have the power to give instructions to them and therefore could not directly interfere with the liquidation process (see Kotov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0107).",

In both cases, furthermore, the authorities disposed of the companies\u2019 property as they saw fit, ordering the transfer of their respective assets to different legal entities (ibid.). In Khachatryan the Court observed that while the debtor, a closed joint-stock company, had enjoyed under the law and its statute a certain degree of legal and economic independence from the State, its assets had been to a large extent controlled and managed by the State. The State had disposed of the company\u2019s assets as it saw fit: in particular, the Government had ordered the transfer of the company\u2019s property to the regional administration, allowed the company to sell a large portion of its property and ordered that the proceeds be put towards paying off the company\u2019s debts owed to the State budget (see Khachatryan v.\u00a0Armenia, no. 31761/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a051-54, 1\u00a0December 2009). By contrast, in Anokhin the Court found that the debts of a jointstock company were not directly imputable to the State. The company owned assets that were distinct from the property of its shareholders and had delegated management. Thus, the State, like any other shareholder, was only liable for the company\u2019s debts in the amount invested in its shares. Further, the Court found nothing in the case materials to suggest that the State was directly responsible for the company\u2019s financial difficulties, siphoned the corporate funds to the detriment of the company and its stakeholders, failed to maintain an arm\u2019s-length relationship with the company or otherwise abused the corporate form. Further, the Court found no indication that the company\u2019s financial difficulties resulted from its poor management rather than from the overall effect of unfavourable conditions in the coalmining industry and the market (see Anokhin, cited above).",

Further, in the Court\u2019s view, it is significant that unitary enterprises may sue other persons, including their owners, in court, in order to protect the assets allocated to them (see paragraphs\u00a057 and 77 above, as well as the domestic case-law summarised in paragraphs\u00a080-81 and 107 above).

While agreeing with the Government that the State cannot automatically be held liable for those companies\u2019 debts, the Court considers that the authorities\u2019 extensive powers of control over the companies\u2019 activities will weigh heavily in its assessment of the State\u2019s responsibility for such companies\u2019 failure to comply with domestic judgments. Arguing that municipal unitary enterprises have \u201cvirtually unlimited\u201d independence, the Government mainly refer to the conclusions reached in the 1999\u00a0Concept (see paragraph\u00a0126 above).

This aspect of control may become, in certain circumstances, particularly important, since unitary enterprises are limited in their activities by the need to comply with the purposes and aims defined by their articles of association (see paragraphs\u00a066-68 above). In fact, they may dispose of the assets allocated to them only in so far as this does not prevent them from conducting their activities in accordance with their statutory purpose and aims, otherwise any transactions may be declared void (see paragraph\u00a068 above). The major consequence is that their transactions may be challenged by their owners on the ground of non-compliance with their statutory purpose and aims (see, for an assessment of that aspect of control, the 2009\u00a0Concept, summarised in paragraph\u00a0127 above). The Court further observes that the owner itself sets the company\u2019s economic performance targets and oversees its achievement of those targets (see paragraph\u00a073 above); it also approves the financial reports of the company (see paragraph\u00a072 above). Those considerations are further strengthened by the specific provisions on the accountability of the directors of unitary enterprises. They are appointed by, and report to, the owner of the assets (see paragraph\u00a093 above) and may be dismissed for failure to meet the above-mentioned economic performance targets set by the owner, or for making any transaction going beyond the company\u2019s designated purpose and aims (see paragraphs\u00a084-85 above).",

The Court accepts the Government\u2019s argument that that interpretation indeed guarantees, to a certain extent, the company\u2019s independence in the management of its assets, even though the domestic courts\u2019 approach to the possibility of the owner\u2019s withdrawal of the assets with the company\u2019s consent until at least 2008 may be assessed as somewhat divergent (compare the case-law cited in paragraphs\u00a080 and 81 above; see also, for the test applied by the domestic courts, paragraph\u00a080 above).",

Further, Article\u00a0295 of the Civil Code provides that it is the owner who may decide to restructure or liquidate the enterprise. Turning to the abundant existing case-law of the domestic commercial courts on the subsidiary liability of the owners of municipal companies\u2019 assets, the Court notes that in nearly all such cases liability was claimed precisely in connection with various instances of the owners\u2019 actual disposal of the property placed under the debtor enterprise\u2019s economic control (see paragraph\u00a0111 above). The domestic courts have consistently accepted the restructuring or liquidation of the company as a legitimate ground for the owner to remove its property and, in case of restructuring, to transfer it to a different legal entity (see paragraph\u00a080 above). This approach was also taken by the domestic courts in the present cases of Liseytseva (see paragraphs\u00a023 and 26-27 above) and Maslov (see paragraph\u00a050 above). Furthermore, the owner also decides on the actual manner in which the assets are transferred in any such case (see paragraph\u00a069 above), as amply demonstrated by the facts of the present two cases: by the decision of the local administration the debtor companies\u2019 assets were transferred to the newly created companies, while the debts remained on the balance sheets of the applicants\u2019 employers (see paragraphs\u00a010 and 34-35 above; see also, in a similar context, Yershova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011 and 60).",

Although the purpose-related restrictions in setting up such companies are not in themselves a sufficient basis on which to decide on the issue of those companies\u2019 independence from the State, the Court cannot overlook the fact that, at least in principle, such companies are supposed to be set up in areas of a certain public importance. The Court further notes that in the late 1990s the Government adopted a policy aimed at reducing the number of the unitary enterprises, so that the legal form in question would be reserved only for State companies operating in spheres of particular importance for the economy (see paragraphs\u00a0127 and 128 above).",

On the other hand, municipal unitary enterprises may also be responsible for the heating or water supply in certain areas, as in Maslov (see paragraph\u00a029 above; see also Yershova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a06; and the domestic case-law cited in paragraphs\u00a081-82 and 111 above) or may, for instance, ensure provision of housing and communal services in a town. In such cases, the companies\u2019 institutional links with the public administration are particularly strengthened by the special nature of their activities, since they provide public services of vital importance to the population (see Yershova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058). The assets allocated for such purposes accordingly enjoy special status under the domestic law (see paragraph\u00a0125 above). Certain services provided by such companies are subject to the application of tariffs set by the owner (see paragraph\u00a033 above). The Court is therefore bound to conclude that the degree of actual State control over municipal unitary enterprises may, in some cases, be further enhanced depending on a particular company\u2019s sphere of operation.",

The Court reiterates that, in order to decide if the delay in execution of the judgment was reasonable, it will look at how complex the enforcement proceedings were, how the applicants and the authorities behaved, and what the nature of the award was (see Raylyan v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a022000/03, \u00a7\u00a031, 15\u00a0February 2007).",

It is sufficient for the Court to note that in the instant cases the judgment of 19\u00a0June 2007 in Mr Maslov\u2019s favour had remained unenforced for slightly more than one year and eight months by the date of the debtor company\u2019s liquidation.

While liquidation proceedings may objectively justify some limited delays in enforcement, the continuing non-execution of the judgments in the applicants\u2019 favour for several years could hardly be justified in any circumstances. The facts of the present cases would rather suggest that the municipal authorities did not consider themselves bound by the obligation to honour the judgment debts towards the employees related to their salaries after they had decided to liquidate the debtor companies and to create the new ones in their places (see, mutatis mutandis, Yershova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072).

The Court finds that, by failing for years to take the necessary measures to comply with the final judgment given in favour of the applicants, the Russian authorities for a considerable period prevented the applicants from receiving in full the money to which they were entitled, which amounted to a disproportionate interference with their peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see, among many others, Khachatryan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069; and, mutatis mutandis, Sharenok v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a035087/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035-38, 22\u00a0February 2005; and Grigoryev and Kakaurova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a039.)
