The claim by S.A.\u00a0Jacques Dangeville which the Administrative Court of Appeal examined in the impugned judgment was for payment of 'compensation' in an amount equal to the amount of value-added tax that had thus been paid, by way of reparation for the 'damage' which that tax liability had caused the company to sustain, on the ground that that damage was attributable to the French State's delay in transposing the objectives of the Directive into domestic law. It follows that, as submitted by the Minister of the Budget, the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the fact that the company '[had] first referred the issue of taxation to the tax court' did not render inadmissible a claim for reparation in which the only alleged damage was that resulting from the payment of the tax.

Although, in the light of the S.A. Dangeville v. France judgment (16 April 2002, no.\u00a036677/97, ECHR 2002-III), SGAP Expansion, OGIA and Christian de Clarens had in 1978 possessed a claim against the State that met the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the factual and legal positions were so significantly different that the decision reached by the Court in the Dangeville case was not transposable: whereas S.A. Dangeville had contested the erroneous payment of VAT from the outset, the three companies involved in the present case had waited until 20 December 1993, that is to say until fifteen years after the payment of the VAT in issue and, more specifically, until after the Paris Administrative Court's judgment of 1\u00a0July 1992 in favour of Dangeville S.A. The Government explained that Article L 190 of the Code of Tax Procedure enabled taxpayers with statute-barred claims to rely, despite their past inaction, on changes in the case-law to obtain a refund of sums which the new decision had shown to have been paid erroneously. However, in the applicant companies' case, the impugned taxation had taken place more than ten years before the temporal limit fixed by Article L 190 of the Code of Tax Procedure. Independently of this ground of inadmissibility, which the domestic courts had upheld, the claim was in any event inadmissible pursuant to the Limitation of Claims against the State, D\u00e9partements, Municipalities and Public Bodies Act (Law\u00a0no. 68-1250 of 31\u00a0December 1968) as being a statute-barred claim against the State. In any event, the Government considered that in the light of the subsidiarity principle the applicant companies could not validly argue that they had not had an effective remedy as the administrative case-law at the time had yet to recognise the direct applicability of Community directives in domestic law: it was precisely through lodging a claim in the domestic courts that Dangeville had secured the important change to the case-law made by the Administrative Court of Appeal's judgment of 1 July 1992. The Government also considered that the applicant companies could have made an application to the European Commission of Human Rights at the outset in 1978 by arguing that the domestic remedies manifestly offered no prospects of success.",

Spain, 25\u00a0January 2000, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 2000-I). In reality, either no favourable judicial decision was forthcoming, in which case the claimant did not have access to a court, or there was a favourable decision but the period in respect of which a claim could be made was then reduced depending on the date of that decision. Consequently, the courts could deprive a claimant of his right to full compensation simply by deferring a finding of incompatibility. In the instant case, by limiting the period in respect of which a claim could be made to the four years preceding the judgment delivered in favour of S.A.\u00a0Dangeville in 1992, Article L 190 had excluded the right to reparation for the VAT erroneously paid in respect of the first semester of 1978 with the result that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

Even though the CJEC was not required to apply Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (indeed, that provision was not referred to in the request for a preliminary ruling), we consider it unfortunate for there to be any hint of a divergence of opinion between Europe's two highest courts, which are careful to avoid such differences (see, for example, the Court's judgments in the cases of Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24833/94, ECHR 1999I and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Colas Est and Others v. France, no. 37971/97, ECHR 2002III, and, respectively, the CJEC's judgments in the cases of Kingdom of Spain v.
