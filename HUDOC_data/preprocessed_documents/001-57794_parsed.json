Ordinarily the function of a judge hearing a pre-trial application for provisional liberty is to decide, on appropriate evidence, whether he is satisfied that the accused, if at liberty, will abscond or seek to defeat justice by tampering with or destroying evidence or intimidating witnesses. If the judge is not so satisfied he should grant the application subject to such reasonable guarantees or restrictive conditions as he thinks necessary and prudent. That applies equally to the innocent and the guilty. If liberty is refused simply because of the strong suspicion of guilt it violates the concept of the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 (art. 6). If however the national legal system requires, or permits, consideration of the probability of guilt as a factor in the decision on provisional liberty, the judge who so decides clearly disqualifies himself from participation as a judge at the trial of the substantive issue of guilt or innocence.",
