The case originated in an application (no. 41820/16) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Rešad Ljajić (“the applicant”), on 5 July 2016.
The applicant was represented by Mr S. Ljajić from Belgrade. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 30 August 2017 the applicant’s complaint, under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, concerning the non-enforcement of final domestic court decision rendered in favour of the applicant was communicated to the Government. Other two complaints, under Article 13 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 were rejected in the single judge procedure on non-exhaustion grounds.
The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Štitare.
On 30 May 2000 the Belgrade Third Municipal Court ordered a socially-owned company KMG Trudbenik (hereinafter “the debtor company”), based in Belgrade, to pay to the applicant a specified amount on account of salary arrears, plus the costs of the civil proceedings (judgment no. P1 863/99). This judgment became enforceable on 19 June 2000.
On 13 March 2002, upon the applicant’s request to that effect, the Fourth Belgrade Municipal Court ordered the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor company to pay the applicant’s enforcement costs (enforcement order no. I-VIII 101/2002).
On 7 October 2003 the enforcement proceedings were suspended due to the institution of compulsory settlement proceedings before the Belgrade Commercial Court (“the Commercial Court”).
On 9 December 2011 the Commercial Court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor company.
On 6 March 2012 the applicant submitted his request for enforcement of the 30 May 2000 judgment (“enforcement request”) to the insolvency manager. The insolvency manager neither rejected the applicant’s claim nor forwarded it to the Commercial Court.
On 24 February 2014 the applicant thus submitted his enforcement request with the Commercial Court, and on 1 October 2014 he supplemented it.
On 6 August and 27 October 2014 the applicant complained about the inactivity of the acting judge in the insolvency proceedings.
On 13 October 2014 the Commercial Court rejected the applicant’s enforcement request as having been lodged out of time.
On 28 January 2015 the Commercial Appellate Court rejected the applicant’s appeal, and upheld the Commercial Court’s decision of 13 October 2014.
On 24 March 2015 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal, complaining of the decision of 28 January 2015.
However, on 19 May 2016 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s appeal as unfounded.
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially-owned companies, enforcement and insolvency proceedings is outlined in the cases of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia (nos. 2269/06 et al., §§ 57-64 and §§ 71-76, 15 January 2008), and Jovičić and Others v. Serbia ((dec.), no. 37270/11, §§ 88-93, 15 October 2013).
