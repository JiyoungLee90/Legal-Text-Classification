In April 2007 the applicant, having sentenced I. to fifteen days\u2019 imprisonment for disorderly conduct, had the site manager for the house renovation, Mr Sh., check I. out of the police detention facility (\u201cthe facility\u201d) where the latter was serving his sentence and take him to the construction site where he was to work under Sh.\u2019s direction. Then, in November 2007, a police officer, G., conspired with the applicant in drawing up a report falsely accusing I. of another episode of disorderly conduct. G. fabricated written statements by false witnesses, P.S. and I.A., incriminating I., and submitted the file to the applicant. Knowing that I. was innocent and the report was false, the applicant convicted I. and sentenced him to another fifteen days\u2019 detention.

In the present case I. was the victim\u00a0of the offence for which the applicant was convicted; his statement directly accused the applicant of knowingly using his judicial authority for personal benefit. It is true that, as the Government submit, there was other evidence before the domestic courts showing that the applicant did use his official position in order to have I. work on his father\u2019s property during I.\u2019s administrative detention. The domestic courts relied in that respect on the testimony of police officers, indicating that the applicant had called to release I. to Sh. and both witness testimony and documentary evidence that it had been Sh. who had taken I. during his administrative detention to work on the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s property. While I.\u2019s testimony seems to be the only source of evidence on the fact that his work was not remunerated, the domestic courts did not single out this element as being decisive for his conviction. Similarly, while I.\u2019s evidence appears to have been important in establishing the fact that the applicant actually conspired with the police to fabricate a case against him, this was not the only evidence. This fact was also established by way of documentary evidence and police officer B.\u2019s testimony, to the effect that the applicant initiated the false proceedings against I. In view of the above, the Court, therefore, does not find it necessary to make a definitive finding as to whether the evidence provided by I. was \u201cdecisive\u201d as\u00a0in any case it is satisfied that his statements carried significant weight and their admission as evidence may have handicapped the applicant\u2019s defence.",
