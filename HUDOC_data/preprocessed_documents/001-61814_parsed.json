The convening authority was central to the prosecution in naval courts-martial and similar connections in rank and command structure existed between the members of naval courts-martial and that authority. The Commission also noted that the naval convening authority could also countermand the ordering of a court-martial before its commencement and dissolve a court-martial during the trial (orders 13(2) and 28(2) of the 1991 Orders). While the post court-martial \u201cconfirming\u201d stage did not exist in the naval court-martial procedure (a point raised by the Government in the present case), the Commission observed that the convening authority retained extensive powers as regards suspending a sentence (sections 90 and 92 of the 1957 Act).

However, the  judgment also referred in that context to the superiority in rank of the convening officer, which was the position in the present case. While the Government suggested that the applicant should have challenged the composition of the court-martial, they did not indicate on what basis he could have done so when he did not question the subjective impartiality of any member and when the court-martial was convened in accordance with domestic law.

In particular, the prosecuting, convening and adjudication roles of the former convening authority were divided between separate authorities. However, the Court has recently found even this new system to give rise to objective independence and impartiality issues constituting a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (the above-cited Grieves v.\u00a0the United Kingdom judgment): the current naval system still provided insufficient guarantees of independence and impartiality, in particular, because it did not have the added guarantees of a civilian Judge Advocate and of a Permanent President (the Grieves case, \u00a7\u00a7 80-89), positions for which the 1957 Act did not provide.

Since the final decision in Mr Cooper\u2019s domestic proceedings lay with a judicial authority (the Courts-Martial Appeal Court), the role of the post-trial reviewing authority was not considered to breach the independence and impartiality requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (the above-cited Cooper case, \u00a7\u00a7 130-133).
