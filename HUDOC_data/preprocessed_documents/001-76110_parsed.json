Accordingly, insofar as the judgments have not yet been enforced (see \u00a7 15 above), the applicants are still entitled to recover the principal amount of the debt in the course of domestic proceedings. The Court recalls that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0 (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v. , no.\u00a053431/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 23 October 2003 and Makarova and Others v. , no. 7023/03, \u00a7\u00a037, 24 February 2005). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violations found. It therefore considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the awards made by the domestic courts. For this reason the Court does not find it necessary to make an award for pecuniary damage in so far as it relates to the principal amount.",
