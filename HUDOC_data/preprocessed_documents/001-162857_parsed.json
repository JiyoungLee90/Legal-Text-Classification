The Court reiterates that a substantial delay in the identification of the cause of a death, unless it is justified by objective circumstances, can in and of itself undermine public confidence in the maintenance of the rule of law and thereby raise an issue under the Convention (see, e.g., Prynda v. Ukraine, no. 10904/05, \u00a7\u00a7 48-57, 31\u00a0July 2012 Merkulova v. Ukraine, no. 21454/04, \u00a7\u00a7 50-51, 3 March 2011, Sergiyenko v. Ukraine, no. 47690/07, \u00a7 52-53, 19\u00a0April 2012). This is all the more so where the investigation is characterized, as in the present case, by repeated discontinuation and reopening of the investigation as a result of the insufficiency of the measures taken by the inquiring officers (see, e.g., Dudnyk v. Ukraine, no. 17985/04, \u00a7 36, 10 December 2009; Oleynikova v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 38765/05, \u00a7 81, 15 December 2011; Zubkova v.
