Its key purpose is to prevent arbitrary or unjustified deprivations of liberty. Three strands of reasoning in particular may be identified as running through the Court\u2019s case-law: the exhaustive nature of the exceptions, which must be interpreted strictly and which do not allow for the broad range of justifications under other provisions (Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention in particular); the repeated emphasis on the lawfulness of the detention, both procedural and substantive, requiring scrupulous adherence to the rule of law. One of the most common types of deprivation of liberty in connection with criminal proceedings is detention pending trial. Such detention constitutes one of the exceptions to the general rule stipulated in Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 that everyone has the right to liberty and is provided for in sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. The period to be taken into consideration starts when the person is or remanded in custody, and ends when he or she is released and/or the charge is determined, even if only by a court of first instance (see Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova [GC], no. 23755/07, \u00a7 84 and 85, ECHR 2016, with further references).",

Article 331 further obliges the courts to decide on further preventive measure upon request of the prosecution or the defence, and in some circumstances even on the court\u2019s own motion (see paragraph 25 above). It does not appear that they are required by that provision to give reasons for continuing the accused\u2019s detention or to fix any time-limit when extending it. It further notes, however, that there is a general provision in Article 197 suggesting that decisions ordering detention are valid for a maximum of sixty days at any stage of the investigation and trial, and that was the case in the decision of 1\u00a0October 2013 criticised by the applicant. Indeed, the court upheld the applicant\u2019s detention until 29\u00a0November 2013 (see paragraph 12 above). It follows that this part of the applicant\u2019s complaint is not based on the factual circumstances of his case and the Court is not called upon to decide as a purely theoretical exercise whether Article 315 should contain specific reference to the courts\u2019 obligation to fix timelimits when extending pre-trial detention.",

That left the applicant in a state of uncertainty as to the grounds for his detention after that date. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time is incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Yeloyev v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a017283/02, \u00a7 54, 6 November 2008; Nakhmanovich v.

In these circumstances, the Court considers that the District Court\u2019s decision of 1 October 2013 did not afford the applicant adequate protection from arbitrariness, which is an essential element of the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention within the meaning of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention.",

It observes that the seriousness of the charges against him and the risk of his absconding had been mentioned in the initial decision ordering his detention. Those reasons, as well as the risk of him influencing the course of investigation, which was added soon after (see paragraphs 8 and 13), remained the same grounds for his detention until his conviction, with the exception of the decision of 1\u00a0October 2013, which contained no grounds whatsoever (see\u00a0paragraphs\u00a012 and 34 above). Thereafter, the courts used the same grounds for extending the applicant\u2019s detention. However, under Article 5 \u00a7 3, justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities. The arguments for and against release, including a risk that the accused might hinder the proper conduct of the proceedings, must not be taken in abstracto, but must be supported by factual evidence. The danger of an accused\u2019s absconding cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the sentence risked. It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Strogan v. Ukraine, no. 30198/11, \u00a7 97, 6 October 2016). The Court notes that decisions on the applicant\u2019s detention were couched in general terms and contained repetitive phrases. They do not suggest that the courts made an appropriate assessment of the facts relevant to the question of whether such a preventive measure was necessary in the circumstances at the respective stage of proceedings. Moreover, with the passage of time the applicant\u2019s continued detention required more justification, but the courts did not provide any further reasoning. Furthermore, at no stage did the domestic authorities consider any other preventive measures as an alternative to detention (see\u00a0Osypenko v. Ukraine, no. 4634/04, \u00a7\u00a7 77 and 79, 9\u00a0November 2010).",
