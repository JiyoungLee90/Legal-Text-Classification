In the Court\u2019s view, that is precisely what occurred in the instant case. The successful invocation by the accused of the Article 239a remedy brought to an abrupt end a deficient investigation marked by an obstinate refusal of the prosecutor to address the concerns repeatedly expressed by the courts.

Where this discretion is capable of being exercised arbitrarily or in bad faith, as is suggested by the facts of the instant case, the very object of the procedural requirement of Article 3 is undermined, since the punishment component can never materialise notwithstanding that the investigation was capable of identifying the offender or offenders.",

Even assuming that the prosecutors in the present case acted in the sincere belief that these facts and evidence did not justify a decision to indict the suspect/s in question, we fail to see any justification for the absence of further diligent investigation of other avenues which the prosecution authorities might have seen as a more plausible explanation of the origin of the applicant\u2019s serious injuries. In the opinion of one of the judges in the appeal proceedings, \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s conclusions suggested that ... the applicant had somehow injured himself or had been attacked by unknown individuals...[H]aving regard to the time and location of the incident as suggested by the prosecutor, namely while the applicant was retuning home, it was very unlikely that this would have gone unnoticed.\u201d",

We regret that the present judgment fails to examine the extent to which the demonstrated arbitrary exercise of prosecutorial discretion contributed to the respondent Government\u2019s failure to meet the obligations under Article 3. Unaccountable discretion renders meaningless the positive obligation to conduct an investigation capable of leading to punishment and, in practice, relegates the victim to the position obtaining before the development of the positive obligation doctrine in the context of Articles 2 and 3.",
