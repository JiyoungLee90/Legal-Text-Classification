In that case the Court held that there may be disputes of pecuniary nature which, nevertheless, \u201cbelong exclusively to the realm of public law and are accordingly not covered by the notion of civil rights and obligations\u201d (\u00a7\u00a050). Thus, in Finkelberg v. Latvia (dec., no. 55091/00, 18\u00a0October 2001) the Court held that a taxation dispute did not fall under Article 6 of the Convention. In Pan\u010denko v. , (dec., no. 40772/98, 28\u00a0October 1999) the Court recalled that the Convention does not guarantee, as such, socio-economic rights.

They noted that in the case Pravednaya v. Russia (no. 69529/01, 18\u00a0November 2004) the Court regarded a judicial award of that type as the applicant's \u201cpossessions\u201d. In that case the Court ordered restoring the initial judgment in the applicant's favour and paying pension in the amount defined by that judgment. However, in the Government's view, such approach creates confusion. If the sum awarded by the court is the \u201cpossession\u201d of the pensioner, it should not be affected by future raises of the pension rates. Therefore, in Pravednaya the applicant has to return the money she has already received from the Pension Fund by virtue of the recent changes in the legislation on the State pensions. They conclude that in order to avoid such situations the Court should not regard the amounts of pension awarded by the domestic courts as the claimants' \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

However, the courts ordered the application of a certain multiplier to her existing pension; therefore, the amount due to her could easily have been calculated and the Pension Fund had no discretion in this respect, unlike the Government in the Kiryanov case (see also Mihailov v. , no. 52367/99, \u00a7\u00a034, 21 July 2005). The enforcement proceedings were initiated, and as follows from the writ of execution of 14\u00a0December 1999 the bailiffs invited the Pension Fund to pay money to the applicant.

It is beyond doubt that the pension and the related benefits, which are purely economic in nature, are \u201ccivil\u201d rights within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Francesco Lombardo, cited above, pp. 26-27, \u00a7 17, Schuler-Zgraggen v.

The Court underlines in this respect that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not include a right to acquire property, in particular, to receive a social security benefit or pension. It places no restriction on the Contracting State's freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme (see Stec and Others v. the  [GC], no. 65731/01, \u00a7\u00a053, 12 April 2006). However, it was a long and well-established practice of this Court to regard court awards of pecuniary nature against the State, whatever their origin may be, as \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol no. 1 (see, among many other authorities, Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania, judgment of 28 October 1999, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1999-VII; see also Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2003\u2013X; see also Androsov mentioned above, \u00a7 55). Whereas a mere expectation to receive a pension is not protected by the Convention, a \u201clegitimate\u201d one does attract protection of Article 1 of Protocol no. 1. An expectation may become \u201clegitimate\u201d, for example, by virtue of a final court judgment, as in the present case. The Court reiterates in this respect that the judgment was sufficiently clear and specific to be enforceable (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above). Therefore, its annulment constituted an interference with the applicant's \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol no. 1.",
