The Court of Appeal found that the District Court had erred in considering that the formal expropriation order had been issued in an untimely fashion, a determination which had led the latter court conclude that the transfer of the property had occurred by means of the application of the constructive-expropriation principle. At the outset, the court made a finding to the effect that the applicant had failed to provide evidence that the duration of the period of lawful occupation in the case at hand had been set for a time-frame inferior to the five-year period prescribed by the relevant legislation in force at the time. The appellate court went on to note that, as it considered the occupation to have commenced on the date the authorities first took physical possession of the land in on 22 October 1989 (see paragraph 5 above) \u2013 which was the date referred to by the first-instance court (see paragraph 10 above) \u2013 the period of lawful occupation of the land should have expired on 23\u00a0October 1994. However, the court pointed out that, on the basis of the legislation applicable at the time, five-year lawful occupation periods were to be considered automatically extended for a further period of two years. It followed that the deadline for the issuing of an expropriation order had been extended until 23 October 1996. Accordingly, the court concluded that the expropriation order had been issued in a timely fashion, that is to say within the period of lawful occupation.",

In support of her arguments, the applicant relied on the judgment of the Benevento District Court, which had made a finding to this effect (see paragraph 10 above). However, the Court notes that the Benevento District Court judgment had been appealed against the Naples Court of Appeal and proceedings were pending before the latter court on 23 May 2006 when the respondent Government were notified of the case, when the Government submitted their first and second sets of observations on 21 September 2006 and 3 May 2007 respectively, and when the applicant submitted her observations on 19 March 2007. The Court notes that the proceedings came to a conclusion on 28 May 2008, with the judgment of the Naples Court of Appeal. In that judgment, the court overturned the first-instance judgment and found that the transfer of ownership at issue had not occurred by means of constructive expropriation and had been, on the contrary, carried out in accordance with the law (see paragraph 12 above).\u00a0\u00a0The Court further points out that, as the applicant did not lodge an appeal with the Court of Cassation, the Court of Appeal judgment was the final determination on the issue of whether or not the deprivation of the applicant\u2019s property had been lawful.\u00a0Bearing in mind that it is primarily for the domestic courts to interpret the relevant domestic law, and that the decision of the Court of Appeal, based on the full knowledge of the relevant facts, does not appear arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable, the Court sees no reason to call its findings into question.",
