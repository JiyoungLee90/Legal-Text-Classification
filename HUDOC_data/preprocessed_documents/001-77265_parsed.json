As to the Government's argument that the case raised complex legal questions before the , the Court notes that this court, referring to its previous case-law, declined to deal with the applicant's complaint for lack of prospect of success. In any event, the Court observes that there was a period of inactivity of three years three months and some two weeks before the Administrative Court, namely from 17\u00a0May\u00a01999 (when the IAP filed its observations) until 3\u00a0September\u00a02002 (when the Administrative Court decided).

The Court reiterates that Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 does not prohibit the use of presumption of fact or law, if they remain within reasonable limits which take into account the importance of what is at stake and maintain the rights of the defence (see Salabiaku\u00a0v.\u00a0France, judgment of 7 October 1988, Series A no. 141A, \u00a7\u00a028). In the present case, the applicant was not left without means of defence: Mr S, a Polish national was found to be working on the construction site of the M company without an employment or work permit. The applicant, the managing director of the M company, tried to allege that he was not at fault as he had not known about the illegal employment of Mr\u00a0S and had ordered a subordinate to observe the legality of the company's employment policy. The Austrian authorities rejected this argument as they found that the applicant had not set up an effective control system on whether his orders had been respected. The Court cannot find that by doing so, the Austrian authorities overstepped the limits set out by Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02 (see mutatis mutandis Bruckner v. , no. 21442/93, Commission decision of 18 October 1994).",
