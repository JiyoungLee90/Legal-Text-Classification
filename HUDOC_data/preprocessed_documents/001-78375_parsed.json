However, in the Antonenkov and Others case (see, Antonenkov and Others v. , no. 14183/02, \u00a7\u00a7 59-67, 22 November 2005), where the length of the impugned restriction within the course of criminal proceedings was four years and ten months, the Court found no violation of Article 2 of Protocol\u00a0No. 4.
