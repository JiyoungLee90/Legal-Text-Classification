The applicant had conspired with T. and Z. to approach the director of the brewery to extort 350,000 Russian roubles (RUB) from the head of the brewery in exchange for covering up those irregularities. The head had agreed to pay RUB\u00a0200,000. On the day of payment the applicant prepared an amended assessment report on the brewery\u2019s immovable property, signed it in his office and affixed the seal of the Property Management Committee.

Particulars of the offence play a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of their service that the suspect is formally put on notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him (see Kamasinski v. Austria judgment of 19\u00a0December\u00a01989, Series A no. 168, pp. 36-37, \u00a7 79). Article\u00a06 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention affords the defendant the right to be informed not only of the cause of the accusation, that is to say the acts he is alleged to have committed and on which the accusation is based, but also the legal characterisation given to those acts.

In this respect it is to be observed that Article 6 \u00a7 3 (a) does not impose any special formal requirement as to the manner in which the accused is to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. The Court further recalls that sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article 6 \u00a7 3 are connected and that the right to be informed of the nature and the cause of the accusation must be considered in the light of the accused\u2019s right to prepare his defence (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v.

Equally, the arguments before the trial court were confined to the offence of attempted large-scale bribery under Article 290. The prosecution did not appeal against the trial judgment, a fact which leads the Court to surmise that they had no objections to the trial court\u2019s legal characterisation of the applicant\u2019s acts. Hence, the Court finds nothing to suggest that the applicant was made aware, at any time before the final pleadings before the court of appeal, that he risked conviction under Article 159 of the Criminal Code.",

The offence of fraud presupposes that another person\u2019s property is obtained by specific means, namely deception or abuse of confidence, the perpetrator being aware that the victim divests him- or herself of the asset on account of the deceitful conduct. The objective element of bribe-taking consists in accepting valuable assets in exchange for acts or omissions within the perpetrator\u2019s professional competence and its subjective element requires that the bribe-taker be aware that he obtains the asset precisely for the requested acts or omissions in the interest of the bribe-giver. Taking into account these differences, the Court does not consider that it was sufficiently foreseeable for the applicant that he could be convicted of attempted fraud instead of attempted bribe-taking (compare P\u00e9lissier and Sassi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a057-59; and, mutatis mutandis, Miraux v. , no.\u00a073529/01, \u00a7\u00a036, 26 September 2006). Nor is the Court convinced by the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant could have anticipated the amendment of the charges against him because he was represented by an experienced lawyer. It has already dismissed such arguments in a similar context, finding that a mere reference to the abstract possibility that a court might arrive at a different conclusion than the prosecution on the issue of the qualification of an offence is not sufficient for a proper exercise of the right to defence (see I.H. and Others v. , no.\u00a042780/98, \u00a7\u00a034, 20 April 2006). Furthermore, in so far as the Government argued that a more lenient provision had been applied, the Court considers that this fact is irrelevant to the case at hand since the thrust of the applicant\u2019s complaint is not the severity of the punishment but the alleged breach of his right to be informed of the charges against him and his ability to prepare his defence and, in any event, the appeal court upheld the applicant\u2019s imprisonment term.",

Nevertheless, given the obvious differences in the constitutive elements of the offences described above, the Court considers it plausible to argue that the applicant\u2019s defence to the charges of attempted fraud would have been different from that used to contest attempted bribe-taking (compare Sadak and Others, \u00a7\u00a055, and P\u00e9lissier and Sassi, \u00a7\u00a060, both cited above).",

Taking into account the fact that the judgment in the applicant\u2019s case became final and no ordinary appeal lay against it (see Nikitin v. , no.\u00a050178/99, \u00a7\u00a039, ECHR 2004VIII), it appears that there was no further instance where the applicant could have advanced his defence against the reformulated charge (see, by contrast, Dallos, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050; Lakatos v.
