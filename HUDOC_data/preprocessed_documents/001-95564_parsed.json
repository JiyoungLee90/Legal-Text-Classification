In addition, the National Bank of  was required to grant national-currency loans (initially, interest-free) to commercial banks to the value of the redeposited foreign currency. It should be underlined, however, that such redepositing was as a rule only a paper transaction, because commercial banks had insufficient liquid funds: it would appear that commercial banks redeposited in total 12.2 billion United States dollars (USD), out of which only USD 1.7 billion (approximately 14%) was actually transferred to the National Bank of Yugoslavia (see Kova\u010di\u0107 and Others v.

The SFRY turned to international capital markets and soon became one of the most indebted countries in the world. When the international community backed away from the loose lending practices of the 1970s, the SFRY resorted to foreign-currency savings of its citizens to pay foreign debts and finance imports. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has established that, as a result, a major part of the original deposits ceased to exist before the dissolution of the SFRY (see its Resolution 1410 (2004) adopted on 23\u00a0November 2004 \u2013 reproduced in Kova\u010di\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 188 \u2013 as well as the explanatory memorandum by Mr Erik Jurgens). While it is true that \u201cold\u201d foreign-currency claims as such survived the dissolution of the SFRY and that Bosnia and Herzegovina assumed full liability for such claims in locally based banks, the fact that the original deposits had been spent, in all probability, by the former regime explains why Bosnia and Herzegovina has not been able to allow the uncontrolled withdrawal of these deposits.",

While understandable in view of past abuses (see paragraphs 19 and 47 above), such concerns are unsubstantiated. Unlike privatisation certificates under the former legislation, government bonds under the current legislation may be traded on the Stock Exchange, which, together with the interest on the bonds (at an annual rate of 2.5%) and the relatively short amortisation period, should ensure a significantly higher price. Indeed, such bonds are at present sold in the Republika Srpska for around 90% of their nominal value. There is no reason why such bonds should be traded for anything less in the Br\u010dko District or, once issued, in the Federation of Bosnia and . Anyhow, the applicant is not required to sell government bonds in order to obtain his \u201cold\u201d foreign-currency savings. He could instead opt for cash payments in eight instalments. As opposed to privatisation certificates under the former legislation, government bonds under the current legislation are not designed to replace cash payments. On the contrary, their function is to make early cash payments possible for those who are unable or unwilling to wait until the end of the amortisation period (27 March 2015 in the applicant's case).",

Indeed, the Court's task as defined by Article 19, that is, to \u201censure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto\u201d, is not necessarily best achieved by repeating the same findings in large series of cases (see, by analogy, E.G. v. Poland (dec.), no.\u00a050425/99, \u00a7\u00a027, ECHR 2008-...). The object of the pilot-judgment procedure is to facilitate the speediest and most effective resolution of a dysfunction affecting the protection of the Convention rights in question in the national legal order (see Wolkenberg and Others v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no.\u00a050003/99, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR 2007XIV). While the respondent State's action should primarily aim at the resolution of such a dysfunction and at the introduction, where appropriate, of effective domestic remedies in respect of the violations in question, it may also include ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers in line with the Convention requirements. The Court may decide to adjourn the examination of all similar cases, thus giving the respondent State an opportunity to settle them in such various ways (see, by analogy, Broniowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0198, and Xenides-Arestis v. , no.\u00a046347/99, \u00a7\u00a050, 22 December 2005). If, however, the respondent State fails to adopt such measures following a pilot judgment and continues to violate the Convention, the Court will have no choice but to resume the examination of all similar applications pending before it and to take them to judgment so as to ensure effective observance of Convention (see, by analogy, E.G. v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a028).",

Notably, the Court considers that government bonds must be issued and any outstanding instalments must be paid in the Federation of Bosnia and  within six months from the date on which the present judgment becomes final. Within the same time-limit, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina must also undertake, as the Republika Srpska and the Br\u010dko District did (see paragraph 31 above), to pay default interest at the statutory rate in the event of late payment of any forthcoming instalment. As regards the past delays, the Court does not find it necessary, at present, to order that adequate redress be awarded to all persons affected.
