The case originated in an application (no. 44137/12) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by a Russian national, Mr Aleksandr Anatolyevich Volkov (“the applicant”), on 7 July 2012.
The applicant was represented by Ms M. Maryasova, a lawyer practising in Novosibirsk.
The application was communicated to the Russian Government (“the Government”).
The relevant details of the application are set out in the appended table.
The applicant complained of the inadequate conditions of his detention. He also raised other complaints under the provisions of the Convention.
The Government submitted a declaration with a view to resolving the issues raised by the applicant.
In particular, the Government acknowledged that the conditions of the applicant’s detention in facility no. IZ-42/2 in Novokuznetsk had not complied with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention. They offered to pay the applicant the sum of 4,480 euros and invited the Court to strike the application out of the list of cases in accordance with Article 37 § 1 (c) of the Convention. The amount would be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable on the date of payment, and would be payable within three months from the date of notification of the Court’s judgement. In the event of failure to pay this amount within the abovementioned three-month period, the Government undertook to pay simple interest on them, from the expiry of that period until settlement, at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points. The declaration did not mention the applicant’s complaint concerning the inadequate conditions of detention in correctional colonies, no. IK-13 in Nizhniy Tagil and no. IK-2 in Yekaterinburg.
The applicant informed the Court that he agreed to the terms of the declaration.
