This was so, even if due to the rate of inflation throughout the years, the rent due was now to be considered low.

The owner was only able to gain back the possession of the property by requesting authorisation from the Rent Regulation Board on condition that the owner was able to prove that the lessee was not paying the rent or that the property was needed for the accommodation for the owner himself or his ascendants and descendents. Act I of 1925 was intended to provide such protection until 1929. By means of Act XXIII of 1929 the obligation of renewal of leases was extended until 1933. In the meantime, in 1931, Ordinance XXI had been promulgated (originally Chapter 109 of the Laws of Malta, today Chapter 69 of the Laws of Malta), which provided that the obligation to renew a lease was an indefinite obligation.

Thus, in the Government\u2019s view, the applicants had not been subjected to an interference and could not claim to be victims of the alleged violation.",

Moreover, the Court observed that when such applicants had inherited the property in question they had been unable to do anything more than attempt to use the available remedies, which had been to no avail in their circumstances. The decisions of the domestic courts regarding their request had thus constituted interference in their respect. Furthermore, those applicants, who had inherited a property that had already been subject to a lease, had not had the possibility to set the rent themselves (or to freely terminate the agreement). It followed that they could not be said to have waived any rights in that respect. Accordingly, the Court found that the rentcontrol regulations and their application in those cases had constituted an interference with the applicants\u2019 right (as landlords) to use their property (see, for example, Zammit and Attard Cassar v. Malta, no. 1046/12, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05051, 30 July 2015).",

The applicants submitted that EUR 1,164.69 annually was also disproportionate prior to 2014, given that, for example, calculations based on the property price index showed that in 2004 rent would have worked out to two thirds of that rent [i.e. around EUR\u00a0179,400].

The rent from 2023 onwards will be regulated by the index of inflation, which was generally substantially low  for instance, the rate of inflation for the year 2014 was 0.31% and the rate for 2013 was 1.38%. The Regulations also provided a premium of 5% per annum on the profits of the lessee. However, theses profits were not foreseeable since the profits may vary from year to year. The fact remained that (in 2017) the applicants were receiving a rent of around EUR\u00a03,000 while the rental market value was one hundred times as much (EUR\u00a0350,000 annually according to an expert report submitted to the Court).",

The Government explained that band clubs were prominent institutions and social centres in all towns and villages and the two Valetta band clubs practically enjoyed a national status in the Maltese cultural landscape. They noted that such clubs could not function in small secluded premises as they were at the heart of the village/town feast and that on the days before the feast and during the feast people would come together at the club to socialise whilst band marches were played in the centre of the village or town.

Subsequently, until 2004, it could still not be said to be a low rent unless it was compared to rents charged to commercial entities or to Maltese persons who struggled to pay high rents. The Government emphasised that the rental valuation presented by the applicants (EUR 269,100 annually in 2014) was excessive and the applicants had not shown that there had been anyone willing to pay that amount. Indeed the Government had, during domestic proceedings, submitted a rental valuation of EUR 93,000 annually (in 2014).

In situations where the operation of rent-control legislation involves wide-reaching consequences for numerous individuals and has economic and social consequences for the country as a whole, the authorities must have considerable discretion not only in choosing the form and deciding on the extent of control over the use of property but also in deciding on the appropriate timing for the enforcement of the relevant laws. Nevertheless, that discretion, however considerable, is not unlimited and its exercise cannot entail consequences at variance with the Convention standards (see Fleri Soler and Camilleri v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a035349/05, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR\u00a02006X). However, these principles do not necessarily apply in the same manner where an interference effecting property belonging to private individuals is not aimed at securing the social welfare of tenants or preventing homelessness (ibid. \u00a7\u00a077). In such cases the effects of the rent-control measures are subject to closer scrutiny at the European level (ibid., in connection with property requisitioned for use as government offices).",

The Government did not submit any figures in relation to that period (despite admitting that there was a boom in the property market, see paragraph 89 below). The Court observes that the Government implicitly accepted that the applicable rent was a low rent (see paragraph 46 above). Indeed, contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, the Court sees no reason why the applicable rent should not be compared to \u201crents charged to commercial entities or to Maltese persons\u201d which are the relevant comparators and therefore the rent applicable to them is precisely what constitutes a current market value.

The Court notes that, while the Regulations allowed for more or less double the rent previously received by the applicants, it still amounted to around 3% of the rental value estimated by the Government for the year 2014 (and around 1% of that estimated by the applicants). It was also around EUR 14,000 less than the rent the KOBC was obtaining for the use of part of the first floor by the catering facility. The Court thus considers that the situation following the 2014 remains disproportionate, and without any action by the legislature, it is likely to remain so indefinitely.",

While the applicants do not have an absolute right to obtain rent at market value, the Court observes that, despite the recent amendments, the amount of rent is very much lower than the market value of the premises. Furthermore, the restriction on the applicants\u2019 rights has been in place for fifty years since the Convention came into effect in respect of Malta, and will remain so perpetually in the absence of any action by the legislature to establish the required balance.

It is also in such contexts that effective procedural safeguards become indispensable (see, mutatis mutandis, Zammit\u00a0and Attard Cassar, cited above, \u00a7 63). The Government argued that there existed procedural safeguards, without mentioning what these were, preferring to rely on the fact that the applicants had no right to complain given their ancestors\u2019 knowledge of the applicable laws seventy years ago. The Court notes that the latter argument has repeatedly been rejected by the Court, as was done in paragraph 35 of the present case. From the information available to the Court, there were no avenues - other than constitutional redress proceedings  which the applicants could pursue to ameliorate their situation (if circumstances so required).

The Court reiterates that no discrimination is disclosed as a result of a particular date being chosen for the commencement of a new legislative regime and differential treatment arising out of a legislative change is not discriminatory where it has a reasonable and objective justification in the interests of the good administration of justice (see Amato Gauci, cited above, \u00a7 71). While the Government failed to substantiate their claim that persons leasing out property for commercial purposes were suffering more than people in the applicants\u2019 position, the fact that commercial premises deserved lesser protection is for the purpose of this part of the assessment an acceptable argument.

The Court notes that it has already found above (see paragraphs 62 and\u00a066 above) that the 2014 amendments were of little comfort to the applicants, who continued to suffer a breach of their property rights. Indeed more than eight years have passed since the 2009 amendments and the situation of persons in the applicants\u2019 position remains the same. According to the Government this different level of improvement was justified because band clubs were more deserving of protection.

In the present case the measure complained of by the applicants is that, according to the law at present, their property will not be \u201creleased\u201d in 2028, while that of their comparators will. Thus, such an action will come to be in respect of their comparator only in ten years\u2019 time.

On the other hand by taking into account the valuation of the defendants the rent that should have been received would have been around EUR 5 million, which was still a considerable sum. Thus, the compensation of EUR\u00a0300,000 awarded to the applicants by the first-instance constitutional jurisdiction was a very conservative one, albeit one which, in the circumstances, the applicants had been willing to accept. However, the applicants noted that they were still suffering from the violation which would persist ad infinitum. They therefore submitted a fresh updated architect report dated 2017 which estimated a fair rental value for that year as being EUR 352,550 annually (comprising EUR 111,750 for the ground floor as commercial premises, EUR 58,800 for the mezzanine, and EUR\u00a091,000 each for the second and third floor rented out as offices). The report took into account the properties found in the same street as the applicants\u2019 property and the particular features and characteristics of the property at issue. On the basis of that report and relevant calculations back dating the rent for each of the relevant years (for example, the rent in 1967 is estimated as being approximately EUR 74,352, that in 1980 as being approximately EUR 153,958 and that in\u00a02000 as EUR 255,316), the total rent due was EUR 10,488,115.82 from which had to be deducted the rents actually received i.e. EUR 87,421.76.",

Moreover, the rent established willingly by the applicants\u2019 ancestors until 1962, which the Court found to be appropriate for 1960s \u2013 70s, was EUR\u00a01,164.69 annually, however, the backdated calculation submitted by the applicants estimates the market rent for that year as being EUR\u00a074,352. The Court therefore considers that such an estimate has no reasonable foundation in the reality of the time. With that in mind, and noting that the upper floors are lower in price (as also shown by the applicants\u2019 valuation) it would appear that the Government\u2019s valuation is closer to the actual reality. Thus, in assessing the pecuniary damage sustained by the applicants, the Court has considered the estimates provided in as far as appropriate and has had regard to the information available to it on rental values on the Maltese property market during the relevant period. It also takes into account that the applicants were satisfied with the award of EUR 300,000 granted by the first-instance domestic court. To that amount must be added a sum in respect of the annual rent lost for the period 2013 to date.",

It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to \u201cthe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms\u201d safeguarded by those provisions. The judges should take this principle into account and establish where is the core complaint  under the substantive provision or under Article 14. In the case of Biao v.\u00a0Denmark ([GC], no. 38590/10, 24 May 2016), the core complaint concerned the Danish authorities\u2019 refusal to grant the applicant and his wife family reunion in Denmark on the basis of the attachment requirement under national law. The attachment requirement was thus the principal issue of the case. The applicant insisted that the authorities had taken their decision as a result of an unjustified difference in treatment between Danish nationals of Danish ethnic origin and Danish nationals of other ethnic origin. In the Biao case, it could be accepted that the discrimination issue under Article 14 was more important and it was reasonable not to examine the case solely under Article 8. The dissenting judges took different positions as to whether it was necessary to examine Article 8 if there would be no violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8. Judge J\u00e4derblom preferred not to examine the application separately under Article 8, whereas judges Villiger, Mahoney and Kj\u00f8lbro considered it necessary to examine the application under Article 8 taken alone. However, in their view, it was clear that there had been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention, since the female applicant had no ties with Denmark and their family life in Denmark was not feasible.",

In the present case, we have both criteria in place, which enabled the Court to examine the complaint under Article 14 on the merits: the complaint was based on the provisions of national law establishing different treatment for commercial landlords and band clubs; although the relevant provisions will become effective as from 2028, they were enacted in 2008, and thus the national authorities have already expressed their views on the issue. Since the rent legislation in Malta broadly distinguished between residential and commercial premises, the difference in treatment could therefore be justified due to the wide margin of appreciation and the principle of subsidiarity. It is not for the international judge, but for the national authorities, to solve social problems, including those arising from the automatic renewal of lease agreements.",

The Court has found that a disproportionate and excessive burden was imposed on the applicants, arising mainly from the extremely low rent of these premises. Since Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 14 refer to different problems (economic and social) and to different issues (low rent and obligatory renewal of the lease), an examination by the Court of their merits is justified in the present case.",
