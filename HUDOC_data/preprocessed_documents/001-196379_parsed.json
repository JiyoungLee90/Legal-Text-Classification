In particular, the personal space per prisoner was reduced to 2.8075 sq. m and on 21 October 2009 to 2.41 sq. m. The Court finds that in these circumstances the reduction of the required personal space cannot be considered as \u201cshort, occasional and minor\u201d within the meaning of the Court\u2019s case-law (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0130). In addition, as noted above, the Government\u2019s submissions that the reductions in the required personal space were accompanied by mitigating factors were not confirmed by any evidence (see paragraph 21 above). It follows that in the present case the strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 cannot be rebutted.",
