They variously complained about violations of their right to respect for family life as guaranteed by Article\u00a08 of the Convention, on account of the taking into care of the children, the maintenance in force of the care order and the implementation of the care. On the latter point the first applicant and her children complained about the conditions in the foster homes and the restrictions on contact. In their view, the restrictions on telephone communications also violated Article\u00a010 of the Convention. The first\napplicant further complained under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention about the fairness and the length of the proceedings relating to the restrictions on her access to the children and about the length of the proceedings concerning the lifting of the care order. The other applicants alleged that the refusals of the Social Council to take any decision with regard to their rights of access had, in breach of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01, deprived them of any possibility of judicial review of the access restrictions imposed de facto. Finally, the first applicant and her sons complained that, contrary to Article\u00a025 of the Convention, their lawyer Mrs\u00a0Westerberg had not been allowed to meet the sons in order to complete the form for their application to the Commission and that they had been refused to use her as their legal representative under the national legal aid scheme.",

According to its case-law, the Court may order the reimbursement of legal costs only in so far as they have been actually and necessarily incurred in order to prevent or obtain redress for the matter found to constitute a violation of the \nConvention and were reasonable as to quantum (see, for instance, the Z v. Finland judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, p.\u00a0355, \u00a7 126).
