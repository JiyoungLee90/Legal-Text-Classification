The Court accepts that the actions of a private individual, M., and her relatives hindered the enforcement proceedings; however, it should be noted that M. and C. had been living in  quite openly. C. was attending a State secondary school and was an outpatient at a public hospital, and her mother M. had been in contact with the domestic authorities (see paragraphs\u00a015, 17, 19, 21, 24, 56 and 69 above). In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the bailiffs had an impossible task to perform in tracing their whereabouts and in at least bringing C. into contact with her father. The actions taken by the domestic authorities appeared to be formalistic and uncoordinated, although, according to the respondent Government, these had been the only steps possible for the enforcement of the judgment. The penalty provided by the domestic law for hindering the enforcement procedure is formulated in very general terms and the Government did not argue that the bailiffs could effectively have brought M. and her relatives to account for deliberate obstruction of the enforcement proceedings. At the same time the application of the only clearly formulated penalty against M. for failure to enforce the judgment, namely the fine (see paragraph 82 above), does not appear to be ever considered by the bailiffs, even though it would probably be to no avail until M. could be effectively located and contacted. If the competence of the bailiffs was limited, as the Government maintained, only to the actions that were actually taken by the bailiffs in this case, the applicant could not be reproached for not challenging the bailiffs\u2019 actions in the courts. Furthermore, the Government did not demonstrate in what way any further judicial action by the applicant could have accelerated the enforcement proceedings, nor did they furnish any examples of the domestic case-law applied to that effect in any previous cases of child abduction. Therefore, the Government\u2019s objection as to admissibility must be dismissed.",
