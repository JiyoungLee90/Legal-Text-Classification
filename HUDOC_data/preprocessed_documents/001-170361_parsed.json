The applicant had succumbed to depression, which had manifested itself in acute feelings of hopelessness and a perception that any future efforts would be futile, as well as in feelings of helplessness, insomnia, a disturbance of memory functions, and attention disorder. Those conditions had further led to a serious deterioration in the applicant\u2019s family environment, given that she had directed all her frustration and negative emotions towards her young daughter. The court awarded the applicant the entirety of her claim, namely about 20,000 euros (EUR), plus interest, as well about EUR 6,500 for costs and expenses. It further declared null and void the municipality\u2019s tacit refusal to act upon her request of 23 May 2008, and returned the case to it for it to take the appropriate action.",

The essence of these principles is that execution of a judgment given by any court must be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 and that a failure to enforce a binding judgment may therefore breach this Convention provision. The Court further reiterates that a \u201cclaim\u201d can constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 if it is sufficiently established to be enforceable (see Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v.

Accordingly, the applicant had a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court next observes that the authorities never enforced the final judgments in the applicant\u2019s favour. This was despite the fact that \u2013 before the shop was demolished in February\u00a02006 \u2013 two final judgments had been delivered in the applicant\u2019s favour (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above). Both judgments had ordered the municipal authorities to open a privatisation procedure in respect of the property, and the first judgment in particular had remained unenforced for over two years before the demolition. Even after the shop had been pulled apart, a third final judgment was delivered in the applicant\u2019s favour, confirming that the municipal authorities had to open a privatisation procedure in favour of the applicant. Furthermore, the Privatisation Agency, which had been approached by the municipality with a request for advice on how to proceed, also held that the municipality had been obliged to comply with the court judgments (see paragraph 19 above). Despite all these decisions, no action by the municipal authorities followed in respect of the implementation of the said judgments. The Government\u2019s contention in their submissions on the merits before the Court \u2013 namely that, because the shop had been erected on land restituted to private parties and its construction had not been solid, the applicant should have reasonably expected that the shop would be demolished sooner or later and that she could not have therefore entertained a legitimate expectation of being able to buy it (see paragraph 58 above) \u2013 does not sit well with the findings in the final judgments in the applicant\u2019s favour.",

However, the Court observes that, without prejudice to the steps which the municipal authorities could have taken before or after the demolition, the obligation for them to open a privatisation procedure remained unaltered (see paragraphs 7, 9, 11 and 19). They should have therefore complied with the essence of the three final judgments; however, the judgments in the applicant\u2019s favour remained unenforced and the applicant\u2019s claim for damages was rejected.",

The remaining part of the claim, the one against the municipal council for its failure to offer the shop for privatisation by the applicant, was examined at two levels of jurisdiction. The first-instance court found that claim well founded, in particular because the failure of the municipal council to start a privatisation procedure was unlawful and the applicant had suffered anxiety, acute stress and depression as a result of the non-enforcement of the final judgments in her favour. The court awarded her non-pecuniary damages (see paragraph 27 above). This decision was quashed on cassation for several reasons (see paragraphs 28-36 above) which the Court will examine below.",

The Court observes that the question as to whether the applicant had a valid rent contract and a right to buy the shop had been decided earlier in three separate final judgments, which had consistently found that the applicant had had a valid contract at the time of her lodging her requests for privatisation (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 11 above) and that the municipal authorities had been bound to make her a privatisation offer. By re-examining an issue that has already been decided by a final judicial decision in proceedings between the same parties, the Supreme Administrative Court did not act in conformity with the principle of legal certainty (see Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06162, ECHR 1999-VII; and, Kehaya and Others v. Bulgaria, nos.\u00a047797/99 and 68698/01, \u00a7 76, 12 January 2006).",

However, nothing in the domestic law suggests that the obligation to enforce the judicial decision recognising the applicant\u2019s right to buy the shop was extinguished with the refusal of the municipality of 25 November 2005 to enforce that decision. On the contrary, that right clearly continued to exist and the refusal to enforce the judgments recognising the applicant\u2019s right was an ongoing situation. The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s claim for damages concerned precisely the lack of enforcement of the final judgments in her favour and covered the whole period after the first final judgment in her favour of 4 November 2003 and until at least February 2006, when the shop was demolished and possibly even beyond that date (see paragraph\u00a023 above). Consequently, it finds that the breaking of the applicant\u2019s claim into separate sub-periods and the refusal to examine it as it had been made, namely as a claim based on an unlawful continuing refusal to enforce a final judicial decision, was unjustified and equated to a refusal to hear the applicant\u2019s claim.",

Neither can it be said that the last-instance court carried out a thorough examination of the applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary damages by considering the elements of evidence adduced by her.

Consequently, despite having pursued the compensatory remedy provided for under the SMRDA, the applicant was not able to obtain compensation for the lack of implementation of the judgments in her favour. Not only did she not obtain the enforcement due to her, but as a result of having attempted to seek damages she was obliged to pay a significant amount of money in costs and expenses to the municipality, which had blatantly refused to enforce final judgments in her favour. The Court finds that, instead of providing the applicant with appropriate compensation for the enforcement failure, this pecuniary obligation added considerably to the burden she had to endure on account of the lack of implementation of the judgments in her favour by the municipal authorities.",

An award may still be made notwithstanding the large number of imponderables involved in the assessment of future losses, though the greater the lapse of time involved the more uncertain the link becomes between the breach and the damage. The question to be decided in such cases is the level of just satisfaction, in respect of both past and future pecuniary loss, which it is necessary to award, the matter to be determined by the Court at its discretion, having regard to what is equitable (see ibid., \u00a7\u00a048, and Lustig-Prean and Beckett v. the United Kingdom (just satisfaction), nos. 31417/96 and 32377/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02223, 25 July 2000).",

Thus, the present case does not concern deprivation of existing property or an unconditional obligation on the part of the authorities to transfer property (see Stretch, cited above, \u00a7 50, and Basarba OOD v. Bulgaria (just satisfaction), no. 77660/01, \u00a7 22, 20 January 2011; and Kirilova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria (just satisfaction), nos. , ,  and\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27, 14 June 2007).",

As regards the different elements in the applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary damages, the Court finds as follows. In respect of the amount claimed for rent she had paid between January 1998 and February 2006, the Court does not find a connection between the violation it has found, namely a failure to enforce final judgments in the applicant\u2019s favour starting in November 2003, and the period referred to in the claim for damages for which no explanation has been provided. As regards the claim in relation to the construction she had intended to build on the plot, the Court finds it speculative, especially in view of the fact that the land on which the shop stood at the time did not form part of the property which the courts had ruled had to be offered to the applicant to buy under preferential conditions (see paragraph 7 above). Finally, as regards the amount claimed to represent the difference in the prices of the shop at the time of the first final judgment and at the time of the preparation of the expert report, the Court observes that this amount is based on an expert report presented solely by the applicant and that the estimated value of the shop indicated therein depended on an assessment of its life-span.",
