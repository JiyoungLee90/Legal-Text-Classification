In the present case, the compulsion was imposed in the context of section 172 of the Road Traffic Act, which imposes a specific duty on the registered keeper of a vehicle to give information about the driver of the vehicle in certain circumstances. The Court notes that although both the compulsion and the underlying offences were \u201ccriminal\u201d in nature, the compulsion flowed from the fact, as Lord Bingham expressed it in the Privy Council in the case of Brown v. Stott (see paragraph 31 above), that \u201cAll who own or drive motor cars know that by doing so they subject themselves to a regulatory regime. This regime is imposed not because owning or driving cars is a privilege or indulgence granted by the State but because the possession and use of cars (like, for example, shotguns ...) are recognised to have the potential to cause grave injury\u201d. Those who choose to keep and drive motor cars can be taken to have accepted certain responsibilities and obligations as part of the regulatory regime relating to motor vehicles, and in the legal framework of the United Kingdom, these responsibilities include the obligation, in the event of suspected commission of road traffic offences, to inform the authorities of the identity of the driver on that occasion.",

Section 172 (2)(a) applies only where the driver of the vehicle is alleged to have committed a relevant offence, and authorises the police to require information only \u201cas to the identity of the driver\u201d. The information is thus markedly more restricted than in previous cases, in which applicants have been subjected to statutory powers requiring production of \u201cpapers and documents of any kind relating to operations of interest to [the] department\u201d (Funke, referred to above, \u00a7 30), or of \u201cdocuments etc. which might be relevant for the assessment of taxes\u201d (J.B v. Switzerland, cited above, \u00a7 39). In the case of Heaney and McGuinness the applicants were required to give a \u201cfull account of [their] movements and actions during any specified period ...\u201d (referred to above, \u00a7\u00a024), and in that of Shannon, information could be sought (with only a limited legal professional privilege restriction) on any matter which appeared to the investigator to relate to the investigation (see reference at \u00a7 23 of the Shannon judgment referred to above). The information requested of the applicant in the case of Weh was limited, as in the present case, to \u201cinformation as to who had driven a certain motor vehicle ... at a certain time ...\u201d (Weh judgment cited above, \u00a7 24). The Court found no violation of Article 6 in that case on the ground that no proceedings were pending or anticipated against him. It noted that the requirement to state a simple fact \u2013 who had been the driver of the car \u2013 was not in itself incriminating (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 53-54). Further, as Lord Bingham noted in Brown v. Stott (paragraph 31 above), section 172 does not sanction prolonged questioning about facts alleged to give rise to criminal offences, and the penalty for declining to answer is \u201cmoderate and non-custodial\u201d.",

At his trial, he attempted to challenge the admission of the statement under sections 76 and 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, although the challenge was unsuccessful. It remained for the prosecution to prove the offence beyond reasonable doubt in ordinary proceedings, including protection against the use of unreliable evidence and evidence obtained by oppression or other improper means (but not including a challenge to the admissibility of the statement under section 172), and the defendant could give evidence and call witnesses if he wished. Again as noted in the case of Brown v. Stott, the identity of the driver is only one element in the offence of speeding, and there is no question of a conviction arising in the underlying proceedings in respect solely of the information obtained as a result of section 172(2)(a).",

No mention was made of the penalties applicable in the event of failure to comply with the order. Nevertheless, the Court considers that, in the circumstances, it must have been clear to the first applicant that failure to comply with the obligation would entail consequences, for instance the imposition of a fine. In Mr\u00a0Spanner\u2019s case the order to disclose the identity of the driver referred to section 1a taken in conjunction with section 4(2) of the Vienna Parking Meter Act, which makes the failure to provide information an offence punishable with a fine. Although the first applicant\u2019s case is less clear-cut than the second applicant\u2019s, the Court accepts that in both cases the compulsion was of a direct nature. The applicants were obliged on pain of a fine to provide the name and address of the person who had driven the car on the occasion of the commission of the underlying traffic offence. Like in O\u2019Halloran and Francis (cited above, \u00a7 57) it can be said that the compulsion flowed from the fact that owners or drivers of motor vehicles subject themselves to a regulatory regime involving certain responsibilities and obligations. In Austria, like in the , those obligations include the obligation, in the event of suspected commission of road traffic offences, to inform the authorities of the identity of the driver on that occasion.",

                                        "content": "54.\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the degree of compulsion, the Court notes that the maximum fines the applicants risked incurring amounted to ATS 30,000 (2,180 euros (EUR)) in Mr L\u00fcckhof\u2019s case and to ATS 3,000 (EUR 210) in Mr\u00a0Spanner\u2019s case. The fines actually imposed amounted to ATS 1,500 (EUR 105) in the first applicant\u2019s case and to ATS 500 (EUR 36) in the second applicant\u2019s case. In comparison, the Court notes that the applicants in O\u2019Halloran and Francis were liable to pay a fine of up to 1000 pounds sterling (GBP) (EUR 1,446) and disqualification from driving or an endorsement of up to three penalty points on their driving licence (ibid., \u00a7\u00a056). Mr Francis, who refused to give evidence, was actually ordered to pay a fine of GBP 750 (EUR 1,218) plus procedural costs and three penalty points. The Court considers that the difference as regards the penalties at stake is not decisive. The fact that, in Austrian administrative criminal law, fines are accompanied by default prison terms does not change that assessment. The default prison terms which amounted to two days\u2019 imprisonment in Mr L\u00fcckhof\u2019s case and to twelve hours\u2019 imprisonment in Mr Spanner\u2019s case may only be enforced after the conduct of a separate set of proceedings and if a number of conditions are met (see paragraph 39 above). Therefore it cannot be said that they brought direct pressure to bear on the applicants.",

In this context the Court reiterates that in the case of Weh (referred to above, \u00a7 24) it has already found that the requirement to state a simple fact, namely who the driver of the car was, was not in itself incriminating. Indeed, this distinguishes cases concerning the registered car keeper\u2019s obligation to disclose the identity of the driver from other cases, in which the authorities were entitled to seek comprehensive information or to subject the applicants to extensive questioning (see Funke, \u00a7 30; J.B. v.
