In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s representative charged EUR 2,380 for drafting the application submitted to the Court. The Court notes the representative doubled his fees due to the representation before an international court, which the Court finds rather unreasonable, since, for example, he was allowed to use the Slovene language before the Court. The Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant EUR 1,000 under that head, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant.",
