Article 6 \u00a7 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, ECHR 2005-II and Larin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 15034/02, \u00a7 35, 20 May 2010). A hearing may not be necessary in the particular circumstances of the case, for example when it raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties\u2019 written observations (see, mutatis mutandis, Fredin v. Sweden (no. 2), 23 February 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22, Series A no.\u00a0283-A, and Fischer v. Austria, 26 April 1995, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 312). Legal assistance in civil cases is not mandatory either, although, in certain circumstances, Article 6 \u00a7 1 may sometimes compel the State to provide for the assistance of a lawyer when such assistance proves indispensable for an effective access to court (see Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, \u00a7 26, Series\u00a0A no. 32, p. 14-16). In discharging its obligation to provide parties to civil proceedings with legal aid, when it is provided by domestic law, the State must display diligence so as to secure to those persons the genuine and effective enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under Article 6 (see Muscat v.\u00a0Malta, no. 24197/10, \u00a7 46, 17 July 2012, with further references therein).",

In the Court\u2019s view, they did not. The Government have accepted that the Court of Appeal\u2019s reference to the applicant\u2019s Article 30 complaint being vague was unfortunate. This is certainly the case, but it was also unfair. In the reasons accompanying her grounds of appeal the applicant referred to the right of litigants to present their case and to be defended by counsel, rights guaranteed by Article 30(3)(b) and (d) of the Constitution. In her skeleton argument \u2013 filed at the direction of the Court of Appeal \u2013 she developed her submissions based on Articles 30(3)(b) and (d), supplementing those submissions with references to the case-law of this Court on the corresponding provisions of Article 6. The Court of Appeal then heard oral submissions on the relevance of the Airey case to the issues it had to decide. By the time the Court of Appeal came to give judgment it could not reasonably be said that the applicant\u2019s Article 30 ground of appeal was vague and it was thus unfair to dismiss it for that reason. Neither could it be said that the applicant had not relied on any specific grounds for complaining that there had been a breach of the rules of natural justice granting a party the right to be heard in her own cause. Finally, contrary to the Government\u2019s submissions, this unfairness was not rescued by the Court of Appeal\u2019s view that the first instance judgment was a result of the applicant\u2019s total indifference to the proceedings. This view did not address the applicant\u2019s submissions as to why she had failed to attend on the trial date. Nor did it properly address one of the central issues in the case, the unfairness caused by the Family Court\u2019s decision to proceed to trial in the absence of the applicant in a case in which it could reasonably be expected that no further steps would be taken in the petition, including the filing of a defence, before the application for legal aid had been determined.",

However, the Court is unable to speculate as to what the outcome of those proceedings would have been had the Family Court heard the applicant before granting the petition.

Thus, they are in principle recoverable (see, for instance, Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) v. the United Kingdom, no. 11002/05, \u00a7\u00a058, ECHR 2007 ...). However, aside from the order concerning the EUR 2,056, the applicant has not provided an itemised bill of costs sufficiently substantiating her claims: the sums claimed are without reference to the number of hours worked to the hourly rate charged (see Efstathiou and Michailidis & Co. Motel Amerika v. Greece, no.\u00a055794/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2003IX). For this reason, the Court awards the applicant EUR 2,056 under this head and dismisses the remainder of her claim for costs. As regards the EUR 403 expenses incurred by the preparation of a valuation report, given that the Court has dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary damage, it follows the Court finds that this expense was not necessarily incurred and must be dismissed.",
