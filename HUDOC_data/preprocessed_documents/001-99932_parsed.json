In this connection, it observes that, after acquainting itself with the evidence and having had the benefit of hearing various witnesses and of evaluating their credibility, the , in its decision of 20 June 2003, found that all the complainants, including the applicants in the present cases, had been ill-treated by police officers from the Istanbul Security Headquarters. In convicting those police officers under Article 243 of the Criminal Code, the court also found that the police officers had inflicted such treatment intentionally in order to extract confessions (see paragraph 30 above). However, the proceedings were subsequently discontinued for being timebarred. In the instant case no cogent evidence has been provided which could lead the Court to depart from the findings of fact of the first-instance court in this respect. The Court therefore concludes that the ill-treatment inflicted on the applicants amounted to torture within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.",
