The Court considers that this complaint is very specific and does not constitute an elaboration of the applicant\u2019s initial complaints lodged in 2005.

Failure to comply with that obligations may lead the Court to find a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. However, the Court reiterates that, in order for ill-treatment to fall under Article 3 of the Convention, it must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of such minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the gender, age and state of health of the victim. Allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. The Court is mindful that the applicants might experience certain difficulties in procuring evidence to substantiate a complaint of ill-treatment. Nevertheless, in such cases applicants may well be expected to submit at least a detailed account of the facts complained of and provide \u2013 to the greatest possible extent \u2013 some evidence in support of their complaints (see Danilov v. Ukraine, no. 2585/06, \u00a7 78, 13 March 2014, with further references).",

As to his complaint concerning allegedly inadequate treatment for that disease, the applicant did not provide any evidence, for example, in the form of witness statements, that he had not received the anti-relapse medication to which the Government referred. He also did not provide any details about the manifestation of his TB during the period from February 2003 to June 2005 and the Court thus finds no reason to believe that during that period he suffered from categories 1-3 TB. The Court also observes that the applicant did not claim that his requests for medical aid were refused or that he was not able to undergo X-ray examinations every six months. In such circumstances the Court cannot conclude that the applicant\u2019s treatment from February 2003 to June 2005 was inadequate or that the reactivation of his TB and the deterioration of his health was imputable to the authorities.",

The Government\u2019s objection regarding non-compliance with the six-month rule must thus be rejected (see Worm v. Austria, 29 August 1997, \u00a7 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997V). The Court notes that the applicant described his alleged physical ill-treatment by the police in quite general terms and did not produce any evidence in support of his allegations of beating and threats having been issued by them. It also notes that the applicant did not complain about his alleged beating until July 2002 (see paragraph 27 above) \u2013 more than one year after the events in question. Such a delay undoubtedly undermined the authorities\u2019 chances of collecting any evidence in support of the applicant\u2019s allegations.

Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a052 and\u00a054, 27 November 2008). Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict that right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such a restriction \u2013 whatever its justification \u2013 must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will, in principle, be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police questioning without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (ibid., \u00a7 55).",

In the second stage, it must evaluate the prejudice caused to the rights of the defence by the restriction in the case in question.

In particular, the Government did not cite any legal norm which would justify their inaction. The Court cannot but conclude that their inaction was not in accordance with the domestic legal framework. At the same time, the effect of this unlawfulness on the overall fairness of the proceedings was likely mitigated by the fact that it occurred not at the very beginning of the investigation, but subsequently, after the applicant had been repeatedly advised of his rights, including his right to remain silent but still made incriminating statements, and after he had already provided the authorities with all the essential information (see paragraphs 11 and 15 above and contrast Ibrahim, cited above, \u00a7 303).",

Ukraine (no.\u00a0760/03, \u00a7 110, 26 July 2012) it found that the Ukrainian legal system did not provide prisoners with a clear and specific procedure to enable them to obtain copies of case documents after the conclusion of criminal proceedings. The Court does not find a reason to depart from that finding in the present case. As regards the Government\u2019s position, the Court observes that the applicant lodged his request for a copy of the document almost one year before his release on parole. At that stage it was not possible for him to obtain such a copy (see Vasiliy Ivashchenko, cited above). It was also impossible for him to foresee that in future he would be released and thus able to make such a copy in person. The Court thus rejects the Government\u2019s objections and finds that the State has failed to comply with its obligations under Article 34 of the Convention.",
