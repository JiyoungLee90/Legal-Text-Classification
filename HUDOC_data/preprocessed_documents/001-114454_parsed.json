Nevertheless, in such cases applicants may well be expected to submit at least a detailed account of the facts complained of and provide \u2013 to the greatest possible extent \u2013 some evidence in support of their complaints (see, mutatis mutandis, Visloguzov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a032362/02, \u00a7 45, 20 May 2010). The Court also recalls that the procedural obligation under Article 3 of the Convention to investigate an allegation of ill-treatment only arises where an individual raises an arguable claim that he has been subjected to ill-treatment prohibited by that provision (see, among many authorities, Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 102 et seq.).",

Meanwhile, during that questioning session the applicant made statements which gave serious grounds to consider him at least as an accomplice to the murder. In particular, his statements suggested that he had a motive to kill H. and the applicant\u2019s violent actions in respect of H. supported the existence of that motive. Therefore, in the context of the applicant\u2019s story his final remark that it had been L. who had decided to kill H. could not shade off the applicant. It follows that the initial statements, given by the applicant without a lawyer, affected his position in the further criminal proceedings.
