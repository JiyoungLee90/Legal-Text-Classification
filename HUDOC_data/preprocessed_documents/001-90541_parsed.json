They were considered speedily. On several occasions the defendants had to be summoned to rectify formal shortcomings in their requests. In this connection the court observed that the time-limits given had been complied with. Hence, no evidence was found in support of the conclusion that unreasonable delays had occurred in the case. The court concluded that nothing in the case file could suggest that the length of proceedings was excessive.",

Accordingly, if the complaint was drafted and lodged by a non-lawyer the court should consider primarily the general meaning and aim of the complaint and whether it corresponded in substance to the requirements of section 6 \u00a7 2 of the 2004 Act.
