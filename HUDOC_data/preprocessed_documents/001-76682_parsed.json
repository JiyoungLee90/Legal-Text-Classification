This is because, unlike the situations obtaining in all these cases, and in spite of the terminological similarity, review proceedings before the former Bulgarian Supreme Court were, after the reform of the CCP of 21 April 1990, not extraordinary proceedings, but part of the normal threeinstance proceedings (see Stoitchkov and Shindarov v. Bulgaria, nos. 24571/94 and 24572/94, Commission decision of 28 June 1995, Decisions and Reports 82, p. 85, at p. 94; Petrov v. Bulgaria, no. 24140/94, Commission decision of 22\u00a0February 1995, unreported; Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, Commission decision of 29 June 1998, unreported; Marintchev v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 43232/98, 8\u00a0July 2003; and Raichinov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 47579/99, 1 February 2005). This was so because (i) they were directly accessible to the litigants, (ii) were, as a rule, initiated, as in the case at hand, by the parties to the case, not by a thirdparty State official, (iii) the possibility of instituting them was subject to a relatively short timelimit, and (iv) in these proceedings the Supreme Court could, much as a court of cassation, examine whether the judgments of the courts below were contrary to the law or illfounded, or whether there had been a substantial breach of procedure, and had the power to quash them (see paragraphs 4345 above). Thus, although the  Regional Court\u2019s judgment was technically regarded as final, it was in effect not such, as it could be, and, indeed, was overturned in the review proceedings.",

It is true that they also held obiter that the State Property Regulations of 1975 did not create an entitlement to acquire Stateowned flats. However, they did not touch upon the substance of the applicant\u2019s claim and the main thrust of his argument, namely that that he had a specific right to a acquire the flat by virtue of paragraph 4 of the additional provisions of the Housing Act of 1991, as amended on 3 August 1992, provided, of course, that he met the conditions laid down in section 2(1) of the Act.",

The fact that the  based the crux of its reasoning on it suggests the contrary (see paragraph 14 above). It is therefore necessary to establish whether the silence of the  can reasonably be construed as an implied rejection. The Court notes on this point that the provision in issue was a special enactment, adopted more than fifteen years after the State Property Regulations of 1975 and at a time of wide-sweeping reform in the country. It dealt not with the sale of State property in general, but with the much narrower issue of the possibility for the employees of \u201cState entities\u201d to purchase flats in which they had been settled as tenants (see paragraphs 2427 above). Its impact thus appears to have been decisive for the outcome of the case and therefore required a specific and express reply. However, it was not even mentioned, let alone discussed, in the reasoning of the two panels of the  (see paragraph 23 above). In these circumstances, it is impossible to ascertain whether they simply neglected to deal with that question or whether they intended to dismiss it and, if that were their intention, what were their reasons for so deciding (see Higgins and Others v. France, judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998I, p. 61, \u00a7 43).",

This is a question of Bulgarian law, which falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bulgarian courts. It nevertheless reiterates that, while Article 6 \u00a7 1 does not lay down specific rules on how to draft and present judicial opinions and cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument raised by a litigant, it obliges the courts to give adequate reasons for their judgments (see Ruiz Torija and Hiro Balani v. Spain, judgments of 9 December 1994, Series A nos. 303A and\u00a0303B, p. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 29 and 30, and pp. 29 and 30, \u00a7\u00a7 27 and 28; and Albina v.\u00a0Romania, no. 57808/00, \u00a7 33, 28 April 2005).

The applicant was thus not able to obtain a final judicial determination of his alleged entitlement to acquire the flat. The Court observes that no justification has been offered for the obtaining situation. In particular, neither the  nor the Government have sought to justify this denial of access to a court as pursuing a legitimate aim and being in a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved. On the other hand, it must be noted that it impaired the very essence of the applicant\u2019s right, as it does not appear that he could resort to any other avenue of redress (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, p.\u00a03171, \u00a7 153).",
