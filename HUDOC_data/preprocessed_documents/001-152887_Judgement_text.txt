The case originated in an application (no. 67542/11) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Lajos Tóth (“the applicant”), on 24 October 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr E. Kiss, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
The applicant complained that the retroactive imposition of 98% tax on part of his severance payment was contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and several provisions of the Convention.
On 6 June 2014 the complaint concerning the alleged infringement of the applicant’s right to property was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Budakalász.
The applicant was employed with a State-owned gambling service provider for more than 20 years.
On 29 June 2010 the applicant’s employment was terminated by mutual agreement with effect from 30 June 2010. Under this agreement, the employer paid the applicant a gross amount of 21,573,086 Hungarian forints (HUF) (approximately 18,000 euros (EUR)), subject to payroll burdens.
Under new legislation (see paragraph 10 below) the severance payment was subsequently taxed at a 98% rate in its part exceeding HUF 3.5 million; the income tax and social security contributions already paid (see paragraph 7 above) were deducted from the tax payable. Thus, the applicant paid an additional HUF 10,756,341 (approximately EUR 34,000) in special tax on 3 May 2011.
