Croatia [GC], no. 59532/00, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2006III). Since the scope of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction is determined by the Convention itself, in particular by Article 32, and not by the parties\u2019 submissions in a particular case, the mere absence of a plea of incompatibility cannot extend that jurisdiction. The Court has to satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it, and is therefore obliged to examine the question of its jurisdiction of its own motion and at every stage of the proceedings (see Ble\u010di\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 67).",

Croatia (dec.), no. 59109/00, 28 February 2002).

The difference between the purpose pursued by the respective safeguards afforded by Articles 6 and 8 may, in the light of the particular circumstances, justify the examination of the same set of facts under both Articles (see, among many authorities, McMichael v. the United Kingdom, 24 February 1995, \u00a7 91, Series A no.\u00a0307B and Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, \u00a7\u00a7 20-22, Series A no. 18). The Court observes that the possibility of reaching different legal results when applying different legal rules on one factual situation is obvious (see, for example, in the context of Articles 6 and 8 Anghel v. Italy, no. 5968/09, \u00a7\u00a7 71 et seq, 25 June 2013).",

Although Article 6 \u00a7 1 obliges courts to give reasons for their decisions, it cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument of the parties involved (see Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands, 19\u00a0April 1994, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 288). When applying legal rules lacking in precision, however, the domestic courts must show particular diligence in giving sufficient reasons as to why such a rule was applied in a particular manner, given the circumstances of each specific case. Merely citing the language of the imprecise provision cannot be regarded as sufficient reasoning (see H. v. Belgium, 30 November 1987, \u00a7 53, Series A no.\u00a0127B).",

The Court also notes that the Constitutional Court of Serbia, after becoming fully operational in 2008, had an opportunity to deal with two cases raising substantially identical issues to those brought by the applicants before this Court. In its decisions cited above (see \u00a7\u00a7 36-37), it concluded that both the law on the basis of which the applicants had been dismissed and the judicial decisions which were identical to those rendered in the applicants\u2019 cases had been arbitrary in violation of the right to a fair trial.
