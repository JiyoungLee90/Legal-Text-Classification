However, that argument lacks any factual basis. The Court observes that in its decision of 22 October 2007 the City Court did not make a single reference to the detention order of 16\u00a0October 2007, having exclusively referred, including in the operative part of its decision, to the detention order of 6\u00a0September 2007. Moreover, in its letter of 22 August 2008 (see paragraph 9 above) the City Court acknowledged the mistake and informed the applicant that his appeal statement against the detention order of 16\u00a0October 2007 had been misplaced and that the District Court had been asked to take necessary procedural steps to ensure the examination of the appeal statement.

Russia, no.\u00a026386/02, \u00a7\u00a7 131-34, 24 April 2008). The applicant in the present case introduced his complaint to the Court on 29\u00a0May 2008. However, it was not until 2 July 2008 that the applicant learned that there were certain procedural irregularities with his appeal against the detention order of 16\u00a0October 2007. Even assuming that the applicant should have lost hope in the examination of his appeal when he was convicted on 17 January 2008 and when his attempts to have his pre-trial detention challenged became evidently futile, his complaint to the Court brought on 29 May 2008 was still lodged in conformity with the six-month time-limit provided for in Article 35\u00a0\u00a7 1 of the Convention.
