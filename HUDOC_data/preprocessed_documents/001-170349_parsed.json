G.N. had explained that a group of people had informed the police that a meeting of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses was due to be held and had asked the police to intervene before they did so themselves. The police officers had therefore been obliged to go to the premises. According to S.Kh., G.N. had entered Mr Aliev\u2019s property in order to ask him not to hold the meeting, so as to avoid a clash with the group of individuals in question. S.Kh. stated that he had then continued his journey and denied having taken the two applicants to the police station.

They merely submitted that no public officials had played any role whatsoever in that incident (see paragraph 75 above). The Court makes the following observations. During the domestic proceedings the applicants and other eyewitnesses identified by name three police officers who had allegedly been involved in the dispersal of the religious gathering on 26 October 2000 (see paragraph 17 above). One of the police officers, S.Kh., acknowledged before the national courts that a colleague, G.N., had indeed asked the applicants and other Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u201cto halt the meeting\u201d in order to prevent a confrontation with a group of people opposing it (see paragraph 21 above). Even assuming that that request by the police officer did not involve any humiliation or assault, it nevertheless amounted to an interference with the applicants\u2019 rights enshrined in Article\u00a09 of the Convention (see Krupko and Others v. Russia, no. 26587/07, \u00a7\u00a049, 26 June 2014, and Dimitrova v. Bulgaria, no. 15452/07, \u00a7\u00a028, 10\u00a0February 2015). Given that the request was made by at least one police officer, his actions clearly engaged the State\u2019s responsibility, whether he was acting ultra vires or not (see Moldovan and Others v.

As to the domestic courts, they simply subscribed to the version of the police officers (see paragraph 23 above). The Court notes that no evidence whatsoever was produced to show that such a degree of interference with the applicants\u2019 religious rights, if any at all, had indeed been required by the exigencies of the situation. Not a single so-called third person testified in this respect (see Krupko, cited above, \u00a7 51). In any event, according to the case file, this was a peaceful meeting of about thirty Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, which was held at the home of Mr Aliev. Neither the domestic courts in the course of the domestic proceedings nor the Government before the Court referred to any law which the applicants breached by having a gathering at their home. The domestic courts in their decisions simply omitted any discussion as to why the dispersal had been \u201clawful\u201d and \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d. In those circumstances, the Court finds that the Government have failed to justify the interference.",

Subsequently, the applicants, that is the host of the gathering and the pastor, had been taken to a police station where they had been forced to write an undertaking not to conduct any religious meetings in the future (see paragraphs 18 and 22 above). At no stage of the proceedings did the domestic courts make any attempt to verify a possible discriminatory motive behind the acts of the police officers.

Without addressing the reasoning of the domestic courts as such, the Court would at the outset focus on the attitude of the judges, which defined the nature of their decisions. In that regard, the first-instance court, while considering a complaint about alleged police violence filed by two Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, wrote as an introductory remark in the decision that \u201cit was well known that many of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses blatantly violate the requirements of Article\u00a019 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Constitution and frequently impose their opinion and belief on others, thus violating their rights\u201d (see paragraph 32 above). Furthermore, the court dismissed several witnesses on the applicants\u2019 behalf stating inter alia that they were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses (see paragraph 32 above). The latter argument was further upheld by the appeal court, whereas the introductory phrase about the frequent violation of the Constitution by Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses was left unremarked by the courts of appellate and cassation instances. In this context, the Court finds it difficult to accept the Government\u2019s argument that the domestic courts adequately examined the applicants\u2019 allegations. It appears that consideration of the applicants\u2019 complaints was rather superficial and biased, culminating in accepting the police version of events as true by default.",

Their consistent and detailed statements to the domestic courts and the Court, further supported by the statements of several witnesses, have not been adequately refuted by the Government. Put in a wider context of country-wide religious violence against Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses at the material time, they lead the Court to conclude that applicants nos. 6 and 7 became victims of police violence on account of their religious beliefs. The Court, accordingly, finds a violation of Article 9 of the Convention taken separately and in conjunction with Article 14 with respect to Mr Dzamukov and Mr Gabunia.",

The only arguable issue is whether the police officers allowed that to happen. In that connection, the Court cannot understand how the domestic courts took the version of events presented by the police officers at face value, without having the possibility to examine either of them in court. Furthermore, the domestic courts did not examine the applicants\u2019 allegation that one of the police officers had been present during the incident itself. The video-recording submitted in support of the above claim was simply omitted from the domestic courts\u2019 reasoning. Also, the courts failed to address the applicants\u2019 argument that the police officers, despite their belated reaction, could nevertheless have stopped the dispersal. They simply satisfied themselves with the finding that a post factum criminal investigation had been opened into the events. Last but not least, the domestic courts disregarded the culmination of the violent incident, which was the public burning in broad daylight of the religious literature confiscated from the applicants and other Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses at a public market the day after the dispersal (see paragraphs 55 and 56 above). This major allegation by the applicants about a flagrant violation of their religious rights was simply left without any consideration whatsoever. Such a superficial and one-sided consideration of the case coupled with an automatic reliance on law-enforcement officials and the unsubstantiated rejection of the applications\u2019 version of events cannot but amount, in the Court\u2019s view, to connivance on the part of the judiciary with the violent acts committed against the applicants. Such a conclusion is all the more credible if put into the wider context of systemic failures on the part of various public authorities to address religious violence against Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Georgia (see paragraphs 60 and 78 above).",

The domestic judicial proceedings in that respect, given their deficiencies (see paragraph 86 above), were futile. Furthermore, the Government have advanced no argument justifying such an interference with the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 9 of the Convention. In view of all the foregoing considerations, the Court concludes that the dispersal of the religious meeting of 27 March 2001 and the subsequent destruction of the applicants\u2019 religious literature would not have been possible without the connivance, or at least the acquiescence of the police (see Begheluri and Others, cited above, \u00a7 111).

Thus, where a breach of property rights and a refusal to redress it occurred, respectively, before and after the entry into force of Protocol No. 1 with respect to the Contracting State in question, the date of the latter act is immaterial for the determination of the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction (see Nikolaishvili v. Georgia (dec.), no. 30272/04, 7 July 2009, with further references; see also Jikia v. Georgia (dec.), no. 37302/05, \u00a7 23, 11 October 2016). In the current case, the three violent incidents at stake took place on 2-3 September 2000 (case no. 3), 26 October 2000 (case no. 2), and 2728\u00a0March 2001 (case no. 5). They were instantaneous acts which did not produce any continuing situation under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see among many others, Ble\u010di\u0107, \u00a7 86, cited above; see also, Moldovan and Others and Rosta\u015f and Others v.

The subsequent judicial proceedings are, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, immaterial in this regard. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 entered into force with respect to Georgia only on 7 June 2002. The Court therefore concludes that the applicants\u2019 complaint concerning the alleged breach of their property rights is inadmissible ratione\u00a0temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7 4.",
