The case originated in an application (no. 31043/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Vadim Cogut (“the applicant”), on 1 July 2004.
The applicant was represented by Mr Valeriu Pelin, a lawyer practising in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Mr Vitalie Pârlog, and by Ms Lilia Grimalschi, Head of the Government Agent's Directorate.
The applicant complained that the belated enforcement of the final judgment in his favour violated his right to have his civil rights determined by a court as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention and his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 4 March 2006 the President of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the admissibility and merits of the case (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Chişinău.
On 17 March 1999, after 27 years of military service, the applicant was transferred to the reserve. As he did not obtain a two-roomed apartment from the Ministry of Defence (“the Ministry”) to which he was entitled, he brought an action against it.
By a final judgment of 23 November 2000 the Supreme Court of Justice ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the Ministry to provide him with a two-roomed apartment.
Since the Ministry did not have apartments available, on an unspecified date in 2001 the applicant lodged an action with the Centru District Court seeking a change in the manner of enforcement of the judgment of 23 November 2000. In particular, he claimed money from the Ministry in lieu of an apartment.
On 18 May 2001 the Centru District Court decided to change the manner of enforcement of the judgment of 23 November 2000 and ordered the Ministry to pay the applicant 83,000 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 7,133 euros (EUR) at the time). The Ministry appealed.
On 4 July 2001 the  upheld the appeal, quashed the judgment of 18 May 2001 and discontinued the proceedings aimed at modifying the manner of enforcement of the judgment of 23 November 2000.
Following a request from the applicant, the Deputy Prosecutor General lodged a request for annulment of the judgment of 4 July 2001. The request for annulment was upheld by a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice of 5 June 2002 and the judgment of 18 May 2001 therefore became final.
On 25 June 2002 the applicant requested the Centru District Court to issue an enforcement warrant.
On 19 July 2002 a bailiff requested the Ministry to comply with the judgment in favour of the applicant.
On 13 September 2002 the Ministry replied that the judgment could not be enforced because of lack of money.
On 21 January 2003 a bailiff issued a payment order in respect of the Ministry in the amount of MDL 83,000. On 18 April and 25 July 2003 the bailiff informed the applicant that the Ministry had refused to comply with the requests to enforce the judgment and therefore administrative proceedings had been instituted against those responsible for non-enforcement of the final judgment.
By a judgment of 26 February 2004 the Chişinău Court of Appeal discontinued the administrative proceedings against the Minister of Defence. It found that although the judgment in favour of the applicant had not been enforced, the Minister was not to be held responsible for the Government's failure to allocate money for that purpose.
Between 2002 and 2003 the applicant unsuccessfully lodged complaints about the non-enforcement of the judgment.
On 15 March 2005 the applicant was paid MDL 83,000.
The relevant domestic law was set out in Prodan v. Moldova, no. 49806/99, § 31, ECHR 2004III (extracts).
