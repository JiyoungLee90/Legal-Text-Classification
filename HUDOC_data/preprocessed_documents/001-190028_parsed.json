Where the applicant has died after the application was lodged, the Court has accepted that the next of kin or heir may in principle pursue the application, provided that he or she has sufficient interest in the case (see Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu v. Romania [GC], no.\u00a047848/08, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2014, with further references). In such cases, the decisive point is not whether the rights in question are or are not transferable to the heirs wishing to pursue the procedure, but whether the heirs can in principle claim a legitimate interest in asking the Court to deal with the case on the basis of the applicant\u2019s wish to exercise his or her individual and personal right to lodge an application with the Court (see Singh and Others\u00a0v. Greece, no. 60041/13, \u00a7\u00a026, 19 January 2017).",

Although I agree that these were prosecution witnesses, I disagree with the reasoning provided in reaching that conclusion. To my mind, they were prosecution witnesses purely and simply because they were mentioned in the bill of indictment (see paragraph 15 of the judgment). More importantly, I do not agree with the Al-Khawaja and Tahery and Schatschaschwili criteria. I would draw attention to the considerations set out in my separate opinion in Murtazaliyeva v. Russia [GC], cited above.",

In fact, the trial court ensured that sufficient counterbalancing measures were taken to compensate for the handicaps imposed on the defence. In the case at hand, the applicant was confronted during the pre-trial stage with the prosecution evidence and confessed to the facts imputed to him. There is no evidence in the case file of \u201cphysical or psychological pressure\u201d being used to force this confession. In any event, the trial court did not base its judgment, alone or to a decisive extent, on the pre-trial testimony of the absent witnesses. The decisive evidence was clearly the testimony of witness P., who repeated at the trial the incriminatory statements already made during the pre-trial stage. In view of this circumstance, this complaint is indeed manifestly ill-founded.",

As a rule, in cases where a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 is found on account of the length of the criminal proceedings, the Court awards the non-pecuniary damage for the distress and anxiety the applicants might have suffered. This judgment follows that long-standing practice, by which I felt bound when voting with the majority on point 4 (a) of the operative part.",

The enforcement of his sentence was waived by the court which convicted him, as it had become time-barred. Had the domestic authorities acted with the requisite celerity, the applicant would have ended up in a penal institution. There, he would have spent two years (unless released earlier). What was formally a violation of the Convention was thus, in fact, a reward. Now, on top of that reward, a bonus of EUR 1,200 has been added.",

Take, for instance, Gagliano Giorgi v. Italy (no. 23563/07, \u00a7\u00a7 56-58, 6\u00a0March 2012). More generally, the Court\u2019s underlying approach, which I find consistent and justified in principle, calls for a revisit. One size does not necessarily fit all; in real life it hardly ever does. Legalistic purity is often \u2013 and unavoidably \u2013 a bit at odds with life\u2019s reality. Still, it would benefit both if the gap between them were retrenched, whenever possible.",
