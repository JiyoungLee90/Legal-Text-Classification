On 8 July 2004 the applicant sent the completed application form to the Court, raising the same complaint. Given that the applicant submitted the completed application form without excessive delay, the Court decides that the date of his first letter to the Court is the date of the introduction of the application (see, by contrast Kleyn and Aleksandrovich v.

In order to decide this question, regard must be had, among other considerations, to the specific features of the proceedings in question and to the manner in which the applicant\u2019s interests were actually presented and protected before the appeal court, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it and of their importance to the appellant (see among many other authorities, Kremzow v.\u00a0Austria, 21 September 1993, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 268-B; Belziuk v.

The Court further refers to its settled case-law to the effect that when an applicant has suffered an infringement of his rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, he should as far as possible be put in the position in which he would have been, had requirements of that provision not been disregarded, and that the most appropriate form of redress would, in principle, be the reopening of the proceedings, if requested (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a046221/99, \u00a7 210 in fine, ECHR 2005-IV, and Popov v. Russia, no.\u00a026853/04, \u00a7\u00a0264, 13 July 2006). The Court notes, in this connection, that Article 413 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure provides the basis for the reopening of the proceedings in the event of the finding of a violation by the Court (see paragraph 31 above).",
