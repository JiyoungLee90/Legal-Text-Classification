The case originated in 15 applications (nos. 1218/07, 1240/07, 1242/07, 1335/07, 1368/07, 1369/07, 3424/07, 3428/07, 3430/07, 3935/07, 3940/07, 7194/07, 7204/07, 7206/07 and 7211/07) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by 26 citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Igor Čolić, Mr Stevo Trninić, Mr Dušan Punišić, Mr Teofik Jusufagić, Mr Jovica Novaković, Mr Predrag Vulin, Ms Velinka Žujić, Mr Duško Žujić, Mr Jovo Žujić, Mr Goran Simović, Mr Tomislav Malkić, Ms Draginja Malkić, Mr Dražen Malkić, Ms Kristina Todorović, Mr Mišo Todorović, Ms Marina Todorović, Ms Mila Todorović, Mr Vid Milić, Mr Vojin Višić, Ms Miladinka Bojanić, Ms Tatjana Petrović, Ms Marijana Ivanov, Mr Predrag Ivanov, Mr Milan Majstorović, Ms Mira Majstorović and Mr Siniša Majstorović (“the applicants”), between 25 November 2006 and 18 January 2007.

Mr Trninić and Mr Novaković live in Serbia and the other applicants in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
By judgments of the Banja Luka Court of First Instance of 18 September 2001, 28 January 2003, 27 March 2001, 25 February 2002, 19 March 2003, 6 July 1999, 5 November 2001, 4 April 2000, 21 December 1999, 12 May 1999, 1 October 1999, 17 April 2002, 17 October 2002, 22 April 2002, 17 July 2001 and 15 February 1999, which became final on 16 November 2004, 26 May 2005, 17 September 2003, 25 January 2005, 25 April 2005, 20 June 2001, 18 October 2004, 20 March 2002, 10 July 2001, 5 January 2001, 9 March 2001, 17 March 2005, 10 May 2005, 21 December 2004, 28 December 2004 and 6 July 2001 respectively, the Republika Srpska was ordered to pay, within 15 days, the following amounts in respect of war damage together with default interest at the statutory rate from the date of the relevant first-instance judgment:

The Banja Luka Court of First Instance issued writs of execution (rješenje o izvršenju) on 20 April 2005, 24 October 2005, 4 November 2003, 19 April 2005, 26 December 2005, 31 January 2005 (ordering the enforcement of two judgments in favour of Mr Vulin), 2 June 2003, 1 November 2001, 6 July 2001, 4 April 2002, 5 September 2005, 25 October 2005, 7 April 2005, 19 April 2005 and 29 August 2001 respectively.
The applicants complained of non-enforcement to the Human Rights Chamber or to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 9 November 2005 the Human Rights Commission (the legal successor of the Human Rights Chamber) found a breach of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in the cases of Mr Simović, the Malkićs, the Todorovićs and the Majstorovićs. On 20 December 2005, 12 April and 27 June 2006 the Constitutional Court ruled likewise in the cases of Mr Čolić, Mr Trninić, Mr Jusufagić, Mr Novaković, Mr Vulin, Mr Milić, Mr Višić, Ms Bojanić, Ms Petrović and the Ivanovs. On 3 July 2006, following amendments to the Domestic Debt Act 2004, the Human Rights Commission, in the cases of Mr Punišić and the Žujićs, considered the matter to have been resolved and dismissed these cases.
It would appear that the judgments under consideration in the present case have not yet been fully enforced (see paragraph 11 below).
In view of many civil actions brought under the ordinary rules of tort law, on 29 November 2005 the Republika Srpska created a general compensation scheme for war damage and extinguished the pending civil actions (see the War Damage Act 2005). The deadline for submitting such claims expired in most cases on 28 February 2007 (as regards damage caused by the disappearance of a close relative, it expires on 31 December 2009). Compensation awarded under this scheme is to be paid in government bonds, which are to be amortised in ten annual instalments. The bonds earn interest at an annual rate of 1.5% and may be traded on the Stock Exchange (their current trade price on the Stock Exchange is around 45% of their nominal value). As from 12 May 2009, they may also be used to pay direct taxes accrued by 31 December 2007. According to official data, around 6,000 administrative decisions had been issued under this scheme by 7 August 2008 (the compensation thus awarded amounted to approximately BAM 50,000,000). Around 21,000 cases were still pending.
Some 9,000 judgments (including those under consideration in the present case) became final by 29 November 2005. The Republika Srpska was ordered to pay approximately BAM 140,000,000 in total plus default interest. Their enforcement (apart from legal costs and associated default interest which have recently been paid) has been suspended since 28 May 2002 pursuant to the Postponement of Enforcement Act 2002, the Temporary Postponement of Enforcement Act 2003 and the Domestic Debt Act 2004. In accordance with the settlement plan, principal debt and associated default interest is to be paid in ten annual instalments between 2014 and 2023. Meanwhile, on 30 June 2008 government bonds were issued to all holders of such judgments in the amount of their principal claims and default interest accrued hitherto (default interest no longer accrues as of that date). The bonds earn interest at an annual rate of 1.5%. Those who are unable or unwilling to wait until 2023 may sell their bonds on the Stock Exchange (their current price is around 45% of their nominal value). As from 12 May 2009, the bonds may also be used to pay direct taxes accrued by 31 December 2007.
While the Human Rights Commission and the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina initially considered this solution to be incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see decision CH/00/3615 of the Human Rights Commission of 9 November 2005 and decision AP 774/04 of the Constitutional Court of 20 December 2005), they decided that the matter had been resolved following amendments to the Domestic Debt Act 2004 (see decision CH/01/7197 of the Human Rights Commission of 3 July 2006 and a letter of 17 November 2008 sent by the Constitutional Court to the appellant in the case AP 505/06). The amendments concerned, among other things, the time-frame for the enforcement of these judgments and the payment of default interest and legal costs awarded therein. Following a decision of the Constitutional Court of the Republika Srpska of 15 January 2009, the Domestic Debt Act 2004 has undergone further amendments.
According to the Default Interest Rate Act 2001, default interest cannot exceed principal debt. It is calculated on the basis of the official retail price growth rate plus another 0.05% daily (which corresponds to an annual rate of 18.25%).
