To that end, the Court considered in its judgment in the case of Brecknell v. the United Kingdom (no. 32457/04, \u00a7 71, 27 November 2007) that, where there is a plausible or credible allegation, the discovery of any new piece of evidence or item of information relevant to the identification and eventual prosecution or punishment of the perpetrator of an unlawful killing, would require the authorities to take further investigative measures. The steps which would be reasonable to take will vary considerably according to the facts of the situation.

Indeed, the national authorities\u2019 failure to give serious thought to the possibility of security force involvement in the killing is apparent from the trial court\u2019s conclusion (see paragraph 45 above) \u2013 which was also adopted by the Government (see paragraph 74 above) \u2013 that, as one of the defendants had been helping the security forces with their operations at the time, it was not logical that he would be involved in any killings.",

The Court notes that, according to Turkish law, defendants who are not detained on remand during the course of criminal proceedings against them have the right not to attend the trial court hearings. As happened in the present case, pursuant to letters rogatory issued by trial courts, such defendants\u2019 statements are taken by criminal courts located in the areas where they live. Nevertheless, the Court considers that, in the circumstances of the present case, the trial court\u2019s failure to ensure the attendance of the two defendants was not compatible with the requirements of an effective investigation. That failure not only prevented the trial court from questioning the defendants directly in the presence of the applicants\u2019 lawyer, but also prevented the eyewitnesses from identifying them. In this connection the Court observes that the key eyewitness to the events informed the prosecutor that he would be willing to identify the two confessors in an identity parade (see paragraph 33 above). For their part, the applicants drew the Court of Cassation\u2019s attention to the trial court\u2019s failure to ensure such a procedure (see paragraph 46 above). Nevertheless, as pointed out by the applicants in their appeal petition, the \u015e\u0131rnak court contented itself with showing photographs of one of the defendants to that eyewitness. In this connection the Court cannot but note that even obtaining those photographs took the trial court more than a year and required many reminders (see paragraphs 39 and 43-44 above).",

In this case the Court finds that the information submitted to the authorities by the applicants in July 2002 led to significant new developments. The Court therefore limits itself to a review of the investigations carried out after July 2002 and finds a violation of Article 2 of the Convention under its procedural limb.

In particular, the difficulties in securing probative evidence for the purposes of domestic legal proceedings, inherent in such a troubled situation, may make the pursuit of judicial remedies futile\u201d (see, inter alia, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16\u00a0September 1996, \u00a7 70, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV).

Thus, in a number of cases the Court concluded that there existed special circumstances, dispensing the applicants from the obligation to use certain domestic remedies (ibid., \u00a7\u00a075).",

The Court has previously placed reliance on \u201cthe vulnerable position of the applicant villagers and the reality that in SouthEast Turkey complaints against the authorities might well give rise to a legitimate fear of reprisals\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 105). In comparable cases such fears have been voiced a number of times by applicants and the Court has found that during emergency rule people were actually killed for not being willing to join the village guards (see, for example, Acar and Others v.\u00a0Turkey (nos. 36088/97 and 38417/97, 24 May 2005).
