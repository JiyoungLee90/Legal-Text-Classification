The Government noted in this connection that, before the Athens Criminal Court, the applicant had merely claimed the symbolic amount of 1,000 drachmas (about three euros), without prejudice to the satisfaction of all her civil rights before the civil courts. The Government added that, in acquitting the defendant, the Athens Criminal Court had refused to decide on the applicant's civil claims. Accordingly, the sole purpose of her request to the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation was to support the criminal charge and to have the Criminal Court's acquittal reversed, not to assert any civil right before a criminal court. For the Government, those facts left no doubt that the applicant had decided to join the proceedings as a civil party primarily in order to obtain the defendant's conviction and not for the protection or reparation of her civil rights. Referring to the case of Perez v.\u00a0France ([GC], no.\u00a047287/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-71, ECHR 2004I), they observed that the Convention did not guarantee the right to \u201cprivate revenge\u201d.",

On this point the Government also referred to Article 463 of the Code of Criminal Procedure: \u201cRemedies may be used solely by persons who are expressly afforded such right by law\u201d. For the Government, the public prosecutor was by no means obliged to justify his decision not to accept the request, since there was no right to appeal on points of law under domestic law and, moreover, no such right could be relied upon against statutory provisions on the basis of any particular judicial practice. The lodging of an appeal on points of law fell exclusively within the public prosecutor's discretion.",

However symbolic that sum might have been, Article 6 \u00a7 1 was applicable in the present case because her application to join the proceedings as a civil party also had an economic aspect, in accordance with the principle set out in Perez (cited above). In addition, the applicant observed that, according to a longstanding and established domestic practice, the civil party was entitled to request the public prosecutor to appeal on points of law and could always expect a reply. Judicial practice thus confirmed the possibility for the civil party to appeal on points of law indirectly, that is to say through the intermediary of the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. The applicant added that the argument that her request to the public prosecutor did not concern a \u201ccivil right\u201d was contrived, since that act was part of a whole set of proceedings in which she had participated, among other reasons, to obtain compensation. She pointed out that, under Article 513 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, if the public prosecutor granted the civil party's request to lodge an appeal on points of law, the civil party was also summoned to appear before the Court of Cassation and to take part in the proceedings thus reopened. Lastly, she observed that the case-law of the Court itself, as developed in other Greek cases, recognised as a \u201cremedy\u201d the request to the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation and, accordingly, the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in such cases.",

Article 138 of that Code provided that public prosecutors made orders in the cases provided for by law at the pre-trial stage or during the court's recess. Accordingly, the Government contended that the refusal by the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation to lodge an appeal on points of law in response to a request from the civil party did not need to contain reasoning, since it was not a judicial decision but an official note in which he expressed his preference not to use the remedy in question, this being left to his discretion. The Government added that, in any event, the public prosecutor's refusal in this case had been sufficiently reasoned. It being a simple libel and perjury case, it had been sufficient, in their opinion, for the public prosecutor to confirm the Criminal Court's decision merely by writing an observation on the applicant's letter.",

The Court notes, however, that to be applicable Article 6 \u00a7 1 does not necessarily require the existence of a remedy that is formally recognised by law.

It did so in particular in its Reinhardt and Slimane-Ka\u00efd v. France judgment (31 March 1998, \u00a7 106, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998II), where it took the view that the practice of sending notes to the court in deliberations could remedy the parties' inability to respond to the advocate-general's submissions, provided the latter informed the parties' lawyers of the tenor of his submissions before the day of the hearing.",

In other words, her request to the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation was made in the same context and pursued the same aim as her previous application to be joined to the proceedings as a civil party. In addition, the Court observes that if the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had lodged an appeal on points of law, the applicant's request would have been inextricably linked to the subsequent proceedings. It can be seen from Article 513 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that if the public prosecutor had acceded to her request by lodging his own appeal on points of law, the applicant would have been summoned to appear before the Court of Cassation as a \u201cparty to the proceedings\u201d.",

Indeed, the fact that the determination of the applicant's civil right to compensation is left to the discretion of a body which is not bound by procedural rules or requirements and which, furthermore, has no appellate jurisdiction, but acts as an intermediary between the applicant and the court, does not appear to be consonant with the institutional and procedural guarantees that are inherent in the judicial determination of a civil right. Having voted that Article 6 was applicable in these circumstances, I fail to see how proceedings of a non-remedial nature could meet the higher standards required by Article 6 as a matter of principle. I regard the length of these proceedings and the absence of minimum reasoning for their outcome as logical aspects of their non-judicial nature.",
