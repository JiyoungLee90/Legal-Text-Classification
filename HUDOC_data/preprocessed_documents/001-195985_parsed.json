Turkey, no. , \u00a7\u00a027, 23\u00a0October 2003). In this respect it notes that the applicant may apply to have the proceedings reopened under Article 465 of the CCP, should he choose to do so (see Mischie v. Romania, no. 50224/07, \u00a7 50, 16\u00a0September 2014). However, the Court considers that the applicant suffered some nonpecuniary damage as a result of the violation of his rights under Article\u00a06 of the Convention which cannot be made good by the mere finding of a violation or by the reopening of the proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Siegle v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a023456/04, \u00a7\u00a7 47-48, 16 April 2013). Having regard to his wish to withdraw his claim in respect of the complaint under Article\u00a03 (see paragraph 18 above), and making an assessment on an equitable basis, it awards the applicant EUR 4,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that sum.",
