Therefore, the Ia\u015fi County Court delivered its judgment on appeal as a bench of two judges. Thereafter, the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against that decision. The Ia\u015fi Court of Appeal then reclassified the civil claim as eligible for consideration at only two levels of jurisdiction, dismissing the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law as inadmissible. Consequently, the decision given by the Ia\u015fi County Court on 21 November 2007 was considered final by the Ia\u015fi Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above).",
