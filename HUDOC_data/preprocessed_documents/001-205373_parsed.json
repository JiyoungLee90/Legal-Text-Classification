To support that contention, the applicant drew the Court\u2019s attention to the fact that all the documents drawn up by the police during his period of custody in Istanbul indicated his name as M.M.K., given the fact that at that time he had not revealed his true identity to the police. The only document in which his real name had been used was the search-and-seizure record in respect of the search of his house dated 29 October 2004, which, moreover, did not bear his signature.

Only nine days after the visit had the applicant had been apprised of the information that those notes had allegedly been found on him and that disciplinary proceedings had been initiated against him on that basis. When the public prosecutor had taken his statements in relation to that event, the applicant had denied that any notes had been found on him and had asked the public prosecutor to obtain the recordings of the security cameras in the prison and to obtain samples of his writing and to send them to the Forensic Medicine Institute for analysis. However, both the public prosecutor and the trial court had been informed by the prison authorities that the impugned recordings had been erased. In his view, the fact that the public prosecutor had taken further writing samples from him illustrated that the samples taken and assessed by the police had been insufficient. Likewise, the Forensic Medicine Institute had concluded (on the basis of the same documents as those examined by the police criminal laboratory, which had found that the notes had been written by him) that further samples were required for an accurate examination. Giving a detailed description of how visits at the prison are organised, the applicant submitted that other inmates had also been present on 5 April 2005 and asked the public prosecutor to hear evidence from them. He complained that except for the two above-mentioned prison guards, no other persons had been heard as witnesses.

The Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor filed two different bills of indictment against the applicant on 9 February 2005 and 19 January 2006, respectively. In the first bill of indictment, three different accusations were levelled against the applicant under Article 125 of the then Criminal Code for seeking to destroy the unity of the Turkish State and to remove part of the country from the State\u2019s control: the killing of two police officers at a police checkpoint on 7\u00a0September 2004 (incident 1); an armed attack against a battalion command post in Hani, Diyarbak\u0131r on 7 June 2004 (incident 2); and the forcible seizure of M.\u00c7.\u2019s telephone (telephone no.4) and identity card in early August 2004 (incident 3 \u2013 see paragraph\u00a053 above). In the second bill of indictment, which was filed following the discovery of the notes on the applicant\u2019s person in prison, the public prosecutor requested that the applicant be tried and convicted under Article 125 of the then Criminal Code on one count on the basis of the material found during the search of his house on 6 April 2005 (see paragraph 61 above). Neither of the two bills of indictment contained any accusation against the applicant concerning his alleged involvement in or criminal liability for the attempted bombing of the 30\u00a0August 2004 Victory Day parade.",

In the instant case, the domestic courts not only acquitted the applicant of the killing of two police officers but also found that the applicant\u2019s secretly recorded interview with the police officers had been unlawful and thus excluded it from its examination on the merits of the case. In the present case, the practical ramifications of that approach create a constraint on the Court\u2019s examination in so far as the Government\u2019s above argument regarding incident no. 1 is concerned.",

It is not disputed between the parties that the applicant\u2019s complaint regarding the killing of the two police officers had been limited to the admission of the video recording (including his selfincriminating statements), which was declared inadmissible by the Court at the time that the present application was communicated to the Government on 30\u00a0January 2014, pursuant to Article 24 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. In any event, the Court reiterates its well-established case-law to the effect that an applicant cannot be considered as a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention for complaints lodged by him under Article 6 of the Convention relating to criminal proceedings that ended in with his acquittal, save for any complaints that he may have concerning the length of those proceedings under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, or the presumption of his innocence under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention in connection thereto.

First and foremost, that document was discovered following the delivery of the trial court\u2019s reasoned judgment; thus, it did not form part of the trial court\u2019s examination, as reflected in its judgment (compare Natig Jafarov v.

In any event, the Government did not submit any proof showing that the \u201cregistry book\u201d had been duly submitted to the Court of Cassation before the delivery of its judgment.

Russia, no.\u00a07025/04, \u00a7\u00a069, 24 September 2009). The right to a lawyer also contributes to the prevention of miscarriages of justice (see Beuze v.

Firstly, the search was carried out by the police in the absence of the applicant and his lawyer, and no reasons at all were put forward for this course of action. While it might have been legitimate to limit the applicant\u2019s participation in the search owing to the fact that he was detained in a prison in Diyarbak\u0131r at the material time, the Court discerns no reason justifying the failure to ensure the presence of his lawyer during the search. The Court furthermore notes that the participation of a lawyer in\u00a0investigative measures during which the accused is not present may be crucial in safeguarding the latter\u2019s rights \u2013 in particular by providing adequate protection against a possible planting of evidence, thereby contributing to the wider aim of ensuring equality of arms between the investigating or prosecuting authorities and the accused (see, in respect of identity parades, Laska and Lika v.

Be that as it may, carrying out a search in the absence of the public prosecutor was not entirely excluded by the domestic legal provisions in force at the material time, which required the presence of two independent witnesses (Article 97 \u00a7 2 of the then Code of Criminal Procedure).

That belief may be deduced from the questions put by the police to M.\u00c7. in his interview on 1\u00a0September 2004 (see paragraph 9 above). However, the deputy director of the Anti-terrorism Branch of the Diyarbak\u0131r Security Directorate indicated in his report dated 2 November 2004, which was addressed to the public prosecutor in charge, that the mobile telephone that had forcibly been taken from M.\u00c7. was the same one as that (telephone no.4) which had been found during the search of the applicant\u2019s house on 29 October 2004 (see paragraph\u00a038 above).

In that connection, the Court furthermore notes that (in the absence of any concrete evidence directly linking the applicant to other acts of terrorism) his conviction for the gravest terrorism-related offence contained in the then Criminal Code, and his resulting life sentence without the possibility of parole, hinges to a significant degree on his implication in this particular attempted bomb attack. Therefore, the ambiguity in that crucial part of the judgment cannot be ignored as a mere linguistic mishap, as it leaves unanswered a fundamental question that goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s conviction. The Court finds the trial court\u2019s failure to state the reasons for the applicant being found criminally liable for the attempted bombing of 30\u00a0August 2004 to be particularly troubling, given the extremely serious nature of the accusations against the applicant and what was at stake for him.",
