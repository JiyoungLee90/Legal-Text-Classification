The only question before them was, pursuant to Article 176 of the Civil Code, whether K.\u2019s mother endangered his well-being. After two conflicting expert opinions had been taken, the District Court ordered a third expert in child psychology to submit a decisive expert opinion. The latter came to the conclusion that K.\u2019s best interests would not be manifestly endangered if custody remained with his mother. Consequently, the courts dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for transfer of sole custody.",

Given the difference in the factual situation in comparison with a child born in wedlock vesting sole custody in the mother of a child born out of wedlock was justified to enable her to defend the child\u2019s interests in paternity and maintenance proceedings. Secondly, the Government asserted that a father of a child born out of wedlock who wished to assert parental responsibility could do so with the mother\u2019s consent. The relevant provisions were based on the assumption that awarding joint custody against the will of the mother would not serve the child\u2019s interests.",

In reaching that conclusion the Court had regard on the one hand to the wide margin of appreciation of the authorities when deciding on custody-related matters and on the other hand to the evolving European context in this sphere and the growing number of unmarried parents. The Court observed that although there existed no European consensus as to whether fathers of children born out of wedlock had a right to request joint custody even without the consent of the mother, the common point of departure in the majority of Member States appeared to be that decisions regarding the attribution of custody are to be based on the child\u2019s best interests and that in the event of a conflict between the parents such attribution should be subject to scrutiny by the national courts (ibid., \u00a7 60).",

The only issue the domestic courts could examine, pursuant to Article 176 of the Civil Code, was whether the child\u2019s well-being was endangered if the mother continued to exercise sole custody. In contrast, Austrian law provides for a full judicial review of the attribution of parental authority and resolution of conflicts between separated parents in cases in which the father once held parental authority, either because the parents were married or, if they were unmarried, had concluded an agreement to exercise joint custody. In such cases the parents retain joint custody unless the court, upon request, awards sole custody to one parent in accordance with the child\u2019s best interests pursuant to Article 177a of the Civil Code.",
