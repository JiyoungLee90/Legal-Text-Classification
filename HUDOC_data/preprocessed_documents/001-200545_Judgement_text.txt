The case originated in an application (no. 5489/10) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Guzyal Gabbasovna Yunusova (“the applicant”), on 12 January 2010.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr M. Galperin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 22 February 2017 the Government were given notice of the complaints concerning non-enforcement of judgements in the applicant’s favour and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Izhevsk.
On 15 September 2006 and 7 May 2007 by two separate judgments the Industrialnyy District Court of Izhevsk (“the Distict Court”) ordered the municipal institution MU “Gorodskoye zhilishchnoye upravleniye” (МУ “Городское жилищное управление – Управляющая компания в жилищно-коммунальном хозяйстве г. Ижевска”, “the company”) to perform certain works within the adjacent territory and in respect of the house where the applicant lived. Each judgment contained a list of the specific works. The District Court did not address the question of responsibility of another defendant in these civil cases, i.e. the administration of town of Izhevsk. The judgments came into force on 9 October 2006 and 21 June 2007 respectively.
On 22 October 2007 the District Court issued another judgment in the applicant’s favour ordering the company to conduct certain major repairs in the house where the applicant lived. By its additional judgment of 27 December 2007 the District Court extended the list of those repairs.
The operative part of both judgments concerning the major repairs read that if the company lacked the necessary funding, the works had to be performed at the expense of the town of Izhevsk. The decisions came into force on 19 March 2008.
On various dates enforcement proceedings were initiated in respect of the judgments.
On 7 November 2013 the District Court established non-enforcement of judgments of 15 September 2006 and of 7 May 2007, and granted the applicant’s claim to impose vicarious liability for all of the obligations under those judgments on the town administration.
On 24 December 2014 the Supreme Court of the Udmurtiya Republic changed the mode of enforcement of the judgment of 22 October 2007 in the part concerning installation of a heat meter. Having acknowledged a lack of enforcement of the initial judgment, the court allowed the applicant to install the meter herself and later recover the cost of such installation from the town.
On 9 February 2017 the town administration sent a letter to the bailiffs’ service department responsible for the enforcement of the judgment concerning major repairs asking it to terminate the proceedings as the judgment had been fully executed. A number of documents confirming the performance of works were enclosed with the letter.
On 28 April 2017 having examined the above-mentioned documents, the bailiff in charge terminated the enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgment of 22 October 2007.
On 19 July 2017 the senior bailiff overturned the decision to terminate the enforcement proceedings. She found, in particular, that the documents available in the case file did not confirm full enforcement of the judgment.
On an unspecified date the applicant complained to the senior bailiff about ineffective work by the bailiff responsible for enforcement of the judgments of 7 November 2013 and of 22 October 2007.
On 24 July 2017 the senior bailiff rejected the applicant’s complaint. It follows from the text of the relevant ruling that all the judgments remained unenforced and the enforcement proceedings were still pending. However, the bailiffs’ work was satisfactory.
The company was instituted by the administration of the town of Izhevsk (“the town administration”) with the aim to manage maintenance and use of housing in Izhevsk.
On 19 August 2011 the town administration decided to reorganise the company into an autonomous municipal institution.
On 10 August 2012 the town administration initiated liquidation of the company.
