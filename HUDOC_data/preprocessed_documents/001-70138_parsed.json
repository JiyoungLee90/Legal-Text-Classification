Furthermore, in many cells, there were not enough beds and prisoners had to share them or sleep in turns. In addition, the bedding was in a bad condition; the very small stocks of mattresses, blankets and sheets was not enough and many prisoners without family or resources had to sleep just on the bed frame.",

The majority of these prisoners formed part of the workforce allocated to the various prison duties. Other forms of activity were almost non-existent. It should be noted, however, that some efforts had been made in Prison No. 3, following the CPT's recommendations. For example, the outdoor exercise areas had been equipped with modest sports facilities. In this context, management plans to fit out two sports halls as soon as possible deserve particular support. Improvements had also been made to the juvenile detention regime: a television room had been provided and a few activities organised, such as music, singing and group discussions/debates. However, these early attempts to meet the needs of young persons remain an isolated example. In the other establishments, they were left entirely to their own devices.",

It has deemed treatment to be \u201cdegrading\u201d when it was such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see, for example, Kudla v.

In considering whether a particular form of treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object was to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3. However, the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see, for example, Raninen v.

Had there been any significant improvements, the Government could have pointed them out, the more so as the applicant expressly invoked the CPT reports in his application.",

Accordingly, the cells were designed to provide between 1.78 and 2.02 m\u00b2 and between 1.5 and 1.93 m\u00b2 for each inmate. The Court considers that such accommodation cannot be regarded as attaining acceptable standards. In this connection it recalls that the CPT has stated in a report, drafted following a visit to  between 24\u00a0November and 4\u00a0December\u00a02002, that 4 m\u00b2 per prisoner was an appropriate and desirable guideline for a detention cell (see paragraph 60 above).",

In its decision on admissibility of 22\u00a0March\u00a02005 the Court held, in respect of the Government's contention that the applicant should have requested a transfer to a non-smoking cell, that that remedy was not effective. Accordingly, the Court considers that the Government did not fulfil their obligation to safeguard the applicant's health and instead allowed him to be exposed to cigarette smoke, which was dangerous in view of his medical condition, particularly, since the applicant was kept in the cell twenty-three hours a day.",

In their observations on admissibility the Government stated that there was a record of regular medical visits in the prison register. They did not, however, provide a copy of this document to the Court. In the absence of such a contemporaneous record, the Court is not satisfied that it has been proven that the applicant received the regular medical attention he requested.

As regards the contacts with his wife and daughter, he was running the risk of losing his family and it was difficult not to see his only child for such a long period.",

In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant must inevitably have suffered frustration, uncertainty and anxiety which cannot be compensated solely by a finding of a violation.
