As regards the conduct of the authorities and courts the Court observes that on three occasions the Regional Government quashed the decision of the lower instance as the expert opinion was defective and the Municipal Council had repeatedly failed to give the necessary instructions to the expert appointed by it. It ordered the lower instance to give the expert clear instructions. As regards the conduct of the applicants, there is no indication that they delayed the proceedings. Even if they refused the expert to enter their property, this did not cause any substantial delay to the proceedings since the expert had nevertheless been able to obtain the information necessary for his report. From the documents submitted, there is also no indication that the applicants had not submitted observations within due time. The Court concludes that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.
