The Court further remarks that the provisions of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to which the Government refer, do not preclude disclosure of the documents from a pending investigation file, but rather set out a procedure for and limits to such disclosure. The Government failed to specify the nature of the documents and the grounds on which they could not be disclosed (see, for similar conclusions, Mikheyev v. Russia, no.\u00a077617/01, \u00a7\u00a0104, 26 January 2006). The Court also recalls that in a number of comparable cases reviewed and pending before the Court, similar requests have been made to the Russian Government and the documents from the investigation files have been submitted without a reference to Article 161 (see, for example, Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia cited above, \u00a7\u00a046; Magomadov and Magomadov v. Russia (dec.), no. 58752/00, 24 November 2005). For these reasons the Court considers the Government's explanations concerning the disclosure of the case file insufficient to justify the withholding of the key information requested by the Court.",

The Court considers that the applicant has presented a coherent and convincing picture of her son's detention on 17 December 2000. The Court reviewed no material which could cast doubt on the credibility of the applicant's statements or the information submitted by her. Even though she herself was not an eye-witness of the events, she identified three such witnesses and collected their statements, which refer to the involvement of the military or security forces in the abduction. The fourth witness informed the applicant that he had seen Said-Khuseyn Imakayev's car followed by an APC in Novye Atagi (see \u00a7\u00a7\u00a014-16 above). In her applications to the authorities, the applicant constantly maintained that her son had been detained by unknown military servicemen and requested the investigation to determine their identity (see \u00a7\u00a017 above). According to the Government, as far back as 2001 the investigation into Said-Khuseyn Imakayev's detention took steps to find out whether he had been detained by the Ministry of the Interior, the FSB or the military commander (see \u00a7\u00a022 above). The letter sent to the applicant in July 2002 by the Chechnya Prosecutor's Office stated that the investigation was focusing on the version that her son had been detained by the servicemen from one of the \u201cpower structures\u201d (see \u00a7\u00a026 above). Despite the statement by the Government that the abduction could have been committed by members of illegal armed groups for the purpose of discrediting the federal forces (see \u00a7\u00a028 above), no evidence has been submitted to the Court to support such an allegation.",

The applicant's husband had then disappeared. This was apparently established on the basis of witness statements by a number of servicemen involved in the operation.

This information was immediately available to the authorities to whom the applicant applied with requests to carry out an investigation and to ensure her husband's release. However, they failed to act with the promptness which could possibly have prevented the disappearance. Instead, for more than two years officials denied that Said-Magomed Imakayev had ever been detained. In the meantime, the investigation appears to have obtained information that the applicant's husband had indeed been detained on suspicion of involvement in illegal activities. On the basis of witness statements by unnamed servicemen, the investigators also concluded that he had been released after a certain time in custody, even though no records of his detention, questioning or release existed. In July 2004 the investigation conducted by the military prosecutor was closed and the applicant's victim status was withdrawn, thus depriving her of the possibility to have access to the case file and to learn who had detained her husband and why.",

The passage of time may therefore to some extent affect the weight to be attached to other elements of circumstantial evidence before it can be concluded that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. In this respect the Court considers that this situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere irregular detention in violation of Article 5.

It has been established that Said-Magomed Imakayev was detained by military servicemen during a special operation on 2 June 2002. His family have had no news of him since. No records were drawn up of his detention, questioning or release, and until July 2004 the authorities denied that he had ever been detained, both to the applicant and to the European Court. In July 2004 his detention was acknowledged, with a broad reference to the Suppression of Terrorism Act. At the same time the criminal investigation into the actions of the military servicemen was closed for absence of corpus delicti. The investigation concluded that the servicemen had acted lawfully and that Said-Magomed Imakayev had been released, some time after detention, from the Shali District Department of the FSB to the head of the Shali district administration, who by that time had died and therefore could not be questioned. No information of substance about these proceedings was disclosed to the applicant or to the Court, despite several specific requests. Moreover, it was not disclosed to the district prosecutor, who was instructed in November 2004 to open a new investigation into Said-Magomed Imakayev's presumed murder without the benefit of acquainting himself with the statements of the servicemen who, it appears, were the last persons to see him alive. This new investigation failed to identify any relevant witnesses or to collect any information about the missing man's fate (see \u00a7\u00a087 above).",

Moreover, the stance of the prosecutor's office and other law-enforcement authorities after the news of his detention had been communicated to them by the applicant significantly contributed to the possibility of disappearance, because no necessary actions were taken in the crucial first days or weeks after the detention. Their behaviour in the face of the applicant's well-established complaints gives a strong presumption of at least acquiescence in the situation and raises strong doubts as to the objectivity of the investigation.",

It has stressed in that connection that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. In order to minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5. Bearing in mind the responsibility of the authorities to account for individuals under their control, Article 5 requires them to take effective measures to safeguard against the risk of disappearance and to conduct a prompt and effective investigation into an arguable claim that a person has been taken into custody and has not been seen since (see \u00c7akici v. Turkey [GC], no.23657/94, \u00a7\u00a0104, ECHR-1999-IV; and \u00c7i\u00e7ek v. Turkey, no. 25704/94, \u00a7\u00a0164, 27 February 2001).",

The Government declined to disclose any information concerning the exact timing and place of Said-Magomed Imakayev's detention, the agency and officials responsible for his apprehension and release and the legal and factual basis for those actions. In accordance with the Court's practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of holding data recording such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Kurt v.
