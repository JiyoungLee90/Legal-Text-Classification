Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000IV). The Court has consistently stressed that, in the context of deprivation of liberty, to meet the Article 3 threshold the suffering and humiliation involved must go beyond the inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Although measures depriving a person of liberty may often involve such an element, in accordance with Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 92-94).",

Admittedly, the Court has previously held that the personal space afforded to detainees in the dormitory of a correctional colony must be viewed in the context of the wide freedom of movement enjoyed by detainees during the daytime, which ensures that they have unobstructed access to natural light and air (see Nurmagomedov v.Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004). Nevertheless, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that the level of privacy available to the applicant was insufficient to comply with the standards set forth in Article 3 of the Convention. For over five years, during the night, the applicant was housed in a dormitory with forty-four to sixty other people where he was afforded less than two square metres of personal space. Furthermore, in the Court\u2019s view, the sanitary facilities available were not sufficient to accommodate the needs of the detainees. Lastly, the Court observes that on several occasions the applicant was transferred to a hospital where there was no overcrowding. However, given the infrequency and the brevity of such periods of detention, the Court does not consider them to have alleviated the applicant\u2019s situation.",
