Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his words and deeds by journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance (see Lingens v. Austria, judgment of 8\u00a0July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, \u00a7 42, Incal v.

No doubt Article\u00a010 \u00a7 2 enables the reputation of others \u2013 that is to say, of all individuals \u2013 to be protected, and this protection extends to politicians too, even when they are not acting in their private capacity; but in such cases the requirements of such protection have to be weighed in relation to the interests of open discussion of political issues (Lingens v. Austria, cited above, \u00a7 42).",

Although it must not overstep various bounds set, inter alia, for the prevention of disorder and the protection of the reputation of others, it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas on political questions and on other matters of public interest. Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of their political leaders (Castells v. Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0236, \u00a7\u00a043). Journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 26\u00a0April 1995, Series\u00a0A no. 313, p. 19, \u00a7 38).",
