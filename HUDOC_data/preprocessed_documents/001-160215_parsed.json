As a result, the police had to use proportionate force against the group, who were holding an illegal demonstration. The police intervened using truncheons, water and tear gas.

As a result, they are prosecuted as if they were actually fighting the government as armed \u2018members\u2019 of the PKK (Article 314/2, Turkish Penal Code). These serious charges, on top of more usual charges under the Law on Demonstrations and Public Assemblies, could result in sentences of 28 years in prison, or more, if there are repeated offenses. To date, the majority of adults convicted under these laws have received prison terms of between seven and 15 years. Prior to a July 2010 legal amendment, child protestors typically received prison sentences of between four and five years, though in 2010, at least several children were sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison.",

Hence, the template for individual indictments includes an abstract overview of PKK history and policies, followed by a statement of the alleged specific criminal activities of the defendant. In none of the cases examined by Human Rights Watch had prosecutors submitted evidence to establish that the individual defendant either heard the PKK\u2019s \u2018appeal\u2019 or had been directly instructed or motivated by the PKK to participate in the demonstration, much less that the individual had any other specific link with the PKK or committed a crime under its orders.",

Then the defendant, by joining the demonstration, is assumed to have acted directly under PKK orders.

That speech triggered a fight between those citizens who wanted to remove the flag and those who wanted to keep it. After that incident, that applicant organised an armed vigil to protect the Albanian flag. The police later found weapons in the town hall and in the applicant\u2019s flat. On the same day as they found the cache of weapons, the police were attacked by a group of about 200 people, who were armed with metal sticks and threw stones, rocks, Molotov cocktails and teargas projectiles at them. The Court found that in the very sensitive interethnic situation of that time the applicant\u2019s speeches and actions had encouraged interethnic violence and violence against the police. Nonetheless, noting that the applicant was found guilty of stirring up national, racial and religious hatred, disagreement and intolerance, on account of the fact that he had organised a public meeting, the Court rejected the Government argument that Article 11 of the Convention was not applicable in that case. The Court considered that there had been an interference with the exercise of the applicant\u2019s freedom of peaceful assembly. It then examined the necessity and the proportionality of the sanction imposed on the applicant and concluded that the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 11 was manifestly ill-founded.",

She was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment, suspended for three years. In those circumstances, the Court considered that the applicant\u2019s arrest, detention and conviction constituted an interference with the right to freedom of expression.

The Court notes that nothing in the case file suggests that this demonstration was not intended to be peaceful or that the organisers had violent intentions. The Court further observes that the applicant claimed that when he first joined the demonstrators, he started walking and chanting slogans with them. Thus, he had the intention of showing support for Mr \u00d6calan, but not of behaving violently when he started demonstrating, and these submissions were not contested by the Government. Besides, there is nothing in the domestic courts\u2019 decisions showing that the applicant had violent intentions when he joined the demonstration. What is more, the charges against the applicant did not concern infliction of any bodily harm on anyone.

However, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant was detained on remand for three months and twenty days between 21 July and 11 November 2008 and partly served his prison sentence arising from the judgment of Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court between 11 November 2008 and 25\u00a0July 2010.

Nor did it provide reasoning for the applicant\u2019s re-conviction of these charges. The Court therefore finds that Diyarbak\u0131r Juvenile Court adhered to the conclusions of Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court regarding the assessment of the evidence and the establishment of the facts of the applicant\u2019s case. Besides, the judgment of 20 December 2012 did not acknowledge or provide redress for the alleged breach of the applicant\u2019s freedom of assembly on account of the applicant\u2019s original convictions for having disseminated propaganda in support of the PKK and having resisted to the police. Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, the reassessment of the applicant\u2019s convictions and sentences as well as the application of Article\u00a0231 of Law no. 5271 did not deprive the applicant of victim status. What is more, the juvenile court\u2019s judgment also had a deterrent effect on the applicant\u2019s future exercise of his right guaranteed under Article 11, since the pronouncement of the applicant\u2019s convictions under section\u00a07(2) of Law no.\u00a03713, sections 33(1), 32(1) and (2) of Law no.\u00a02911 and Article 265 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code was suspended on condition that he did not commit another wilful offence and any failure on the applicant\u2019s part to comply with that condition would lead to the pronouncement of these convictions and the execution of the sentences (see\u00a0paragraphs 36-39 and 52 above and compare Erdo\u011fdu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072; Asl\u0131 G\u00fcne\u015f v.

The line of reasoning in this decision was also used by Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court in its judgment of 11 November 2008 (see paragraph 19 above). The Court therefore considers that the question as to whether the interference based on Article\u00a0314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of assembly was prescribed by law must be examined on the basis not only of the wording of Articles 220 \u00a7 6, 314 \u00a7 2 and 314 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code, but also on that of the decision of 4\u00a0March 2008.

The applicant was therefore convicted of membership of the PKK and sentenced to four years and two months\u2019 imprisonment. This interpretation of Articles 220 \u00a7 6 and 314 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code is in accordance with the reasoning contained in the decision of the Plenary Court of Cassation of 4\u00a0March 2008. According to this line of interpretation, at the material time, if a demonstrator took part in a demonstration or a march for which the PKK had made a general call to participate, and committed one or more offences proscribed under the criminal codes during that event, he or she would be liable to be punished not only for the individual offences committed but also for membership of the PKK. In the light of its examination of these matters below, from the point of view of the \u201cnecessity\u201d of the interference in a democratic society (see paragraphs 110118 below), the Court considers that it is not required to reach a final conclusion on the lawfulness issue in so far as it relates to the applicant\u2019s conviction under Article\u00a0314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. For the same reason, the Court does not deem it necessary to examine the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s convictions under section\u00a07(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) and sections 23(b) and 33(c) of Law no. 2911 by the judgment of 11 November 2008 and those under section\u00a07(2) of Law no.\u00a03713, sections\u00a033(1), 32(1) and (2) of Law no. 2911 and Article 265 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code contained in the judgment of 20\u00a0December 2012.",

In this regard, the Court agrees with the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights that the conviction of a person for membership of an illegal organisation for an act or statement which may be deemed to coincide with the aims or instructions of an illegal organisation is of concern (see paragraphs 66-69 above).",

This general rule, moreover, translates into specific obligations under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention, by requiring domestic courts to provide \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d reasons for an interference. This obligation enables individuals, amongst other things, to learn about and contest the reasons behind a court decision that limits their freedom of expression or freedom of assembly, and thus offers an important procedural safeguard against arbitrary interference with the rights protected under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. The Court is of the opinion that the failure of the domestic courts to provide relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the applicant\u2019s conviction under Article\u00a0314 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Criminal Code and section 7(2) of Law no. 3713 also stripped the applicant of the procedural protection that he was entitled to enjoy by virtue of his right under Article 11 (see, mutatis mutandis, Sayg\u0131l\u0131 and Seyman v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 51041/99, \u00a7 24, 27 June 2006; Mente\u015f v.

In this context, the Court notes Article\u00a037 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and General Comment No. 10 (2007) of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, according to which the arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child can be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time (see paragraphs 60 and 61 above). The Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe also issued resolutions and recommendations in the same vein (see paragraphs 62-64 above). In the present case, there is nothing in the case file to show that the national courts sufficiently took the applicant\u2019s age into consideration in ordering and continuing his detention on remand or in imposing a prison sentence.

What is more, the applicant was detained pending trial for almost four months and the Government did not argue that alternative methods had been considered first or that the applicant\u2019s detention had been used only as a measure of last resort, in compliance with their obligations under both domestic law and a number of international conventions (see, mutatis mutandis, G\u00fcve\u00e7 v.

The Court considers that when individuals are involved in such acts the State authorities enjoy a wider margin of appreciation when examining the need for an interference with freedom of assembly (see, mutatis mutandis, S\u00fcrek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a026682/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999IV). As a result, the imposition of a sanction for such a reprehensible act would be considered to be compatible with the guarantees of Article 11 of the Convention, as also submitted by the Government (see Osmani and Others, cited above; Galstyan, cited above, \u00a7 115; and Y\u0131lmaz Y\u0131ld\u0131z and Others, cited above, \u00a7 42). While it is true that with the judgment of 20 December 2012 the juvenile court decided to suspend the pronouncement of the criminal convictions arising from the applicant\u2019s act of violence, the Court cannot overlook the harshness of the sentence imposed on the applicant by Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court pursuant to sections 23(b) and 33(c) of Law no.\u00a02911, that is to say, two years, nine months and ten days\u2019 imprisonment, a sentence that the applicant partly served, or the lengthy period during which he was detained pending trial. In the Court\u2019s view, its considerations regarding the disproportionate nature of the penalties imposed on the applicant by the assize court pursuant to Article\u00a0314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code and section 7(2) of Law no.\u00a03713 equally apply under this head, in particular, in view of the applicant\u2019s age. In this context, the Court cannot but conclude that the applicant\u2019s punishment for throwing stones at the police officers during the demonstration was not proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued.",
