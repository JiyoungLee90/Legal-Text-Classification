In these circumstances, the \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d is also based on a reasonably justified reliance on administrative decisions which have a sound legal basis and bear on property rights (see Kopeck\u00fd v.\u00a0Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, \u00a7\u00a7 45-47, ECHR 2004-IX, and Pyrantien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 61).

While the Government contested this figure, they did not submit an alternative assessment. In any event, the Court finds it reasonable to conclude that the market value of the land in 2007 was higher than the nominal price paid by the applicants in\u00a01996. It should also be noted that the LTL 129 returned to the applicants had obviously suffered considerable devaluation and could not reasonably relate to the value of the land eleven years later. Accordingly, the Court finds that the compensation of LTL 129 paid to the applicants in 2007 was clearly insufficient for the purchase of a new comparable plot of land (see, mutatis mutandis, Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7 207).",
