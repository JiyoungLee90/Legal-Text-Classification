With reference to D.J.\u2019s neck injuries (questions nos. 1, 2 and 3) the expert stated that they had been inflicted by a hard blunt object impacting with considerable force. According to her, those injuries could have occurred when the officer M.K. had attempted to restrain D.J. by applying a type of neck hold from behind. Since M.K. was much smaller than D.J., he had been in fact hanging on D.J.\u2019s neck. This strong pressure on D.J.\u2019s neck had exposed him to a direct risk of death or grievous bodily harm. However, in view of the \u201cdynamics of the incident\u201d, the expert could not confidently indicate which person had been directly responsible (question no. 6). It could also not be excluded that those injuries had occurred when D.J. had fallen on the ground.",

She stated that such a condition could not be identified anatomically during a post-mortem examination, but only afterwards on the basis of the victim\u2019s characteristics and when other causes of death were excluded. Deaths often occurred during police intervention and individuals who suffered EDS were often heavy-set men. During arrest they demonstrated extraordinary physical strength and resistance to pain. Death happened within the first hour of the incident. Such cases were most frequently associated with cocaine abuse.

In view of that discovery, the officers had decided to arrest him. D.J. had attempted to convince them not to arrest him by offering money. The arrest attempt had failed as D.J. had refused to comply with the officers\u2019 orders and had begun to walk away from the car. They had managed to bring him back but he had still resisted their attempts to handcuff him. He had been agitated and had demonstrated extraordinary physical strength.
