Having obtained the expert opinion, which stated that the applicant had not signed the power of attorney, the courts rejected it essentially on the grounds that the original power of attorney had not been presented to the expert and had not been examined in the course of the trial. However, they did not examine whether the applicant had ever been in position to present the original of the power of attorney which, he claimed, he had never signed.
