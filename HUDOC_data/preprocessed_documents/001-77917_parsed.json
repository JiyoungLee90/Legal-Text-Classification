In particular, the courts considered that certain aspects of the lawfulness and the justification of the applicant's detention were beyond their jurisdiction (see Nikolova, cited above, \u00a7 61). In particular, the courts repeatedly failed to address the applicant's arguments and to assess specific facts and evidence about the possible danger of the applicant absconding, re-offending or obstructing the investigation, but simply relied on the seriousness of the charge against him to justify his continuing detention (see paragraph 29 above). In addition, they explicitly refused to examine the reasonableness of the suspicion grounding the arrest of the applicant, as noted in the decisions of the Plovdiv Regional Court of 13 July and 15 September 1999 (see paragraphs\u00a030 and 31 above).",
