The diagnosis on the latter occasion was not related to any heart disease. The Court is not in a position to decide which of the said diagnoses was correct and whether the applicant's allegations that the authorities had failed to acknowledge the existence of the heart disease during his stay in the medical wing of the SIZO had any substance. In these circumstances, it will examine whether the medical treatment had been adequate for the applicant's state of health. In this connection it observes that the applicant was placed in the medical wing of the SIZO the day after he had complained of chest pain. He was prescribed medication and regularly examined by a doctor. On 11 March 2003 he was discharged in a satisfactory state of health and had no further health-related complaints until his release from the SIZO some five months later. This latter point is not contested by the applicant. Furthermore, his hospitalisation in August 2003 after his release does not appear to have had any causal link to his medical treatment between January and March 2003. His allegation that he had had a heart attack is not supported by sufficient details, including the date of the incident. Finally, his state of health does not appear to be so poor as to make it as such incompatible with the detention.",

Such measures must also be taken in respect of other persons in the applicant's position, notably by solving the problems that have led to the Court's findings (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7 249, ECHR 2000-VIII; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2002-VI; Lukenda v.

Despite the existence of the domestic judicial authorities competent to examine such cases and to order release, it appears that without a clear procedure for review of the lawfulness of the detention the above authorities often remain a theoretical rather than practical remedy for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Molodorych v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0108, not final). Moreover, speediness of review of the lawfulness of the detention seems to be compromised by the fact that such a review is linked to other procedural steps in the criminal case against the applicant during the investigation and trial, while such procedural steps might not necessarily coincide with the need to decide on the applicant's further detention promptly and with reasonable intervals (see, among many other authorities, Svershov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-72, and Sergey Volosyuk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05259). Finally, the current legislation does not protect the applicants from arbitrariness, when, like in Yeloyev case, the domestic court refused to look again into the reasonableness of the applicant's detention on the ground that it had ruled on the lawfulness of his detention on several previous occasions, therefore denying the applicant's right to a review of the lawfulness of his detention as guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Yeloyev v.\u00a0Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7 65).

Having regard to the structural nature of the problem disclosed in the present case, the Court stresses that specific reforms in Ukraine's legislation and administrative practice should be urgently implemented in order to bring such legislation and practice into line with the Court's conclusions in the present judgment to ensure their compliance with the requirements of Article 5. The Court leaves it to the State, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, to determine what would be the most appropriate way to address the problems and requests the Government to submit the strategy adopted in this respect within six months from the date on which the present judgment becomes final at the latest..",
