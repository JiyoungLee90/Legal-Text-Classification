The case originated in an application (no. 49915/08) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Milan Ignjatović (“the applicant”), on 19 September 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Ralević, a lawyer practising in Majdanpek. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by Mr S. Carić, their Agent at the time, and later by Ms N. Plavšić, the newly-appointed Agent.
On 24 July 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Donji Milanovac.
He was employed by Ðerdap, a company in Kladovo (Ribarsko gazdinstvo “Ðerdap” – hereinafter “the debtor company”).
On 28 December 1998 the applicant was reassigned to a lower post by his employer. He was subsequently dismissed on 20 January 2000. These two decisions, taken by the company’s managing director, were upheld by its board of management.
On 18 February 1999 the applicant filed a civil claim against the debtor company; on 26 April 2000 he filed a separate claim seeking reinstatement to a suitable position, as well as the outstanding salary payments and social benefits.
On 19 June 2003 the Majdanpek Municipal Court (hereinafter “the Municipal Court”) ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the debtor company to reinstate the applicant to a post which corresponded to his professional qualifications and to pay him specified amounts on account of salary arrears and social insurance contributions, plus the costs of the civil proceedings. This judgment became final on 23 October 2003.
On 16 February 2004, 9 March 2004, 18 and 19 October 2004, respectively upon the applicant’s requests to that effect, the Municipal Court accepted the enforcement of the said judgment and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicant the enforcement costs.
The Municipal Court provided the National Bank of Serbia (Narodna banka Srbije – “the Central Bank”) with the above-mentioned enforcement orders on 14 April 2004, 20 July 2004 and 11 November 2004, respectively.
It would appear that none of the above-mentioned enforcement orders have been enforced to date.
On 8 April 2010 the Central Bank informed the Zaječar Commercial Court of the suspension of the debtor company’s accounts for three years.
On 13 April 2010 the Commercial Court opened preliminary insolvency proceedings against the debtor company.
On 30 June 2010 the Commercial Court opened and closed the insolvency proceedings against the debtor company and that decision became final on 10 August 2010.
The debtor company was ultimately struck from the relevant public register on 31 August 2010.
The debtor company in the present case had been a socially owned company. In 1991 it was transformed into a limited company which remained mainly socially owned, and remained as such until it was struck off the register (see , accessed on 1 December 2016).
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially owned companies, as well as enforcement and insolvency proceedings, was outlined in the cases of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia (nos. 2269/06 et al., §§ 57-64 and 71-76, 15 January 2008) and Jovičić and Others v. Serbia ((dec.), no. 37270/11, §§ 88-93, 15 October 2013). Furthermore, the case-law of the Constitutional Court in respect of socially owned companies, together with the relevant provisions concerning constitutional redress was likewise outlined in the admissibility decision in Marinković v. Serbia ((dec.), no. 5353/11, §§ 26 -29 and 31-44, 29 January 2013), the judgment in Marinković v. Serbia (no. 5353/11, §§ 29-31, 22 October 2013) and the decision in Ferizović v. Serbia ((dec.), no. 65713/13, §§ 12-17, 26 November 2013).
