To give some examples: in May 2000 and April 2002 the applicant gave a detailed description of two servicemen who had been among the perpetrators of the attack and stated that she could have identified at least one of them (see paragraphs 41 and 47 above). No steps were taken by the investigators to follow up this information. In August 2000 the investigation decided not to obtain an expert ballistics report on the cartridges found at the scene of the killings (see paragraph 60 above), although the results of such a report could have been vital in identifying the persons who had committed the crime. Although some servicemen were questioned about the attack, the majority of them stated that they knew nothing of the events or that their units had not been deployed in the area. The servicemen of the two \u201csuspect\u201d units \u2013 the 205th brigade stationed in Budennovsk and the special police forces from the North-Western region - were not questioned properly. In particular no attempts were made to resolve the apparent discrepancy between the statements of the officers of the 205th brigade and the information from the staff of the Northern Caucasus military circuit about the position of the brigade in the end of January 2000 (see paragraphs 74 and 75 above). The review of the relevant documents from the 205th motor rifle brigade did not go beyond stating that they contained no information relevant to the investigation (see paragraph 74 above).",

It appears that no attempt was made to check credible allegations that a number of attacks committed in the district at the same time had followed the same pattern and could have been committed by the same persons, most probably servicemen stationed in the district. The Court finds the statements to that effect made by the officers of the Staropromyslovskiy ROVD in December 2001 and April 2002 to be particularly striking (see paragraphs 80 and 82 above).",

She was again questioned in October 2003. Independently of these proceedings, the applicant was questioned by military prosecutors in April 2003.

In that judgment the Court also referred to the conclusions of the domestic court which had found that by 19 January 2000 the Staropromyslovskiy district was under the control of Russian forces and therefore only they could have conducted security operations there (see Khashiyev and Akayeva cited above, \u00a7\u00a039-42).

Thus, it has found that where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which an issue will arise under Article 3 of the Convention (see Tomasi v.
