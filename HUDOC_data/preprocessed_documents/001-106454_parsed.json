Further, contrary to the requirements of Article 165-1 of the CCP, he had not been provided with a copy of the decision to remand him in custody, and had not been afforded an opportunity to appeal against it.

Secondly, in breach of Article 165-2 of the CCP, he had not been brought before a judge following his arrest.

As by that time the investigation had already collected ample evidence that the applicant had participated in the killing of B. and stealing his valuables, and as the applicant had absconded, there were sufficient grounds for taking the decision to remand him in custody. The provisions of Article 148 of the CCP concerning the need to produce a bill of indictment within ten days of the arrest of a suspect were not applicable in the present case, since the initial bill of indictment in the applicant\u2019s respect had been drawn up before his arrest (on 26 November 2001) and he therefore had no longer been a suspect upon his arrest. The decision of 5 December 2001 had accordingly been valid for holding the applicant in custody during the two-month period following his arrest in accordance with Article 156 of the CCP. Should the pre-trial investigation have lasted longer, the authorities would have needed to re-apply to the District Court to extend the applicant\u2019s detention. However, as the investigation ended on 28 February 2002, the applicant having been committed for trial, his further detention pending trial had been ordered by the District Court itself.",

The Court may review whether national law has been observed for the purposes of this Convention provision; however, it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among other authorities, Zakharkin v. Ukraine, no. 1727/04, \u00a7 84, 24\u00a0June 2010). For the detention to be lawful, it is further essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention \u2212 a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Baranowski v.

In particular, according to the Government, the application of the custodial measure was first upheld by the District Court on 7 March 2002. According to the materials in the case file, the applicant\u2019s continuing detention was further upheld on 14\u00a0June 2004 when the case was remitted for additional investigation; on 12\u00a0October 2004 when the case was referred back to trial; as well as on 31\u00a0March, 19\u00a0April and 18 July 2005 and 21 August 2007 in response to the applicant\u2019s complaints. The Court notes that the copy of the decision of 7\u00a0March 2002 taken at the close of the preparatory hearing and available to it does not contain any decision concerning either the applicant\u2019s detention or his release. No copy of any other decision on the subject taken on that date has been provided by the parties. However, it appears from the Government\u2019s submissions that such a decision was taken with reference to the absence of any reasons for releasing the applicant, rather than in the form of a statement of reasons for holding him in custody. The Court further notes that the subsequent decisions concerning the applicant\u2019s detention lack any express reasoning for his continuing detention and do not set time-limits for it. The Court has already held in other cases that such a practice, which is recurrent in Ukraine, whereby court orders made during the trial stage set no time-limits for the further detention of a defendant, and uphold rather than extend his or her previous detention, is not compatible with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention (see, for example, Kharchenko v. Ukraine, no. 40107/02, \u00a7 98, 10 February 2011). The Government have not provided any arguments warranting the Court\u2019s departure from this approach in the present case.",

It accepts that this fact, along with the applicant\u2019s disappearance, may have initially warranted ordering his detention. However, after a certain lapse of time the judicial authorities were obliged to re-assess the applicant\u2019s personal situation and to give express grounds for his continued detention. In the meantime, the only decision citing the grounds for upholding the applicant\u2019s continued detention, which is presented in the case file, was taken on 21 August 2007 (see paragraph 40 above). The reasons, cited in this decision, are essentially the same as those mentioned in the initial decision given some five years earlier, without any updated details. Furthermore, at no stage did the domestic courts consider applying any alternative preventive measures, and by relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and the fact that the applicant had absconded at the beginning of the investigation, the authorities extended the applicant\u2019s detention on grounds which, regard being had to the length of the detention at issue, cannot be regarded as \u201csufficient\u201d.",
