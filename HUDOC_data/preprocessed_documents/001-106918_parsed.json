It accepted certain extra costs for medication, medical treatment and support material as well as for certain travel up to a specific amount. However, in the Office\u2019s view, the total of the applicant\u2019s extra costs per year amounted to no more than SEK 7,300 from September 1999, SEK 8,900 from January\u00a02000 and SEK 6,800 from January 2001. Thus, the Office concluded that the applicant\u2019s extra costs did not reach the minimum level established for each year to be granted disability benefits (namely SEK\u00a010,374 for 1999, SEK 10,431 for 2000 and SEK 10,517 for 2001, which was equal to 28.5% of the basic amount in line with the price index [basbelopp]). It further noted that the applicant had claimed that she needed help with shopping and some cleaning and driving but that she had not stated that she had a daily need for assistance. In this respect, the Office took into account that the applicant was married and could rely on some help from her husband. Therefore, it considered that she had failed to show that she had a substantial need of assistance in her daily life (minimum two hours per day). Finally, it found that the total need of support was not sufficient for disability benefits to be granted. The decision was based on Sections 5 and 6 of the Act on Disability Benefits and Care Allowance (Lagen om handikappers\u00e4ttning och v\u00e5rdbidrag, Act no. 1998:703) and the Office also had two medical certificates at its disposal from different doctors who had treated the applicant.",

In the alternative, she requested that the court declare her entitled to disability benefits as from June 1999. She maintained her claims and developed her reasons for why the various extra costs were essential. She further added that the Office had failed to investigate her actual need for assistance, which she alleged amounted to one hour per day, in order to estimate the total cost of extra needs due to the disability. Moreover, the applicant stated that she needed manual lymphatic drainage which the County Council of Blekinge lacked resources to provide. Since her need was medically documented, she had to travel to a neighbouring county for treatment at her own expense. In this connection, she alleged that she was unable, due to her illness, to use public transport for which reason her travel expenses were higher than calculated by the Office.

The applicant was not considered to be in need of assistance on a daily basis to such an extent that this alone could constitute a basis for granting disability benefits. Turning to the extra costs, the court shared the Office\u2019s conclusions and calculations but added some additional costs for special soap. It also observed that the County Council was responsible for the costs related to the treatment for lymphatic drainage and that these costs thus could not be included in the calculation of disability benefits. Furthermore, it found that the medical certificates invoked before it did not show that the applicant was unable to use public transport. The court concluded, in an overall assessment of the applicant\u2019s need of assistance and of her extra costs, that the conditions for granting disability benefits were not fulfilled and, thus, that the applicant was not eligible for a disability allowance.",

As to the disabled person\u2019s need of support, regard must be had to the fact that support may be provided naturally to a certain extent by the person\u2019s husband or wife or another person with whom the person is living. If the support amounts to two hours per day, the need for assistance is considered time-consuming and may, for that reason, constitute a basis for granting disability benefits amounting to 36% of the basic amount, even if there are no extra expenses (see Guidelines of the National Social Insurance Board, Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket, AR 1998:5, applicable at the time of the Office\u2019s decision). As far as the assessment of extra costs is concerned, account has to be taken of whether and to what extent the disabled person has access to assistance provided by the municipal social services, such as having his or her own personal assistant or having the possibility of using municipal transport services for the disabled. According to the above-mentioned Guidelines, considerable extra expenses incurred as a consequence of the functional impairment may in themselves result in a right to disability benefits amounting to 36% of the basic amount, provided the extra expenses come to at least 28.5% of the basic amount. It is necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the Guidelines, the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should attain at least 28.5% of the basic amount in order to make the individual eligible for disability benefit. Thus, if a person needs support for only one hour per day but also extra expenses amounting to 15% of the basic amount, he or she is entitled to 36% of the basic amount in disability benefits (see Guidelines of the National Social Insurance Board, cited above, p. 24).",

The Supreme Court stated that the plaintiff\u2019s right to damages on account of a violation of Article 5 should be assessed in the first place under the Tort Liability Act (Skadest\u00e5ndslagen, Act no.\u00a01972:207) and the Act on Compensation for Deprivation of Liberty and Other Coercive Measures (Lagen om ers\u00e4ttning vid frihetsber\u00f6vanden och andra tv\u00e5ngs\u00e5tg\u00e4rder, Act no. 1998:714).

If \u2019s obligations under Article 5 \u00a7 5 could not be met by such an interpretation, the domestic courts should award compensation without the support of specific legal provisions. As concerned the determination of the level of compensation, the Supreme Court repeated that the Court\u2019s case-law was a natural point of departure but also noted that account must be taken of the fact that different national conditions may lead to variations from one country to another in what should be regarded as a reasonable level of compensation.",

Having found that compensation for the violation could not be awarded directly on the basis of the Tort Liability Act, the Supreme Court held that there was no reason to limit the scope of application of the principle established in the abovementioned cases of 9 June 2005 and 21 September 2007 to violations of Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention. In view of this and with reference to, inter alia, Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention and the Court\u2019s case-law under these Articles, the Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiffs should be awarded non-pecuniary damage for the violation of Article 8. With regard to the levels of compensation, the Supreme Court concluded that they should not be too far removed from the levels which applied when awarding damages under the Tort Liability Act. Generally speaking, these levels should, however, be compatible with the case-law of the Court. In the same case, Svea Court of Appeal had also concluded, in a judgment dated 12\u00a0January 2006, that there had been a violation of Article 8 and that an award for non-pecuniary damage should be made on the basis of the principle established in the case of 9 June 2005.",

The first of these Supreme Court judgments had been delivered more than a year before the present application was lodged with the Court. Accordingly, the legal position under domestic law had to be considered to have been sufficiently clear at the time when the present application was introduced before the Court. In this connection, the Government pointed out that the existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy, which was not obviously futile, was not a valid reason for failing to exhaust domestic remedies. The compensatory remedy which existed at the time of the introduction of the application to the Court had been available to the applicant at that point in time as the limitation period in respect of such a claim was ten years from the point in time when the damage occurred. Thus it had been open to the applicant to take full advantage of that remedy when she had filed her application with the Court.

In these circumstances, in the Court\u2019s view, it has not been shown that, at the time of the applicant\u2019s lodging the present application, there existed a remedy which was able to afford redress in respect of the violation alleged by the applicant (see also Bladh v. Sweden (dec.), no. 46125/06, 10\u00a0November 2009, \u00a7\u00a7 23-27).",

Leaving open the question of whether the applicant could have been obliged to institute domestic compensation proceedings after the date of introduction, the Court notes, again, that the underlying issues in the cases mentioned by the Government were different to those raised in the present case. While the Court welcomes the development in Swedish law concerning the possibility to claim compensation on the basis of alleged violations of the Convention, it must be kept in mind that this development is a rather recent one. Consequently, it cannot generally be required of an individual applicant to pursue a compensation claim in respect of Convention issues that have not been determined by the domestic courts or are not closely related to issues that have been so determined. The reason for this is that, in many of these cases, the existence of the remedy cannot yet be considered as sufficiently certain. This consideration is even more important in a situation where the decisions allegedly establishing the remedy were issued after the introduction of the application before the Court.",

According to these provisions, it needed to be established that a person had become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needed time-consuming assistance from another person on a daily basis or otherwise had considerable extra expenses. If the disabled person needed assistance on a daily basis and, in addition to this, had extra expenses, the issue of whether he or she was entitled to disability benefits and the amount of compensation was to be decided on basis of the total need of support.",

The applicant\u2019s request for an oral hearing did not include any issues that could not have been decided on the basis of the case file and the parties\u2019 written submissions. Moreover, the judgment of the Administrative Court of Appeal was unanimous. As the applicant was represented by counsel throughout the entire proceedings, her interests were properly presented and protected and it was not difficult for her to argue her case in writing. The Court finds that the administration of justice did not require in the applicant\u2019s case that she be afforded a right to explain, on her own behalf or through her representative, her personal situation, taken as a whole at the relevant time, in a hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal (see, e contrario, Andersson v. , no. 17202/04, 7 December 2010).",
