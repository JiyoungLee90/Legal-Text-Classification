Where contact with the parent might appear to threaten those interests or interfere with those rights, it is for the national authorities to strike a fair balance between them (see Hokkanen, cited above, p. 22, \u00a7 58; Nuutinen, cited above, \u00a7 128; and Scozzari and Giunta v.

It does not appear from the evidence that they were ever asked for their opinion, either directly in an interview with a judge or a counsellor or indirectly through expert assessments which would have provided an opportunity to ascertain their views and feelings about the adoption in practical terms. The centre where the children had lived for approximately five and six years respectively at the time of the adoption orders, and where they had been looked after and brought up, had no means of conveying its opinion, based on its knowledge of them, during the proceedings. Once this became possible, the children themselves instituted proceedings to have the adoption orders revoked, thereby finally being able to express the view that they did not wish to move to  to live with the applicants. In short, there were no emotional or de facto ties that would have allowed the children to feel close to the applicants and would have provided the legal fiction of the adoption order with some substance that could be held to constitute family life.",

Nor, to my mind, is the existence of family life sufficiently established by the fact that the applicants always viewed themselves as the girls\u2019 parents and behaved as such towards them through the only means open to them, namely by sending them letters written in Romanian. That would imply that, in this context, the position of children aged nearly 10 should be completely disregarded.",

I am not saying that this factor in itself constitutes a reason to abandon efforts to find a family to provide a loving environment for a child, even if this has to be in another country. However, the very delicate position in which such children find themselves certainly requires special protection. In the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption, such protection is afforded, for example, by the obligation on States to give due consideration to the possibilities for placing the child within the State of origin (Article 4 (b)) and to ensure, having regard to the age and degree of maturity of the child, that he or she has been counselled and duly informed of the effects of the adoption and that consideration has been given to the child\u2019s wishes and opinions (Article 4 (d)).",

I cannot endorse such an interpretation of Article 6, which amounts to acknowledging the absolute pre-eminence of every legal rule. In my opinion, Article 6 cannot justify the execution of a judicial decision whose application infringes the fundamental rights of others. In the present case the execution of the decisions in question would have forced the children to leave their country against their will to live with parents whom they had never met. I do not believe that the Romanian authorities should have enforced such decisions.
