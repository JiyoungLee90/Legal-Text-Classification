The case originated in an application (no. 12605/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Polish nationals, Mr Leon and Mrs Agnieszka Kania (“the applicants”), on 7 April 2003.
The applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mr Z. Cichoń, a lawyer practising in . The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 21 April 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants were born in 1929 and 1936 respectively and live in Mielec.
In 1978 the craftsmen’s cooperative (spółdzielnia rzemieślnicza) “Wielobranżowa” established its seat next to the applicants’ home. It was engaged in a wide range of commercial activities, including various maintenance services for lorries, metal cutting and grinding machines and other small-scale operations in the iron and steel industry.
On an unspecified date in 1985 the applicants instituted administrative proceedings to have the cooperative cease its activities. They alleged that the level of noise and pollution emitted by the cooperative exceeded a tolerable level.
On 25 March 1986 the Mielec District Office ordered the liquidation of the craftsmen’s cooperative “Wielobranżowa” by the end of 1995 or alternatively that it switch to activities that did not cause a nuisance. During the remaining months of 1986 the cooperative was to adapt its activities in order to comply with the rules on the protection of the environment and the emission of noise.
On 5 September 1986 the Director of the Department for Architecture of the Provincial Office in Rzeszów upheld that decision. The applicants appealed, contesting the lengthy period foreseen for the cooperative’s liquidation and urging its shutdown.

For a presentation of the relevant domestic law, see Kaniewski v. Poland, no. 38049/02, 8 February 2006; Koss v. Poland, no. 52495/99, 28 March 2006; and Borysiewicz, no. 71146/01, 1 July 2008.
The relevant domestic remedies for nonenforcement of a final administrative decision are listed in the Law of 17 June 1966 on enforcement proceedings in administration (ustawa o postępowaniu egzekucyjnym w administracji). In particular, Section III applies to the execution of non-pecuniary obligations. Chapter II in so far as relevant (Articles 119 et seq.) provides for a possibility of imposing a pecuniary penalty on an individual or a natural person compelling him to comply with an imposed obligation.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”), are stated in the Court’s decisions in the cases of Charzyński v.
