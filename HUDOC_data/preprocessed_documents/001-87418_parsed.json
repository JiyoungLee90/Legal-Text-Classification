This raises a question as to what extent such \u201cvarying\u201d differed in its legal consequences from the simple quashing of the final decision. The Court takes note of the ruling of the Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan, according to which Article 429.0.2 of the CCP did not empower the Plenum to \u201cvary\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions based on a finding of errors of fact or law, as this would, in essence, constitute a new judgment on the merits of the case. Instead, in such a situation, the Plenum had to remit the case for reexamination. It therefore follows that, relying on Article 429.0.2 of the CCP, the Plenum could make only technical changes to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions that would not interfere with the substantive conclusion on the merits of the case.",

However, following such an appeal, there appeared to be no specific time-limit for the actual review of the case by the Plenum. Third, the procedure of additional cassation could be initiated only when the ordinary appeals had been exhausted, that is, after the delivery of a final decision by the court of cassation instance, and could not be used to obtain a review of judgments of first-instance or appellate courts which had become final (see Article 422 of the CCP).",

In the present case, the Plenum of the Supreme Court quashed the Supreme Court\u2019s final decision of 11 January 2002 and granted G.R.\u2019s claim in full.\u00a0Although after the Plenum\u2019s decision the applicant technically retained the title to the apartment, she was now required, inter alia, to give up space in the apartment for G.R. to reside, as well as to seek the consent of the latter, as a registered co-resident, for future transactions involving the apartment. The applicant could no longer enjoy unrestricted rights to possess, use and dispose of her property free of all encumbrances, which had been confirmed by the final decision 11 January 2002. Accordingly, the quashing of the final and binding judicial decision frustrated the applicant\u2019s reliance on it and deprived her of the possibility to peacefully enjoy her possession.",

The Court observes that neither the Plenum of the Supreme Court itself nor the Government have sought to offer any justification for the interference that has taken place in the present case. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the quashing of the final domestic decision by way of the additional cassation procedure placed an excessive burden on the applicant and was therefore incompatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (compare with Brum\u0103rescu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 77-79, and Kot, cited above, \u00a7\u00a033).
