It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim\u2019s behaviour (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV). However, to fall under Article\u00a03 of the Convention, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Vala\u0161inas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a7 100-01, ECHR 2001-VIII). When a person is held in detention the State must ensure that he is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Vala\u0161inas, cited above, \u00a7 102, and Kud\u0142a v.  [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7\u00a094, ECHR\u00a02000XI). When assessing conditions of detention, their cumulative effects must be considered, as well as the applicant\u2019s specific allegations (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2001II). The duration of the detention is also a relevant factor.",

The Court further notes from the parties\u2019 submissions that the applicant was held alone in cells measuring between 6.9 and 22.7 sq. m (see paragraphs 28 and 36 above). He was at all times provided with an individual sleeping place (see paragraphs 31 and 40 above), had unrestricted access to a toilet and to running water (see paragraphs 30 and 39 above) and received food three times a day (see paragraphs 33 and 43 above). The Court notes the applicant\u2019s allegations of poor natural and artificial lighting in the cells, low temperatures in the cells, lack of opportunity to have a shower, bed linen not provided, absence of drinking water tanks in the cells, lack of outdoor exercise and substandard quality of food, all of which is disputed by the Government. However, the Court does not find it necessary to establish the veracity of these allegations as, in any event, it considers that in view of the short duration of the applicant\u2019s stays in that facility, which did not exceed three days on any given occasion and amounted to eleven days altogether between February and April 2005, it cannot be said that their cumulative effect could have been such as to attain the minimum level of severity and to amount to inhuman and degrading treatment under Article\u00a03 of the Convention (see, by contrast, Kantyrev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a037213/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046-54, 21 June 2007; Guliyev v.

For instance, in the case of Kovalev v.\u00a0Russia (no.\u00a078145/01, \u00a7\u00a037, 10\u00a0May 2007), despite the fact that the applicant was represented by his wife, the Court considered it relevant that his claim of ill-treatment by the police had been largely based on his personal experience and that his submissions would therefore have been \u201can important part of the plaintiff\u2019s presentation of the case and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings\u201d. In the case of Khuzhin and Others v. Russia (no. 13470/02, \u00a7\u00a7 53 et seq., 23\u00a0October 2008) the Court found that, by refusing to ensure that imprisoned applicants could attend hearings, and by failing to consider other legal means of ensuring their effective participation in defamation proceedings, the Russian courts had violated the principle of equality of arms. A similar conclusion was reached by the Court in other cases against Russia where the authorities had failed to secure imprisoned applicants\u2019 appearances before the civil courts examining their complaints about the conditions of their detention (see, for instance, Shilbergs, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 107-113; Artyomov v.\u00a0Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0204-208; and Roman Karasev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a030251/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a065-70, 25\u00a0November 2010), and, in a very recent case, where the imprisoned applicant was not afforded an opportunity to personally argue his civil case concerning termination of his parental rights (see Karpenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a05605/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a089-94, 13\u00a0March 2012). In the cases cited above, the Court consistently held that given the nature of the applicants\u2019 claims, which were, to a significant extent, based on their personal experience, an effective, proper and satisfactory presentation of the case could have only been secured by the applicants\u2019 personal attendance at the hearings. The applicants\u2019 testimony pertaining to the facts of the case, of which only they themselves had first-hand knowledge, would have constituted an indispensable part of the plaintiffs\u2019 presentation of the case.",

The District Court could have held an off-site court session at the colony where the applicant was serving his sentence (see paragraph 51 above).
