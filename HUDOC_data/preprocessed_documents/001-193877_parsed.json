Even though the company was wholly owned by the municipality, it was distinct from municipal institutions in that, unlike the latter, it conducted for-profit activities largely subject to private-law rules (see paragraph 22 above and contrast V.K. v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0180). This is further illustrated by the fact that the company and its staff had been engaged to guard the construction site by a private entity, the Main Contractor, under a private-law contract (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above). These considerations, however, do not suffice to absolve the State from responsibility under the Convention for the actions of the security guards.",

Estonia, no. 22574/08, \u00a7 82, 26 April 2016).",

The Court reiterates that neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 of the Convention prevents a person from waiving of his own free will, either expressly or tacitly, the entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial. However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, such a waiver must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance. Such a waiver need not be explicit, but it must be voluntary and constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right. Before an accused can be said to have implicitly, through his conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be. Moreover, the waiver must not run counter to any important public interest (see Simeonovi v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 21980/04, \u00a7 115, 12 May 2017, with further references).",

Therefore, it would appear entirely in line with this apparently shared position for the first and second applicants to assert that they had been using the park as a public space.

Moreover, it has not been contested that the first and second applicants were actually among the group of protesters who, on 28 May 2010, had been blocking the railroad passage for a bulldozer in the area marked off as a construction site, who had been warned to leave the site and allow the construction to continue and who, having failed to comply, had been surrounded by MG staff and removed from the construction site (see paragraph 45 above). It is evident from that sequence of events that those who continued to be present in that restrained group of protesters until the time of arrest could not have been simple bystanders ignorant of what was at stake and caught up in the events, since any such bystander would have had an opportunity to leave before being surrounded by security guards.",

They had unlawfully erected structures on the pavement, obstructed the passage of pedestrians, and offended and endangered road users. In that case, unlike in Vyerentsov and Shmushkovych, Article 185\u20131 of the Code of Administrative Offences was not applied. While criticising the shortcomings of the judicial procedure which had led to the dispersal of the applicant\u2019s assembly, the Court nevertheless held that the imposition of restrictions on gatherings at which participants breached substantive law was not, as such, unforeseeable (see Chumak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044). In view of the shortcomings in the judicial procedure, which consisted, in particular, in the fact that the courts had taken the authorities\u2019 allegations of inappropriate conduct on the part of the protesters at face value and issued an overly broad order banning the applicant\u2019s assembly, the Court expressed doubt as to whether the interference in that case met the lawfulness requirement. Nevertheless, it proceeded to examine whether the dispersal in that case met the other requirements of Article\u00a011\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a048).",

This follows from a decision of the Constitutional Court, which provides the authoritative interpretation of the relevant constitutional provision (see paragraph 94 above). It is well illustrated by the provision in the Code of Administrative Justice, which requires the court to reject an action for a judicial order restricting an assembly if it has been lodged belatedly, that is on the planned date of the event or thereafter (see paragraph 100 above). This latter provision was subject to the Court\u2019s examination in Chumak, where the Court, for precisely that reason, expressed a doubt as to whether the judicial procedure in question could properly be used to disband an ongoing assembly (cited above, \u00a7\u00a042).",

Accordingly, the Court accepts the Government\u2019s submission that the interference had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the health and safety of protesters and workers. In the latter respect, it can also reasonably be viewed as having been for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The Court notes that the project involved numerous entities and individuals who had a stake in its implementation in terms of urban infrastructure development, economic activity, jobs, performance of contractual obligations etc. (compare Drieman and Others v.

Moreover, at least initially some degree of tolerance was shown vis-\u00e0-vis even the obstructive activity and, in that initial period, some protesters systematically engaged in highly dangerous conduct, such as exposing their bodies to chainsaws (see paragraphs 34 and 35 above regarding video evidence from 24 and 25 May). By the time the applicants were arrested, substantial public attention had already been attracted to the problem (compare Cisse v.

In any event, that repetition came only when the protesters were already restricted in their movement.

After all, the situation on 28 May 2010 has to be seen not in isolation but in the broader context of the events: by that date, it was public knowledge that a construction project was unfolding in the area where the applicants were present and the applicants, who by their own admission, participated in the protests from 20 May 2010, could not but have been aware that the police were likely to be deployed to stop them from interfering in the tree-felling and construction work (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above regarding the evidence concerning the events of 20 and 25 May, for example, and compare Pentik\u00e4inen v.

The access to the area was not physically barred to any great extent, beyond the warning tape (see paragraphs 38 and 40 above). This is corroborated by the domestic authorities\u2019 finding that, when the area was marked off on 28 May 2010, there were already protesters inside it (see paragraph 83 above). In such circumstances, the security staff\u2019s involvement consisted in attempts to remove the protesters from the path of the construction machinery and from the construction site rather than deny them entry to it. This situation was fraught with tension and bound to create greater friction than a simple denial of access to a welldefined and guarded area. In other words, the security guards acted on the basis of a framework focussed on operations within limited and welldefined perimeters with restricted access, which appears to have been inapplicable or, at least impractical, in the context of the events as they actually unfolded.",

In fact, the situation was far from unexpected since by the time of the events in question (27 and 31 May 2010) the standoff had been ongoing for seven and eleven days respectively and, in fact, the Main Contractor, which had appointed the security personnel, had informed the police of the likelihood of clashes with the protesters ahead of time (see paragraph 26 above).

The authorities\u2019 failure to investigate the alleged presence on the scene of the protests of unidentified persons bearing security guard insignia without proper authorisation is one of the factors which has led the Court to find a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the present case (see paragraph 168 above). The Court considers that, in the particular circumstances of the present case those failings also have consequences for the respondent State\u2019s compliance with its Article\u00a011 obligations. The authorities\u2019 failure to take any demonstrable steps to investigate that alleged infiltration of the scene of protests by such unidentified and unauthorised persons form part of the respondent State\u2019s failure to take reasonable steps to ensure the peaceful nature of the protests (see, mutatis mutandis,\u00a0Identoba and Others\u00a0v.\u00a0Georgia, no.\u00a073235/12, \u00a7\u00a098, 12 May 2015, and \u00a7\u00a076 the UN Special Rapporteur\u2019s report at paragraph\u00a0115 above).",

It does not suffice that a person is aware that it is likely that he or she might be the addressee of a police action. There needed to have been an audible, clear and feasible order from the police, addressed to the applicants, which was not the case here, as found in the Court\u2019s own assessment of the facts. The majority\u2019s own description of the chaotic nature of the context in which the police order was issued directly contradicts the majority\u2019s conclusion that the applicants understood the police order and \u201cmaliciously\u201d failed to obey the order to leave.",

According to the Convention principle of immediacy, a defendant is not required to renounce statements with which he was not even confronted during the trial hearing and certainly not statements allegedly made before the police under unknown circumstances and without the benefit of legal assistance.

In his appeal, the sixth applicant omitted to request a mitigation of his sentence, insisting instead on his innocence. The Court of Appeal examined his case on 15 September 2010, almost two months after the applicant had served his ten-day detention sentence in full. Thus, a mitigation of his sentence at that stage would not have effectively remedied the effects of the unexplained severity of the sanction imposed by the first-instance court. The majority admit this fact, but go on to blame the defendant for having used his procedural right to appeal a conviction and to ask for his acquittal.
