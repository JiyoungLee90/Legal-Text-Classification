His forehead was bruised with two recent scars. His eyes were bloodshot, swollen and discoloured. He had a cut on his left ear which was recently stitched. This wound may have been inflicted with a knife or a similar sharp object. He had a superficial wound to his right wrist which was caused by his handcuffs. He had abrasions to his left forearm, right shoulder and both knees which could indicate an involvement in a fight or a struggle. He had two cuts on his right buttock which were 1 cm and 3 cm long and recently stitched. These wounds were probably inflicted with a knife or sharp object. On his back he had many superficial, horizontal marks, particularly in his lower lumbar region. These scars on his back may have been caused by whipping or beating. He complained of a pain in his abdomen but it must have been muscular pain because the abdomen did not show signs of internal injury. Such muscular pain could be consistent with punching or kicking. Yusuf was handcuffed to his hospital bed. It is the considered medical opinion [sic] that his injuries could not have been self-inflicted and that his injuries are consistent with being ill-treated in a fight or severely beaten, the condition of his wounds suggest that they were inflicted during the previous week and his injuries indicated that they may have occurred over a period of time as his wounds were at different stages of healing.\u201d",

I was also injured. They cut off my ear with a knife. Between eight and twelve men attacked me and beat me. I lost consciousness. When I came to, they were cutting the soles of my feet with a knife or razor blade. I was screaming with pain. They hit me in the face and wounded me under the left eye. Blood started to flow from the wound. I was injured on the forehead, which also began to bleed. Someone (a policeman) thrust his fingers into my eyes as hard as he could. They didn't stop kicking me. One of them hit me with his gun. I had injuries to my shoulders, which also began to bleed. They split my lips. My left eye was swollen up so much that I could no longer see. I was unable to speak and have absolutely no recollection of them taking a statement from me at the hospital.

On 2 October 1995, towards 4.30 p.m., I went there to turn off the irrigation system, which is near the greenhouse. As I went past the apparatus, I saw two people coming towards me. When they approached, they said to me in Greek: 'Stay where you are. Police.' I realised that they meant me harm and started to run to the village. As I did so, they began to fire at me with automatic weapons equipped with silencers. I heard a shot fly past my head and immediately dropped to the ground. At that point they set about me. They didn't say anything. They hit me. At some point I looked up and saw that there were ten to twelve of them beating me. They did so for a long time. Then I passed out. At the last minute I received a shock. I don't remember whether they used an electric baton or gas. I was semiconscious. In the meantime, they had dragged me and thrown me into the back of a jeep. When it started up, they continued to hit me. Then they began to torture me somewhere; I didn't know where we were. They said that I was an M\u0130T [the Turkish national intelligence agency] agent, asked me whether there were other agents in the area, from whom I received my orders and all sorts of absurd questions of that kind while continuing to beat me without respite. At some point, a masked man arrived with a cutting instrument, something like a knife. He said that if I didn't speak he would cut my ear off, that if I didn't speak he would drink my blood. I must have blacked out as, when I came to, he was cutting the soles of my feet with a cutting instrument. I couldn't see because I was tied up. I was in such pain that I passed out several times. Each time I came to, the torture would start up again. At some stage they laid me out on my back and pushed something like a bayonet into the upper side of my thigh. I screamed and passed out again. They carried on torturing me like that. I couldn't cry out any more. But they continued to torture me like that. When I came to for the last time, I realised that I was somewhere else. They were no longer hitting or cutting me. I couldn't see out of one eye at all, but with the other, which was injured, I tried to make out where I was.",

At some stage they put a table and chairs in my room at the hospital. Two police officers and a judge then came in. When the judge saw the situation he left the room. As he was leaving, I heard him say something about a lawyer. As I was later to learn, it was decided that I was under arrest. Another day the police officers again brought a table and chairs into my room at the hospital. I remember the second time better. I was lying in my bed. I had one hand handcuffed to the bed and an intravenous drip attached to my other arm. My feet were of course also attached to the bed. On this occasion the judge arrived with some lawyers. There were about twenty people in the room, most of them policemen. The judge had ordered that I be held in detention pending trial for eight days so that questioning could continue.

When I regained consciousness, I was in a small room surrounded by uniformed men who verbally abused, intimidated and threatened me. There the Greek-Cypriot police asked me to sign a statement to the effect that 'President Rauf Denkta\u015f is intransigent, does not want peace and as a leader is misleading the Turkish-Cypriot people'. In return, I was offered money, a house and a job in what they called 'the free areas', i.e. South Cyprus. I refused without hesitation. They got angry and started hitting and beating me again. I thought I would be beaten to death. I was punched and slapped across my face. Suddenly one policeman held my head tightly and another cut my ear. I totally blacked out. I came to my senses in a hospital. I was on a stretcher, chained and handcuffed. Again several policemen in civilian clothes approached me, their mouths full of profanity and threats, and again started hitting. They also pressed their hands heavily on my eyes, which really hurt. As a result of such pressure my eyes got bloodshot. In the middle of this ordeal a Greek-Cypriot nurse protested. She was shouting: 'This is enough ... do not hit ... he is wounded ... you brought him here for treatment but you are killing him. He is a human being. This is a sin, even if he is a Turk ... do we have the right to treat him this way, a wounded and chained man ...' The police left me and walked towards the nurse. The Greek-Cypriot police were obviously well-trained and professional in torture methods. I don't even recall if and when I gave a statement. But I recall that twice the Greek-Cypriot police made me sign false confession papers accepting Greek-Cypriot accusations. I was branded a 'dangerous smuggler' and a Turkish-Cypriot 'spy'. In the hospital I was in chains, handcuffed to a bed and put on a drip and continuously given painkillers. The pain was excruciating. For a long time my bruised jaw hurt badly. I had difficulty even drinking water, let alone chewing. The Greek-Cypriot court was brought twice to the hospital, once on a Sunday, because they were ashamed to publicly take me to court. ...\u201d",

According to the Government, it was the Attorney-General who encouraged him to do so. The Court recalls that, according to the Convention organs' case-law, a complaint to the Ombudsman is not in principle a remedy to be exhausted under Article 35 \n\u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Montion v. France, application no. 11192/84, Commission decision of 14 May 1987, Decisions and Reports (DR) 52, p. 227). However, the applicant, by complaining to the Ombudsman, drew the authorities' attention to his allegations. The Attorney-General was prepared to treat the latter as credible. Therefore, in the Court's view, there could have been no doubt that the applicant had at the time an \u201carguable\u201d claim that he had been a victim of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. As a result, the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus were placed under an obligation to carry out \u201ca thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible\u201d.",

The Court has no reason to doubt the effectiveness of the Ombudsman's investigation. However, under domestic law, the Ombudsman does not have the power to order any measures or impose any sanctions (see paragraph 51 above). As a result, the Court considers that at the time of the publication of the Ombudsman's report the obligation of the Cypriot authorities under the Convention to undertake an investigation capable of leading to the punishment (as opposed to the mere identification) of those responsible had not been discharged.",

Even in the most difficult circumstances, such as the fight against organised crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (see Selmouni cited above, \u00a7 95). Of course, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, \nSeries A no. 25, p. 65, \u00a7 162). However, in order to determine whether a particular form of ill-treatment should be qualified as torture, the Court must have regard to the distinction, embodied in the provision, between this notion and that of inhuman or degrading treatment. As the Court has previously found, it appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (see Selmouni cited above, \u00a7 96).",
