By a judgment of 26 April 2013 the Constitutional Court took cognisance of the merits of the case despite the fact that the proceedings were still pending, and reversed the first-instance judgment. Reiterating its previous findings in other domestic judgments, it noted that the right to legal assistance was not meant to be a formality which, if not complied with, gave the accused a means to defend himself. That right served as a guarantee that every statement made by a person during questioning was made freely, in full knowledge of the right to remain silent, and without threats or promises, violence or other abuse. A breach of the right to a fair trial as a result of a lack of legal assistance during questioning occurred when a statement was taken abusively and without the guarantees of legitimacy, and not solely because of the lack of legal assistance. It followed that the sole fact that the applicant had made a statement, including both admissions of guilt and denials, in the absence of a lawyer could not ipso facto entail a violation of Article 6 of the Convention. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, other circumstances such as the particular vulnerability of the individual being questioned had to exist in order to conclude that the absence of legal assistance breached the right to a fair trial. The Constitutional Court could not agree with the first-instance court that Article 6 of the Convention provided for the right to a lawyer without any consideration of the age, maturity and tainted criminal record of the accused as well as the nature of the accusations against him. A correct interpretation of Salduz v. Turkey ([GC], no. 36391/02, ECHR 2008) had to be made in the light of the circumstances of that case, where Mr Salduz had indeed been in a vulnerable position when he had made the statement. The ratio of the right was precisely that, and not to allow a guilty person to go scot-free because of the failure to comply with a formality which lacked any real or grave consequences. The same exceptional and extreme circumstances had been present in other cases decided by the ECtHR such as Panovits v.\u00a0Cyprus (no. 4268/04, 11 December 2008) and P\u0142onka v.\u00a0Poland (no.\u00a020310/02, 31 March 2009), and cases decided by the domestic Constitutional Court such as The Police vs Alvin Privitera of 11\u00a0April 2011 and The Police vs Esron Pullicino of 12 April 2011. Even in the Salduz case the Court had held that such a violation arose only if the fairness of the trial was compromised. The Court had stated in that context that \u201cArticle 6 \u2013 especially paragraph 3 thereof \u2013 may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions\u201d (\u00a7\u00a050). This, according to the Constitutional Court, was probably the reason why the Grand Chamber had not embraced the more categorical approach suggested by Judge Bratza in his concurring opinion.",

The Constitutional Court further noted that Mr Salduz\u2019s young age had not been the decisive factor for the finding in that case, but merely a further argument. Moreover, it was not necessary in the case at hand to examine whether there existed any compelling reasons to justify the absence of a lawyer during questioning or whether such restrictions prejudiced the case, in so far as at the relevant time Maltese law had not provided for the right to legal assistance at that stage of the investigation and therefore there had been no need for the accused to request it. There had therefore been a systemic restriction on access to a lawyer under the relevant legal provision in force at the time.

As a result, a number of cases where the accused had not been represented by a lawyer \u2013 because the matter was not regulated in Maltese law \u2013 were found not to violate the Convention and the Constitution. Nevertheless, in The Republic of Malta vs Alfred Camilleri of 12 November 2012 the Constitutional Court, in the particular circumstances of the case, found a violation of the accused\u2019s fair trial rights, in particular because he had not even been cautioned by the police. However, following a request for retrial which was upheld by a judgment of the Constitutional Court of 31 January 2014, no violation was found in that case because the accused, who had given a statement in the absence of a lawyer, had not been forced to reply to the questions put to him by the police, nor was he particularly vulnerable to the extent that he would have required the assistance of a lawyer. The accused was fifty-five years old and therefore mature. While he had never been to prison or been questioned, he had already been found guilty of minor charges and therefore was acquainted with the law. Lastly, his statement had not been the only evidence, as some police officers had been eyewitnesses to his handling of the drugs in issue.",

The Government noted that in Albu and Others v. Romania (nos. 34796/09 etc., 10 May 2012), the Court had reiterated the general principles applicable in cases concerning conflicting court decisions. The Court had emphasised that it was not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court, unless they had infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Furthermore, it had reiterated that the possibility of conflicting court decisions was an inherent trait of any judicial system. For the Court it was important to establish whether \u201cprofound and long-standing differences\u201d existed in the case-law of the domestic courts, whether the domestic law provided for machinery for overcoming those inconsistencies, whether that machinery had been applied and, if appropriate, to what effect. A key consideration in assessing the above was whether a certain stability in legal situations had been ensured, as legal certainty contributed to public confidence in the courts. However, the requirements of legal certainty did not create a right of consistency of case-law, given that case-law development was not, in itself, contrary to the proper administration of justice. The Court had observed that achieving consistency of the law might take time, and that periods of conflicting case-law might therefore be tolerated without undermining legal certainty.",

On the other hand, in the Agius and Fenech cases a violation had been found by the Constitutional Court because they were very similar to the Privitera, Lombardi and Pullicino cases cited by the applicant. According to the Government\u2019s analysis of the cases, it was clear that the reason for the finding of a violation had been the vulnerability of the accused and the fact that the only evidence had been their own admission of guilt, made in the absence of legal assistance. Ms Agius and Mr Fenech had been very young when the statements had been taken, and on the basis of their age the domestic courts had found that this factor was decisive when analysing whether the individual had suffered a violation as a result of the lack of legal assistance. In the other three cases (Muscat, Spiteri and Camilleri), like in the applicant\u2019s case, the accused had been mature adults: Mr Muscat had given the statement while he was imprisoned following a sentence for a double murder that he had committed, and Mr Spiteri had been a high-ranking police officer. In all four cases (Muscat, Spiteri, Camilleri and the applicant\u2019s) there was other evidence besides the statements, and the latter did not contain an admission of guilt on the part of the individual concerned.

From an analysis of the judgments it clearly transpired that the Constitutional Court attributed importance to the vulnerability of the individual in those cases where the only evidence that the prosecution had was an admission of guilt made in the statement. The Constitutional Court has also established that each and every case was considered on its own merits, and if it transpired that the person was not a vulnerable person, or when there was other evidence besides an admission of guilt made in a statement, the Constitutional Court did not find an Article\u00a06 violation.

Turkey [GC], no. 13279/05, \u00a7 57, 20\u00a0October 2011). The persistence of conflicting court decisions, on the other hand, can create a state of legal uncertainty likely to reduce public confidence in the judicial system, whereas such confidence is clearly one of the essential components of a State based on the rule of law (see Vin\u010di\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Serbia, nos.  and others, \u00a7 56, 1 December 2009). However, the requirements of legal certainty and the protection of the legitimate confidence of the public do not confer an acquired right to consistency of case-law (see Un\u00e9dic v. France, no. , \u00a7 74, 18 December 2008) and case-law development is not, in itself, contrary to the proper administration of justice since a failure to maintain a dynamic and evolutive approach would risk hindering reform or improvement (see Atanasovski v.\u00a0the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. , \u00a7\u00a038, 14\u00a0January 2010).",

However, at some point, notably from 2012 onwards, the Constitutional Court \u201crestricted\u201d its interpretation of the Salduz judgment, with the consequence that a number of persons who were subject to the systemic ban in Malta, and who therefore were not assisted by a lawyer when they made their statements, did not have the benefit of favourable judgments remedying their situation. This interpretation appears to have remained the practice thereafter, in so far as the only example brought by the applicant to demonstrate a further inconsistency was the case of The\u00a0Republic of Malta vs Alfred Camilleri of 12 November 2012, which was however overturned by the Constitutional Court pending proceedings before this Court.",

Such a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2010). The Court also points out that the grounds on which those differences of treatment are based are relevant in the context of Article\u00a014. Only differences in treatment based on an identifiable characteristic, or \u201cstatus\u201d, are capable of amounting to discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 (see O\u2019Donoghue and Others v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a034848/07, \u00a7 101, ECHR 2010 (extracts)).",

Thus, despite the fact that the applicant claims that he was discriminated against on the basis of age, the Court considers that this is not the sole criterion on which the domestic courts based their differentiation of the cases.",

Following that reversal it appears that all cases of the same kind were examined on the basis of the same legal principles and criteria of judicial assessment (see, mutatis mutandis, Ucar v. Turkey, (dec.), no.\u00a012960/05, 29 September 2009), namely the new interpretation given to this Court\u2019s case-law.

Moreover, the Court reiterates that the effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant (see S\u00fcrmeli v. Germany [GC], no. , \u00a7\u00a098, ECHR 2006VII) and the mere fact that an applicant\u2019s claim fails is not in itself sufficient to render the remedy ineffective (see Amann v.\u00a0Switzerland, [GC], no. , \u00a7\u00a7 88-89, ECHR 2002-II). In the present case it has not been argued that there were no prospects of success.
