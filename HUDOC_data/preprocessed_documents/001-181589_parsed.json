Therefore, his detention fell under Article 466\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 and the latter provision required that a Russian court authorised a detention pending extradition following the procedure set by Chapter 13\u00a0of the CCrP (in particular, Article 108 of the CCrP). As there were no Russian court decisions in his case, the applicant maintained that his detention was unlawful. Furthermore, even assuming that the initial placement in custody was compatible with the domestic legal provisions, it ceased to be lawful after the expiry of the two-month period provided for by Article\u00a0109\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of Chapter 13 of the CCrP.
