In addition to the evidence set out in the previous decision, the decision of 3\u00a0June 2012 relied on statements by E.\u2019s daughter that after the incident between the applicant and V. the applicant had attacked her, throwing her to the ground and kicking her about six times. He had then tried to hit her mother, E. The decision also referred to the conclusions made by the expert psychologist (see paragraph 65 above).",

The investigating authority therefore ordered an additional opinion, which was prepared by the panel of five forensic medical experts on 19\u00a0April 2012 (see paragraphs 49-53 above). According to its report, the abrasion on the chest could have been caused on 5\u00a0August 2002 by a hard blunt object with a limited surface area, as a result of hitting or being hit by it (see paragraph 50 above). The panel\u2019s opinion thus suggested that the abrasion could have just as easily been received by the applicant as a result of falling and striking himself against a hard blunt object with a limited surface area as having been punched. As to the injury to the ribs, the panel did not confirm the diagnosis of bruising, unlike Zh. It stated instead that no conclusions could be made at that time about the rib fractures, diagnosed in 2002 and 2003, because the relevant X-ray images had been lost (see paragraph 52 above).",

According to both reports, the fractured left temporal bone, mild bruising on the brain and fracture of at least one rib could have been received as alleged by the applicant, as a result of being punched by the police officers after his arrest on 5 August 2002. The expert, S., explained that this was confirmed by their nature, number and location, the mechanism and means of their infliction, the positions of the victim and attackers in relation to each other, and the direction of the blows (see paragraph 32 above).",

V. had then managed to slip out and trap the applicant underneath him. T. had then pulled him off the applicant by the legs. Similarly, in 2002 V. stated that he had trapped the applicant underneath him and that T. had pulled him off by the legs (see paragraph\u00a026 above).
