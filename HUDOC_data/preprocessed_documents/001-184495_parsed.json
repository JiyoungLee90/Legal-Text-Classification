Turkey (68514/01), the ECtHR considered (although in the context of Article 169 of the former Penal Code \u2013 concerning aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation) that where the only evidence which led to the criminal conviction of the applicants under Article 169 was forms of expression (statements by the applicants, content of the slogans they shouted during a public demonstration etc.), it should be concluded that there was an interference with the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression (para. 58 of the judgment). Subsequently, the Court examined whether this interference was justified as being necessary in a democratic society. The Court applied the same principle in the case of G\u00fcl and others v. Turkey (4870/02) and held that the criminal conviction of the applicants on the basis of Article 169 of the former Penal Code constituted an interference with their right to freedom of expression, since the only evidence used against them was the content of the slogans they shouted during a public demonstration.",

As the applicants\u2019 case demonstrates, the array of acts that potentially constitute evidence for the application of a severe criminal sanction in the form of imprisonment, under Article 220 \u00a7\u00a07 of the Criminal Code, is so vast that the wording of the provision, including its extensive interpretation by the domestic courts, does not afford a sufficient measure of protection against arbitrary interference by the public authorities (see I\u015f\u0131k\u0131r\u0131k, cited above, \u00a7 67).",

Such extensive interpretation of a legal norm cannot be justified when it has the effect of equating the mere exercise of fundamental freedoms with membership of an illegal organisation in the absence of any concrete evidence of such membership. The Court does not underestimate the difficulties to which the fight against terrorism has given rise (see Incal v.\u00a0Turkey, 9 June 1998, \u00a7 58, Reports 1998IV; D\u00f6ner and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a029994/02, \u00a7 102, 7 March 2017; and I\u015f\u0131k\u0131r\u0131k, cited above, \u00a7 68; see also paragraph 68 of the report of 10 January 2012 (CommDH(2012)2) of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, cited in paragraph 29 above).

The length of those prison sentences was subsequently reduced to two years and one month. Yet, the applicants served those prison sentences. The Court notes that when demonstrators, such as the applicants, face the charge of membership of an illegal armed organisation, they risk a sentence of between five and ten years in prison, a sanction which is strikingly severe and grossly disproportionate to their conduct. The Court finds therefore that Article 220 \u00a7 7 of the Criminal Code, as applied in the instant case, would inevitably have a particularly chilling effect on the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. Moreover, the application of the provision at issue was not only likely to deter those who were found criminally liable from exercising their rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention in the future, but also had a great deal of potential to deter other members of the public from attending demonstrations and, more generally, from participating in open political debate (see, mutatis mutandis, Huseynli and Others v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, nos.\u00a067360/11 and 2 others, \u00a7 99, 11 February 2016; S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi and Others v.

The Court considers that it must make awards taking into account the legal provision under which the applicants were convicted and the periods of their detention. The Court hence awards Mr Deniz Bak\u0131r, Mr\u00a0Alihan Alhan, Mr\u00a0Metin K\u00fcrek\u00e7i and Ms Necla \u00c7omak EUR 7,500 each in respect of nonpecuniary damage. It further awards Mr\u00a0Sel\u00e7uk Mart EUR\u00a06,000 under this head. The Court also awards Mr Mesut A\u00e7\u0131kal\u0131n, Mr\u00a0U\u011fur G\u00fcd\u00fck, Ms Latife Canan Kaplan, Mr Mehmet Ali Tosun and Mr\u00a0Serdar K\u0131r EUR\u00a04,500 each in respect of non-pecuniary damage.
