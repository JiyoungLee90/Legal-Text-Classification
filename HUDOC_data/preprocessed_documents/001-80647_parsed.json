Instead, he preferred to raise the ill-treatment issue before the trial court which determined the criminal charge against him. In this connection, the Court notes that the purpose of the criminal proceedings against the first applicant was to find him innocent or guilty of the criminal charges levelled against him rather than to attribute responsibility for alleged beatings or to afford redress for an alleged breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see Toteva v. Bulgaria (dec.), no.\u00a042027/98, 3\u00a0April 2003). The submissions of the first applicant to the trial court concerning his alleged ill-treatment were designed to demonstrate that his confession had been obtained by force and was therefore inadmissible in evidence (see Ksenzov v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no.\u00a075386/01, 27\u00a0January 2005). He did not ask that the investigation be reopened nor did he raise the issue of its alleged deficiencies before the trial court, although these matters form part of his grievances under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention. In such circumstances, the remedy employed by the first applicant cannot be regarded as a part of the normal process of exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of the complaints he made to the Court (see Slyusarev, cited above).",
