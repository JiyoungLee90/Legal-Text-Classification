The Act provides that a claimant may use a supervisory appeal and an application for a deadline in order to expedite the proceedings. In addition to these acceleratory remedies, the 2006 Act also provides for the opportunity to obtain redress by means of a compensatory remedy, namely, by bringing a claim for compensation. With regard to the compensatory remedy, the 2006 Act provides that two cumulative conditions must be satisfied in order for a party to be able to lodge a claim for compensation. Firstly, during the proceedings the applicant must have successfully availed himself of a supervisory appeal or have lodged an application for a deadline, regardless of the outcome. Secondly, the proceedings must have been terminated. Before a compensation claim can be lodged with a court, the claimant is required to attempt to settle the case with the State Attorney\u2019s Office. For a detailed presentation of the 2006 Act, see \u017duni\u010d v.  (dec.), no.\u00a024342/04, \u00a7\u00a7 17-26, 18 October 2007.",

This factor in itself leads to a result that is manifestly unreasonable, having regard to the Court\u2019s case-law.

Slovenia, (dec.), no. 42320/98, 2\u00a0October 2001, and Lukenda\u00a0v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 23032/02, \u00a7\u00a7 66-71, ECHR 2005X). However, on 1\u00a0January 2007, after the introduction of the 2006 Act, he had at his disposal remedies which were aimed at redressing breaches of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement at domestic level. The Court found in its decision in Korenjak\u00a0v. Slovenia ((dec.), no. 463/03, \u00a7\u00a7 63-71 and 78, 15 May 2007) that the remedies introduced by the 2006 Act should be used by applicants even in cases that were already on the Court\u2019s list by the date of the introduction of that act. In that case the Court, not having yet any court practice at its disposal and therefore basing its conclusions on an assessement of the provisions of the 2006 Act, found that a claim for non-pecauniary damage under that Act represented an appropriate means of redressing a violation that had already occurred (Korenjak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-62). Having regard to the way the provisions of the 2006 Act were applied in the proceedings instituted by the applicant (see paragraph 19-25 above), the court sees no reason to depart from the above finding. It notes that the local court accepted the applicant\u2019s claim, found a violation of his right to trial within a reasonable time and awarded him compensation. The mere fact that the compensation awarded to the applicant at the domestic level does not correspond to the amounts awarded by the Court in comparable cases does not render the remedy on the whole ineffective (see for example, Jakupovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 28).",
