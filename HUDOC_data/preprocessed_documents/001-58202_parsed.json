Furthermore, the outcome of the proceedings in the administrative courts \u2013 to seek an order to quash the High Commissioner\u2019s implicit refusal of Mr Le Calvez\u2019s application for payment of benefit and compensation \u2013 was directly decisive for the applicant\u2019s right to be paid sickness benefit while he was absent from work owing to illness.
