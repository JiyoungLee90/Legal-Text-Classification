On the basis of these findings the trial court had duly examined the other evidence from the case file and found the applicant guilty. Moreover, the Supreme Court had examined the applicant\u2019s complaints in detail and had found that there was not one piece of evidence to suggest there was anything unlawful in the way the statements of his co-accused had been obtained by the police.

Among other reasons, this is because pre-trial questioning is primarily a process by which the prosecution gather information in preparation for the trial in order to support their case in court, whereas the tribunal conducting the trial is called upon to determine a defendant\u2019s guilt following a fair assessment of all the evidence actually produced at the trial, based on the direct examination of evidence in court.
