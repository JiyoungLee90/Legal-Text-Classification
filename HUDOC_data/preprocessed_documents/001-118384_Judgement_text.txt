Of eleven hearings fixed for between September 2002 and August 2004, three were adjourned owing to the applicant’s failure to appear.
On 4 August 2004 the trial court held a hearing in the applicant’s absence and granted B.S.’s claims. According to the applicant, he had not been duly summoned to that hearing.
On 18 October 2004 the Moscow Regional Court upheld the judgment of 4 August 2004 on appeal. The applicant brought a supervisoryreview complaint.
On 16 March 2005 the Presidium of the Moscow Regional Court quashed the judgments of 4 August and 18 October 2004 by way of supervisory review for breach of material and procedural law, and remitted the matter for fresh consideration. The hearing was listed for 30 May 2005.

On 29 June 2006 the Town Court quashed the decision of 1 August 2005.
On 27 July 2006 the  decided to discontinue the civil proceedings. The court found that B.S. had no legal standing under domestic law to challenge the legality of B.M.’s will because his rights and interests had not been affected by the impugned will: he was not related by kinship to Ms B.M. and was not listed in her will.
On 26 October 2006 the  upheld that decision on appeal.
