The relevant provisions of French criminal law were unambiguous on that point: recidivism consisted of two inseparable components which had to be considered in conjunction with one another. It observed that in the applicant\u2019s case the two components had been governed by different statutes and that there had been no overlap between the two periods concerned, since the first period had ended on 12 July 1991, in accordance with the legal rules in force at the time, whereas the new ten-year period had not become law in France until almost three years after that date, on 1 March 1994. In the Chamber\u2019s opinion, the application of the new legislation had necessarily restored a legal situation that had ceased to have effect in 1991. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s previous conviction, which could no longer have formed a basis for recidivism from 12 July 1991 onwards, had had legal consequences, not in relation to the statutory rules which had formerly governed it but under the new rules that had come into force years later, notwithstanding the fact that if the applicant had committed a second offence the day after 12 July 1991 (the expiry of the statutory period in which recidivism was possible) or on any date between 13 July 1991 and 28\u00a0February 1994 (the day before the new Criminal Code had come into force)\u00a0\u2013 that is, during a period of almost three years \u2013 French law would have prohibited the courts from deeming him to be a recidivist.",

That judicial interpretation was justified by the fact that the circumstance of recidivism followed from the second offence and the consequent increase in the sentence related to the commission of that offence alone. Accordingly, the applicant had been fully aware of the consequences when he had committed the 1995 offence; he had known what penalty he faced, in accordance with the law applicable at that precise time. The approach taken by the Court in Co\u00ebme and Others v. Belgium (nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, ECHR 2000-VII) could therefore not be applied to the instant case. Unlike suspended sentences with probation, which were governed by rules laid down by the court at the time of the conviction, recidivism was solely governed and defined by the law, which specified the conditions in which it was applicable. In other words, there was no comparison between recidivism and suspended sentences with or without probation. The requirements for applying the rules on recidivism had been satisfied in the instant case; furthermore, they did not allow for the possibility of recidivism being unlimited in time.",

The rules on recidivism were therefore intended to contribute to reforming convicted persons; that aim, which formed one of the main trends in modern crime policies, accordingly had some bearing on the determination of issues concerning the application of successive laws.
