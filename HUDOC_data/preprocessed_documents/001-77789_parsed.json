They considered that the interference had been provided for by law, had pursued a legitimate aim in the general interest, and had not been disproportionate to that aim. In that regard the Government reiterated the arguments on which they had based their preliminary objection, indicating that the applicants had been free to request the termination of the tenancy agreements in question for non-payment of rent, under section 24 of Law no. 114/1996. They further observed that there were other grounds on which the statutory extension of tenancy agreements could have been challenged and the eviction of the tenants justified, if need be with the assistance of the public authorities, for example where a tenant rendered cohabitation in the building impossible.",

In their view, the social protection referred to by the Government was regulated in such a way that, in practice, the burden of its implementation was exclusively placed on landlords, through their obligation to keep tenants in their properties for a period of five years in return for negligible rent. They submitted that owners were particularly powerless in a situation where, as in the present case, the tenants refused to recognise the new landlords and to enter into a tenancy agreement with them.

However, the relevant provisions of the Ordinance do not stipulate what type of \u201cdispute\u201d is concerned by such an exception, in other words whether the term refers to an action brought before a domestic court by a landlord in compliance with the prescribed formalities, or to a dispute existing on the date of entry into force of the Ordinance arising from the tenant\u2019s refusal \u2013 after notice duly served in compliance with Law no. 114/1996 \u2013 to enter into a tenancy agreement with the new landlord. This second hypothesis corresponds to the position taken by the applicants before the courts. The Court cannot but note that the domestic courts themselves, when dealing with the applicants\u2019 actions for eviction, interpreted this notion of \u201cdispute\u201d differently: whilst the decisions given in the first instance and on appeal generally attributed to this notion the meaning indicated by the applicants (see paragraphs 16-17 above), the decisions given in the last instance reflect, for their part, the other interpretation (see paragraph 18 above).",
