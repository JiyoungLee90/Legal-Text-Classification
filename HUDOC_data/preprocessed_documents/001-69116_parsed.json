In fact, on 21 March 1992 the village guards and the security forces had opened fire in order to stop a march that was being carried out by members of the terrorist organisation. Furthermore, in a clash between the security forces and members of the illegal organisation on 13 April 1992 the security forces, as well as the village guards, had opened fire on the PKK members. In a report dated 13\u00a0April 1992, it was stated that 447 bullets had been fired and 215 empty cartridges had been recovered from the scene of the crime. It therefore appears that 232\u00a0empty cartridges were not found. It is highly probable that empty cartridges from the incident of 20 April 1992 were placed at the scene of the crime before or after the villagers were killed by unknown persons.\u201d",

Turkey, judgment of 27 July 1998, Reports 1998IV, \u00a7\u00a7 81-82, and O\u011fur v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021594/93, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, ECHR 1999III). The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances (for example, Kaya, cited above, p. 324, \u00a7 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible (O\u011fur, cited above, \u00a7\u00a088). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including inter alia eye witness testimony, forensic evidence, and where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (see concerning autopsies, for example, Salman v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 106, ECHR 2000VII; concerning witnesses, for example, Tanr\u0131kulu v.

Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see Av\u015far, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0594).",
