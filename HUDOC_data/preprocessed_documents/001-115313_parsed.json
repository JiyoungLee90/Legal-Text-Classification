As regards the statistical data for 2010, 47.4% of the prisoners who died in the first half of 2010 were diagnosed as suffering from viral hepatitis; some of them had developed life-threatening complications. The monitoring carried out by the National Preventive Mechanism revealed that the chief doctors of the prison establishments recognised viral hepatitis as one of the most widespread diseases. However, no accurate record is maintained concerning instances of viral hepatitis infection; nor is any other type of statistical data gathered in the prisons of . The [prison] doctors have information only concerning cases where the hepatitis diagnosis has been confirmed by lab results.

At the same time, it cannot be construed as laying down a general obligation to release detainees on health grounds. Rather, the compatibility of a detainee\u2019s state of health with his or her continued detention, even if he or she is seriously ill, is contingent on the State\u2019s ability to provide relevant treatment of the requisite quality in prison (see Goginashvili v.

Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, \u00a7\u00a0116, 29\u00a0November 2007). The authorities must also ensure that a comprehensive record is kept concerning the detainee\u2019s state of health and his treatment while in detention (see, for example, Khudobin v. Russia, no.\u00a059696/00, \u00a7\u00a083, ECHR 2006-XII (extracts)); that the diagnoses and care are prompt and accurate (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7 115, and Melnik v.\u00a0, no.\u00a072286/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0104-106, 28 March); and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at, to the extent possible, curing the detainee\u2019s diseases or preventing their aggravation, rather than addressing them on a symptomatic basis (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 109 and 114; Sarban v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 3456/05, \u00a7\u00a079, 4\u00a0October 2005; and Popov v.

At the same time the Court notes that in the assessment of the adequacy of the treatment it must be guided by the due diligence test, since the State\u2019s obligation to cure a seriously ill detainee is one of means, not of result (see Goginashvili, cited above, \u00a7 71).",

It is to be recalled in this connection that the gravity of the problem of HCV transmission in the Georgian prisons, as well as the role of the above-mentioned screening in minimising the spread of this disease, was already acknowledged by the Court in its leading case on the matter, Poghosyan v. Georgia (cited above, \u00a7 69; see also Ghavtadze, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103-105). In the instant case the applicant did not have a screening test for HCV during the first three years of his detention. Even subsequently, after the appearance of the first HCV symptoms, his request for the relevant medical examination was dismissed by the prison authorities and he was obliged to obtain a medical examination at his own expense (see paragraph 11 above). The Court finds this negligence on the part of the relevant prison authorities to be incompatible with the respondent State\u2019s general obligation to take effective measures aimed at preventing the transmission of HCV and other contagious diseases in the prison sector (see paragraphs 30-32 above).",

The Court considers this failure particularly striking in view of the fact that the applicant did not even try the treatment at that time. Most importantly, as disclosed by the case file, the applicant has at the end accepted the very same treatment plan in December 2009. The Court, therefore, finds that the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the inadequacy and incompleteness of the treatment plan offered him is unsubstantiated. Accordingly, there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the medical treatment provided to the applicant following his transfer to the prison hospital on 30 October 2008.",

However, the applicant lodged his application with the Court only on 7\u00a0December 2007, which was more than six months after the date of his conviction at first instance. It follows that the complaints under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 3 of the\u00a0Convention are inadmissible for failure to comply with the six-month rule, and that they must be rejected under Articles 35 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 4 of the\u00a0Convention.",
