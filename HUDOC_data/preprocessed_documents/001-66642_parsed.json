She submitted that the Law on the Lease of Dwellings should not have been interpreted in her case in the literal manner proposed by the District Court. She argued that the main objective of the provisions concerning eviction of tenants was to protect the property rights of owners. On the other hand, those provisions were also aimed at guaranteeing tenants an effective right to continued and peaceful enjoyment of accommodation and thus required the owners to secure alternative flats for them. In the light of that aim of the Law, the interpretation made by the court had been too restrictive. As a result, only the rights of the tenant were protected by the judgment under appeal, to the detriment of the owner's rights. The applicant pointed out that the alternative lodging which she had offered J. made it possible for her to enjoy peaceful accommodation. The purpose of the provision applied in the case was essentially to secure the position of tenant in an alternative dwelling and to prevent him or her being evicted from it. The apartment offered by the applicant guaranteed such certainty, notwithstanding the fact that she did not own that apartment, but had another right in rem to it, close in its nature to ownership. For those reasons the applicant considered that the dismissal of her eviction application, which made it impossible for her to live in her own apartment, amounted to an infringement of her property rights.",

Having regard to the clear wording of the provision at issue and to an unequivocal reference to 'ownership' of the alternative accommodation, the court found that this was not the case. The provision on which the District Court had relied conferred special rights on the owner, in that she was entitled to offer alternative accommodation to the tenant who had been fully complying with the conditions of the tenancy contract.

The purpose of these provisions of the 1994 Law on the Lease of Dwellings, which concerned conditions that alternative accommodation had to satisfy, was to make the legal situation of a relocated tenant safe. The tenant should have a right to occupy the alternative apartment, which could not be challenged either by the owner of the apartment or by third parties. These were, the applicant concurred, perfectly legitimate considerations. She emphasised that the replacement apartment which she had offered to the tenant fully satisfied these conditions. While it was true that the quasi-proprietorial co-operative right to an apartment, provided for by the Law on Co-operatives of 1982, was not identical to full ownership within the meaning of the Civil Code, this was a right which clearly could be assimilated to that right: it was also a right in rem, which could be sold and bequeathed. Moreover, as long as Ms J. paid monthly rent to the co-operative for the alternative apartment, the law provided for practically no circumstances in which this right could be extinguished. ",

Such consideration must be regarded as legitimate, in particular in situations of housing shortage. This provision should also be assessed against the background of various forms of state control over housing matters in  over a period of many years (see \u00a7\u00a7 17-20 above), which also applied to the apartment owned by the applicant and occupied by Ms J. Under these schemes, the property rights of owners were subject to serious restrictions. This administrative control over leases was in principle abolished by the 1994 Law, pursuant to which tenancies which had originated in administrative decisions given in the past under special lease schemes were to be regarded as contractual leases concluded for an indeterminate time.  The Court observes that this gradual lessening of public control over private property, while in itself compatible with the tenets of a market economy, led to a situation obtaining at the time relevant for the present case in which the property rights of owners were in conflict with certain rights acquired over many years by tenants under successive legislation on these special lease schemes. The Court recognises that difficult legal and social issues may arise in connection with balancing the rights of owners against those of tenants in the ongoing process of gradually relaxing restrictive rules concerning the lease of privately owned dwellings, which rules had remained in force from 1945 until 1994 and were later replaced by a transitional regime provided for by the 1994 Law and by the subsequent Law of 21 June 2001 (see above, \u00a7 18-22). These difficulties constitute a part of the process of transition from a socialist legal order and its property regime to one compatible with the rule of law and the market economy, the process which, by the very nature of things, is fraught with difficulties. However, these difficulties and the enormity of the tasks facing legislators having to deal with all the complex issues involved in such transition do not exempt the Member States from the obligations stemming from the Convention or its Protocols (see, mutatis mutandis, Podbielski v.

It is not in dispute that the applicant possessed this right and that it was a quasi-proprietorial right in rem, which could be sold and bequeathed. It is also not in dispute that the co-operative had agreed that Ms J. could occupy that apartment, which agreement at the material time was required for the legal occupation of a co-operative flat by a person not being the member of the co-operative. Pursuant to the declaration made by the housing co-operative, Ms J. could occupy this apartment until the end of 2004, the time-limit which coincided with the time-limit set by the 1994 Act for the validity of the system of protected tenancies as governed by the 1994 Act. It is to be emphasised that Ms J. lived in the apartment owned by the applicant under the same system of protected tenancies. Thus, if she had moved to the alternative apartment offered by the applicant, her rights would have remained valid for exactly the same period, i.e. until the end of 2004. ",

Moreover, given the unequivocal text of Article 56 \u00a7\u00a07 of the 1994 Act, the courts were not given any leeway to carry out this balancing exercise. As a result, the Court is of the view that the applicant's rights were not given sufficient attention and that, more generally, the drafters of the 1994 Law put too much emphasis on the rights of tenants, overlooking those of landlords.

Consequently, the period during which the applicant was prevented from using her apartment on the basis of the 1994 Act lasted, at most, from 6 August 1999, the date on which the Warsaw District Court dismissed her claim for eviction, until 10 July 2001, i.e. for one year and eleven months. The Court further notes that the legal basis for the interference with the applicant's right to the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions ceased to exist on that date. Pursuant to Article 11 of the 2001 Law, the owner can terminate the contract if he or she intends to live in his or her flat, and if he provides the tenant with the alternative flat. Therefore, the legislator rectified the legal situation which had given rise to the interference with the applicant's rights and created a new legal framework which allows for balancing the rights of the owner against these of the tenant more evenly.  However, the Court's task is to assess the actual circumstances of the applicant's case.",
