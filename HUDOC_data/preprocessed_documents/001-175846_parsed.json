Although the order of 12 May 2010 by the President of the Li\u00e8ge Court of First Instance had dismissed the applicant\u2019s claims, this was explained by the fact that that court did not have jurisdiction in the area of applications for release.

Secondly, the applicant could have brought an action for damages on the basis of Article 1382 of the Civil Code. The Government submitted examples from the case-law showing that the Belgian State had already been ordered, through this procedure, to pay compensation to persons detained in psychiatric units or to provide specialist treatment.",
