This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. It also extends in appropriate circumstances to a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 115, Reports 1998-VIII, cited in Kontrov\u00e1 v.

Not every claimed risk to life, therefore, can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For a positive obligation to arise, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk. Another relevant consideration is the need to ensure that the police exercise their powers to control and prevent crime in a manner which fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place restraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to justice, including the guarantees contained in Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention (see Osman, cited above, \u00a7 116).",

Furthermore, having regard to the nature of the right protected by Article 2, a right fundamental in the scheme of the Convention, it is sufficient for an applicant to show that the authorities did not do all that could be reasonably expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which they have or ought to have knowledge.

It observes that the application of the above-mentioned provisions and the cumulative failure of the domestic authorities to pursue criminal proceedings against H.O. deprived the applicant\u2019s mother of the protection of her life and safety.

The Court thus considers that, bearing in mind the seriousness of the crimes committed by H.O. in the past, the prosecuting authorities should have been able to pursue the proceedings as a matter of public interest, regardless of the victims\u2019 withdrawal of complaints (see, in this respect, Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of the Ministers, paragraphs 80-82 above).",

While the Government argued that there was no tangible evidence that the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s life was in imminent danger, the Court observes that it is not in fact apparent that the authorities assessed the threat posed by H.O. and concluded that his detention was a disproportionate step in the circumstances; rather the authorities failed to address the issues at all.

On the contrary, in response to the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s repeated requests for protection, the police and the Diyarbak\u0131r Magistrate\u2019s Court merely took statements from H.O. and released him (see paragraphs 47-52 above).

Italy [GC], no. 32967/96, \u00a7\u00a051, ECHR 2002-I). The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7\u00a7 69 and 71, ECHR 2002-II). A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in the context of an effective investigation within the meaning of Article 2 of the Convention (see Ya\u015fa v. Turkey, 2 September 1998, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a010204, Reports 1998-VI, and \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-87 and 106, ECHR 1999-IV). It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating a use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of tolerance of unlawful acts (see Av\u015far v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7 395, ECHR 2001-VII).",

The proceedings were ultimately discontinued because the applicant withdrew her complaints (see paragraphs 13 and 19 above). Again, although H.O. assaulted the applicant and her mother using a knife and caused them severe injuries, the prosecuting authorities terminated the proceedings without conducting any meaningful investigation (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). Likewise, H.O. ran his car into the applicant and her mother, this time causing injuries to the former and life-threatening injuries to the latter. He spent only twenty-five days in prison and received a fine for inflicting serious injuries on the applicant\u2019s mother (see paragraphs 23-36 above). Finally, the Court was particularly struck by the Diyarbak\u0131r Magistrate\u2019s Court\u2019s decision to impose merely a small fine, which could be paid by instalments, on H.O. as punishment for stabbing the applicant seven times (see paragraphs 37 and\u00a044 above).",

Despite the applicant\u2019s petition of 15 April 2008 requesting the prosecuting authorities to take measures for her protection, nothing was done until after the Court requested the Government to provide information about the measures that have been taken by their authorities.

The then Criminal Code also treated women as second-class citizens. A woman was viewed primarily as the property of society and of the male within the family. The most important indicator of this was that sexual offences were included in the section entitled \u201cCrimes Relating to General Morality and Family Order\u201d, whereas in fact sexual offences against women are direct attacks on a woman\u2019s personal rights and freedoms. It was because of this perception that the Criminal Code imposed lighter sentences on persons who had murdered their wives for reasons of family honour. The fact that H.O. received a sentence of fifteen years is a consequence of that classification in the Criminal Code.",

In Nachova and Others (cited above, \u00a7 157), the Court did not rule out requiring a respondent Government to disprove an arguable allegation of discrimination in certain cases, even though it considered that it would be difficult to do so in that particular case, in which the allegation was that an act of violence had been motivated by racial prejudice. It noted in that connection that in the legal systems of many countries proof of the discriminatory effect of a policy, decision or practice would dispense with the need to prove intent in respect of alleged discrimination in employment or in the provision of services.",

Like the CEDAW Committee (see the Concluding Comments on the combined fourth and fifth periodic report of Turkey CEDAW/C/TUR/45 and Corr.1, 15 February 2005, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012-21), the Court welcomes the reforms carried out by the Government, particularly the adoption of Law no. 4320 which provides for specific measures for protection against domestic violence. It thus appears that the alleged discrimination at issue was not based on the legislation per se but rather resulted from the general attitude of the local authorities, such as the manner in which the women were treated at police stations when they reported domestic violence and judicial passivity in providing effective protection to victims. The Court notes that the Turkish Government have already recognised these difficulties in practice when discussing the issue before the CEDAW Committee (ibid.).",
