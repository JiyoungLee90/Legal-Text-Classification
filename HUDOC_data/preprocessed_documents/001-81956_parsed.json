Specifically, the Court held in the Eskelinen case that it is primarily for the Contracting States, in particular the competent national legislature, and not the Court, to identify expressly those areas of public service involving the exercise of the discretionary powers intrinsic to State sovereignty where the interests of the individual must give way. If a domestic system bars access to a court, the Court will verify that the dispute is indeed such as to justify the application of the exception to the guarantees of Article 6. If it does not, then there is no issue and Article 6 \u00a7 1 will apply. It is for the respondent Government to demonstrate, first, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, second, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 61-62).",

Even if the applicant had brought a complaint against the enforcement officer and obtained a decision confirming that the decision to return the writ of execution had been unlawful in domestic terms, such an action would only have produced repetitive results, the only outcome being the issue of another writ of execution enabling the enforcement officers to proceed with the enforcement of the judgment of 20 August 2001 (see Yavorivskaya v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 34687/02, 15 May 2004, and Jasi\u016bnien\u0117 v.

The Government did not elaborate on or provide any specific examples of how, exactly, this provision could be applied in the present case and what results the applicant could expect to obtain by using it. In any event, it appears that, usually, this procedure may be used by a defendant in cases of inability to execute a judgment due to financial difficulties or other impeding circumstances.

Accordingly, the applicant is still entitled to enforcement of that judgment. The Court recalls that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 85, p. 16, \u00a7 12). Having regard to the violation found, the Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well. It therefore considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the judgment of 20\u00a0August 2001.",

In general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention (see Shofman v.\u00a0Russia, no. 74826/01, \u00a7 53, 24 November 2005, with further references). By finding a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the present case, the Court has established the Government's obligation to take appropriate measures to remedy the applicant's individual situation, i.e. ensure the compliance with the applicant's enforceable claim under the judgment of 20 August 2001 (compare with Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2005-...). Whether such measures would involve reinstating the applicant in an equivalent job at an equivalent institution or, in case of impossibility to do so, granting him reasonable compensation for non-enforcement, or a combination of these and other measures, is a decision that falls to the respondent State. The Court, however, emphasises that any measures adopted must be compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court's judgment (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 202, ECHR 2004-II, with further references).",
