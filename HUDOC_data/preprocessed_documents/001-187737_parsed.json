The expert concluded that the applicant\u2019s injuries, as recorded on 5 and 8 July 2013, had been caused within the last fourteen to fifteen days. The expert did not exclude the possibility that the applicant\u2019s injuries had been caused on 4\u00a0July 2013 and concluded that the injuries had originated from impact with a hard, blunt object or objects as a result of a blow or pressure (bruising), friction or a blow with friction (abrasions), and had not caused any \u201chealth damage\u201d to the applicant. The expert did not exclude the possibility that the applicant\u2019s injuries to his abdomen could have been caused by being kicked in that area, as was alleged by the applicant.

In reply to the investigator\u2019s question, the expert stated that the bruising on the applicant\u2019s forehead and abdomen and abrasions on his abdomen, elbow and knees could possibly have been caused as a result of a fall (\u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438) onto hard asphalt.

As to the abrasions on his limbs, head and abdomen, the investigator concluded that they had most probably been caused during the arrest as a result of the use of combat techniques on the applicant by the officers of the special rapid response unit and the applicant\u2019s position (\u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) on the ground. The investigator further indicated seven areas where force could have been used against the applicant on the forehead, chest, abdomen, arms and knees. The investigator noted that the applicant\u2019s injuries, as recorded on 5 and 8 July 2013, had been caused within the last fourteen to fifteen days. Accordingly, they could have been caused on a day other than 4\u00a0July\u00a02013.",

They submitted that the applicant had actively resisted arrest and had tried to abscond, and that in order to prevent him from absconding the police had used physical force by \u201cknocking him down, laying him face down on the asphalt and handcuffing him\u201d. They stated that he had sustained the following injuries as a result of that use of force: a haematoma on his forehead, abrasions on his right elbow and abrasions on his knee joints. The Government argued that the applicant\u2019s attempt to flee had been confirmed by witnesses to his arrest; the fact that the official records of the procedural activities carried out on 4\u00a0and 5\u00a0July 2013 made no mention of his complaints of ill-treatment, and that witnesses to those procedural activities had stated that no threats or force had been used against him by the police and had not noticed any injuries on him (the attesting witnesses and the owner of the apartment rented by him), as well as the delay in lodging an official criminal complaint against the police officers, refuted the applicant\u2019s allegations. The Government further asserted that the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment were inconsistent with his actual injuries and that he would have suffered more serious injuries. They concluded that the force used against the applicant had been made necessary by his own behaviour and had not been excessive. It had not resulted in any \u201clong-term or even light negative effects on his health\u201d. It could not be considered inhuman or degrading treatment. The delay in lodging the criminal complaint against the police officers had significantly reduced the effectiveness of any measures that the authorities had been able to take in response. For example, the forensic medical expert had been unable to establish a precise reason or time in relation to the applicant\u2019s injuries in the report of 18 September 2013. The authorities had taken all necessary procedural action in the course of the pre-investigation inquiry and had rightly refused to initiate criminal proceedings into the applicant\u2019s allegations which had not been supported by evidence. The Government referred to the case of Goryachkin v. Russia (no. 34636/09, 15\u00a0November 2016).",

The applicant pointed out that the Government\u2019s allegation of his having actively resisted arrest and attempted to flee was unfounded. Their reference to statements by eyewitnesses to his arrest was not supported by any evidence, such as records of interviews with those witnesses. The attesting witnesses\u2019 statements that they had not noticed injuries on him only supported his complaint concerning his illtreatment after the procedural activities carried out with their participation. The applicant explained that he had not complained about his ill-treatment to the attesting witnesses, the owner of the apartment rented by him, the doctors at the hospital or the court which had remanded him in custody because he had been depressed \u2013 he had been under the control of the police officers who had ill-treated him, experiencing pressure and receiving threats, and being afraid that the ill-treatment would continue. Therefore, the official records of the procedural activities carried out on 4\u00a0and 5 July 2013 had made no mention of his complaints. Furthermore, the record of his arrest had been drawn up without his lawyer being present; his family and the consulate of Belarus had not been informed of his arrest. His questioning as a suspect on 5 July 2013 had been held in the presence of a State-appointed lawyer invited by the investigator. That lawyer had acted in accordance with the investigator\u2019s instructions and not in the applicant\u2019s interests and his presence had been a pure formality. The applicant also submitted that the Government\u2019s allegation that he would have suffered more serious injuries than those he had received was totally speculative.",

Germany [GC], no.\u00a054810/00, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2006\u2011IX). Where an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 336, and Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999\u2011V). Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of individuals within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the version of events given by the victim. In the absence of such an explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government. That is justified by the fact that those in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (see Bouyid v. Belgium ([GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2015).",

Otherwise, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would, despite its fundamental importance, be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (see Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 102, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII).",

They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see, for example, Kopylov v. Russia, no. 3933/04, \u00a7 133, 29 July 2010). Thus, the mere fact that appropriate steps were not taken to reduce the risk of collusion between alleged perpetrators amounts to a significant shortcoming in the adequacy of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 330, ECHR 2007\u2011II, and Turluyeva v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a063638/09, \u00a7 107, 20 June 2013).

As a result of those amendments additional investigative measures, such as a forensic examination and receipt of samples for a comparative examination, may be carried out before a criminal case is opened. A prompt forensic medical examination of victims of alleged police illtreatment is an important element of an effective investigation (see paragraph 49 above). Furthermore, the Lyapin approach (see paragraphs 5152 above) should not be read as an obligation to open a full-fledged criminal investigation in all cases when there is a complaint of ill-treatment. The pre-investigation inquiry may serve the legitimate purpose of filtering out illfounded or even bogus complaints, saving the resources of the investigating authorities (see Goryachkin, cited above, \u00a7 68). However, if the information gathered has disclosed elements of a criminal offence, that is to say that the alleged illtreatment may have been committed, the preinvestigation inquiry no longer suffices and the authorities should initiate an investigation proper, in which the whole range of investigative measures may be carried out, including the questioning of witnesses, confrontations and identification parades (see Lyapin, cited above, \u00a7 134). The framework of the preinvestigation inquiry alone (if it is not followed by a criminal investigation) does not allow the identity of the alleged perpetrators of illtreatment to be established and is not capable of leading to their punishment, since the opening of a criminal case and a criminal investigation are prerequisites for bringing charges against them, which may then be examined by a court (ibid., \u00a7 135).",

According to the forensic medical expert, the injuries could have been caused as a result of blows from hard blunt objects on 4 July 2013. The injuries to the applicant\u2019s abdomen could have been caused by being kicked in that area one or more times (see paragraphs 19-22 above). Though the contusion of the applicant\u2019s kidney was not the subject of a forensic medical assessment, the diagnosis was made by doctors at the Aleksandrovskaya Hospital urology unit where the applicant received inpatient treatment from 5 to 9 July 2013. The Court considers that the injuries, at least partly, could arguably have resulted from the applicant\u2019s alleged illtreatment by police officers, most likely as a result of being punched and kicked.",

In total, they took five such decisions.\u00a0The refusals to open a criminal case were so poorly reasoned that the higher investigating authorities repeatedly set them aside as unlawful, unsubstantiated or based on an incomplete inquiry.
