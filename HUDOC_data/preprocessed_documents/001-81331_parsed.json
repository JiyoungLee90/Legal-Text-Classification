As to the adjournment of proceedings pending the outcome of other cases, the Court reiterates that the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement within the meaning of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 must be assessed according to the Court's own case law and not according to the internal law of the respondent State (see, mutatis mutandis, Wiesinger v.

Only delays attributable to the State may justify a finding of failure to comply with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement (see, for example, Humen v. Poland [GC], no. 26614/95, \u00a7 66, 15 October 1999). In this respect, Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of the requirements of that provision, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see the aforementioned judgments in the cases of S\u00fcrmeli, \u00a7\u00a0129, and Scordino, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0183 and 224). The State remains responsible for the efficiency of its system and the manner in which it provides for mechanisms to comply with the reasonable time requirement \u2013 whether by automatic time-limits and directions or some other method \u2013 is for it to decide. If a State allows proceedings to continue beyond the \u201creasonable time\u201d prescribed by Article 6 of the Convention without doing anything to advance them, it will be responsible for the resultant delay (see Blake v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a068890/01, \u00a7\u00a045, 26\u00a0September\u00a02006).",

In other terms, there was no period of inactivity that would be attributable to the court. On the other hand, most of the adjournments were due to the applicant's own conduct.

This lapse of time lasted two and a half years. Even if it seems in itself rather long, the Court reiterates that a legal provision providing for the dependence of one set of civil proceedings on another, when they concern the same or related facts, is not per se contrary the requirements of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention (see Kiurkchian v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a044626/98, \u00a7\u00a068, 24 March\u00a02005). When assessing the relevance and reasonableness of the adjournment of a case pending the outcome of another case, it must be taken into account what is at stake for the persons involved (see Tibbling v.\u00a0Sweden, no.\u00a059129/00, \u00a7\u00a032, 11\u00a0October\u00a02005). In the present case, the Court accepts that the postponement of the proceedings between 12\u00a0November 1997 and 30\u00a0May 2000 served to ensure legal certainty and to protect the rights of other people, such as potential heirs and creditors. In any case, it is not the Court's task to determine whether there existed a sufficient link between the two sets of proceedings and whether the proceedings at issue were thus properly stayed, because, as a general rule, it is for the domestic courts to establish the facts and to interpret and apply national law. The Court will not interfere with their rulings, unless the applicants succeed in demonstrating that they acted arbitrarily; however, this is manifestly not the case as concerns the impugned litigation. The Court thus admits that this long adjournment was an objectively necessary measure which cannot be imputed to the Government as an element weighing in favour of finding a violation of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01.",

The total duration of these three periods of inactivity amounted to three and a half months. Similarly, the hearing was adjourned for three months between 19 April and 19 July 2001, one of the defendants being absent for medical reasons. Leaving to one side the question whether these delays could really be imputable to the conduct of the , they do not appear to be disproportionate against the background of the overall length of proceedings before that court.
