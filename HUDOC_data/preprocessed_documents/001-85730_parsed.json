The Court agrees that some delays in the procedure before the Supreme Court could be explained by the fact that, during the material time the Supreme Court had to deal with an increased workload and that subsequently the authorities had taken remedial actions (see Kepa v. Poland (dec), no.\u00a043978/98, 30\u00a0September 2003).
