Some authors take the view that the rights and prohibitions listed in Article 4, paragraph 2, ICCPR and Article 15, paragraph\u00a02, ECHR correspond to the core human rights and could therefore be regarded as peremptory norms of general international law (see Stefan Oeter, \u2018Ius cogens und der Schutz der Menschenrechte\u2019, in Liber amicorum Luzius Wildhaber 2007, pp. 499 et seq. and pp. 507 et seq.); for other authors the provisions merely point in that direction (see Eva Kornicker, op. cit., pp. 58 et seq.). The latter opinion seems to correspond to that of the (former) Commission on Human Rights [recte: Human Rights Committee], which found that the list of non-derogable rights in Article 4, paragraph 2, ICCPR might admittedly be related to, but not identical with, the question whether certain human rights corresponded to peremptory norms of general international law (General Comments 29/72 of 24 July 2001 under Article 40, paragraph 4, ICCPR, ch. 11, in Manfred Nowak, U.N.

Similarly, the list of individuals and entities drawn up by the 1518 Sanctions Committee is not indicative in nature. It is not a matter of deciding whether the appellant\u2019s name should be, or is legitimately, included on that list; it is simply a question of observing that his name does appear on the list in question, which must be transposed into Swiss domestic law. In asserting that it should be possible to deal separately with the question of the confiscation of his assets, the appellant overlooks the fact that the measures imposed on member States include the immediate transfer of the frozen assets to the Development Fund for Iraq. This order does not call for any interpretation, nor does it grant any latitude in the result that it requires of member States as to the treatment of the frozen assets of persons who, like the appellant, are included in particular on the list of the 1518 Sanctions Committee.

The applicant complained of his inclusion on the lists annexed to the ordinances adopted by the Federal Council and the ensuing freezing of his financial assets. In its judgment of 27 May 2013, the Federal Court (Second Public Law Division) agreed to examine the substance of the applicant\u2019s complaint, including in the light of fundamental rights, but it dismissed the claims, not finding any arbitrariness or ultra vires acts in the area of international sanctions.",

By Resolutions 1989 (2011), 2083 (2012) and 2161 (2014), the Security Council considerably extended the duties and mandate of the Ombudsperson, who can now make recommendations concerning delisting requests. If he or she recommends delisting and the relevant sanctions committee does not decide, by consensus, to maintain the person on the list within a period of sixty days, the person\u2019s name will be deemed deleted. It should be noted that the introduction of this mechanism, together with the office of Ombudsperson, post-dates the facts of the present case, as the applicants\u2019 delisting request was rejected by the Sanctions Committee in January 2009.",

On 22 June 2006, at the conclusion of its thematic debate on the rule of law, the Security Council expressed its commitment to carrying this recommendation forward. The Council itself has acknowledged that human rights and international law should guide counter-terrorism initiatives.

Since the Council lacks enforcement mechanisms of its own, however, it is dependent on the ability of States to implement its resolutions. Even if the Council itself is not formally bound by international human rights law when acting under Chapter VII (a proposition that is heavily disputed), there is no doubt that Member States are bound by human rights obligations when implementing Council decisions. Experience has shown that the absence of an independent judicial review mechanism at the United Nations level has seriously undermined the effectiveness and the perceived legitimacy of the regime. National and regional courts and treaty bodies, recognizing that they have no jurisdiction to review Council decisions per se, have focused their attention instead on domestic measures of implementation, assessing their compatibility with fundamental norms of due process. A series of successful legal challenges has highlighted the problem by quashing implementing legislation, or declaring it unlawful, for precisely this reason.",

The Court held that restrictions on the applicant\u2019s freedom of movement, imposed by an ordinance of the Swiss Federal Council implementing resolution 1267 (1999) (as amended) had violated his right to respect for his private life, in breach of article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Of much greater practical significance, however, was the Court\u2019s finding of a violation under article 13 of the Convention (the right to an effective domestic remedy). The Court concluded that in the absence of effective judicial review at the United Nations level, there was a duty on State parties to the Convention to provide an effective remedy under national law. This implied a full review on fact and law by an entity with jurisdiction to determine whether the measures were justified and proportionate in the individual case and power to order their removal. The Nada Judgement thus echoes the approach of the European Court of Justice and the General Court in the Kadi litigation, holding that regional implementing measures taken by the European Commission were to be judged against human rights standards binding on the Community institutions. However, the principle in the Nada case has wider geographical ramifications than the Kadi litigation since it applies to all 47 member States of the Council of Europe, including three permanent members of the Security Council.",

This can obstruct the ability of national or regional courts to carry out an effective judicial review.

The European Court of Human Rights has similarly held that a requirement for quasi-judicial determinations to be ratified by an executive body with power to vary or rescind it contravenes the \u2018very notion\u2019 of an independent tribunal. This principle does not depend upon a perception that the existence of such a power might indirectly influence the manner in which such a body handles and decides cases. The \u2018very existence\u2019 of an executive power to overturn the decision of a quasi-judicial body is sufficient to deprive that body of the necessary \u2018appearance\u2019 of independence however infrequently such a power is exercised, and irrespective of whether its exercise was, or even could have been, at issue in any particular case.",

The appeal was examined by a Grand Chamber jointly with another case.

It thus held that, even though it was not for the \u201cCommunity judicature\u201d to examine the lawfulness of Security Council resolutions, it was entitled to review Community acts or acts of member States designed to give effect to such resolutions, and that this \u201cwould not entail any challenge to the primacy of that resolution in international law\u201d.",

The authors also draw attention to the prolonged imposition of those sanctions and maintain that they did not have access to an effective remedy, in violation of article 2, paragraph 3, of the Covenant. The Committee notes, in this connection, the assertion of the State party that the authors did have a remedy, since they took the State party to the Brussels Court of First Instance and obtained an order requiring it to submit a de-listing request to the Sanctions Committee. Based solely on consideration of the actions of the State party, the Committee therefore finds that the authors did have an effective remedy, within the limits of the jurisdiction of the State party, which guaranteed effective follow-up by submitting two requests for de-listing.

This is something that, under the system that the 1267 Committee currently operates, is denied to him. I would hold that article 3(1)(b) of the AQO [al-Qaeda Order], which has this effect, is ultra vires section 1 of the 1946 Act.

It thus found that the relevant Security Council resolutions did not confer on the States concerned any discretion in the implementation of the obligations arising thereunder. In the Chamber\u2019s view, the system put in place by the United Nations \u2013 even in its improved form, enabling the applicants to apply for the deletion of their names from the Security Council lists \u2013 did not afford an equivalent level of protection to that required by the Convention.

In the Government\u2019s view there had, by contrast, been no such latitude in the present case because the description of the impugned measures in the text of the resolutions was detailed and left no room for interpretation. They argued that Switzerland had acted in this matter as a sort of agent of the United Nations and had therefore had no alternative but to enforce Resolution 1483 (2003) strictly. As it was unable to annul or amend that Resolution, and had no control over the addition or deletion of names to or from the sanctions list, it was doubtful whether Switzerland really had \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in respect of the applicants within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention. Admittedly, the measures decided by the Security Council had been implemented at national level by the adoption of the Iraq Ordinance and by the addition of the applicants\u2019 names to the national sanctions list. However, the origin of the alleged interference with the applicants\u2019 property rights only really lay in the Resolution itself; the obligation to implement the measures imposed would have been exactly the same whether or not it had been transposed into domestic law.

The freezing and confiscation were therefore an immediate consequence of the addition of the applicants\u2019 names to the list drawn up pursuant to the Resolution in question, without Switzerland having the slightest leeway in that connection. The direct applicability of the resolutions in domestic law meant that the outcome of the procedure at the level of the Swiss authorities was not directly decisive of the applicants\u2019 rights; an examination by the Federal Court of the merits of the sanctions would not have had any influence on the content of the lists drawn up by the Sanctions Committee or on the legal consequences arising therefrom.

Among the resolutions adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, a number specifically provided that the obligation to respect and to implement the impugned measures prevailed over any other obligations, including those aimed at protecting human rights. However, the lack of any such specific provision in Resolution 1483 (2003) could not justify an a contrario interpretation. On the contrary, it had to be assumed that the Security Council had accepted the possibility that the implementation of certain resolutions could come into conflict with human rights protection.

The primacy of the UN Charter and the resolutions of the Security Council adopted under Chapter VII thereof over any other norms with the exception of jus cogens was one of the pillars of general international law at the present time. At the time when the Convention was drafted, the Charter had already existed for several years. Moreover, the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires in respect of the Convention showed that the Charter had been firmly in the minds of its drafters, and there could have been no intention to cut across key provisions such as Articles 25 and 103. Indeed, the Preamble to the Convention expressly invoked the aim of the Council of Europe, as recorded at Article 1 (c) of the Council\u2019s Statute, which read: \u201cParticipation in the Council of Europe shall not affect the collaboration of its members in the work of the United Nations and of other international organisations or unions to which they are parties\u201d. It was precisely the UN system which existed to preserve peace and security in the world, in particular enabling human rights to be respected and protected.

However, that solution could not be transposed to the present case. As the European Court of Justice had always held, the EU legal order was of a sui generis nature, being distinct from the international legal order and based on treaties of a constitutional nature.

They argued that this would have the effect of undermining the integrity and efficiency of the entire international system for the protection of peace and security, with potentially serious consequences.

Secondly, it noted the very precise and detailed nature of the obligations imposed on States by Resolution 1483 (2003), not leaving them any discretion (see paragraph\u00a029 above). In those circumstances, the Court is of the view that the applicants\u2019 right of access to a court, under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, was clearly restricted.

The Court refers to the terms of Article\u00a053 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which defines jus cogens as \u201ca peremptory norm of general international law ... accepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character\u201d. The Court observes that the guarantees of a fair hearing and in particular the right of access to a court for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 occupy a central position in the Convention. As the Court held in Golder, \u201c[t]he principle whereby a civil claim must be capable of being submitted to a judge ranks as one of the universally \u2018recognised\u2019 fundamental principles of law\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 35). Nevertheless, despite their importance, the Court does not consider these guarantees to be among the norms of jus cogens in the current state of international law (see paragraph\u00a057 above).

In that connection the Court must also take into account the purposes for which the United Nations was created. As well as the purpose of maintaining international peace and security, as stated in its first paragraph, Article 1 of the Charter provides in its third paragraph that the United Nations was created \u201c[t]o achieve international co-operation ... in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms ...\u201d.

The Court would point out that in Al-Jedda (cited above) it found that the resolution in question in that case, namely Security Council Resolution 1546 (2004), authorised the United Kingdom to take measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq, but that neither that Resolution nor any other subsequent UN Security Council resolution explicitly or implicitly required the United Kingdom to place an individual whom its authorities considered to constitute a risk to the security of Iraq in indefinite detention without charge (ibid., \u00a7 109). Shortly afterwards, in Nada (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0172), the Court found, by contrast, that Resolution 1390 (2002) expressly required States to prevent individuals on the UN list from entering or transiting through their territory. In the Court\u2019s view, the presumption that \u201cthe Security Council does not intend to impose any obligation on member States to breach fundamental principles of human rights\u201d (see Al-Jedda, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102) was thus rebutted in Nada, having regard to the clear and explicit wording used in the relevant Resolution, imposing as it did an obligation to take measures that might breach human rights. However, the Court also found that \u201cSwitzerland enjoyed some latitude, which was admittedly limited but nevertheless real, in implementing the relevant binding resolutions of the United Nations Security Council\u201d (see Nada, cited above, \u00a7 180). On the basis of that finding, it took the view that the respondent State could not validly confine itself to relying on the binding nature of Security Council resolutions adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, but should have persuaded the Court that it had taken \u2013 or at least had attempted to take \u2013 all possible measures to adapt the sanctions regime to the applicant\u2019s individual situation. The Court observed that this finding made it unnecessary to determine the question of the hierarchy between the obligations of the States Parties to the Convention under that instrument, on the one hand, and those arising from the UN Charter, on the other (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0196-97).",

Being drawn up by bodies whose role is limited to the individual application of political decisions taken by the Security Council, these lists nevertheless reflect choices of which the consequences for the persons concerned may be so weighty that they cannot be implemented without affording the right to appropriate review, which is all the more indispensable as such lists are usually compiled in circumstances of international crises and are based on information sources which tend not to be conducive to the safeguards required by such measures. In this connection, the Court would emphasise that the object and purpose of the Convention, a human rights treaty protecting individuals on an objective basis (see Neulinger and Shuruk, cited above, \u00a7 145), require its provisions to be interpreted and applied in a manner which makes its requirements practical and effective (see Artico, cited above, \u00a7 33).

Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, \u00a7 75, Series A no. 310, and AlSkeini and Others, cited above, \u00a7 141), the States Parties are required, in that context, to ensure a level of scrutiny of Convention compliance which, at the very least, preserves the foundations of that public order. One of the fundamental components of European public order is the principle of the rule of law, and arbitrariness constitutes the negation of that principle. Even in the context of interpreting and applying domestic law, where the Court leaves the national authorities very wide discretion, it always does so, expressly or implicitly, subject to a prohibition of arbitrariness (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7\u00a7 28-29, ECHR 1999-I, and Storck v. Germany, no. 61603/00, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2005-V).",

One such source is the Council of Europe\u2019s Parliamentary Assembly, through its Resolution 1597 (2008) (see paragraph 58 above). Such criticisms have also been expressed by a number of courts, such as the European Court of Justice, the United Kingdom Supreme Court and the Federal Court of Canada (see paragraphs 59-65 and 70-77 above). The respondent Government themselves have admitted that the system applicable in the present case, even in its improved form following Resolution 1730 (2006), enabling applicants to apply to a \u201cfocal point\u201d for the deletion of their names from the Security Council lists, does not afford satisfactory protection (see paragraph 114 above).

But I do not subscribe to a substantial part of their reasoning for that finding. Contrary to those of the majority who read into Resolution 1483 of the United Nations Security Council (\u201cthe Security Council\u201d) much more than it warranted or even permitted, the normative conflict between the respondent State\u2019s obligation to implement Resolution 1483 and its Convention obligation to observe the applicants\u2019 right of access to a court seems to me to be unavoidable. In order to resolve this normative conflict, my opinion deals, in its first part, with the origins of the conflict, analysing on the one hand the relevant United Nations legal framework, namely Article 103 of the United Nations Charter (\u201cthe Charter\u201d) and Resolution 1483, and on the other hand the right of access to a court in international humanitarian and criminal law, international human rights law and European human rights law. The second part of the opinion is dedicated to the resolution of the normative conflict between obligations under Security Council resolutions and obligations under human rights treaties, and more precisely between the obligations resulting respectively from Resolution 1483 and from Article 6 of the Convention. After discussing the two radically opposite solutions, consisting of prevalence of the former over the latter and vice versa, and the third solution of avoidance of conflict, I put forward my reservations with regard to the present judgment\u2019s solution. Finally, building on that critique, I propose a different solution to the normative conflict, based on the premise of the constitutional nature of the Convention. Taking the Convention seriously warrants the applicability of the Bosphorus comparative analytical methodology to the UN Charter obligations. The opinion concludes, on the basis of this methodology, that Article 6 of the Convention was indeed violated in the case at hand.",

Like Article 30 of the Convention on the Law of Treaties (the Vienna Convention), Article 46 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Article\u00a0131 of the 1948 Charter of the Organization of American States (the OAS Charter) and the seventh Principle of the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, the conflict rule of the Charter does not determine the ipso jure abrogation or even de facto suspension of the conflicting international treaty or agreement.

A fortiori, the rule extends to legal or contractual obligations entered into by a State with regard to an individual or private entity. In other words, Security Council resolutions may create obligations for any State, international or regional organisation, private entity or individual, which override in a specific situation previous or future rights or obligations under a treaty or of a customary, legislative or contractual nature.",

Thus, for example, Security Council resolutions which flagrantly contradict the aims and principles of the United Nations (Article\u00a024 \u00a7 2 of the Charter) do not benefit from the precedence rule.

The relations between a State and its own nationals are no longer viewed, as in the past, as a purely domestic question. The Copernican revolution that international law faced with the birth of the twin human rights Covenants and their regional counterparts created a new narrative in international law with constitutional overtones, bearing its own counterfactual strength. Remarkable developments in the treaty law of emerging international and regional organisations, and most notably the European Communities, furthered the process of constitutionalisation of international law. The 2005 World Summit Outcome Document brought this process to a point of no return, the topic having attained the status of a locus classicus in international law.",

The Charter does not yet fulfil the double function of a Constitution, as the foundational, non-derived source of law and the primary limit to the exercise of public power and the use of public force. Neither the principle of speciality of international organisations, nor the lack of a territory and a permanent population are decisive factors in this context. The reasons for the constitutional black hole within the United Nations are twofold. On the one hand, the International Court of Justice has not yet taken its Marbury step, submitting the bodies and officials of the United Nations and in particular its most important political and legislative body, the Security Council, to an effective constitutional control. On the other hand, the Human Rights Committee\u2019s recommendations under the first optional protocol to the ICCPR do not afford a non-optional, binding, judicial human rights protection system as the guarantee of an effective limitation of public power and public force would have required. The achievement of international cooperation in the promotion and encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all (Article 1 \u00a7 3 of the Charter and ICCPR, fourth preambular paragraph) does not suffice to compensate for the lack of specific human rights constraints in the Charter. Until the day a World Human Rights Court comes into existence, with compulsory jurisdiction over both the bodies and officials of the United Nations and its members, or the International Court of Justice gains compulsory jurisdiction in such matters, the United Nations will not have a constitutional nature. As things stand presently, there may be an emerging foundational, non-derived source of law at the United Nations, but there is no true global Constitution as yet, in the absence of justiciable, human rights limits on the exercise of public power and use of public force. Thus, the Charter of the United Nations has not yet acquired the nature of a Constitution for the international community and consequently there is no hierarchical relationship between Charter obligations and obligations resulting from other international treaties and agreements, most notably human rights treaties.",

The Security Council\u2019s response to the Vienna call was a differentiated one. In the majority of cases, it established a Focal Point to examine requests for delisting from the sanctions lists of the following Committees: 751 (1992) and 1907 (2009) concerning Somalia and Eritrea; 1518 (2003); 1521 (2003) concerning Liberia; 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo; 1572 (2004) concerning C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire; 1591 (2005) concerning the Sudan; 1636 (2005); 1718 (2006); 1970 (2011) concerning Libya; 1988 (2011); 2048 (2012) concerning Guinea-Bissau; 2127 (2013) concerning the Central African Republic; 2140 (2014); and 2206 (2015) concerning South Sudan.

The Focal Point was responsible for forwarding such requests to the designating government(s) and to the government(s) of citizenship and residence.

However, if one of those governments opposed the delisting request, the Focal Point would inform the Committee and provide copies of the request.

In the fight against al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with them, Resolution 1904 (2009) decided that, when considering delisting requests, the Committee should be assisted by an Office of the Ombudsperson.

Firstly, the Ombudsperson was given the power to make a recommendation, in a comprehensive report, on the delisting of those individuals, groups, undertakings or entities that had requested removal from the al-Qaeda sanctions list through the Office of the Ombudsperson. This could be either a recommendation to retain the listing or a recommendation that the Committee consider delisting. Where the Ombudsperson recommended against delisting, the person would remain on the list. Where the Ombudsperson recommended that the Committee consider delisting, the requirement for States to implement the Resolution would automatically terminate with respect to that individual, group, undertaking or entity sixty days after the Committee completed consideration of a comprehensive report of the Ombudsperson, unless the Committee decided by consensus before the end of that sixty-day period that the requirement should remain in place with respect to that individual, group, undertaking or entity. Thus, the previous positive-consensus requirement for delisting was replaced by a consensus presumption, which could be reversed by a unanimous explicit vote of the fifteen Committee members. This \u201creverse consensus\u201d was the second critical change reinforcing the Ombudsperson position: from now on the Ombudsperson\u2019s delisting recommendation prevailed in the absence of a consensus position of the Committee to the contrary or a Security Council reference and vote. In cases where there was no consensus, the Chair had, at the request of a Committee member, to submit the question of whether to delist that individual, group, undertaking, or entity to the Security Council for a decision within a period of sixty days (\u201cthe triggering mechanism\u201d). The possibility of the Committee\u2019s consensual overturn or the Security Council\u2019s overriding of the Ombudsperson\u2019s recommendation built into the process a decisive political element, aggravated by the lack of any obligation of reasoning imposed on the Security Council.

Accordingly, any missing information would not be a part of the case which was analysed by the Ombudsperson and would not be included in the comprehensive report and its recommendations. This would, in principle, bring about an important advantage for the petitioner: the case made known to the petitioner would be the same as that which formed the basis of the recommendation. Furthermore, the report would \u201clevel\u201d the information field within the Committee, since all fifteen members would have access to the same information. Yet since there was no obligation to disclose relevant information to the Ombudsperson, nothing hindered the providing State in practice from conveying to the Committee or some of its members the information undisclosed to the Ombudsperson, with the risk that the case be decided on the basis of information that was neither communicated to the petitioner nor analysed by the Ombudsperson. In other words, the al-Qaeda Committee continued to act as judge in its own cause and the exercise of the Ombudsperson\u2019s powers of investigation and disclosure of evidence was still subject to the unfettered discretion of the States. The petitioner and the public at large were deprived of access to the Ombudsperson\u2019s comprehensive report, its conclusions, incriminating and exculpating evidence, and even to the identity of the designating State.

By the effect of the transfer of sovereign powers from the member States to the Union, the latter was bound by the Charter even though it was not itself a member of the United Nations.

In its judgment of 3 September 2008, the CJEC found that its review of the validity of any Community measure in the light of fundamental rights had to be regarded as the expression, in a community based on the rule of law, of a constitutional guarantee stemming from the EC Treaty as an autonomous legal system which was not to be prejudiced by an international agreement. It explained that this review concerned the Community act adopted to give effect to the international agreement in question, and not the latter as such, emphasising the principle that all Community acts must respect fundamental rights \u2013 that respect constituting a condition of their lawfulness. In Kadi I the CJEC found that the applicants\u2019 defence rights, in particular the right to be heard, had been breached. In addition, their right to an effective legal remedy had been infringed as they had been unable to defend their rights in satisfactory conditions before the Community judicature, and there had been a breach of their right to property, in the absence of basic procedural safeguards.

The second involves an interpretation of the text of the Security Council Resolution in such a manner as to make the obligations coexist, either by finding that the impugned measure taken by the respondent State was not in reality required by the Security Council (the Al-Jedda approach), or by finding that, in the implementation of the resolution, the respondent State had some latitude \u2013 perhaps limited but nevertheless real \u2013 and that the alleged violation stemmed from the insufficient use of that room for manoeuvre by the respondent State (the Nada approach).",

But this is an instrument of interpretation of limited value, since in cases of unambiguous language imposing an obligation in breach of human rights no conclusions are drawn from the reversal of the presumption \u2013 and thus, the presumption remains unnecessary \u2013 and in cases of language imposing no obligation at all, there is no normative conflict \u2013 and thus, the presumption is simply beside the point. The Nada reasoning does not help much in this context. It is permeated by the belief that the Charter leaves to United Nations member States a free choice among the various possible models for transposition of Security Council resolutions into their domestic legal order. But the Nada refinement of a two-tier compliance obligation of members of the United Nations, regarding both the interpretation and the implementation of Security Council resolutions, is not convincing. Methodologically speaking, the distinguo between interpretation and implementation ignores a long established acquis of legal theory, namely that any act of interpretation of a norm is already a particular way of implementing it, and vice versa, any act implementing a norm implies a certain interpretation of the norm. Furthermore, by putting the emphasis on the \u201cimplementation stage\u201d, Nada tacitly nullifies the effect of the allegedly autonomous interpretation test, admitting that the Al-Jedda presumption may be rebutted even in the case of clear and explicit language imposing an obligation of result. In such a case, the fiction of \u201csome latitude\u201d risks overstretching the text by means of an artificially in-read linguistic ambiguity. The best evidence of this artificiality is reflected in the obligations of facere imposed on the respondent State, which have no foothold in reality. By creating a duty to act to alleviate the strictness of the Resolution within the confines of the Article 103 obligation, the Nada judgment is insistently looking for some sort of Swiss State discretion where the Security Council did not want it to be so. When the laudable effort of systemic integration, as warranted by Article 31 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Vienna Convention, goes beyond the limits of reasonableness, it is no longer persuasive.

In fact, there is a covert comparable assessment, which is carried out in the Article 13 part of the Nada judgment. The Court concludes that, in the absence of an effective judicial review at UN level, the respondent State had a duty to provide an effective remedy, without specifying how such a review should have been organised.

In a quite voluntaristic approach, the majority further state that the scope of such judicial scrutiny includes any \u201cdispute over a decision to add a person to the list or to refuse delisting\u201d; not only must a \u201csubstantiated and tenable allegation made by listed individuals to the effect that their listing is vitiated by arbitrariness\u201d be entertained by domestic courts, but also the giving of \u201clegal effect\u201d to \u201cthe addition of a person \u2013 whether an individual or a legal entity \u2013 to a sanctions list\u201d must be preceded by an assessment of arbitrariness.

With more than 217\u00a0treaties, the legal order of this international organisation has at its top an international treaty, the European Convention on Human Rights, that has direct, supra-constitutional effect on the domestic legal orders of the member States of the Council of Europe. Being more than just a multilateral agreement on reciprocal obligations of States Parties, the Convention creates obligations for States Parties towards all individuals and private entities within their jurisdiction. With its transformational role emphatically proclaimed in the preamble as an instrument for building a closer union of European States and developing human rights on a pan-European basis, the Convention is subordinated neither to domestic constitutional rules, nor to allegedly higher rules of international law, since it is the supreme law of the European continent. In the Council of Europe\u2019s own internal hierarchy of norms, United Nations law is equal to any other international agreement and subordinated to the primacy of the Convention as a constitutional instrument of European public order.",

The pilot-judgment and the quasi-pilot judgment procedures are typical constitutional review instruments which play a critical role in resolving the dysfunctional operation of domestic law or the legislator\u2019s failure to regulate systemic dysfunctions. If need be, the Court exercises an indirect annulment power, by means of Article 46 injunctions, in the operative part of its judgments, summoning the respondent State to review its laws and administrative regulations and practices. Although not yet used, the Court also has competence to entertain an infringement action (Article 46 \u00a7 4 of the Convention). Finally, the Court has the power to determine its own jurisdiction (Kompetenzkompetenz), which does not exclude the possibility that, in case of a political blockade of the execution procedure and the infringement action at the level of the Committee of Ministers, it may agree to play its supervisory role with regard to the nonexecution or incomplete execution of a judgment of the Court, even in the absence of such an action. It is stating the obvious today that the once primarily intergovernmental enforcement mechanism has radically changed its nature as a result of the Court\u2019s own leading role in guaranteeing the efficiency of the European human rights protection system. The Council of Europe can thus put forward a strong constitutional claim.",

This argument is invalid for two principled motives. Firstly, it sounds like a petitio principii. There is no plausible reason not to apply the human rights standards of the United Nations to its own decisions. As a matter of principle, nothing hinders the adoption of adequate substantive and procedural safeguards by the United Nations bodies, in conformity with the Charter and the ICCPR themselves, when they take binding decisions which impose sanctions on individuals and entities. The Office of the Ombudsperson is not an insignificant development, which shows that incremental changes in the system are possible. It can be further strengthened, if the political will is there. Secondly, the issues addressed by Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions, like genocide, crimes against humanity and terrorism, are not per se strictly political or excluded from any legal considerations.

Since the present State-oriented UN architecture is unprepared to protect the rights and freedoms of those subject to non-forcible Chapter VII Security Council sanctions, a new human rights accountability mechanism is definitively needed. I repeat what I have said elsewhere: as a matter of principle, all States are to be considered as the \u201cinjured State\u201d in the case of the delicta juris gentium, such as genocide, crimes against humanity and terrorism, whose perpetrators are deemed to be hostis human generis. The international community as a whole has not only the right, but also a legal obligation to react, yet to react lawfully. Since it fulfils this legal imperative, the UN\u2019s constantly extending sanctioning power, and specifically the Security Council\u2019s growing assertiveness in the field of collective law enforcement, are most welcome, but they themselves warrant increased legal foreseeability and judicial accountability. A regression to less targeted, less rules-based sanctions is no option, because they would face an even more resolute opposition and ultimately be counterproductive and ineffective. Infused with due process, the United Nations sanctions regime can only become stronger. Failure to do so in the near future will promote a heightened adverse collective reaction, which will not only further distance natural allies such as the Council of Europe and the United Nations from each other, but will certainly undermine a robust fight against the many threats that the world faces.",

However, the European Community Regulation governing the implementation of the UN sanctions formed the legal basis for the impounding of the aircraft in dispute and it thus served as a partition to shield the Security Council itself. The Court focused its attention on the guarantees available to ensure the protection of human rights under Community law. Those were the guarantees that it thus found to be \u201cequivalent\u201d to those secured by the Convention, and it took the view that there was generally a presumption of equivalence \u2013 albeit a rebuttable one \u2013 between the protection of fundamental rights by Community law and that guaranteed by the Convention system (see Bosphorus, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a015965).

In the same vein, Article 55 (c) of the Charter, which is part of the chapter on \u201c[i]nternational economic and social cooperation\u201d, provides that \u201cthe United Nations shall promote ... universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\u201d.",

In other words, the Security Council is in principle bound by the provisions of the UN Charter, including Article 1 \u00a7 3 and Article 55 concerning respect for human rights. That is what the Court stated in substance when it found that \u201cArticle 24 \u00a7 2 of the Charter require[d] the Security Council, in discharging its duties with respect to its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, to \u2018act in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations\u2019\u201d. The Court has thus drawn the legal conclusion (see Al-Jedda, cited above, \u00a7 102) that when resolutions are interpreted \u201cthere must be a presumption that the Security Council does not intend to impose any obligation on member States to breach fundamental principles of human rights\u201d and that \u201c[i]n the event of any ambiguity in the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution, the Court must therefore choose the interpretation which is most in harmony with the requirements of the Convention and which avoids any conflict of obligations\u201d.",

The presumption in question is, admittedly, rebuttable. Nevertheless, any doubt must be dispelled in favour of an interpretation of the relevant Security Council resolutions which avoids a conflict of obligations.

The Court thus assumes the logical consequence of that idea: in the absence of any clear or explicit wording excluding or limiting respect for human rights in the context of the implementation of sanctions against individuals or entities at national level, \u201cthe Court must always presume that those measures are compatible with the Convention\u201d (paragraph 140 of the present judgment).",

The relevant question here is whether this wording allowed UN member States to provide listed persons with access to judicial review \u2013 in other words, whether Resolution 1483 (2003) could be understood as creating an obligation to freeze without delay, except for the delay necessary in order to grant access to a court and to examine whether the names appear arbitrarily on the UN sanctions list. The latter interpretation is the one reached by the Court, though it conflicts with the wording of Resolution 1483 (2003) and with the manner in which it was understood by all bodies involved. In determining whether the majority\u2019s interpretation is correct, it must be noted that the Resolution does not authorise States to choose the means by which to attain their objective. Furthermore, the fact that the Federal Supreme Court granted the first applicant a period of time so he could introduce a fresh delisting request (see point 11 of that court\u2019s judgment, cited in paragraph 29 of the present judgment), and the fact that the Swiss authorities unfroze certain sums in order to allow the applicants to pay their legal fees, do not mean that the authorities had any leeway regarding the decision to freeze and confiscate the applicants\u2019 assets.

The assets concerned in the present case clearly do not belong to this latter category. In my opinion, there is no ambiguity in the text with regard to the absence of any margin of appreciation for the implementing State. This is also emphasised by the fact that neither the respondent State nor the two third-party interveners, nor any organ at UN level, had understood the text in the sense in which the Court has now interpreted it (see paragraphs\u00a0107, 119 and 124 of the present judgment).",

In order to reconcile this stance with the reality of international cooperation, the Court has held that State action taken in compliance with such international legal obligations is justified as long as the relevant organisation is considered to protect fundamental rights, both as regards the substantive guarantees offered and the mechanisms controlling their observance, in a manner which can be considered at least equivalent to the protection provided by the Convention (see, for example, M. & Co. v.

With regard to the European Patent Organisation, the Court has made a distinction, in terms of the equivalence of the fundamental-rights protection offered, between its internal staff dispute settlement procedure (see Klausecker v.

Such a limitation would entail different treatment for that particular organisation as compared to other powerful international organisations, without good reason.

Not only does the text of the UN Charter have a strong connection to human rights protection, but the United Nations has also adopted nine major human rights conventions, each institutionally secured by a human rights body, and some of these instruments have been universally ratified by the international community of States. In particular, the sister treaty to the Convention \u2013 the ICCPR \u2013 has been ratified by 168 States (among them all of the Council of Europe member States).

Therefore, it is necessary to first examine whether Switzerland acceded to the United Nations in the good faith that this organisation provided equivalent protection of fundamental rights.

These arguments were reflected in the Al-Jedda judgment (cited above, \u00a7 102), where the Court presumed that the UN Security Council had not intentionally obliged States to breach fundamental human rights principles. However, the various targeted sanctions regimes set up by the Security Council are notoriously problematic as regards the provision of adequate human rights protection (see paragraphs 52-56 of the present judgment). This and other criticisms led to the creation of a focal point for delisting requests and a delisting procedure in Security Council Resolution 1730 (2006) of 19\u00a0December 2006.

It is possible to legitimately restrict the guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 under certain circumstances; in the present case the protection under the provision that remains unrestricted consists of an arbitrariness test (see paragraphs 146-48 of the present judgment). As long as the targeted sanctions regimes do not provide adequate human rights protection, States must apply this test. Adequate human rights protection at UN level need not take the same form as in domestic criminal proceedings, but as long as there is a manifest deficiency in this regard then States must intervene in order to compensate for it. The temporal element may also have an influence: in cases where an applicant is unable to secure access to a court for a number of years, as was the case here, then the lacuna in the Security Council\u2019s protection system becomes particularly difficult to ignore.",

While I agree both with the reading of the Resolution and the standard set forth by the Court in terms of the need for judicial scrutiny at domestic level, I cannot agree that the Swiss Federal Court did not exercise such scrutiny in the circumstances of the case.

The Court takes the view that in this case there was a dispute over the enjoyment of the applicants\u2019 right to property, since the implementation of the UN sanctions at domestic level affected that right in its very essence (paragraph 100). Such delimitation of the question leaves some uncertainty as to which procedure exactly is subject to scrutiny by the Court.

Here again, it is unclear which procedure the Court has in mind. At the same time, the Court accepts that the Federal Court set out very detailed reasons in its judgments. But the Court insists that the Federal Court did not examine the merits of the case. It characterises the judgments of the Federal Court as confining itself to verifying that the applicants\u2019 names actually appeared on the lists drawn up by the Sanctions Committee and that the assets concerned belonged to them (see paragraph 29). This approach in the judgment, albeit a little circular, seems to suggest that in the Court\u2019s view the very detailed reasoning of the domestic courts in this case is not necessarily Article 6 compliant. It is the substance of the reasoning that the Court is interested in. This suggests that in the Court\u2019s view the reasoning could be arbitrary (see point 3 above) and the Court under Article 6 may look at the quality or substance of the reasoning in domestic proceedings. In view of the Court\u2019s case-law, also referred to in paragraphs 127 to 128, such a broad reading of Article 6 is not obvious and especially if confronted with the principle of subsidiarity and the fourth-instance doctrine.

It is this claim that they submitted for examination in the Swiss domestic proceedings and not the issue of whether or not they were linked to the Saddam Hussein regime or that the manner in which Switzerland had transposed the obligations arising from Resolution 1483 (2003) was contrary to human rights. At the same time, the Federal Court in fact responded to all the aspects of the case (see points 9 and 10 of the domestic judgments, paragraph 29 of the present judgment). It looked at the mandate of Sanctions Committee 1518 and concluded that it was detailed and left no room for interpretation. The list drawn up by Sanctions Committee 1518 is not indicative. In other words, there is no room for Switzerland itself to identify individuals, groups and entities in implementing measures against the former Iraqi regime\u2019s officials, unlike the implementation of other UN Security Council resolutions. Likewise Resolution 1483 (2003) requires the immediate transfer of the frozen assets to the Development Fund for Iraq. It is important to note that Resolution 1483 (2003) superseded Resolution 661 (1990), which had been adopted as part of the international measures to counter the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the first international joint action to address unlawful use of force between States after the end of the Cold War.

The Federal Court explained why the Swiss authorities could not scrutinise the validity of Security Council decisions unless they violated jus cogens norms, and it had already explained that this was not the case. However, it also pointed out that it had the freedom to choose how it transposed UN obligations into domestic law. The facts show that all that could have been done at domestic level was available to the applicants. The confiscation proceedings were suspended while the applicants sought to have the matter re-examined by the Sanctions Committee. They were resumed only upon express application. The applicants had full access to the file and could express themselves before the relevant authority. They were also entitled to lodge an administrative appeal, and they did so. The Federal Court examined all the arguments in detail and responded that Switzerland had no power to delete the applicants\u2019 names from the list drawn up by the Sanctions Committee.

If the effect of this judgment is such that it provides a precedent for all domestic courts of the world to scrutinise the obligations imposed on States by the Security Council, that would be the beginning of the end for some elements of global governance emerging within the framework of the United Nations.

This position follows up on a line of argument that was developed in Al-Jedda v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 27021/08, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2011) and then transferred to Nada v. Switzerland ([GC], no.\u00a010593/08, \u00a7 180, ECHR 2012). But while it was convincing in AlJedda and arguable in Nada it goes beyond what is acceptable in the present case. In Al-Jedda the relevant UN Resolution clearly left room for interpretation as it only required the United Kingdom to take \u201call necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq\u201d (UN Security Council Resolution 1511 passed on 16 October 2003, paragraph\u00a013).

Although the language of UN Resolution 1390 in Nada was much more explicit and required the prevention of entry into or transit through Swiss territory by listed individuals, nevertheless there was a clause which stated \u201cthis paragraph shall not apply where entry or transit is necessary for the fulfilment of a judicial process or the Committee determines on a case by case basis only that entry or transit is justified\u201d.

Under such conditions, it would be the exception rather than the rule to allow judicial control by domestic courts in the member States obliged to implement the measures, as this would transfer the last word to domestic judicial institutions. This is all the more so as fair trial and access to a court are considered to be derogable rights in emergency situations, as is also confirmed by Article 15 of the Convention.

While this is true, it has to be put into perspective in the light of the historical context and the actual wording of the Security Council Resolution. Resolution 1483 (2003) clearly explained both against whom the sanctions should be directed and the reasons why they were necessary. The personal scope of the application of the Resolution was defined by the words \u201cSaddam Hussein or other senior officials of the former Iraqi regime and their immediate family members, including entities owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by them or by persons acting on their behalf or at their direction\u201d. According to the Security Council, the first applicant had been the head of finance for the Iraqi secret services under the regime of Saddam Hussein (see paragraph 10 of the present judgment); thus there was a priori a presumption that he fell within the group indicated. As to the reason for the freezing and transfer of his funds, the Resolution takes as a precondition for the sanction that such funds or financial assets have been removed from Iraq. The first applicant\u2019s more than 200\u00a0million Swiss francs were kept in bank accounts in Switzerland and his company was incorporated under the laws of Panama. So, even if the applicant had not personally been informed of the reasons for the measures taken, he must have known or could at least have presumed why his accounts and assets were targeted. It is important to note that he never claimed not to have been the head of the Iraqi secret services, or not to have removed funds from Iraq to Switzerland, or not to have incorporated a company under the laws of Panama. This aspect clearly distinguishes the case from Nada (cited above), where the applicant had always argued that he did not have any connection with Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organisation, against which the sanctions were directed.",
