The court took note of the request of the Child Rights Protection Institution to give custody of the girls to the applicants, whom the girls recognised as their \u201cnatural family\u201d and who had cared for them since their parents\u2019 death. However, it concluded that the girls were of a young, adaptable age.

The court noted that the children should be provided with the most suitable and best conditions to meet their personal interests in the most advantageous way. Therefore the court found that the principle of not separating siblings had been justifiably overruled. It also held that the principle of placing children within the family had not been violated. The court pointed out that it was not only blood ties which mattered when choosing placements, but also the individuals to whom the child felt closest.",

The Supreme Court also noted that the evidence in the case showed the existence of a conflict between the two guardianship families. It noted that proper conditions should be created so that the girls could communicate with each other, giving the primary importance of the children\u2019s interests over those of their guardians.

[GC], no.\u00a025702/94, \u00a7\u00a0150, ECHR 2001VII).

The Court notes that, during this period, the applicants had initially been appointed as temporary custodians and later took legal steps to adopt the girls. A clear intention of continuing their life together can thus be deduced. The Court also takes into account the fact that R\u0160 refused to leave the applicants\u2019 home when the authorities attempted to execute the court decision to send her to her grandparents (see paragraph 13 above).

Consequently, the Court must first determine whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and notably the serious nature of the decisions to be taken, the applicants were sufficiently involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, in order to ensure the requisite protection of their interests. If they have not, there will have been a failure to respect their family life, because the interference could not be regarded as having been \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 (see, mutatis mutandis, W. v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 July 1987, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0121, p.\u00a029, \u00a7\u00a064).",

The Court has recognised that, provided a public hearing has been held at first instance, the absence of a second hearing on appeal may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue. Thus, leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6 (paragraph 34 below), although the appellant was not given an opportunity of being heard in person by the appeal or cassation court (see Helmers v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0212A, \u00a7\u00a036). However, the Court observes that the \u0160iauliai Regional Court essentially had to determine a factual question, namely, whether the applicants or the grandparents should be granted permanent custody of the orphaned girls (see, a contrario, Valov\u00e1, Slez\u00e1k and Slez\u00e1k v. , no.\u00a044925/98, 1 June 2004, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a061-69). Thus the proceedings were of crucial importance for the applicants and involved the assessment of their character as well as the motives and wishes of the girls. In the Court\u2019s view, this was a question of fact which could not be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file. \u00a0In such circumstances, where evaluations of this kind played such a significant role and where their outcome could be of major detriment to the applicants, it was essential to the fairness of the proceedings that the appellate court hold a hearing and afford the applicants and the girls an opportunity to be heard and fully participate in order to ensure the best interests of the orphaned children in the future.",

However this is what happened in the present case. It was R\u0160\u2019 continued resistence to the enforcement of the decisions of the Ma\u017eeikiai District Court and the \u0160iauliai  that she should be in the permanent custody of S\u0160 and V\u0160 which led to the reopening of the proceedings. Thereby, the courts were prompted to amend those decisions and to rule partly in favour of the applicants by granting them the custody of R\u0160 (see paragraphs 15-17 above). Moreover, the Supreme Court acknowledged the mistake which the lower courts had made when applying the domestic law (see paragraph 16 above). Finally, the Court notes the position\u00a0of the Supreme Court that proper conditions should be created so that the two girls could communicate with each other. This remains an obligation for the State authorities to fulfil.",
