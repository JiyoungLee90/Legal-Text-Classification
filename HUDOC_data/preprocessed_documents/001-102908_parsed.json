That discomfort was compounded by the negative psychological effects of being kept in isolation for a long time, having to interact with serious criminals, being branded by the authorities and media as a criminal, and being paraded in handcuffs and leg fetters. He disputed the lawfulness of all legal acts relating to his confinement, and stated that he did not consider himself as having the status of a prisoner. Accordingly, there was no reason for him to interact with other prisoners or take part in common activities with them. He also stated that he had not complained about the conditions of his detention because that would be pointless.

Bulgaria, no. 54659/00, \u00a7\u00a7 59 and 94, 6 March 2008), or by other persons who might possess relevant information, such as visiting relatives. Nor did he submit medical evidence showing the impact of the conditions in which he was kept on his physical or psychological well-being (compare Georgiev v.

In the specific circumstances, the Court must treat the applicant's assertions with certain caution, because he might have a tendency to exaggerate the inadequacy of the conditions in prison partly because he has a negative attitude towards an establishment in which he considers he should have never been detained (see, mutatis mutandis, Sabeva v. Bulgaria, no. 44290/07, \u00a7 41, 10 June 2010, citing B.\u00a0v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 6870/75, Commission's report of 7 October 1981, DR 32, p. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 174-75). Those assertions do not match the findings of the CPT in its 2006 and 2008 reports, which say that at the times of the visits the cells of life prisoners in Sofia Prison included integral sanitation, shower, and permanent access to hot water (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above). Even assuming that the conditions were worse at the beginning of the applicant's confinement in 1997, the Court cannot overlook the fact that they have gradually improved.",

The detention regime imposed on the applicant following his transfer to Sofia Prison was based on an order issued by the prison's governor under the relevant regulations and on the basis of information about the applicant supplied by the investigating authorities (see paragraph 14 above). After the applicant's sentence became final, his prison regime was based on a court order made under the applicable provisions (see paragraphs 12 and 21 above). There is nothing to indicate that those decisions were arbitrary. The Court notes that the CPT has criticised the statutory provisions requiring that individuals sentenced to life imprisonment be placed under a \u201cspecial regime\u201d during the first five years of their confinement (see paragraphs 21, 22 and 25 above). However, the question whether or not the applicant suffered treatment proscribed by Article 3 depends on the extent to which he was personally affected by that regime (see Van der Ven, cited above, \u00a7 53 in fine). Indeed, in cases arising from individual applications, the Court must as a rule focus its attention not on the law as such but on the manner in which it has been applied to the applicant (see, among other authorities, Sommerfeld v. Germany [GC], no. 31871/96, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2003-VIII).",

However, although his opportunities for contact are therefore limited, one could not speak of isolation in this context (see  v.  (no. 2) (dec.), no. 25498/94, ECHR 1999-V). It is true that, according to his allegations, during the early period of his deprivation of liberty he spent almost twenty-three hours per day alone in his cell. However, the Court cannot overlook that, as it appears from the CPT's reports, in recent years his situation has gradually become more flexible, with the possibility to engage in various activities and communicate with other prisoners from his group. However, it appears that he is unwilling to do so (see paragraphs 16 and 28 above and compare, mutatis mutandis, with Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, \u00a7 148). In those circumstances, and noting that the applicant has not submitted any medical documents showing the effects of the regime on his psychological well-being (contrast Van der Ven, cited above, \u00a7 56), the Court is not persuaded that it has affected him to an extent sufficient to amount to a violation of Article 3.

France, no. 17020/05, \u00a7 95, 29 October 2009). However, the CPT's reports, which fully confirm the applicant's allegations on that point, show that he is indeed being handcuffed each time when taken out of his cell, even when taking his daily walk (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above). The Court takes note of the misgivings expressed by the prison authorities about the applicant's conduct and of their assessment of the risk that he might pose (see paragraph 16 above). It is aware that those authorities need to exercise caution when dealing with individuals who have been convicted of violent offences, refuse to accept the fact of their imprisonment, and are consequently hostile towards prison staff and other inmates. However, it observes that the systematic use of handcuffs in respect of the applicant started about thirteen years ago, in December 1997, and apparently continues to this day. The authorities did not point to any specific incidents over that period in which the applicant has tried to flee or harm himself or others. For the Court, the matters to which the authorities refer do not necessarily show that there is a risk that such incidents might occur. It shares the CPT's opinion that the routine handcuffing of a prisoner in a secure environment cannot be considered justified (see paragraph 25 above).",
