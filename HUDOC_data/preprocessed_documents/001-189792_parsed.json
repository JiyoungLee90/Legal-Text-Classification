The compensation paid to the applicants had been proportional to the aim pursued. The market value of the plot of land in question had been calculated by applying income and comparative methods. The comparative method took into account several factors influencing the market value of agricultural lands, such as property rights and restrictions; appearance of the plot of land; existence of any water supplies; measurements, location and yield of the plot of land; existence of any transport access; and slope degree and rock content of the plot of land. The income method took into consideration the necessary expenses and the expected incomes produced by the growing of crops on the agricultural land at issue. The average fertility rates were used for the calculation of the market value of the plot of land in question. Data from neighbouring and comparable plots of land not subject to expropriation for State needs were used in the market value assessment.

The courts decided, despite the circumstances, that the applicants should be provided with compensation which was determined in relation to the prices of real estate situated in the area subject to expropriation and the expected incomes. They did not address the issue whether the compensation granted would cover the applicants\u2019 actual loss involved in deprivation of their means of subsistence, or was at least sufficient for them to acquire equivalent land within the area in which they lived.",
