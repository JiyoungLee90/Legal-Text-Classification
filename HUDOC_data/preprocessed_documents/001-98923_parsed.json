The prosecutor stated that the confiscation of the Mazniashvili estate, indicated by the Ajarian High Court's decision of 10\u00a0September 2004, had already been confirmed by the Supreme Court of Georgia.

Consequently, the Ajarian prosecutor's request for quashing was belated, as provided by Article 426 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the CCP. He further noted that the Mazniashvili estate had never been State property and, consequently, the Batumi City Court could not have been expected to join the prosecutor as a third party to the civil case. If the Ajarian prosecutor had acted with minimum diligence, by having consulted, for instance, the Batumi Land Registry prior to the institution of the confiscation proceedings against Mr\u00a0G. on 25 August 2004, he would have learnt that the Mazniashvili estate had already been attached, by virtue of the injunction of 30 June 2004, in the course of the civil case.

Whilst examining the latter element, the City Court had found that the notary had had a legitimate interest in the civil case.

The Government also argued that, if the Batumi City Court had rejected the notary' request for quashing, it would have unjustifiably limited her right of access to a court.

One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, among other things, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question (see Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999VII). This principle underlines that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Review by higher courts should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ryabykh, cited above, \u00a7 52). In addition, the existence of a property interest confirmed by a binding and enforceable judgment constitutes the judgment beneficiary's \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01. Quashing of such a judgment amounts to an interference with his or her right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see, among other authorities, Burdov v. Russia, no. 59498/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2002-III).",

The first of these errors, which affects, in the Court's view, the principle of a trial \u201cby an independent and impartial tribunal established by law\u201d, is the fact of a judge's unlawful or otherwise undue participation in the case (Article 422 \u00a7 1 (a) of the CCP). The second judicial error negates, as the Government noted, the principle of equality of arms, since it concerns the situation where a final decision has been delivered in the unjustified absence of one of the parties to the proceedings (Article 422 \u00a7 1 (b) of the CCP). The Court's task is thus to determine whether, on the facts of the present case, the procedure was exercised in an appropriate manner, that is to ensure that the quashing was not applied for a purpose other than those for which it had been prescribed under the relevant provisions of the CCP.",

The City Court did not even take the trouble to give reasons for that serious procedural irregularity which, as made clear by the relevant circumstances, was attributable to its own conduct (see paragraphs 23 and 25-27 above). Consequently, the applicant was placed in an unjustifiably disadvantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent in the proceedings, which directly affected his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 274; Hentrich v. France, 22 September 1994, \u00a7 56, Series A no. 296A). Furthermore, whilst the case file does not contain sufficient proof to allow the conclusion that the decision of 27 October 2005 was, as asserted by the applicant, fabricated, the Court cannot overlook the vexing fact that the Batumi City Court summoned the applicant to the relevant proceedings even after the above-mentioned date (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above).",

By analogy to its similar case-law about the quashing of final decisions and the reopening of proceedings, and noting that such a rule was also explicitly contained in Article 422 \u00a7 2 of the CCP, the Court considers that the notary's assertion should have been examined in the light of the relevant \u201cdue diligence\u201d rule. Notably, the notary should have shown that, despite having acted with due diligence, she could not have obtained knowledge of or referred to the facts allegedly constituting a limitation of her right under Article 422 \u00a7 1 (b) of the CCP earlier (see, for instance, Pravednaya v. Russia, no. 69529/01, \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 27, 18 November 2004, and Popov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 26-28 and 49-51). In this connection, the Court notes that, pursuant to the Notaries Public Act of 3\u00a0May 1996, individual notaries, united in the Chamber of Notaries, were directly supervised by the Ministry of Justice (see paragraph 41 above). However, the facts of the case clearly show that the Ministry, acting through its two subordinate agencies \u2013 the very same Chamber of Notaries and the Land Registry \u2013 was duly aware of the existence of the applicant's civil case, both whilst it was still pending before the Batumi City Court as well as shortly after the decision of 18 November 2004 became binding and the applicant obtained an enforceable title to the Mazniashvili estate (see paragraphs 10, 13 and 17-18 above). In such circumstances, the Court finds it difficult to accept that the notary discharged, in her request for the quashing of the final decision of 18 November 2004, the requisite burden of proof under Article 422 \u00a7 2 of the CCP, by showing that it would have been objectively impossible for her to obtain knowledge of the civil case earlier. It is particularly regrettable that, in its decision of 27 October 2005, the Batumi City Court omitted to examine this important issue prior to arriving at the conclusion that the request for quashing was timely and well-founded (see Eugenia and Doina Duca v. , no. 75/07, \u00a7 35-37, 3 March 2009; Popov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a050; Kumkin and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a073294/01, \u00a7 33, 5 July 2007).",

In reality, that provision was strictly tailored for the actual parties to the proceedings, to ensure, as the Government noted themselves, that their procedural right to the equality of arms and adversarial proceedings was protected. Logically, a person who was not a party to the proceedings could not subsequently claim to have been a victim of a breach of procedural rights in the course of those proceedings. Even assuming that the applicant's civil action had offended the notary's professional reputation, then, instead of such a harsh measure as the quashing of the final and enforceable decision, a more proportionate course of action would have been for the Batumi City Court to advise the notary to sue the applicant in a separate set of proceedings. The Court reiterates in this regard that the power to quash a final decision should be exercised by the authorities with extreme caution, so that a fair balance between the various interests at stake is always struck to the maximum extent possible (see, for instance, Mitrea v. Romania, no.\u00a026105/03, \u00a7 25, 29 July 2008, and, mutatis mutandis, Nikitin v. , no. 50178/99, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2004VIII).",

The Government also asked the Court that, if a violation of the applicant's rights under the Convention was found, the question of the application of Article 41 of the Convention be reserved. They explained in that regard that, after the quashing of the final decision of 8 November 2004 and the reopening of the proceedings, the applicant's case against Mr G. had been left without examination owing to the parties' continuous inability to appear before the Batumi City Court.

As to the expert opinions submitted, the Court notes that they concern the value of the whole house which measured either 207.94 or 212.7 square meters. However, what is at stake in the present case is not the entire house at 54 Mazniashvili Street in Batumi but only part of it, representing an area which, according to the material before the Court, is limited to some 68 square meters (see paragraphs 7, 11 and 15-16 above). Furthermore, whilst assuming that there might indeed have been an increase in prices on the  property market, the fact that two valuations of the same real estate within a period of only five months gave a difference in price of EUR\u00a0188,000 (see paragraph 65 above) casts legitimate doubt on the qualification and good faith of the assessing experts. Having duly examined the two opinions, the Court further notes that they do not\u00a0indicate with sufficient clarity how the valuations were determined. Consequently, the Court cannot accept these expert opinions as reliable evidence.

Consequently, having due regard to its findings in the instant case, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to restore to the applicant his title to the Mazniashvili estate, as established by the Batumi City Court decision of 18 November 2004. Alternatively, should this return of the estate prove impossible, the Court is of the view that the applicant's claim could also be satisfied by paying him reasonable compensation for the loss of the property title to the Mazniashvili estate, the amount of which should be agreed on by the parties within six months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. However, should the parties fail to reach agreement within that period, the Court reserves the right to fix the further procedure under Article 41 of the Convention, in order to determine itself the amount of such compensation (Rule 75 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Rules of Court).",
