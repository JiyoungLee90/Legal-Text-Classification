In the first set of proceedings the courts found that the prosecuting authorities had failed to investigate duly Savestin's disappearance and awarded the applicant BGN\u00a0700 in damages (see paragraphs 32-34 above). In the second set of proceedings the courts found that the Government had also failed to react adequately when the applicant had addressed them with a request to finance the publication of Savestin's age-progression portrait, and awarded the applicant BGN 10,000 (see paragraphs 39-41 above). The Court also takes note of the fact that the examination of the applicant's claims against the police and the Ministry of Internal Affairs is still pending (see paragraph 38 above), which, as the Government indicated (see paragraph 48 above), could raise an issue with non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. It also extends in appropriate circumstances to a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of other individuals (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 115, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII).",

However, bearing in mind the difficulties in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which have to be made in terms of priorities and resources, the scope of this positive obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (see Dodov v.

For the Court, the answer to that question must be in the affirmative. In particular, it does not consider it unreasonable that the initial efforts of the police were concentrated on searching Savestin's body in the canal, given that that matched one of B.'s versions of the events \u2013 that Savestin had fallen into it (see paragraphs 8-10 above). Moreover, at the same time the police apparently started verifying other versions (see paragraphs 12-13 and 15-18 above). The Court does not consider that the authorities' reaction to the information about Savestin's disappearance was inadequate or otherwise in breach of their positive duty to protect his life under Article 2 of the Convention. The tragic fact that Savestin was never found (see paragraph 24 above) does not refute this conclusion as the State's positive obligation set out in paragraphs 52-53 above cannot be construed as an obligation to yield a particular result.",

Domestic law, namely the Obligations and Contracts Act and the SMRDA (see paragraphs 42-43 above), provides for liability where the authorities have acted in breach of the law, whereas, as noted above (see paragraph 53), there will be a violation of Article 2 of the Convention only where the authorities have failed to take adequate action aimed at protecting the life of an individual at risk.
