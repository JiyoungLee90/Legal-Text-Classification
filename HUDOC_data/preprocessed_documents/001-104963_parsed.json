In order to avoid any risk of arbitrariness, substantive reasons must be given when a protracted period of solitary confinement is extended. The decision should thus make it possible to establish that the authorities have carried out a reassessment that takes into account any changes in the prisoner\u2019s circumstances, situation or behaviour. The statement of reasons will need to be increasingly detailed and compelling the more time goes by. Furthermore, such measures, which are a form of \u201cimprisonment within the prison\u201d, should be resorted to only exceptionally and after every precaution has been taken, as specified in paragraph 53.1 of the European Prison Rules adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 11 January 2006. A system of regular monitoring of the prisoner\u2019s physical and mental condition should also be set up in order to ensure its compatibility with continued solitary confinement (Ramirez\u00a0Sanchez v.
