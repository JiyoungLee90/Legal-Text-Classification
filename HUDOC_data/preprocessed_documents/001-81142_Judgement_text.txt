The case originated in an application (no. 11638/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Henryk Pawlik (“the applicant”), on 8 May 2000.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr B. Sochański, a lawyer practising in . The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged, that the Polish authorities had failed to take effective steps to enforce his right of contact with his son, which had violated his rights under Article 8 of the Convention.
On 27 March 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in .
In 1987 the applicant married I.P. In 1984 and 1988 respectively, K., his daughter, and R., his son, were born. In spring 1992 I.P. filed for a divorce.
On 11 May 1993 the  issued an interim contact order. According to its terms, the applicant was allowed to visit the children on Wednesdays and Fridays for 2 hours and to spend 2 weeks with them in summer.
On 16 September 1994 the  dissolved the applicant's marriage. The court held that the applicant's exwife was responsible for the breakdown of their marriage. It also awarded parental rights to both parents. It also limited the applicant in the exercise of his rights: it ordered that K. and R.'s permanent residence be with their mother. The applicant was allowed to codecide about the children's education, health and place of residence. The court specified access arrangements as determined in the interim contact order of 11 May 1993.
On an unknown date in October 1994 the applicant filed a motion with the Szczecin District Court for enforcement of the access arrangements. On 11 October 1994 the District Court dismissed his application. On 9 January 1996 the applicant again applied to the District Court complaining that his exwife was not respecting the access arrangements.
On 17 May 1996, upon the applicant's motion, the Bailiff of the Szczecin District Court refused to enforce the judgment of 16 September 1994. He stated that pursuant to Articles 1050 and 1051 of the Civil Procedure Code custody arrangements should be enforced by a court.
On 18 June 1996 the Szczecin District Court, referring to the children's best interest, dismissed the applicant's application for enforcement of his visiting rights. Upon the applicant's appeal, on 2 October 1996, the  quashed this decision and remitted the case to the District Court for reexamination. The Court held that the applicant was entitled to have access to his children and that the District Court should have examined the case from the perspective of enforcing his rights. In case the mother obstructed the access arrangements, the District Court should consider imposing a fine on her pursuant to Article 1050 § 1 of the Civil Procedure Code.
On 24 June 1997 the applicant asked the District Court to expedite the proceedings.
On 11 September 1997 the Szczecin District Court ordered the mother to make R. available for contact. The court attached a penal order: in case of failure to comply with that decision I.P. was to pay a fine of PLN 300 [approx. EUR 75]. The court further discontinued the enforcement proceedings as regards contacts with K.
On 6 January 1998 the applicant informed the District Court that I.P. was still failing to comply with the decision of 11 September 1997. He further asked the court to impose a fine on her. The District Court examined his motion on 19 February, 24 March and 10 June 1998. On the latter date the District Court dismissed the motion.
On 23 June 1998 the Szczecin District Court informed the applicant that he could see R. on 29 June 1998 in the Szczecin Consultation Centre (Ośrodek diagnostycznokonsultacyjny). On 29 June 1998 the visit took place.
On 12 September 1998 the court informed the applicant that he could meet his son in the Psychiatric Consultation Centre (Poradnia i pogotowie umacniania zdrowia psychicznego). It is not clear whether the visit took place.
On an unknown date in 1998, of its own motion, the Szczecin District Court instituted proceedings against the applicant's exwife for limitation of custodial rights and failure to establish access arrangements for the applicant.
On 11 January 1999 the applicant informed the court that I.P. had again failed to make R. available for the meeting. On 15 February 1999 the Szczecin District Court ordered I.P. to comply with the divorce judgment as regards the applicant's access rights on pain of a fine in the amount of 500 PLN. On 15 September 1999 and 19 June 2000 the court held hearings. On the latter date the District Court stayed the proceedings.
On 30 June 2000 the Szczecin District Court gave a decision and for the second time determined the applicant's visiting rights. The applicant could visit R. every second Saturday and Sunday. He could also spend with him the second day of the Christmas holidays, Easter Monday and two weeks of holidays either in July or August. The applicant did not appeal against this decision.
On 25 July 2000 the Szczecin District Court discontinued the enforcement proceedings against I.P. in view of the new access arrangements. The court considered that the applicant should have filed a new motion for enforcement of his visiting rights.
On 12 December 2000 the applicant sent a letter to the District Court complaining that the mother had failed to comply with the terms of the new contact order.
On 28 May 2001 the Szczecin District Court ordered the mother to make the child available for contact on pain of a fine in the amount of PLN 500 [approx. EUR 125].
On 9 June 2001 the applicant attempted to visit R. However, I.P. was absent and R was not available for the meeting. Subsequently, on 11 June 2001 the applicant informed the court that his exwife had again failed to comply with the decision of 30 June 2000.
Meanwhile, the applicant applied to be granted full custody rights in respect of R. On 4 October 2000 the Szczecin District Court dismissed his application. This decision was upheld by the  on 11 June 2001.
On 24 September 2001 the Szczecin District Court imposed a fine on I.P, for failure to comply with the court's orders concerning the applicant's visiting rights. I.P. appealed against this decision. She claimed that she had never prohibited R. from seeing his father. She had even tried to explain to R. that it was important to have contacts with his father. On 9 June 2001 R. had refused to meet the applicant and she had not wanted to interfere with his decision. In her opinion, the applicant had been “torturing” R. with his constant request for visits.
On an unknown later date the applicant's exwife filed an application to limit the applicant's contacts with R. She also appealed against the decision of 24 September 2001.
On 14 March 2002 the  gave a decision and dismissed I.P.'s appeal against the decision to impose a fine on her. The court held that since the access arrangements had been specified for the second time, I.P. had been refusing to make the child available for contacts. In addition, I.P. was the debtor in the enforcement proceedings and she was required to comply with the access arrangements. Lastly, the applicant's requests, based on a lawful court order, could not have been considered as “torturing the child”.
On 17 June 2002 the Szczecin District Court discontinued the proceedings in the applicant's case, since the applicant and his exwife had reached an agreement concerning access to the child.
On 11 April 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time alleging inactivity on the part of the Szczecin District Court. On 27 April 2005 he submitted that his complaint related to all sets of proceedings concerning enforcement of the contact orders, since 1994.
On 10 May 2005 the  asked the applicant to specify which set of enforcement proceedings he had referred to in his complaint. On 20 May 2005 the applicant submitted that all sets of proceedings concerned the enforcement of contact orders. He further claimed that, while the case numbers and the presiding judges had changed, the enforcement proceedings concerned the same contact order in respect of his child.
On 23 May 2005 the  rejected the applicant's complaint. The court found that the applicant had failed to indicate to which set of proceedings he had referred. It added that the applicant's complaint could be considered as concerning the first set of enforcement proceedings which had been terminated on 11 October 1994. Therefore, his complaint had to be rejected as lodged outside the timelimit.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings are stated in the Court's decisions in the cases of Charzyński v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 1223, ECHR 2005V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005VIII and its judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, §§ 3446, ECHR 2005V.
As regards visiting rights, according to the Supreme Court's resolution, if a parent who has been obliged by a court decision to respect the other parent's access rights refuses to comply therewith, decisions on access rights are liable to enforcement proceedings. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure on enforcement of nonpecuniary obligations are applicable to the enforcement of court decisions on parental rights or access rights (resolution of the Supreme Court of 30 January 1976, III CZP 94/75, OSNCP 1976 78).
If a court obliges a parent exercising custody rights to ensure the other parent's access to a child, Article 1050 of the 1964 Code of Civil Proceedings (Kodeks Postępowania Cywilnego) is applicable to the enforcement of this obligation. This article provides:
“1.  If the debtor is obliged to take measures which cannot be taken by any other person, the court in whose district the enforcement proceedings were instituted, on the motion of a creditor and after hearing the parties, shall fix the timelimit within which the debtor shall comply with his obligation, on pain of a fine ...
If the debtor fails to comply with this obligation, further timelimits may be fixed and further fines may be imposed by a court.”
