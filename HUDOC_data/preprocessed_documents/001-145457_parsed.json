It is sufficient that the proceedings, deliberations or investigations in question have been declared secret by law or under a decision taken by the authority, or in other words that there has been an intention to keep them from becoming public, regardless of the type of classification selected (for example, top secret or confidential). On the other hand, strict secrecy presupposes that the holder of the specific information wishes to keep it secret, that there is a legitimate interest at stake, and that the information is known or accessible only to a select group of persons (see , point 2a, p.\u00a0242, and 2c/aa, p.\u00a0244). This state of affairs was not altered by the entry into force of paragraph 3 of this Article on 1\u00a0April 1998 (RO 1998 852 856; FF 1996 IV 533). That rule concerns not secrets in the substantive sense but rather instances of futile, petty or excessive concealment (see , point 2c/bb, p. 246). In order to exclude the application of paragraph 3, the court must therefore first of all examine the reasons for classifying the information as secret. It must, however, do so with restraint, without interfering with the discretionary power wielded by the authority which declared the information secret. It is sufficient that this declaration should nonetheless appear tenable vis-\u00e0-vis the content of the proceedings, investigations or deliberations in issue. Moreover, the journalists\u2019 viewpoint on the interest in publishing the information is irrelevant (see , point 2d, p. 246). In its Stoll v.\u00a0Switzerland judgment of 10 December 2007, the European Court of Human Rights confirmed that this formal conception of secrecy was not contrary to Article 10 ECHR inasmuch as it did not prevent the Federal Court from determining whether the interference in issue was compatible with Article 10 ECHR, by assessing, in the context of its examination of Article 293, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code, the justification for classifying a given piece of information as secret, on the one hand, and weighing up the interests at stake, on the other (see Stoll v. Switzerland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0138 and 139).",

The law also specifies that the following are bound by secrecy vis-\u00e0-vis anyone who does not have access to the case file: the judges and judicial staff (save in cases where disclosure would facilitate the investigation or is justified on public-order, administrative or judicial grounds; see Article 185 CPP/VD), and also the parties, their friends and relatives, their lawyers, the latter\u2019s associates, consultants and staff, and any experts and witnesses.

Nevertheless, the interests of the accused must not be disregarded either, particularly vis-\u00e0-vis the presumption of innocence and, more broadly, the accused\u2019s personal relations and interests (see Hauser, Schweri and Hartmann, Schweizerisches Strafprozessrecht, 6th ed., 2005, \u00a7\u00a052, no.\u00a06, p. 235; G\u00e9rard Piquerez, op. cit., \u00a7 134, no. 1066, p. 678; G\u00e9rard Piquerez, Proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale suisse: manuel, 2nd ed., 2007, no. 849, pp. 559 et seq.), as well as the need to protect the opinion-forming process and the decision-making process within a State authority, as protected, precisely, by Article 293 of the Criminal Code (see , point 2c/aa, p. 245). The European Court of Human Rights has already had occasion to deem such a purpose legitimate in itself. The aim is to guarantee the authority and impartiality of the judiciary in accordance with the wording of Article 10 (2) ECHR, which also mentions the protection of the reputation or rights of others (see Weber v. Switzerland, judgment of 22 May 1990, \u00a7 45, and Dupuis and Others v.\u00a0France, judgment of 7 June 2007, \u00a7 32).",

This is the inescapable conclusion as regards the records of interviews of the accused, as it would be inadmissible to allow such documents to be discussed in the public sphere, before the conclusion of the investigation, before the trial and out of context, in a manner liable to influence the decisions taken by the investigating judge and the trial court. It is also the only possible conclusion as regards the letters sent by the accused to the investigating judge, which letters focused on practical problems and criticisms of his lawyer (see Police Court judgment, point 4, p. 7). We might point out here that it appears from the impugned publication \u2013 which the cantonal authorities did not reproduce in full in their decisions, although they did refer to it and its content is not disputed \u2013 that the aforementioned practical problems concerned requests for temporary release and for access to personal effects (letters of 11 July 2003), for a change of cell (letter of 7 August 2003) and for authorisation to use the telephone (letter of 6\u00a0August 2003). Regardless of the guarantee of the presumption of innocence and the inferences concerning the detainee\u2019s personality which might be drawn during the criminal proceedings from such correspondence, the detainee, whose liberty is considerably restricted, even in respect of everyday acts relating to his private, or indeed intimate, life, can expect the authority restricting his liberty to protect him from public exposure of the practical details of his life as a remand prisoner and as a person under examination (see Article\u00a013 of the Constitution).",

He considers that in the light of European case-law, the basic point is that publication is justified in principle unless there is a pressing social need to maintain secrecy. From the standpoint of good faith, Article 32 should apply to journalists who have nothing to do with the indiscretion committed by a third person and who receive information without committing any offence themselves other than the breach of secrecy stemming from the publication. Lastly, he contends that the mode of publication is not a relevant criterion.",

It was not a case of collective trauma on the part of the Lausanne population, which would have justified reassuring the citizens and keeping them informed of the progress of the investigation (see judgment appealed against, point 2, p.\u00a09).",

However, this circumstance alone, alongside the unusual nature of the accident, is insufficient to substantiate a major public interest in publishing the confidential information in question. Unless it can be justified per se, the public interest triggered by media coverage of events cannot constitute a public interest in the disclosure of classified information, because that would mean that it would be sufficient to prompt public interest in a certain event in order subsequently to justify the publication of confidential information to fuel that interest. Furthermore, such a public interest is manifestly lacking as regards the letters published. As we have seen above (see point 7.3 above), these letters virtually exclusively concerned criticisms levelled by the accused against his lawyer and such practical problems as requests for temporary release, for access to personal effects, to change cells and to use the telephone. This type of information provides no relevant insights into the accident or the circumstances surrounding it. It relates to the private, or indeed intimate, life of the person in custody, and it is difficult to see any interest which its publication could satisfy other than a certain kind of voyeurism. The same applies to the appellant\u2019s requests to the investigating judge in relation to his choice of defence lawyer. Nor is it clear, as regards the records of his interviews, what political question or matter of public interest would have arisen or been worth debating in the public sphere, and the cantonal authorities explicitly ruled out the existence of any collective trauma which might have justified reassuring or informing the population. This finding of fact, which the appellant has not disputed in his public-law appeal, is binding on this court (see section\u00a0277 bis of the Federal Criminal Procedure Act). That being the case, the appellant fails to demonstrate the \u2018obvious\u2019 interest to the general public of the information published, and the cantonal court cannot be criticised for having concluded that at the very most, such an interest involved satisfying an unhealthy curiosity.",

It suggested that the case had already been tried in the author\u2019s view, in the sense that the fatalities on the Lausanne Bridge had been caused not by an ordinary motorist but by a \u2018mad driver\u2019, a man \u2018oblivious to the events and all the hubbub around him\u2019; The journalist concluded by wondering whether the driver was not doing his best to \u2018make himself impossible to defend\u2019. The manner in which he quoted the excerpts from the records of interviews and reproduced the letters sent by the defendant to the judge pointed to the motives of the author of the impugned article: he confined himself to sensationalism, his modus operandi being exclusively geared to satisfying the relatively unhealthy curiosity which anyone is liable to feel about this type of case. Readers of this highly biased publication would have formed an opinion and subjectively prejudged the future action to be taken by the courts regarding this case, without the least respect for the principle of presumption of innocence (see judgment appealed against, point 2, pp. 9 et seq.). The cantonal court concluded that this factor did not indicate that the public interest in receiving information prevailed. That court cannot be criticised on that account.",

Nor did he challenge the refusal to grant him a probationary period after which the fine would be struck (former Article 49, point 4, in conjunction with former Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code) under Swiss law. From the angle of weighing up the interest in the interference, we might simply note that the fine imposed, the amount of which took into account a previous conviction dating back to 1998 (imposition of a CHF 2,000 fine, which could be struck out after a two-year probationary period, for coercion and defamation), does not exceed half the amount of the appellant\u2019s monthly income at the material time (see Police Court judgment, point 1, p. 5), and there is nothing to suggest that his freelance status at the time of the first-instance judgment led to any significant drop in his earnings. It should also be pointed out that at CHF 4,000 the amount of the fine is below the statutory maximum set out in former Article 106, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (as in force until 31\u00a0December 2006), and that this maximum amount, set by the legislature more than thirty years ago, was not revised before the entry into force of the new general section of the Criminal Code, which now sets a figure of CHF 10,000 (see Article 106, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code as in force since 1 January 2007). Furthermore, the sanction for the offence with which the appellant is charged did not prevent him from expressing his views, since it was imposed after the article had been published (see Stoll v.\u00a0Switzerland, cited above, \u00a7 156). That being the case, it is unclear, in view of the nature of the offence charged (the least serious in the classification set out in the Swiss Criminal Code), the amount of the fine and the time of its imposition, how it could be regarded as a form of censorship.",

As regards the letters sent by the accused to the investigating judge, they mainly concerned practical problems and criticism of his counsel. The problems mentioned were requests for provisional release, for access to his personal effects, for a change of cell and for authorisation to use the telephone.

The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a \u201crestriction\u201d is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.

This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was \u201cproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued\u201d and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d (see, among other authorities, Stoll, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0101; Mouvement ra\u00eblien suisse v.

The principles set out in this Recommendation include the right of the public to receive information on the activities of the judicial authorities and police services via the media, which means that journalists must be able to report freely on the functioning of the criminal justice system.",

In this connection, the Federal Court held that neither the disclosure of the records of interviews nor the disclosure of the letters sent by the accused to the investigating judge had provided any clarifications relevant to public discussion. Where the records of interviews were concerned, the Federal Court referred to the findings of the cantonal authorities, which had ruled out any collective trauma requiring the population to be reassured or kept informed. As regards the letters sent to the investigating judge, the Federal Court noted that the information which they contained provided no relevant insights into the accident or the circumstances surrounding it, so that they concerned the private, or indeed intimate, life of the person held in custody. These findings led the Federal Court to conclude that in the present case the interest of the population \u201cat the very most ... involved satisfying an unhealthy curiosity\u201d.

We would like to draw attention to the Federal Court\u2019s assessment with regard to this latter point. That court held that it was justifiable to keep the records of interviews and the letters to the investigating judge secret on the grounds that it would be inadmissible to allow such documents to be discussed in the public sphere, before the trial and out of context, in a manner liable to influence the decisions to be taken by the investigating judge and subsequently by the trial court.

Accordingly, the Court takes the view that preventing all public debate of matters relating to an ongoing criminal case by invoking the need to protect the secrecy of the investigation is unacceptable (see, mutatis mutandis, Stoll, cited above, \u00a7 128). The important thing in weighing the interests at stake against each other is the content of the information in question and the potential threat posed by its publication (ibid., mutatis mutandis, \u00a7 129).",

We, however, consider that the respondent Government cannot be expected to provide proof that the disclosure of confidential information caused actual and tangible harm to the interests protected. Such a requirement would deprive the secrecy of judicial investigations of much of its meaning.

That court considered that the headline of the article and the manner in which the excerpts from the records of interviews had been arranged and the letters sent by the defendant to the investigating judge reproduced had \u201cpointed to the [applicant\u2019s] motives: he confined himself to sensationalism, his modus operandi being exclusively geared to satisfying the relatively unhealthy curiosity which anyone is liable to feel about this type of case\u201d.

Furthermore, as noted by the Federal Court, the amount of the fine, which took into account a previous conviction in 1998, did not exceed half the amount of the applicant\u2019s monthly income at the material time.

In our opinion the domestic courts faithfully complied with and applied the criteria which the Court established in that previous case. We consider, having regard to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by those courts, that the applicant\u2019s conviction may be seen as having met a \u201cpressing social need\u201d, that the reasons for the conviction were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d to justify such interference with the exercise of his freedom of expression, and that the penalty imposed was not disproportionate to the aims pursued.",
