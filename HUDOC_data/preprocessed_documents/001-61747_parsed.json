He was also convicted of several counts of fraud. The applicant was sentenced to nine years\u2019 imprisonment. As regards the determination of the applicant\u2019s sentence, the Court of Appeal held, inter alia, that the applicant, over a period of several months, had continuously threatened Ms X by telephone and had eventually carried out his threats by organising \u2013 from his place of detention \u2013 the placing of a bomb under her car. The detonation of this bomb had caused injuries to Ms\u00a0X and Mr Y, necessitating the amputation of the lower part of the latter\u2019s leg. The court noted that it was only as a result of the administration of rapid and adequate first aid that Mr\u00a0Y had not bled to death. In addition, the explosion had caused collateral damage to another car as well as to windows of nearby houses and there had been a real danger that the explosion could also have (fatally) injured bystanders.

Furthermore, the measures also complied with the requirements of proportionality. It further held that, although the internal penitentiary regulations prescribed the immediate erasure of recorded telephone conversations, a reasonable interpretation of the applicable rules in relation to the aims pursued implied that the recorded conversations could be kept, since there were concrete indications of an ongoing escape plan. When fresh suspicion arose that the applicant was involved in another criminal offence, the information lawfully obtained on the basis of internal prison rules could be made available to the police for the purposes of the criminal investigation into that offence. The Court of Appeal referred in this connection to the general obligation contained in Article 160 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering) to report, inter alia, criminal offences involving a danger to life, and to the very serious nature of the offence at issue.",

The exercise of control over a prisoner\u2019s contacts with the outside world was essential in this regard and was an intrinsic feature of detention following conviction. Moreover, a prisoner could reasonably be expected to know on the basis of a penitentiary\u2019s internal regulations that his telephone calls might be tapped, whether in the course of a spot-check or for a particular reason. A prisoner should accordingly have a different expectation of privacy.",

In the instant case, it was strongly suspected that an escape plan involving the use of violence was being prepared and that this danger had not yet been averted.

Especially where a power of the executive is exercised in secret, the risks of arbitrariness are evident. Undoubtedly, the requirements of the Convention, notably in regard to foreseeability, cannot be exactly the same in the special context of interception of communications for the purposes of police investigations or judicial investigations, as they are where the object of the relevant law is to place restrictions on the conduct of individuals. In particular, the requirement of foreseeability cannot mean that an individual should be enabled to foresee when the authorities are likely to intercept his communications so that he can adapt his conduct accordingly. Nevertheless, the law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to this secret and potentially dangerous interference with the right to respect for private life and correspondence. In its judgment of 25 March 1983 in the case of Silver and Others, the Court held that \u2018a law which confers a discretion must indicate the scope of that discretion\u2019, although the detailed procedures and conditions to be observed do not necessarily have to be incorporated in rules of substantive law (Series A no. 61, pp. 33-34, \u00a7\u00a7 88-89). The degree of precision required of the \u2018law\u2019 in this connection will depend upon the particular subject-matter. Since the implementation in practice of measures of secret surveillance of communications is not open to scrutiny by the individuals concerned or the public at large, it would be contrary to the rule of law for the legal discretion granted to the executive or to a judge to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference.\"",
