There they met Members of Parliament, who told them that Mr M. D. was being considered for the abovementioned position.

Mr N. replied that as far as he knew that was so, and referred the applicant to the Full list of credit millionaires, published by the Trud publishing house in 1998. It was stated in the preface of that publication that two companies linked with Mr\u00a0M. D. \u2013 FBK Maxcom and Maxcom OOD \u2013 were on that list. The applicant checked in an electronic law database and found that Mr M.

She accordingly left it to the discretion of the court to subpoena him, but refused to name him. Her counsel said that even though the MPs who had spoken to the applicant had been named in Ms N.\u2019s testimony, that did not allow the unequivocal identification of this witness and hence precluded a request to summon him.

D.] off the record, citing no sources, that is, it was unclear whether he had obtained it through his participation in a parliamentary committee or also through unofficial channels. He should have therefore, according to best journalistic practice, been considered an unreliable source. This fact obliged [the applicant] to duly check the information she had received through other, public and reliable, sources and not trust completely what she had heard in Parliament. The information received from [Mr N.] did not in fact constitute another dependable source of information. The latter relied on the publication of the Trud publishing house The Full List of Credit Millionaires, in whose preface [Mr\u00a0M.\u00a0D.] had been identified as a debtor through three of his companies \u2013 FBK Maxcom, Maxcom Holding and Maxcom OOD. [The applicant] was therefore under the obligation to check whether [Mr M. D.] indeed owned shares in these companies, because the mere linking of his name to the companies in a publication was not enough to perceive the information as authentic. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the publication in issue gave the names of the companies, not of their shareholders, for which reason the statement in its preface was not confirmed by its contents. However, [the applicant] did not take the requisite steps to verify the facts alleged by [Mr N.] and the publication\u2019s preface. She merely established, after a check in the APIS information system, that [Mr M. D.] was a shareholder in the company Vitaplant [OOD], which also featured on the list of persons with outstanding credits. The company Vitaplant [OOD] was not, however, among the companies connected to [Mr M. D.]\u2019s name in the publication\u2019s preface, and that should have prompted [the applicant] to doublecheck her assumptions. However, [the applicant] assumed that the link uncovered by her was sufficient to corroborate the statement that [Mr M. D.] was a credit millionaire. She thus failed to comply with her duty of thoroughly verifying the information through reliable, independent sources. [The applicant] did not check whether the statement in the [publication\u2019s] preface that [Mr M. D.] was connected to three debtor companies corresponded to the truth, which was mandatory. The fact that she works at a daily newspaper does not absolve her of the obligation to carry out thorough journalistic enquiries. She had access to information in the register of companies, which is public, in order to check the veracity of the information she had gathered. Not only did [the applicant] not do that, but in her article she relied on a document with which she had not been duly acquainted \u2013 the official list of borrowers compiled by the [Bulgarian National Bank]. The statement in her article that the three companies \u2013 Maxcom Holding, Maxcom OOD and FBK Maxcom \u2013 were companies of [Mr M. D.] was not supported by due journalistic enquiry. Her source, [Mr N.], relied on the publication of Trud, which in fact means that [the applicant]\u2019s information was solely based on the preface of the list, which was not enough, considering that this information had not been verified either.",

The fact that [the applicant] did not take the necessary steps in this direction confirms the court\u2019s conclusion that her act was wilful. There must be a balance between the reader\u2019s right to information and the rights of the persons affected by journalistic materials. The one responsible for this balance is the author, who must abide by the rules of investigative journalism. It is beyond doubt that the time and means available to a journalist on a daily newspaper for a proper enquiry concerning a current issue are greatly limited, but [the applicant] was bound to do what was possible to verify the information she had gathered. In the case at hand [the applicant] had enough time to consult the register of companies, so as to report on the rumours heard in the lobby of the Parliament building and at the same time to present the actual facts. It is precisely [the applicant]\u2019s passivity in respect of this second element which makes her act criminal. The lack of a full enquiry into the facts, performed with due journalistic care, and the applicant\u2019s own statement that she did not carry out a full enquiry into Mr M. D.\u2019s involvement in the companies mentioned in the article, allow [the court to conclude] that she was not confident that her allegations were true. On the contrary, the fact that [the applicant] is an experienced journalist, maintains contacts with colleagues of hers from other media, with whom she exchanges information concerning such news, allows [the court to conclude] that she knew that information about outstanding credits of [Mr M. D.] had been published before. She was therefore aware that the two newspapers which had published similar articles had also published refutations, and had apologised to [Mr M. D.] for the untruthfulness of their allegations. [The applicant] did not do all she was professionally bound to do in respect of the specific enquiry, which points to intent. She allowed herself to rely on sources which she had not checked, but which made her article look persuasive and objective.",

It has entered the journalistic vernacular and is used in everyday speech to describe individuals who have acquired large amounts of money as a result of the use, by them personally or by physical or legal persons connected with them, of unsecured bank credits, which have remained unpaid and have been listed by the [Bulgarian National Bank] as unrecoverable. The expression is pejorative, because it implies that the people in question are supposedly responsible for the crisis in the banking system and the socalled \u2018draining\u2019 of the banks \u2013 generally persons who have become rich in a criminal way. A list of \u2018credit millionaires\u2019 as an official document emanating from the [Bulgarian National Bank] has never existed. There exists a list of the persons with outstanding credits as of 1997, which has been compiled pursuant to the Information on NonPerforming Credits Act [of 1997]. This Act requires the [reportable] credits to exceed 5,000 German marks \u2013 it does not concern only credits with seven or more figures. According to [the Act], the list is published in a special bulletin, which is not covered by bank secrecy and is sent to the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the tax and customs authorities and the National Assembly. After its receipt at the National Assembly on 21 January 1998 the list was made available to journalists and was published in full or in part as a list of the \u201ccredit millionaires\u201d. In fact, the vilifying circumstance is not to own specific companies, but to be a \u2018credit millionaire\u2019. In the view of the [court], however, such a dissection of the statement in [the applicant]\u2019s publication and the application of paragraph 2 of Article 147 of the [Criminal Code of 1968] to one of the resulting parts cannot be made, for the following reasons. Readers are not bound to accept journalistic statements uncritically. An abundance of specifically alleged facts in support of those statements is key to persuading readers that they are truthful. Such facts in the case at hand are the citing of an official document featuring [Mr M. D.]\u2019s name (untrue) and the citing of specific companies owned by [Mr M. D.] with specific debts (also untrue). There is no doubt that without these untrue allegations the statement that [Mr M. D.] is a credit millionaire would have been uncorroborated and unconvincing and its refutation would have presented no problem for him. It would be wrong to divide an averment containing a vilifying circumstance into two parts for a second reason: the damage to the reputation and the public esteem of a defamed person is not a constant value. The degree of that damage may vary significantly. In the instant case, where there is a statement that an individual is a \u2018credit millionaire\u2019 because of his involvement in companies which have received credits, the [court] considers that the greater the amount of the outstanding credits, the more numerous the companies having received them, the more direct the connection of the individual with these debtor companies, and, last but not least, the noisier the public scandal, the more vilifying is the statement. [Mr M. D.] would suffer a lesser degree of defamation if the amount of the outstanding credits was one and not twenty million levs, if the article had cited one unknown company instead of three companies which had become notorious because of their link with criminal investigations, and if [Mr M. D.] had not been indicated as [their] sole owner instead of merely a shareholder [in them].",

The link may likewise exist through participation in the management [of these companies]. At the time when the credit was received [Mr M. D.] did not participate directly in Vitaplant [OOD]. He was neither a manager of that company, nor a substantial shareholder. The credit itself was not in an amount which would make him a \u2018millionaire\u2019.",

The firstinstance court had not discussed her evidence showing that Mr M. D. did indeed feature on the list of \u201ccredit millionaires\u201d through his participation in Vitaplant OOD. The appellate court had accepted that this was so, but had nevertheless held that Mr M. D. had been defamed. The appellate court\u2019s ruling that despite the existence of two independent sources the applicant was under a duty to verify her information in the register of companies had rendered the trial unfair, because no rule existed requiring journalists to consult this register. The appellate court had furthermore not discussed the argument that criminal liability was personal, whereas journalists worked and checked information in teams. The firstinstance court had also erred in not calling two Members of Parliament to testify about the information they had given to the applicant in the National Assembly.

Seeing that the applicant did not name this Member of Parliament, the national court can hardly be criticised for not calling him to the witness stand.

It cannot therefore be said that the applicant was reporting what others had said and had simply omitted to distance herself from it (see, mutatis mutandis, Radio France and Others, cited above, \u00a7 38; Thoma v. , no. 38432/97, \u00a7\u00a7 63 and 64, ECHR 2001III; and Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, \u00a7 77). Having adopted the offending allegations as her own, she was liable for their truthfulness.",

In view of the nature of that averment, that task was not unreasonable or impossible (see, by contrast, Thorgeir Thorgeirson, cited above, p. 28, \u00a7 65 in fine). However, she was only able to prove that Mr M. D. featured on the Bulgarian National Bank\u2019s list through the company Vitaplant OOD, not through the companies Maxcom Holding, FBK Maxcom and Maxcom OOD, cited in the article (see paragraphs 14, 25, 29 and 30 above). The Sofia City Court held that this did not render her statement nondefamatory, because it was one thing to allege that an individual was a \u201ccredit millionaire\u201d because of his indirect involvement in one company and quite another to say that he fully owned three companies which appeared on the bad debtors\u2019 list. The Court sees no reason to question that finding.",

The Court\u2019s caselaw is clear on the point that the more serious the allegation is, the more solid the factual basis should be (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, \u00a7 78 in fine). The applicant\u2019s allegation appears quite serious (see, mutatis mutandis, Thoma, cited above, \u00a7 57) and therefore required substantial justification, especially seeing that it was made in a popular and highcirculation national daily newspaper (see paragraphs 5 and 18 above). The Court notes on this point that the domestic courts unequivocally found that the applicant had not sufficiently verified her information prior to its publication. These courts established that in her desire to get the news out quickly she had failed to consult trustworthy sources, preferring to rely on sources which could not, according to best journalistic practice, be deemed dependable (see paragraphs 26 and 30 above). The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion.",

Whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their sources as reliable with respect to the allegations (see, among other authorities, McVicar, \u00a7 84; and Pedersen and Baadsgaard, \u00a7 78, both cited above). The Court notes on this point that the preface of Trud\u2019s publication clearly did not amount to an official report. The applicant was accordingly not entitled to rely on it unconditionally, (see, by contrast, Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, \u00a7\u00a7 66, 68, 71 and 72; and Colombani and Others, \u00a7 65, both cited above). Nor could she unreservedly rely on the informal statements made by two Members of Parliament in the National Assembly lobby. That conclusion does not change even if the situation is examined as it presented itself to the applicant at the material time rather than with the benefit of hindsight (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 66 in fine and 72). The domestic courts, which specifically dealt with this point, found that, even if the \u201ctime and means available to a journalist in a daily newspaper for a proper enquiry concerning a current issue [we]re greatly limited\u201d, the applicant had still not adequately verified the facts from reliable sources and had thus failed to comply with the customary rules of investigative journalism, publishing facts which she knew or ought to have known were dubious (see paragraphs 26 and 30 above). The Court sees no reason to hold otherwise. Nor does it consider that the applicant was dispensed on other grounds from properly verifying her information.",

It is also true that two days later the newspaper published Mr\u00a0M.\u00a0D.\u2019s response (see paragraph 19 above). However, this response, while indicative of the newspaper\u2019s willingness to rectify the situation, did not fully wipe out the damage inflicted on Mr M. D.\u2019s reputation. In any event, these developments, which took place only after the newspaper and the applicant had been made aware of the defamatory nature of the allegations, do not show that the applicant was concerned with verifying their truth or reliability to a high standard before writing her article (see McVicar, cited above, \u00a7 86).",

A perusal of the judgments by the Sofia District Court and the Sofia City Court (see paragraphs 26 and 30 above) reveals that they fully recognised that the present case involved a conflict between the right to impart information and protection of the reputation or rights of others, a conflict they resolved by weighing the relevant considerations.",

In this connection, the Court observes that it is unable to follow the applicant\u2019s argument that the very use of criminallaw sanctions in defamation cases is in violation of Article 10. In view of the margin of appreciation left to Contracting States by that provision, a criminal measure as a response to defamation cannot, as such, be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued (see Radio France and Others, cited above, \u00a7 40; and Lindon, OtchakovskyLaurens and July v.\u00a0France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2007...). Nor is it contrary to the Convention to require the defendant to prove, to a reasonable standard, that her allegations were substantially true (see paragraph 39 above). It should also be observed that the proceedings were instituted on the initiative of Mr M. D., not by a State authority (see, by contrast, Raichinov v. , no. 47579/99, \u00a7 50 in fine, 20 April 2006), and that, though they started as criminal, they ended with a mere administrative punishment (see paragraphs 26 and 34 above).",

It considers that the sanction imposed on the applicant \u2013 an administrative fine of BGN 500, plus an order to pay Mr M. D. compensation amounting to BGN 2,000 and to reimburse his costs (BGN 550) \u2013 does not, in the specific circumstances of the case, appear excessive. The Court attaches particular weight to the fact that, as already noted, after convicting the applicant, the Sofia District Court waived her criminal liability and imposed an administrative punishment, opted for the minimum fine possible, taking into account the applicant\u2019s earnings and certain other mitigating circumstances, and refrained from ordering the applicant\u2019s occupational disqualification (see paragraphs 26 and 34 above and compare and contrast Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37, 112, 113 in fine and 118). It also awarded only one fifth of the damages sought by Mr M. D. and gave cogent reasons for its ruling on this point (see paragraphs 22 and 26 above), in line with this Court\u2019s caselaw that an award of damages for defamation must bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered (see Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 13\u00a0July 1995, Series A no. 316B, pp. 7576, \u00a7 49; and Steel and Morris, cited above, \u00a7 96). The fact that the court ordered the applicant to pay Mr\u00a0M.\u00a0D.\u2019s costs, which were not unreasonably high, was not disproportionate either (see McVicar, cited above, \u00a7 81).",
