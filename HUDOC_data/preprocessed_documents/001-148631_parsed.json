The Court observes that it took the domestic authorities more than six years and five months after the incident to reach these conclusions. However, the overall length of the criminal investigations and further proceedings before the courts does not appear to be justified. After the substantial period of investigation and trial, the District Court decided to remit the case for additional investigation considering that the charges against the defendants had to be aggravated (see paragraph 18 above). During the new trial a number of delays between 2009 and 2011 took place because of the authorities\u2019 failure to ensure the presence of the participants of the trial. Many times the hearings were rescheduled causing numerous delays affecting the overall length of the proceedings. In 2011 the trial was also suspended as the District Court considered it necessary to carry out additional investigative measures. Eventually, the delays in the investigations and the trial resulted in some of charges against two defendants being dropped as time-barred (see paragraphs 34 and 35 above).",
