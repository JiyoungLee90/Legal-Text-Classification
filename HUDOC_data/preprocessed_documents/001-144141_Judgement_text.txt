The case originated in an application (no. 1413/05) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Damir Darifovich Sibgatullin (“the applicant”), on 6 December 2004.
In a judgment delivered on 24 April 2012, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 38 of the Convention on account of the Government’s failure to provide the Court with copies of witness statements requested by it at the communication stage. The Court also found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention on account of the absence of a proper and adequate opportunity for the applicant to challenge the statements by the prosecution witnesses. The applicant was awarded 4,000 euros (EUR) for non-pecuniary damage. His remaining claims for just satisfaction were dismissed.
On 23 July 2012 the Government informed the Court that they had sent the witness statements to the Court on 27 November 2007. The Government therefore disputed the Court’s finding of a violation of Article 38 of the Convention.
On 16 October 2012, having decided to treat the Government’s letter of 23 July 2012 as a matter for revision of the judgment within the meaning of Rule 80 of the Rules of Court, the Court considered the request for revision and decided to ask the applicant’s representatives to submit any written observations. Those observations were received on 7 January 2013.
