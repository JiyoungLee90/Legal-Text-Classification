Witness \u00c7. stated that he had not received any threats, nor had any promises been made to him in exchange for his appearance at the trial. He had first made very limited statements to the prosecutor in connection with the assassination out of fear that the persons implicated in the events were police officers with previous criminal records. In his testimony, \u00c7. stated that it was getting dark and he was on the veranda of a bar located on the side of the DP headquarters. He saw the MP who was having a heated argument with Is.H (Is.H has lodged a separate application, no. 29861/03, with the Court). The applicant was also present. He then heard a pistol shot as well as automatic gun fire. He also stated that at the time of the crime the applicant was sitting in the passenger seat of his car.",

F.H could not travel in broad daylight on account of blood feuds between himself and other families in the region. The purpose of the trip was for F.H to obtain explanations from the MP as regards his role in the assassination of F.H\u2019s brother. On the way to Tirana, they had run into the police car of a co-accused (Is.H). In Tirana, the applicant had moved around freely in order to facilitate the meeting between F.H and the MP. These movements were purely coincidental and were not aimed at organising people or bringing accomplices together or securing other facilities for criminal purposes. Had the applicant been an organiser of the crime, he would have tried to keep a low profile and avoid appearing in public. The applicant further admitted that he was present at the crime scene together with F.H and N.C, but he had never shot the MP. It was F.H who had got out of the back seat and shot the MP using an automatic gun. This was further confirmed by Z.N\u2019s statements of 25\u00a0September 1998 and 16 November 2000.",

The Court of Appeal may make a complete re-assessment of the evidence obtained and examined by the first-instance court, in which case it decides afresh on the appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Under Article 427 the Court of Appeal could re-open the judicial examination of a case (p\u00ebrs\u00ebritja e shqyrtimit gjyq\u00ebsor). In the event that one of the parties requests the re-examination of evidence administered during the first-instance court proceedings or seeks the collection of additional new evidence, the Court of Appeal, when deemed necessary, may decide to reopen the judicial proceedings, in part or in whole (Article 427 \u00a7 1). In so far as evidence has been discovered subsequent to the first-instance court\u2019s judgment or, in so far as evidence has been discovered in the course of the appeal proceedings, the Court of Appeal decides on a case-by-case basis as to its admission (Article 427 \u00a7 2). The re-opening of a case may also be decided ex officio when deemed necessary (Article 427 \u00a7 3). The Court of Appeal may also re-examine evidence provided that the accused did not attend the first-instance proceedings, either because he was not notified or because he was unable to attend those proceedings on lawful grounds (Article 427 \u00a7 4). Article 428 establishes that the Court of Appeal may decide to dismiss the appeal and uphold the first-instance decision, to amend the first-instance decision, to quash the first-instance decision and terminate the criminal proceedings, or to quash the first-instance decision and remit the case for a fresh trial.",

It is clearly the case that the statement was made prior to a \u201ccharge\u201d being levied against the applicant or prior to his situation being \u201csubstantially affected\u201d. However, the statement was such a part of the public domain to the extent that on 15 December 1999, more than one year after it had been made, the District Court still relied on it in ordering the applicant\u2019s arrest. It could therefore be considered to have had continued impact.",

Mr Berisha was not involved in the criminal investigation into the MP\u2019s murder as a police officer, investigator or a prosecutor. He did not hold a public office or exercise public authority and, in fact, no powers had been formally delegated to him by any State body. Mr Berisha acted as a private individual, in his capacity as the chairman of a political party which was legally and financially independent from the State. His statement, which was made in a heated political climate, could be regarded as his party\u2019s condemnation of the MP\u2019s assassination. As such the mere fact that his actions might have been socially useful in calling for justice to be rendered does not transform him into a public official acting in the public interest (see, mutatis mutandis, Kotov v.  [GC], no. 54522/00, \u00a7\u00a7 91-107, 3 April 2012).",
