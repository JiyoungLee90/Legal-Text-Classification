They have not furnished any information concerning the factual grounds for the decision. Secondly, as regards the legal grounds, the Court considers it anomalous that the decision of December 2002 should have been founded on a legal provision (section 25.10) that only became effective in January 2003 (see paragraphs 38 and 49 above). Thirdly, the exact date of the decision has not been indicated and no explanation has been given as to why its existence was mentioned for the first time on 25 October 2004, in the Government's observations on the merits, almost two years after it had allegedly been issued. No reference to that decision was made in the domestic proceedings concerning the applicant's deportation on 7 August 2003 or in the \u201cdeportation record\u201d of 25 August 2004. It has never been notified to the applicant or his representative. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the accuracy of the Government's submissions, in so far as they sought to rely on that decision by the Federal Security Service, is open to doubt. Even assuming that the decision of December 2002 did exist, the Government's refusal to furnish a copy of it prevents the Court from formulating its own conclusions regarding its contents. The applicant's contention that the grounds for that decision were the same as those on which his residence permit had been revoked might appear plausible. The Court will therefore assume that the refusal of entry to the applicant in August 2004 was connected with the preceding events and was relevant for the determination of his status as a \u201cvictim\u201d of the alleged violation.",

There is no indication that the applicant was ever suspected or convicted of any other offence, whether criminal or administrative. As noted above, it appears probable that the decision of the Federal Security Service barring the applicant's re-entry into  might have been issued in connection with his repeated failure to abide by the residence regulations. Although the domestic courts subsequently established that the applicant had not committed the administrative offence imputed to him and the residence permit was re-issued, the decision by the Federal Security Service was never revoked. On the contrary, the Government stated, in their submissions, that the possibility of revoking the residence permit on the basis of that decision was being examined (see paragraph 40 above). As a consequence, the legal obstacles to the applicant's lawful residence have not been removed, which has rendered the implementation of his right to liberty of movement merely theoretical rather than practical and effective as required by the Convention (see Artico v.\u00a0Italy, judgment of 13\u00a0May 1980, Series A no. 37, \u00a7\u00a033).",
