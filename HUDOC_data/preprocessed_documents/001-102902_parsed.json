Thereafter, the prosecutors and the courts did not advance any grounds whatsoever for maintaining the applicant\u2019s detention, simply stating that the previously chosen preventive measure was correct. However, Article 5 \u00a7 3 requires that after a certain lapse of time the persistence of a reasonable suspicion does not in itself justify deprivation of liberty and the judicial authorities should give other grounds for continued detention (see Jablonski v. Poland, no.\u00a033492/96, \u00a7 80, 21 December 2000, and I.A. v. France, no. 28213/95, \u00a7\u00a0102, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII). Those grounds, moreover, should be expressly mentioned by the domestic courts (see I\u0142owiecki v. Poland, no. 27504/95, \u00a7 61, 4 October 2001). No such reasons were given by the courts in the present case. Lastly, the Court notes that no alternative preventive measures were effectively considered by the domestic authorities.",
