It gave an overview of the applicant\u2019s past criminal behaviour, noting that he had been sentenced to life imprisonment for aggravated murder, and, while in prison, had been convicted for handling narcotic substances and repeatedly punished for acts of violence against public officials. The escort plan also included a personal risk assessment. It was noted that the applicant reacted aggressively to lawful orders of the officials when he thought that they were being unreasonable and also in situations where he felt cornered. He did not respect the prison regime and was prone to self-harm. Moreover, he was considered to become more dangerous in situations where he interpreted information in a manner expecting a favourable outcome for himself which nevertheless did not follow. The risk of his absconding was considered to be higher when outside prison. Against that background, it was considered necessary for the applicant to wear handcuffs and ankle cuffs.",

It confirmed the Administrative Court\u2019s conclusion about the use of handcuffs and ankle cuffs during the medical examination. It noted that in his appeal the applicant had claimed that the Administrative Court had failed to address the obligation to wear prison clothing, the manner in which the prison officers had carried their weapons and special equipment and the breach of doctor-patient confidentiality. The Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint about the prison officers\u2019 presence during his hospital visits, as the prison officers had had a duty under the Regulation of the Minister of Justice \u201cPrisoner Escort Duties and Procedures\u201d (see paragraph 36 below) to escort and guard him. The regulation also required that at least one member of the escort team maintain visual contact with the prisoner at all times. Even if they had overheard a conversation between the applicant and the doctor, they had had an official duty to maintain the confidentiality of that information. The court also addressed and dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaints about the obligation to wear prison clothing and about the prison officers carrying firearms. In the \u201cfacts and proceedings\u201d part of the judgment, the Court of Appeal noted that the applicant had, inter alia, complained that the visit to see his daughter had taken place at the wrong time, limiting his visit. The court did not address this complaint in its reasoning part of the judgment.",

When applying preventive measures, the feared harm did not definitely have to occur, but such harm had to be probable. It was considered that the opportunities to reduce risks were more limited in an escort vehicle than in a prison (as the latter had closed premises, different accommodation wings, increased security and observation possibilities and different supervisory measures).",

However, that did not mean that the presence of guards during a prisoner\u2019s medical examination was never justified. The security of medical staff and of the prison in general outweighed the prisoner\u2019s right to privacy and confidentiality if his or her behaviour during imprisonment had been defiant, threatening or violent. Additionally, in the same opinion the Chancellor of Justice referred to a Tartu Court of Appeal judgment in the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraph 25 above) and affirmed that the presence of guards during the medical examination of the specific prisoner (the applicant) had been justified in the light of his behaviour in prison.",

He had committed several crimes over the years ranging from crimes against property and hooliganism to those involving violence. He had been convicted and sentenced to life in 2001 for the murder of two people and the attempted manslaughter of another person. While in prison, prior to the hospital visits in the instant case, he had illegally handled narcotic substances, attacked another prisoner and assaulted prison officers or threatened to use violence against them. While some of the offences had required prior planning and organisation, others had been committed on impulse. He had a history of self-harm (he had injured himself twenty-seven times between 2002 and 2014, mostly by cutting himself) and had also acted in a threatening manner towards the prison medical staff. At the same time, his psychiatric examinations had not resulted in any permanent diagnosis. According to the applicant\u2019s personal management plan, he had been assessed as highly dangerous, unpredictable, impulsive, capable of using aggression against others and harming himself to get his way. Against that background, the application of security measures had been based on an individual risk assessment and had been justified in the interests of preventing the applicant from absconding or causing injury or damage. The prison had not had the aim of deliberately exposing or humiliating the applicant in public. Although after the hospital visits the prison medical unit had documented some redness, light pressure marks and abrasions on the skin, this was common after being cuffed and could not be considered as a sign of excessive suffering.",

Given the applicant\u2019s risk profile, such close supervision had been necessary considering the risk of escape or the threat he could have posed to the medical staff. The Government referred to the fact that the Chancellor of Justice had also accepted that in some instances constant supervision of a prisoner might be necessary even during a doctor\u2019s examination (see paragraph 41 above). In any event, the prison officers had \u2013 for tactical reasons \u2013 not stayed in the immediate vicinity of the applicant, but at a distance by the door of the room, and there had been a screen between them and the applicant during the medical examination. The rooms where the applicant\u2019s medical examinations had taken place had been sufficiently large (see paragraphs 11 and 15 above). Moreover, no medical information (only instructions on how to conduct himself during the colonoscopy) had been passed orally from the doctor to the applicant during the examination and the results of the examination had subsequently been sent directly to the prison medical unit. As, given the above findings, no breach of confidentiality had actually taken place, the applicant\u2019s complaint was purely hypothetical. Even if any delicate personal information had been heard, the prison authorities had had an obligation to maintain its confidentiality (see paragraphs 29, 37 and 38 above).",

France [GC], no. 59450/00, \u00a7 115, ECHR\u00a02006IX). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Mur\u0161i\u0107 v.

On the other hand, the States have an obligation under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention and that this, taken together with Article 3, requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including such ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 52442/09, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2011 (extracts), and Aleksejeva v. Latvia, no. 21780/07, \u00a7 34, 3 July 2012). The Court acknowledges that there might be situations where a prisoner has to be taken to a medical facility outside prison to receive such treatment which the prison itself does not or cannot provide. However, such situations may inevitably entail a risk of the prisoner absconding or posing danger either to themselves or anyone else (for example medical personnel or other patients). The Court is also mindful of the fact that medical staff in ordinary public hospitals cannot be expected to have the same level of preparedness and training as prison officers to deal with possible risks posed by prisoners\u2019 unpredictable or violent behaviour. It is in that light that the obligation of securing to everyone the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention must be underlined. The State authorities must be particularly vigilant when they have sufficient prior knowledge about the possible danger the prisoner might pose (for example previous attempts of escaping or violent behaviour).",

They provided a thorough risk profile, stressing that the applicant did not respect to the prison regime, and was aggressive and capable of attacking others as well as of self-harm. The risk of escaping when escorted outside prison was also highlighted. Against that background, the prison director decided that the applicant had to wear handcuffs and ankle cuffs during the visits and had to be accompanied (depending on the visits, by between three and six officers; see paragraphs 8, 12 and 16 above). The Government submitted further corroborating information, according to which the applicant could be considered to be impulsive, manipulative and violent (see paragraph 50 above).",

The applicant did not challenge the relevant risk assessment, but argued that since he had never tried to escape, less restrictive measures could have been used. However, the aim of the security measures was not only to avoid a possible escape, but also to avoid potential harm to other people as well as to the applicant himself. Against that background, the Court finds that the security measures were directly linked to the applicant\u2019s specific behaviour and, as such, did not exceed what could be reasonably considered necessary (see Kleuver v.

Although the handcuffs and ankle cuffs left pressure marks, abrasions and redness on the skin of the applicant, it cannot be concluded from this that excessive force was used when applying them. The Court is also not convinced by the applicant\u2019s allegation that the hospital visits under the described conditions adversely affected his mental state, leading him to self-harm. Although the applicant\u2019s long history of self-harm is, in itself, a matter of concern (see paragraph 50 above), there is no evidence to suggest that a causal link existed between the visits and him harming himself.",

No medical procedures had been performed on the applicant\u2019s daughter during his visit and he himself had asked to leave the hospital (see paragraph 19 above). However, in the event that procedures had been performed on other patients and the applicant had been asked to leave the room, the Government held that this clearly would have taken precedence over the applicant\u2019s visiting rights. It was very unlikely that permission to touch his daughter had been granted (see paragraphs\u00a01820 above). Against that background, no interference with rights protected under Article 8 of the Convention had taken place with respect to the timing and duration of the visit, or as regards the applicant\u2019s ability to touch the child. In any event, even if there had been such an interference, it had been proportionate.",
