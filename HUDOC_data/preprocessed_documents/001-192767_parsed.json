It alleged that the Supreme Court had violated European Union law on account of its failure to apply, of its own motion, Article 17 of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC (see paragraph 30 below) in its 2009 judgment and on account of the wrongful qualification of the applicant\u2019s activity for the purposes of the value-added tax deduction. The applicant argued that the European Union law provision analysed in the Aardappelenbewaarplaats case was Article 8 of the Second Council Directive 67/228 (defining the basis for assessment of value-added tax), rather than Article 17 of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC (concerning tax deduction). It was the latter that should have been directly applicable in the case before the Supreme Court. In the applicant\u2019s view, the Aardappelenbewaarplaats case was about whether turnover tax should be imposed on storage services provided free of charge for members of a cooperative association, whereas the case before the Supreme Court had concerned a different question, namely the deductibility of input VAT. Alleging the Supreme Court\u2019s liability for judicial malpractice, the applicant relied on the K\u00f6bler judgment of the CJEU (see paragraph 31 below). It requested that the Budapest Regional Court obtain a preliminary ruling from the CJEU as to the conformity of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment with European Union law and the conditions for establishing whether the Supreme Court might be liable for a wrongful judgment.",

Contending that the Constitutional Court should be considered as a \u201ccourt or tribunal\u201d for the purposes of Article 267 of the TFEU, the applicant also requested the Constitutional Court to turn to the CJEU in order to enquire whether an \u201carbitrary\u201d refusal of a last-instance jurisdiction to refer a case for a preliminary ruling may violate the party\u2019s right to a fair trial guaranteed by Article\u00a047 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (see paragraph 29 below) and, if so, under what conditions such a refusal might be considered arbitrary. The applicant argued, in particular, that the K\u00faria had failed to recognise an issue of fundamental importance, namely that whether a certain legal issue (the consequences of a plaintiff\u2019s failure to put forward explicit allegations as to an infringement of European Union law) fell within the ambit of national law or European Union law was itself a question belonging necessarily to the realm of European law. Ignoring that concept, the K\u00faria had \u201csolved\u201d the problem in an arbitrary fashion, that is, by refusing the reference and barring the applicant\u2019s access to a \u201clawful judge\u201d, the CJEU in the circumstances.",

It further noted that the only claim an applicant might make in constitutional complaint proceedings initiated under section 27 of Act no. CLI of 2011 on the Constitutional Court was that a judgment be quashed. Consequently, no request for a preliminary ruling was possible under that law, and the applicant\u2019s request to that effect had to be rejected.",

In the Government\u2019s view, a constitutional complaint was a legal avenue to be exhausted when it came to the unfairness of proceedings and, in particular, a lack of appropriate reasoning (see also Somorjai v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 60934/13, \u00a7\u00a044, 28 August 2018). However, they contended that in the present case the proceedings before the Constitutional Court could not be taken into account for the assessment of the applicant\u2019s compliance with the six-month timelimit, since its complaint had been rejected as inadmissible by the Constitutional Court and thus the proceedings could not be considered an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

It further notes that although the Constitutional Court eventually rejected the applicant company\u2019s constitutional complaint, it did not do so on formal or procedural grounds; rather, it embarked on an analysis of the case and held that it lacked jurisdiction; in reaching this conclusion, it in fact partly dealt with the substance of the applicant company\u2019s complaint (see mutatis mutandis Uhl v.

It reiterates that the Convention does not guarantee, as such, the right to have a case referred by a domestic court to another national court or to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. The Court has previously observed that this matter is, however, not unconnected to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention since a domestic court\u2019s refusal to grant a referral may, in certain circumstances, infringe the fairness of proceedings where the refusal proves to have been arbitrary. Such a refusal may be deemed arbitrary in cases where the applicable rules allow no exception to the granting of a referral or where the refusal is based on reasons other than those provided for by the rules, or where the refusal was not duly reasoned. Indeed, the right to a reasoned decision serves the general rule enshrined in the Convention which protects the individual from arbitrariness by demonstrating to the parties that they have been heard and obliges the courts to base their decision on objective reasons (see Ullens de Schooten and Rezabek v. Belgium, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 54-59). As the Court has often noted, the rule of law and the avoidance of arbitrary power are principles underlying the Convention. In the judicial sphere, those principles serve to foster public confidence in an objective and transparent justice system, one of the foundations of a democratic society (see Taxquet v.\u00a0Belgium [GC], 16\u00a0November 2010, no. 926/05, \u00a7 90 and the cases cited therein).",

The Court has come to the same conclusion in a case where the applicant had failed to explicitly ask for a preliminary ruling (see Greneche and Others v. France (dec.), no.\u00a034538/08, 15\u00a0October 2013).

In that sense, the second and fourth questions \u2013 which, in substance, concerned the adequate interpretation of the relevant European Union law provisions \u2013 were considered not relevant as, according to the K\u00faria, they fell outside the scope of the action in damages. As to the third question \u2013 which in substance was about whether the sole fact that a party to an action in tort against a State for infringement of European Union law by its courts does not explicitly allege such infringement in the judicial proceedings, upon which the subsequent action in liability is based, excludes the State\u2019s liability \u2013 the K\u00faria implicitly provided a positive answer by concretely addressing the consequences of the applicant company\u2019s failure to raise the question of the correct application of European Union law in the first set of proceedings. It held that, by failing to put forward its arguments concerning the adequate interpretation of European Union law, the applicant company had prevented the Supreme Court from taking into account its arguments. Thus the K\u00faria assessed the alleged wrongful behaviour of the domestic court in light of the applicant\u2019s own behaviour. It found that, because of the applicant\u2019s own omissions in the first set of proceedings, there was no liability resting upon the competent court for \u2013 allegedly \u2013 wrongly applying European Union law. The K\u00faria could have explained more explicitly why it refused to make a preliminary reference.

Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999I). It is therefore not called on to assess compliance with EU law of the K\u00faria\u2019s approach, according to which there is no liability under EU law of a domestic court which allegedly misapplied EU law when, as in the present case, the applicant company claiming compensation under this head did not itself rely on EU law in the main proceedings and/or make a request for a reference for a preliminary ruling by the CJEU, thus preventing the domestic courts in the compensation proceedings from examining any claims based on an infringement of EU law. Nor can the Court assess whether or not under these circumstances it is open for the party concerned to ask, in the proceedings relating to the claim for compensation, for a reference for a preliminary ruling to be made to the CJEU. The Court notes that, according to the K\u00faria, what was lying at the heart of the case was, by and large, the applicant company\u2019s attempt to make good, by its action in damages brought against the Supreme Court, its omission in the first set of proceedings, that is to say, explicitly to refer to the applicable European Union law and to request a preliminary ruling on the EU law provision at stake.",

Such position cannot be considered arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable either. It is not for the Court to challenge the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding that requests for a preliminary reference to the CJEU should be made before the ordinary courts and that it lacked jurisdiction to review such decisions. The Court would stress in this context that Article 6 \u00a7 1 does not require a supreme court to give more detailed reasoning when it simply applies a specific legal provision to dismiss an appeal on points of law as having no prospects of success, without further explanation (see Burg and Others v.
