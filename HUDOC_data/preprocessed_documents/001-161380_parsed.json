Furthermore, since the minimum age of consent to a sexual act was set by law at fifteen, the applicant \u2012 who was only eleven at the time of the incidents \u2012 could not have expressed valid consent and the sexual abuse committed against her could therefore only be classified as rape.

First, when the victim is so young that it is impossible to establish his/her consent to the sexual act, the act is to be classified as rape \u2013 for example in cases where the victims are between six and nine years old. Secondly, when the victim is not so young for the act to be automatically classified as rape, but is not yet fifteen and gives her/his consent to the sexual act, the law provides that her/his will is not valid because of the victim\u2019s young age and classifies the act as the crime of sexual intercourse with a minor. The domestic courts have made a distinction between the two crimes, holding that the victim\u2019s failure to defend herself/himself or to express her/his will must be established on a case-by-case basis and it is possible that a fourteen-year-old girl may find herself unable to express her consent, while a much younger victim may have the capacity to defend herself and express her will.",

However, the issue lies with the courts\u2019 practice in analysing the existence of consent and their difficulties to adopt a child-sensitive approach in the assessment of the facts of the cases before them. More specifically, the majority of the convictions for rape were adopted in cases involving violence (see paragraph 35 above). In a significant number of cases, the victim\u2019s consent to the sexual acts was inferred from facts which were more akin to child-specific reactions to trauma, such as the fact that the victims did not tell their parents or did not scream for help (see paragraph 33 above). In less than half of the examples had the judges ordered psychiatric or psychological examinations of the victims in order to verify the existence of their capacity to give valid consent to the sexual acts (see paragraphs 33, 35 and 36 above). In very few of the cases submitted as examples \u2012 four, to be precise \u2012 did the courts consider that victims could not have expressed valid consent due to their very young age, ranging from six to twelve years old (see paragraph 34 above). In view of the above, it cannot be concluded that a settled and consistent practice had been developed by the national courts in order to clearly differentiate between cases of rape and those of sexual intercourse with a minor.",
