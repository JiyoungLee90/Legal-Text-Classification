The case file does not indicate that the applicant ever complained regarding the way in which the operation had been carried out or any related post-operative complications. On 10 July 2008 he was transferred back to the prison hospital because of an abscess in his lower jaw (see paragraph\u00a014 above). After being operated on, he was discharged on 30 July 2008 in a satisfactory condition. As regards hepatitis C, on 6 May 2008 the applicant was examined for the presence of the hepatitis C antibody in his blood, however, it was not possible to determine anything at that stage (see paragraph\u00a013 above). In February and July 2009 the applicant underwent a blood test, which revealed no active hepatitis C virus and thus no need for treatment in this respect (see paragraphs 22 and 24 above).

In April 2008 he had an Xray on his lungs and no active tuberculosis bacteria were detected (see paragraph\u00a012 above). In December 2008 he had another examination and this time tuberculosis bacteria were found (see paragraph 21 above). Within one month of the diagnosis of recurrent tuberculosis, namely on 23\u00a0January 2009, he was enrolled in the DOTS programme (see paragraph\u00a021 above). On 5 March 2009 he was transferred to the facility in Ksani for prisoners with tuberculosis. It is important to note that, according to the case file, no complaint was lodged by the applicant with the Ksani prison authorities in connection with the medical treatment provided to him at that facility. It is true that subsequently he was discharged from the Ksani facility for violating internal discipline and returned to Rustavi Prison no.\u00a06. However, as the case file indicates, he continued to have tuberculosis treatment in the latter establishment under the supervision of relevant specialists\u00a0(see paragraph\u00a043 above). The Court reiterates that it is guided by the due diligence test in its assessment of the adequacy of the treatment, since the State\u2019s obligation to cure a seriously ill detainee concerns the means to be employed and not the results to be achieved (see Goginashvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a071). In view of the Court\u2019s relevant case-law, and having regard to the relevant factual circumstances, the Court sees no negligence on the part of the prison authorities in their diagnosis and treatment of the applicant\u2019s tuberculosis.",

The Court notes that the applicant staged two hunger strikes in protest against the prison authorities\u2019 reluctance to address his headaches seriously (see paragraphs\u00a016 and 19 above). He also had to raise this issue with the representatives of the Public Defender in order to increase pressure on the prison authorities (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above). Nonetheless, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant had regular access to a neurologist\u00a0(see paragraphs\u00a014, 16 and 18 above), having his first examination immediately after voicing a complaint about the headaches for the first time\u00a0(see paragraph\u00a014 above). He had several treatments, although they were unsuccessful (see paragraphs\u00a014 and 16 above). There is no evidence that the diagnostic process, although complicated by the applicant\u2019s multiple conditions and thus protracted, had a negative impact on his state of health, and he makes no specific allegations in this respect (compare with G. v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a042526/07, \u00a7\u00a7 85-86, 21 June 2016, and Bulava v.

The Court finds the fact that the tomography scan was conducted following a delay of almost three months regrettable (see paragraphs 18-19 and 22 above). However, after his diagnosis with intracranial hypertension syndrome in February 2009, the applicant was prescribed appropriate treatment and he never voiced any grievances in this respect (see paragraph\u00a022 above).",

It does not, however, see a need to distinguish between the two periods in the current case, as it finds the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention as a whole unsubstantiated. During his pre-trial detention the applicant was allowed under domestic law to have family visits with the prior consent of an investigator or prosecutor (see paragraphs 28-29 above). However, he failed to submit to the Court a copy of at least one request for such a family visit, or a copy of a refusal or subsequent complaint against the refusal. The same holds true for his postconviction period: in accordance with the relevant legislation in force at the material time, the applicant was allowed to receive one or two family visits per month depending on his prison regime (see paragraph 30 above). It is not clear from the case file whether the applicant ever asked for such a visit in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and was not allowed to have one. The case file does not contain a single copy of a request or subsequent complaint against a refusal. In such circumstances, without examining the Government\u2019s non-exhaustion plea in detail, the Court considers that the applicant has failed to substantiate his complaint regarding the restrictions on his receiving regular family visits in prison (see Guk v. Ukraine [Committee], no. 16995/05, \u00a7\u00a093, 8\u00a0December 2016). It thus finds that the complaint under Article 8 of the Convention is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected pursuant to Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(a) and 4.",
