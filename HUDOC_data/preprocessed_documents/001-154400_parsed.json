The Public Defender informed the Commissioner that his Office had received over 30 complaints in 2013 about attacks against LGBTI persons. ILGA-Europe, an umbrella organisation of NGOs dealing with the human rights of LGBTI persons, had collected information on seven hate crimes perpetrated against LGBTI persons during 2013, which included various types of attacks, including rape, and threats of violence, including death threats. In its report submitted to the UN Human Rights Committee in September 2013, the local NGO Identoba referred to a murder with evidence of a possible hate motive which occurred in western Georgia in April 2013. The numbers cited are most certainly lower than the actual occurrence of bias-motivated attacks against LGBTI persons, due to the reluctance of victims to report violence to police, inter alia because of fears that their sexual orientation would be disclosed to family members. NGOs have also expressed serious concerns regarding the lack of effective investigation and adequate punishment for perpetrators of attacks. ...",

However, it is inconceivable that physical integrity, susceptible to be enjoyed by human beings, could be attributed to the first applicant, a legal person (compare with Verein \u201cKontakt-Information-Therapie\u201d (KIT) and Siegfried HAGEN v.

The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature and context of the treatment, its duration, its physical and mental effects and, in some instances, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1993, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 247C). Furthermore, Article 3 cannot be limited to acts of physical ill-treatment; it also covers the infliction of psychological suffering. Hence, the treatment can be qualified as degrading when it arouses in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 103, 1 June 2010, and Eremia v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 3564/11, \u00a7 54, 28 May 2013). The Court further reiterates that discriminatory treatment as such can in principle amount to degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 where it attains a level of severity such as to constitute an affront to human dignity. More specifically, treatment which is grounded upon a predisposed bias on the part of a heterosexual majority against a homosexual minority may, in principle, fall within the scope of Article 3 (see Smith and Grady v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7\u00a0121, ECHR\u00a01999VI). Discriminatory remarks and insults must in any event be considered as an aggravating factor when considering a given instance of ill-treatment in the light of Article 3 (see East African Asians v. the United Kingdom, nos. 4403/70 et al., Commission\u2019s report of 14 December 1973, Decisions and Reports 78, p. 5, \u00a7 208, and Moldovan and Others v.\u00a0Romania (no. 2), nos. 41138/98 and 64320/01, \u00a7 111, ECHR 2005VII (extracts)). In assessing evidence in a claim of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, the Court adopts the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Farbtuhs v. Latvia, no. 4672/02, \u00a7 54, 2 December 2004).",

This obligation should include effective protection of, inter alia, an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party, as well as reasonable steps to prevent ill-treatment of which the authorities knew or ought to have known (see, for instance, T.M. and C.M. v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 26608/11, \u00a7 38, 28 January 2014). Furthermore, Article 3 requires that the authorities conduct an effective official investigation into the alleged illtreatment, even if such treatment has been inflicted by private individuals (see M.C. v. Bulgaria, no. 39272/98, \u00a7 151, ECHR 2003\u2011XII). For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. In this connection, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the incidents reported at the relevant time. Consideration has been given to the opening of investigations, delays in taking statements and to the length of time taken for the initial investigation (see, for instance, Stoica v.

The authorities must do whatever is reasonable in the circumstances to collect and secure the evidence, explore all practical means of discovering the truth and deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of violence induced by, for instance, racial or religious intolerance, or violence motivated by gender-based discrimination (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 160, ECHR 2005\u2011VII; Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Others v. Georgia, no. 71156/01, \u00a7\u00a7 138-42; and Mudric v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 74839/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-64, 16 July 2013). Treating violence and brutality with a discriminatory intent on an equal footing with cases that have no such overtones would be turning a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention (see, for instance, Begheluri and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0173).",

Given that they were surrounded by an angry mob that outnumbered them and was uttering death threats and randomly resorting to physical assaults, demonstrating the reality of the threats, and that a clearly distinguishable homophobic bias played the role of an aggravating factor (see Smith and Grady, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0121; Abdu, cited above, \u00a7 23; and Begheluri and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0107 and 117), the situation was already one of intense fear and anxiety.

Subsequently, all of the applicants again requested, on 3 and 5 July 2012, the initiation of an investigation of the two above-mentioned facts (see paragraphs 20 and 23 above). However, the relevant domestic authorities, instead of launching a comprehensive and meaningful inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the incident with respect to all of the applicants, inexplicably narrowed the scope of the investigation and opened two separate and detached cases concerning the physical injuries inflicted on two individual applicants only. Even in those separate criminal cases, no significant progress has been made for more than two years. The investigations are still pending at the early stages and the applicants have not even been granted victim status (see paragraph\u00a028 above, and compare with Begheluri and Others, cited above, \u00a7 134-36). The only tangible result was the administrative sanctioning of two counterdemonstrators, who were punished for minor breach of public order by a fine of some EUR 45 each (see paragraph 22 above).

The necessity of conducting a meaningful inquiry into the discrimination behind the attack on the march of 17 May 2012 was indispensable given, on the one hand, the hostility against the LGBT community and, on the other, in the light of the clearly homophobic hate speech uttered by the assailants during the incident. The Court considers that without such a strict approach from the lawenforcement authorities, prejudice-motivated crimes would unavoidably be treated on an equal footing with ordinary cases without such overtones, and the resultant indifference would be tantamount to official acquiescence to or even connivance with hate crimes (compare, for instance, with Milanovi\u0107, \u00a7\u00a7 96 and 97; Abdu, \u00a7\u00a7 32-35; and Begheluri and Others \u00a7\u00a0141, 142 and 175, all cited above).",

On the contrary, the applicants and other participants of the demonstration were able to assemble freely near the Tbilisi Concert Hall and then proceeded with their march. As the organiser of the event had given a prior warning, the Ministry of the Interior deployed police units to the scene of the event. Police patrol vehicles escorted the LGBT marchers. As to the manner in which the police reacted to the clash between the marchers and counter-demonstrators, the Government admitted that that reaction had been somewhat delayed. However, they claimed that that had been done on purpose and in the marchers\u2019 best interests. Thus, the Government asserted that where a serious threat of a violent counter-demonstration exists, the domestic authorities have wide discretion in the choice of means to employ to protect assemblies.

Considering the large number of counter-demonstrators and their aggressive attitude towards the demonstrators, immediate preventive measures by the police could have provoked an even greater outburst of violence. Nevertheless, the law-enforcement officers remained at the scene and instantly intervened when the verbal attacks degenerated into actual physical violence by evacuating the attacked applicants from the scene. The police officers also separated the opposing parties by standing between them, verbally warning both sides to behave in an appropriate manner. As regards the applicants\u2019 complaints of discriminatory intent under Article\u00a014 of the Convention, the Government limited their response to noting that that provision was complementary and could not be invoked autonomously in the absence of a violation under Articles 10 and 11.",

Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, \u00a7 92, 17\u00a0February 2004). Referring to the hallmarks of a \u201cdemocratic society\u201d, the Court has attached particular importance to pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness. In that context, it has held that although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of the majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, p. 25, \u00a7 63; S\u00f8rensen and Rasmussen v.

Genuine, effective freedom of peaceful assembly cannot, therefore, be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere: a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the object and purpose of Article 11 of the Convention. This provision sometimes requires positive measures to be taken, even in the sphere of relations between individuals, if need be (see Wilson and the National Union of Journalists and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 30668/96, 30671/96 and 30678/96, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2002\u2011V, and Ouranio Toxo v.

Furthermore, it was apparent from the outcome of the LGBT procession, that the number of police patrol officers dispatched to the scene of the demonstration was not sufficient, and it would have been only prudent if the domestic authorities, given the likelihood of street clashes, had ensured more police manpower by mobilising, for instance, a squad of anti-riot police (contrast with Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037 and\u00a038; and also Ouranio Toxo, cited above, 43).",

I therefore voted against finding a violation of Article 3 taken in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention. I have explained in more detail my position with regard to the interpretation of Article 3 in the dissenting opinion written with Judge Mahoney which is attached to the judgment in the case of Abdu v. Bulgaria (no. 26827/08, 11 March 2014).",

In that case, on the basis of the available evidence, much more serious physical attacks against Muslim worshippers were clearly established, as well as the fact that the attackers had been motivated by religious intolerance. The Court decided, however - in my view correctly - that the Article 3 threshold had not been met in that case and the complaint under Article\u00a014 in conjunction with Article\u00a03 was declared manifestly illfounded. It examined only the complaint brought under Article\u00a09, and found a violation of this latter provision.",
