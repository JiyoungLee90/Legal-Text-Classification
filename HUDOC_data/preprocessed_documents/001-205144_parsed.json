This also corresponds to the modern approach in ophthalmology that one eye should be treated before the age of six to have good or improved vision because in later life it is not possible to achieve good vision whether surgery is performed or not, owing to the development of the neural sense of sight.

On the contrary, Dr P. emphasised that additional surgery had been necessary to resolve the complications in order for the child\u2019s sight to develop.

His vision was not able to develop properly until that point and the visual acuity achieved after surgery carried out so late is never the same as the expected visual acuity for a child of that age.",

The domestic courts dismissed further evidence proposed by the applicant, holding that yet another medical assessment had been unnecessary since the opinions of the two existing expert opinions had been consistent (see paragraph 20 above). The Court finds nothing problematic with such a conclusion.",

In any event, as the Court has previously held, Croatian law lays down several safeguards designed to ensure the reliability of expert evidence (see Jurica, cited above, \u00a7 94).

The domestic courts also duly scrutinised the expert evidence and, on the basis of the consistent findings of both experts rejecting the allegations of medical malpractice, dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim (see paragraph 21 above). The Court does not discern any fault on the domestic courts\u2019 part in respect of the manner in which they assessed the expert reports. The mere fact that the outcome of the proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case was unfavourable to him does not mean that the State has failed in its positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention (see Jurica, cited above, \u00a7 88).",
