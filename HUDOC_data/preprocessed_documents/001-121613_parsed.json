Their aim is to provide an accused person with protection against improper compulsion by the authorities and thus to avoid miscarriages of justice and secure the aims of Article 6. The right not to incriminate oneself is primarily concerned with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent and presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seeks to prove the case against the accused without resorting to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see\u00a0Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 6869, Reports 1996-VI). In examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court must examine the nature and degree of the compulsion, the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedures and the use to which any material so obtained is put (see Bykov v.  [GC], no. 4378/02, \u00a7 92, 10\u00a0March\u00a02009).",

The domestic courts also insisted on that point when they examined the experts\u2019 opinion disputing the \u201cauthenticity and originality\u201d of the tapes (see paragraph 34 above and Dumitru Popescu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0109).",
