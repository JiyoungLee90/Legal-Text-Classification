In particular, he was not informed that the testimonies he had given in the absence of a lawyer at the pre-trial investigation would prevail over those given at trial. After having obtained an opportunity to consult a lawyer, he had retracted his confessions and consistently pleaded innocent throughout the further proceedings. He further pointed out that the necessary procedural guarantees in order for his waivers to be accepted by the authorities, such as a lawyer\u2019s presence or a video recording, had not been provided. The applicant also stressed that in the course of those interviews, during which he had not been represented, he had been questioned about the murder whereas such a charge required mandatory legal assistance.

In this connection, the Court recalls that the waiver of a right guaranteed by the Convention \u2013 insofar as it is permissible \u2013 must be established in an unequivocal manner and must be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance (see Colozza v. Italy, judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89, p. 14, \u00a7 28; Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria (no. 1), judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 23, \u00a7 51; and Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2006II). The robbery of which the applicant had been suspected did not require mandatory legal representation under domestic law. In addition, when admitting as evidence the applicant\u2019s statements concerning his involvement in the robbery, given in the absence of the lawyer, and finding him guilty as charged, the trial court found no grounds to believe that the respective waivers had not been genuine or impermissible (see paragraph 35 above).",

Having noted that, throughout the trial, the applicant had consistently claimed that he was innocent and retracted all of the self-incriminating statements given at earlier stages of the proceedings, the court dismissed as unsubstantiated his allegation that the relevant statements had been obtained in violation of his rights of defence. It noted that those statements had been made in the presence of a lawyer.

The Court finds in this context that the phrase \u201c... including in the presence of a lawyer\u201d implies that some of the testimonies admitted in evidence were given in the absence of a lawyer. In those circumstances, there is clearly an inconsistency in the Court of Appeal\u2019s further statement that no violation of the applicant\u2019s rights of defence occurred as all the evidence had been given in the presence of a lawyer.",

It marks out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the organs of the Convention and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible.
