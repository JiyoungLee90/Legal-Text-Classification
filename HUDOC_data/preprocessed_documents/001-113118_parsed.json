Thus, in the summer of 2005, it had launched with Sweden and Germany a new initiative to ensure that fundamental rights would be given more weight in the sanctions procedure. Pursuing its initiative, Switzerland had submitted to the Security Council in 2008, together with Denmark, Germany, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands and Sweden, concrete proposals for the setting-up of an advisory panel of independent experts authorised to submit delisting proposals to the Sanctions Committee. Moreover, in the autumn of 2009 Switzerland had worked intensively with its partners to ensure that the Resolution on the renewal of the sanctions regime against al-Qaeda and the Taliban, scheduled for adoption in December, met that need. In the meantime Switzerland had supported the publication in October 2009 of a report proposing, as an option for an advisory review mechanism, the creation of an ombudsperson. On 17 December 2009 the Security Council adopted Resolution 1904 (2009), setting up the office of ombudsperson to receive complaints from individuals affected by the United Nations Security Council counterterrorism sanctions (see paragraph 78 below). Lastly, Switzerland had called on many occasions, before the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly, for an improvement in the procedural rights of the persons concerned by the sanctions.",

The two complainants, Belgian nationals, had been placed on the lists appended to that Resolution in January 2003, on the basis of information which had been provided to the Security Council by Belgium, shortly after the commencement of a domestic criminal investigation in September 2002. They had submitted several delisting requests at national, regional and United Nations levels, all to no avail. In 2005, the Brussels Court of First Instance had ordered the Belgian State, inter alia, to initiate urgently a delisting procedure with the United Nations Sanctions Committee, and the State had subsequently done so.",

G answers to that description because he has been designated by the 1267 Committee [the Sanctions Committee].

This is something that, under the system that the 1267 Committee currently operates, is denied to him. I would hold that Article 3 \u00a7 1 (b) of the AQO [al-Qaeda Order], which has this effect, is ultra vires section 1 of the 1946 Act.

In this connection, it should be observed that the applicant submitted many requests to the national authorities for the deletion of his name from the list annexed to the Taliban Ordinance \u2013 requests that were denied by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and the Federal Department of Economic Affairs (see paragraphs 30-32 above). The Federal Council, to which he appealed against the Department\u2019s decision, referred the case to the Federal Court. By a judgment of 14\u00a0November 2007, that court dismissed his appeal without examining the merits of the complaints under the Convention. Consequently, the Court takes the view that the applicant has exhausted domestic remedies relating to the sanctions regime as a whole, the application of which in his case stemmed from the addition of his name to the list annexed to the Taliban Ordinance.",

As well as the purpose of maintaining international peace and security, set out in the first sub-paragraph of Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations, the third sub-paragraph provides that the United Nations was established to \u2018achieve international cooperation in ... promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms\u2019.

Against this background, the Court considers that, in interpreting its resolutions, there must be a presumption that the Security Council does not intend to impose any obligation on member States to breach fundamental principles of human rights. In the event of any ambiguity in the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution, the Court must therefore choose the interpretation which is most in harmony with the requirements of the Convention and which avoids any conflict of obligations.

Indeed, in the applicant\u2019s case Switzerland was neither his State of citizenship nor his State of residence, and the Swiss authorities were not therefore competent to undertake such action. However, it does not appear that Switzerland ever sought to encourage Italy to undertake such action or to offer it assistance for that purpose (see, mutatis mutandis, the case of Sayadi and Vinck (Human Rights Committee), \u00a7 12, paragraphs 88 to 92 above).

It further finds that the possibility of deciding how the relevant Security Council resolutions were to be implemented in the domestic legal order should have allowed some alleviation of the sanctions regime applicable to the applicant, having regard to those realities, in order to avoid interference with his private and family life, without however circumventing the binding nature of the relevant resolutions or compliance with the sanctions provided for therein.",

Therefore, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision, there must be a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention, but the remedy must in any event be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the State (see B\u00fcy\u00fckda\u011f v. Turkey, no. 28340/95, \u00a7\u00a064, 21 December 2000, with the cases cited therein, especially Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 95, Reports 1996VI).

This conclusion is not in our view borne out by the terms of the resolutions themselves or by the provisions of the United Nations Charter under which they were issued. Moreover, despite the attention devoted to the point in the judgment, it does not ultimately appear to have played a central role in the Court\u2019s conclusion that Article 8 was violated, a conclusion which is founded less on Switzerland\u2019s failure to exploit any latitude afforded to it in the relevant resolutions than on its failure to take any, or any sufficient, measures to safeguard the applicant\u2019s Convention rights within the constraints set by those resolutions.",

In this respect, the case differs from that examined by the Court in Al-Jedda v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no.\u00a027021/08, ECHR 2011), where the Court held that the wording of the Resolution in issue did not specifically mention internment without trial and that, in the absence of clear and explicit language to the contrary, there was a presumption that the Security Council did not intend to impose any obligation on member States to breach fundamental principles of human rights. In the present case, clear and specific language was used in the relevant Resolution, as well as in paragraph 7 of Resolution 1267 (1999) in which the Security Council was even more explicit, setting aside any other international obligations that might be incompatible with the Resolution in question.",

He was prevented, at least from October 2003, not only from entering Switzerland but from leaving Campione d\u2019Italia at all, even to travel to other parts of Italy, the country of which he was a national. The prohibition made it exceptionally difficult for him to maintain contact with others, including members of his own family, living outside the enclave. In these circumstances, the Swiss authorities were, as the Federal Court put it, \u201cobliged to exhaust all the relaxations of the sanctions regime available under the United Nations Security Council Resolutions\u201d. They were also, in our view, required to take all such other steps as were reasonably open to them to bring about a change in the regime so as to reduce so far as possible its serious impact on the private and family life of the applicant.",

Nevertheless, in common with the other members of the Grand Chamber, we consider that the Swiss authorities did not sufficiently take into account the specific circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case, including the considerable duration of the measures imposed, and the applicant\u2019s nationality, age and health. Nor, in our view, did those authorities take all reasonable steps open to them to seek to mitigate the effect of the sanctions regime by the grant of requests for exemption for medical reasons or in connection with judicial proceedings, or to bring about a change in the sanctions regime against the applicant so as to secure so far as possible his Convention rights.",

The fact that the investigation against the applicant had been discontinued was of obvious importance to the prospect of the removal of the sanctions against him. In this regard, we note that the applicant\u2019s name was in fact deleted from the list on 23\u00a0September 2009, shortly after Switzerland sent to the Sanctions Committee a copy of the letter from the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office confirming that the judicial police investigation against the applicant had not produced any indications or evidence to show that he had ties with persons or organisations associated with Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda or the Taliban. The failure to communicate this information was the subject of specific criticism by the Federal Court which, while noting that by the date of its judgment in November 2007 the applicant was able to apply himself to initiate the delisting procedure, emphasised that he continued to rely on the support of Switzerland, since this was the only country to have conducted a comprehensive preliminary investigation into the applicant\u2019s activities. We fully share the view of the Federal Court that, while Switzerland could not itself proceed with deletion, it could at the very least have transmitted the results of the investigation to the Sanctions Committee and have actively supported the delisting of the applicant. With the benefit of the results of its own investigation, it could also have encouraged Italy, as the State of nationality and residence of the applicant, to take steps earlier than July 2008 to request the deletion of the applicant\u2019s name. Such measures were not bound to have met with success. There remained, however, a real prospect that they would have resulted in the deletion of the applicant\u2019s name and the restoration of his Article 8 rights at a much earlier stage than eventually occurred.",

The applicant certainly raised two totally separate complaints before the Court (see paragraphs 156 and 157), even though they both fell within the scope of Article 8 in terms of the protection of private life. However, whilst the first complaint concerned physical liberty to move around freely, the second concerned damage to the applicant\u2019s moral integrity, resulting from the very fact that his name appeared on the Sanctions Committee\u2019s list. In addition, whilst the first complaint was intrinsically linked to the highly specific geographical situation of the Campione d\u2019Italia enclave, with its very confined territory, the second was much more general in effect. That aspect of his application was certainly, in the applicant\u2019s view, equally as important \u2013 if not more so \u2013 as the restrictions that had been imposed on his freedom of movement.",

For the purposes of examining whether a person\u2019s name should be included on the Sanctions Committee\u2019s list, I certainly find it difficult to imagine a balancing of the interests at stake by the respondent State.",
