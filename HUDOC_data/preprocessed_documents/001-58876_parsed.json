However, before the expiry of this time-limit the court decided that the applicant should not be compensated. According to Article 536 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this decision was final. As a result, the Court fails to see what useful purpose lodging a claim for compensation could have served given the Court of Appeal's proprio motu ruling and its final character. It follows that there was a \u201cdispute\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see the above-mentioned Georgiadis v. Greece judgment, p. 959, \u00a7 31).",

The Court considers that the Government have submitted nothing in the present case that would justify a departure from these conclusions. It follows that Article 6 \u00a7 1 was applicable.",

A procedure whereby civil rights are determined without ever hearing the parties' submissions cannot be considered to be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 (op. cit., p. 960, \u00a7 40). Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that on 2 September 1996 the Court of Appeal ruled on the applicant\u2019s entitlement to compensation proprio motu without inviting comments on his part. According to domestic law, it was not open to the applicant to challenge this ruling. It follows that there was a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in respect of the Court of Appeal's failure to hear the applicant. It also follows that the Government\u2019s objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must be rejected.",

Greece judgment, p. 960, \u00a7\u00a043). However, in the applicant\u2019s case the domestic court did not invoke any reasons for precluding compensation.
