Whether it is reasonable for an accused person to remain in detention must be assessed on the facts of each case, according to its specific features. Continued detention can only be justified in a given case if there are actual indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty laid down in Article 5 of the Convention (see Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2000-XI, and Zimin v.

Thus, he had had no chance to learn the content of those applications and had not been able to present any material arguments before the court.

A court examining an appeal against detention must provide guarantees of a judicial procedure. The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure \u201cequality of arms\u201d between the parties, the prosecutor and the detained person. Equality of arms is not ensured if counsel is denied access to the investigation file in so far as that access is essential in order effectively to challenge the lawfulness of his client\u2019s detention (see Garcia Alva v. Germany, no. 23541/94, \u00a7\u00a039, 13\u00a0February\u00a02001). Those requirements are derived from the right to an adversarial trial, as laid down in Article 6 of the Convention, which means, in a criminal case, that both the prosecution and the defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, it follows from the wording of Article 6 \u2013 and particularly from the autonomous meaning to be given to the notion of \u201ccriminal charge\u201d \u2013 that this provision has some application to pre-trial proceedings (see Imbrioscia v.\u00a0Switzerland, 24 November 1993, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 275). It is thus clear that, in view of the dramatic impact of the deprivation of liberty on the fundamental rights of the person concerned, proceedings conducted under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention should in principle also meet, to the greatest extent possible in the circumstances of an ongoing investigation, the basic requirements of a fair trial, such as the right to an adversarial procedure. While national law may satisfy this requirement in various ways, whatever method is chosen should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment on them (see Lietzow v. Germany, no. 24479/94, \u00a7 44, ECHR\u00a02001I).",

According to the applicant\u2019s submissions, unrefuted by the Government, the defence was not provided with the prosecution\u2019s applications in any of those proceedings in due time. For the first detention hearing, which took place before the Tatab\u00e1nya District Court on 9 June 2012, the prosecution application was only made available during the court session (see paragraph\u00a013 above). Later, when the delivery of decisions prolonging the coercive measure or dismissing an application for release took place without a court session, the defence was either not provided with the prosecution applications prior to the court decision or was not given them at all (see paragraphs 16 and 18 above). Furthermore, in the present case it is not disputed that neither the applicant nor his counsel was given access to the criminal file or the material presented by the prosecutor to the court deciding the issues of the applicant\u2019s remand in custody and the lawfulness of his continued detention.",
