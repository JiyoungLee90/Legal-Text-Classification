However, the national authorities must attempt to keep this to a minimum (see Quinn v. France, 22\u00a0March 1995, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 311; Giulia Manzoni v. Italy, 1\u00a0July 1997, \u00a7\u00a025 in\u00a0fine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV; K.\u00a0F. v Germany, 27\u00a0November 1997, \u00a7 71, Reports 1997VII; and Mancini v. Italy, no.\u00a044955/98, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2001IX). Administrative formalities connected with release cannot justify a delay of more than a few hours (see Nikolov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 38884/97, \u00a7 82, 30 January 2003). It is for the Contracting States to organise their legal system in such a way that their lawenforcement authorities can meet the obligation to avoid unjustified deprivations of liberty (see, for example, Shukhardin v. Russia, no.\u00a065734/01, \u00a7 93, 28 June 2007, and Mokallal v. Ukraine, no. 19246/10, \u00a7\u00a044, 10 November 2011).",
