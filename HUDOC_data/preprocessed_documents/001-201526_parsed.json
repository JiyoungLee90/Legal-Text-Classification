The Regional Court found that the fact that the applicant had been fully unfit for farm work was undisputed and acknowledged by the defendant (the Fund). Moreover, referring to the medical report dated 18\u00a0June 2010 ordered for the purpose of the pending court proceedings and issued by experts in internal medicine, orthopaedics, neurology and psychiatry, the court established that the applicant had been completely unfit for farm work throughout the whole period starting from the end of March 2008 \u2013 that is to say from the day on which he had stopped receiving the above mentioned pension. The forensic experts \u2013 of whom at least two (the neurologist, a certain J.W., and the orthopedist, a certain J.B.) \u2013 had also issued their respective medical reports for the purpose of the previous set of proceedings in which the applicant\u2019s disability pension had been discontinued, had prepared their latest reports on the basis of the medical documentation previously available to them, as well as on the medical files relating to the applicant\u2019s treatment in the Szczecin Neurosurgical Clinic in December 2009. The court noted that they had indicated, without providing further details, that during the previous set of proceedings they had not had at their disposal the complete medical documentation and procedural files concerning the applicant (dokumentacja orzecznicza). Thus, in the reports issued for the purposes of the second set of proceedings they had reached a conclusion contrary to their previous findings, even though the applicant\u2019s state of health had not improved and he had been completely unfit for farm work for the whole time. Lastly, the experts had indicated that the applicant\u2019s complete inability to perform farm work would cease to exist no earlier than on 30 April 2011. Consequently, the Regional Court reinstated the applicant\u2019s entitlement to a disability pension until that date.",

The District Court established that the medical experts had confirmed that they had not had at their disposal the complete relevant medical documentation and procedural files when they had issued the first medical report concerning the applicant. As a result, their second medical report had contained conclusions contrary to their previous evaluation of the applicant\u2019s state of health.

The court also referred in this regard to the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 18 February 2003 (file no. II UK 139/02).

Additionally, the Regional Court examined the case under Article 4172 of the Civil Code, which allowed the granting of compensation even in the event that the actions of the State representative in question had been legal, the condition for qualifying for such compensation being here a bodily injury (szkoda na osobie). The court, however, also refused to award compensation on those grounds, holding that the damage suffered by the applicant had been purely pecuniary in nature.

In particular, the requisite \u201cfair balance\u201d will not be struck where the person concerned bears an individual and excessive burden (see Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v.\u00a0Sweden, 23 September 1982, \u00a7\u00a7 69-74, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a052, and Brum\u0103rescu v.\u00a0Romania [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a078). Despite the margin of appreciation given to the State, the Court must nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review, determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant\u2019s right to property (see Rosinski v\u00a0Poland, no. 17373/02, \u00a7\u00a078, 17 July 2007). The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention as a whole, including, therefore, the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see Pressos\u00a0Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20\u00a0November 1995, \u00a7\u00a038, Series A no. 332, and The former King of Greece and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a089). Thus, the balance to be maintained between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of fundamental rights is upset if the person concerned has had to bear a \u201cdisproportionate burden\u201d (see, among many other authorities, The Holy Monasteries v.\u00a0Greece, 9\u00a0December 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, Series A no. 301-A).",
