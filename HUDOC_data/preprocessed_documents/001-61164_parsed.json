However, the District Court rejected the claims, finding that the buildings had been erected before 1991 \u2013 when the applicant and her sister, through the partial division of their mother\u2019s estate, had become joint owners of the two properties \u2013 and that the other joint owners at the time had expressly or impliedly consented to the various building projects.

Thus, with effect from the date of the judgment, the legal aid previously awarded was withdrawn. The applicant and her sister appealed against the judgment, submitting, inter alia, that the District Court\u2019s decision on legal aid should be quashed. However, on 3 October 1997 the Court of Appeal upheld the legal-aid decision. On 16 January 1998 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal. Stating that they were unable to plead their case properly without legal aid, the applicant and her sister, by a letter to the Court of Appeal of 1\u00a0November 1999, withdrew most of their claims in the removal case.",

The fact that a building permit had been granted did not alter the situation, as a building committee is not required to look into questions of ownership of the real estate but must concern itself exclusively with planning conditions. When the house had been transferred to the applicant through the partial division of her mother\u2019s estate in 1991, she had been in the same legal position as her mother previously. In order to comply with the law, permission to build the house should have been sought from the other joint owners before the house was built. If they had refused, there would have been two options: either to apply for a sale of the real estate at public auction or to begin division proceedings. Since the law had not been complied with, the other owners had been entitled to request that the house be removed. The courts had therefore been right not to grant the applicant\u2019s requests for a stay of the proceedings or a stay of enforcement on the basis of the division proceedings brought after the building of the house. A decision granting her requests would have favoured her over the other owners. In balancing the applicant\u2019s right to retain a house built in breach of the law against the other owners\u2019 right to have the real estate restored to its former state by means of efficient court proceedings, it was the Government\u2019s position that the interests of the other owners had to be given priority. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 should not be used to protect a measure which had been against the law from the outset, as unlawful behaviour as such does not deserve the protection of the law. By building the house the applicant \u2013 or rather her mother \u2013 had anticipated events which were likely to occur subsequently, such as the division of the real estate into individual plots.",

Agreeing with the Government, the Court considers that such a requirement lies at the heart of the notion of joint ownership and that the ultimate consequence of the application of that principle \u2013 the demolition of a building erected without the necessary consent \u2013 can reasonably be said to further the legitimate \u201cpublic interest\u201d of maintaining a functioning system of joint ownership.

The consent of the other owners was not obtained and, as noted by the Government, the building project therefore failed to comply with the legal requirements under the 1904 Act. Moreover there had apparently been disagreements between the joint owners as to the management of the estates. Thus, the applicant and her mother cannot reasonably have been unaware that, by building the house without having secured the required consent of the other owners, they risked certain legal consequences.",

Moreover, as noted above, the Building Committee had granted a building permit for the house on 9 September 1987 and granted a permit for the reconstruction of the demolished house on 4 February 1997, and had thus concluded that the house complied with planning laws. What remains to be examined by the Court, therefore, is whether a fair balance was struck between the interest of maintaining a functioning system of joint ownership, represented by the other joint owners\u2019 wish that a house built without their consent be removed, and the applicant\u2019s interest in retaining that house.",

In the division proceedings the REFA had decided, on 1 December 1995, not to allow the creation of an individual plot around the house in issue for the sole reason that the Court of Appeal, in its judgment, had upheld the order that the house be removed. The REFA\u2019s decision had been appealed to the  which had asked the Central Office of the National Land Survey to give its opinion on the matter. On 4 March 1996 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant\u2019s request for a stay of the removal proceedings and refused leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment. The order to remove the house thereby acquired legal force. On 14 March 1996, only ten days later, the Central Office recommended that the applicant be assigned an individual plot around the house, as this would preserve the house and reduce the risk of adverse consequences for the applicant.

It appears that the applicant did not receive this order until the time-limit had expired. As she was not present at the address she had apparently given to the court, this was her own fault. However, the court had already heard her appeal, at a session on 3 June, two days before the expiry of the time-limit, and took the decision, delivered on 4 June, to refuse her leave to appeal. Before this session, the court had received a letter from the applicant on 31 May in which she made submissions in the case, but also requested a respite to substantiate her appeal. Thus, there does not appear to have been any justifiable reason for the Court of Appeal to assume that the applicant had made her final submissions and to proceed to decide her appeal before the expiry of the time-limit set by itself. The Court notes, furthermore, that the Enforcement Office had already started to demolish the house on 3 June, that is before the delivery of the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision and the expiry of the time-limit. It is true that the removal judgment was immediately enforceable despite the appeal in the enforcement proceedings.

In those proceedings, the sole reason for the REFA\u2019s refusal to create an individual plot around the house in issue was the Court of Appeal\u2019s removal judgment. Thus, although the Court acknowledges that the Supreme Court could not be expected to have foreseen the outcome of the division proceedings, the question of the removal of the applicant\u2019s house was clearly linked with the division issue. It thus appears that it would have been reasonable for the Supreme Court to await the outcome of the division proceedings, particularly in the light of the irreparable consequences of the demolition of a house and the economic impact of such a measure. In this connection, the Court also has regard to the fact that the division proceedings had been brought by the applicant as early as October 1990, in what appears to have been an attempt to save her house from being removed or demolished, and that those proceedings had been delayed partly due to procedural errors made by the REFA which had caused the case to be referred back to that authority.

The main relevant loss relates to the value of the demolished house. In this respect, the Court notes that the applicant, in her initial letter to the Commission, stated that the value of the demolished house was SEK 700,000, a valuation which has not been challenged by the Government. According to the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction the cost of rebuilding the house came to SEK 1,733,900. However, it is not possible to determine whether the new house is of the same size and standard as the demolished house. The Court therefore finds that the amount to be taken into account is the value indicated by the applicant in her initial letter. Furthermore, as noted by the Government, the applicant has substantiated \u2013 save for not providing proof of payment \u2013 the claims of SEK 114,796 for demolition costs and SEK 9,009 for the building permit fee. From a tender made by the company which demolished the house it appears that the cost of removing the building material amounted to SEK 62,500. The Court finds that the above losses and costs have a direct and causal link to the violation found. Further, although no professional valuation of the demolished house or proof of actual payment of the relevant invoices have been submitted, the losses and costs have been substantiated sufficiently to form the basis of an assessment of the award to be made. Thus, making an overall assessment based on these amounts, the Court finds it appropriate to award the applicant, for pecuniary damage, the sum of 100,000 euros (EUR). ",
