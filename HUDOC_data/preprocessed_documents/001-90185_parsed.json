Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7\u00a046, 25\u00a0November\u00a02003). Although the Court has previously rejected some cases concerning repeated remittals, having observed that the judicial authorities had acted diligently in handling a complex matter (see Zhurba\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a011215/03, 19\u00a0June\u00a02007, and Bespalov\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a011484/05, 15\u00a0January 2008), it cannot find a\u00a0similar justification for remittals in the present case. Furthermore, the Court considers that a number of other delays (adjournments of hearings on\u00a0account of the defendant\u2019s absence and handling by the Supreme Court of the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal) should be attributed to the domestic authorities.",
