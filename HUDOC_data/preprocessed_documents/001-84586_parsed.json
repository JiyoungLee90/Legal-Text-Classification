It is clearly in the general interest that any person who wishes to consult a lawyer should be free to do so under conditions which favour full and uninhibited discussion. It is for this reason that the lawyer-client relationship is, in principle, privileged. Similar considerations apply to a prisoner's correspondence with a lawyer concerning contemplated or pending proceedings where the need for confidentiality is equally pressing. That such correspondence be susceptible to routine scrutiny is not in keeping with the principles of confidentiality and professional privilege attaching to relations between a lawyer and his client. In the Campbell v\u00a0the  judgment of 25 March 1992 Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0233, \u00a7\u00a048, the Court found no reason to distinguish between the different categories of correspondence with lawyers which, whatever their purpose, concern matters of a private and confidential character. In the present case, regard being had to the explicit prohibition of censorship of detained persons' correspondence with their lawyers provided for in Article\u00a073 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court considers that the interference complained of was contrary to the domestic law.",
