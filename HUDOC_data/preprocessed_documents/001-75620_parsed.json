The Government have not produced any convincing evidence, e.g. case-law of the , to prove that the outcome of the applicant\u2019s complaint would have been any different had he lodged it prior to the County Court\u2019s decision. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court\u2019s practice at the material time provided that section 63 was applicable only in cases where the competent court had not decided \u201cthe merits of the complainant\u2019s rights or obligations\u201d (see above \u00a7\u00a016), whereas in enforcement proceedings the court does not, in principle, deal with the merits of civil rights, but rather with the execution of a right already determined by a final court judgment. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint cannot be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies.",
