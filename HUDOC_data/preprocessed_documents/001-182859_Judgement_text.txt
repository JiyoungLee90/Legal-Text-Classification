The case originated in an application (no. 32248/12) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a national of Uzbekistan, Mr Firuzzhon Bakhronovich Ibrogimov (“the applicant”), on 30 May 2012.
The applicant was represented by Ms L. Ovchinnikova, a lawyer practising in Vladivostok. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 19 October 2016 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1992 and lives in Bukhara, Uzbekistan.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
The applicant was born in Uzbekistan. In 2003 his father, mother, brother and sister moved to Vladivostok in Russia and subsequently acquired Russian nationality, while he continued to live with his grandfather in Bukhara, visiting them in the summer months. After his grandfather had died and the applicant had finished the secondary school, in June 2011 he joined his family in Russia.
The applicant took a mandatory blood test with a view to obtaining a health certificate to support his application for a temporary residence permit. He was found to be HIV-positive.
On 23 September 2011 the Consumer Protection Authority declared the applicant’s presence in Russian undesirable (the “exclusion order”) on the ground that he was HIV-positive.
By judgment of 19 December 2011, the Sovetskiy District Court in Vladivostok rejected the applicant’s challenge to the exclusion order, finding that it was issued in full compliance with Russian law.
On 13 February 2012 the Primorskiy Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal.
On 22 February 2012 the applicant left Russia to comply with the exclusion order.
