A number of servicemen brought proceedings against their military unit\u2019s administration, which had not paid them part of their remuneration owing to a lack of funds. A court gave judgment in their favour and, at the same time, ordered that the payment be made as soon as the money was received by the military unit from the relevant State budget. The case-law review noted that in this case the court, in essence, had postponed the enforcement of its judgment for an indefinite period, which had contravened the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure by which a time-limit for the enforcement of judgments was set by law or, in some cases, by a court. In decision no.\u00a02n31497 of the Military Section of the Supreme Court the direction that payment should be made upon receipt of the relevant funds was removed from the judgment.

The defendant authority placed the applicant on the waiting list and stated that it was impossible to enforce the remaining part of the judgment since it had not received funds from the federal budget for that purpose. The applicant requested the Supreme Court to define the procedure for the further enforcement of the judgment. The Civil Section of the Supreme Court ruled in its decision of 14\u00a0November 2000 that the housing authority should provide the applicant with a flat regardless of federal financing. The deputy prosecutor general lodged an application for that decision to be quashed in supervisory-review proceedings.

However, the distinctive feature of the present case is that the Slavyansk Town Court, as well as recognising the applicant\u2019s entitlement to State housing aid and ordering the Town Council to pay a certain amount of money, ordered that the payment should be made when the money was available and when the applicant\u2019s turn came on the waiting list, which never occurred. The present case should be distinguished from the cases of Fadeyeva and Ledyayeva and Others, in which the operative provisions of judgments were limited to the requirement of placing the applicants on a waiting list (see Fadeyeva v. Russia (dec.), no. 55723/00, 16\u00a0October 2003, and Ledyayeva and Others v. Russia (dec), nos. 53157/99, 53695/00, 53247/99 and 56850/00, 16 September 2004). It can be noted that in the case of Malinovskiy a judgment originally ordered a local authority to provide the applicant with a flat \u201cin accordance with the order of precedence on the waiting list\u201d. That condition was removed from the judgment by a higher court in supervisory-review proceedings (see Malinovskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a041302/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08 and 12, 7 July 2005). In that case the Court accepted that the judgment, as it had been worded prior to the decision of the supervisory review court, \u201cdid not require an immediate grant of a flat because its implementation was conditional on prior allocation of flats to the persons placed on the waiting list before the applicant\u201d (ibid., \u00a7\u00a036). The prolonged non-enforcement of the judgment after its amendment by the supervisory-review court was sufficient for the Court to find a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in that case.",

On the other hand, they provided for two conditions for the payment \u2013 the availability of State funds and the payment of State housing aid to individuals placed on the waiting list before the applicant. The judgments remained in their original form during the whole period in which they were not enforced. It is true that if the Court\u2019s task in such situations were to ensure the State\u2019s compliance with a judgment against it as it was worded, the Court would be able to conclude that the non-enforcement of the judgments in the applicant\u2019s case did not pose any problem under the Convention since those two conditions were never fulfilled, the more so because the Convention does not, as such, impose on the State an obligation to provide housing. However, the Court considers that this would be too restrictive an interpretation of Article 6 and would not correspond to the object and purpose of the Convention.",

The conditions were repeated in the judgments of 6 April 1998 and 19 April 2000. It should also be noted that it does not appear that by providing for conditions for the payment, such as those specified above, in the operative provisions of the judgments, the Slavyansk Town Court complied with domestic law (see paragraphs 24-28 above).",

Nor should it in such a case be possible to avoid execution of the claim by providing without any statutory basis in a judgment that the payment of an award is conditional on the availability of money from the State treasury and the prior payment to those before the claimant on a waiting list. In the present case there was no legal basis for such conditions according to domestic case-law (cf. \u00a7\u00a7 24-28 above), and the Government have not advanced any justification for them. The Court therefore considers that the conditions for payment laid down in the judgments in the applicant\u2019s case did not relieve the State of its obligation to pay the sums awarded by those final judgments within reasonable time. The Government have not given any plausible explanation for the failure to enforce the judgment of 6 April 1998 during about two and a half years. The Court finds that by failing for such a substantial period of time to take the necessary measures to comply with the final judgment of 6 April 1998 in the present case, the Russian authorities deprived the provisions of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of their useful effect. It notes that the amount awarded by the judgment of 6 April 1998 was increased by way of index-linking in line with increased market prices by the judgment of 19\u00a0April 2000, which equally remained unenforced. However, since the above considerations concerning the judgment of 6\u00a0April 1998 are sufficient to find a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 in the applicant\u2019s case and since the judgment of 19 April 2000 was closely linked to the judgment of 6 April 1998, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine separately the delay in enforcing the judgment of 19\u00a0April 2000.",

The judgment had become final as no ordinary appeal was lodged against it, and enforcement proceedings had been instituted. It follows that the applicant\u2019s inability to obtain the enforcement of this judgment for a substantial period of time constituted an interference with his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions, in breach of the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01.
