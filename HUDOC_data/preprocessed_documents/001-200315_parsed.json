He held that if the press and the public were not excluded from certain parts of the trial \u201cserious risks would be taken\u201d. He stressed the possibility that the prosecution might drop the case altogether rather than incur those risks. He was of the view that if the press and public were excluded from the relevant parts of the defence, the trial would go ahead, the risks would not be taken and a fair trial would be possible.

It underlined that most of the trial had been conducted in public and that the applicant had been able to name the three alleged gangsters and provide a good deal of identifying material. The in camera order had initially been drafted so as not to cover that part of his evidence, expressly so that it could be heard by anyone who chose to be in court. It was because of the applicant\u2019s own inability to confine himself to that evidence that it had become necessary for all of his evidence to be heard in private. Nonetheless, the information concerning the alleged gangsters had been available to be put to several prosecution witnesses who had given evidence in open court. In addition, at the first trial the applicant\u2019s counsel had made a public opening statement to the court identifying the persons upon whom his defence had relied. The possibility had remained for this to be done in the second trial, although for tactical reasons it had not been taken up. The court was therefore unable to accept that there was a real possibility that other evidence would have emerged had there been further publicity and that such evidence would have been exculpatory. In respect of good character evidence, the court observed that there had been a great deal of character evidence available and that the trial judge had summarised it \u201cvery favourably\u201d in his summing-up to the jury. The court did not agree that the fact that four prosecution witnesses had given their evidence in private had given it additional standing. Although the evidence had been heard in the absence of the public, the evidence-taking had otherwise proceeded in exactly the same way as for all other witnesses.",

The sensitive nature of national security concerns means that the very reasons for excluding the public may themselves be subject to confidentiality arrangements and respondent Governments may be reluctant to disclose details to this Court. Such sensitivities are, in principle, legitimate and the Court stands ready to take the necessary steps to protect secret information disclosed by the parties in the context of proceedings before it. But in some instances even these confidentiality guarantees may be considered insufficient to mitigate the risk of serious damage to fundamental national interests should information be disclosed. It may therefore arise, as in the present case, that the Court is asked to assess whether the exclusion of the public and the press met the strict necessity test without itself having access to the material on which that assessment was made at the domestic level.",

The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the trial judge and underlined that, in the result, it had not led to any unfairness in the proceedings.

The general thrust of the applicant\u2019s defence was also public, and what information was publicly available was more than adequate to enable those with knowledge of the applicant having received stolen items from named gangsters, or the alleged gangsters themselves, to come forward. It appears that, despite the further publicity in light of the applicant\u2019s second appeal in 2017, no such witnesses came forward. For the same reasons, the small part of the trial heard in camera could have no conceivable impact on whether witnesses with good character evidence came forward. In any case, there was already a substantial amount of character evidence, both good and bad, before the jury which was very favourably summarised by the trial judge (see paragraphs 31 and 40 above).",

In the present case, as explained above, the decision to hold part of the trial in camera met this requirement (see paragraphs 58-67 above). The decision to maintain the confidential nature of the in camera material in respect of the proceedings before this Court was reviewed, in proceedings in which the applicant participated, at three levels of jurisdiction (see paragraphs 38-43 above). The courts handed down judgments explaining clearly why the material should remain confidential and why they did not consider it appropriate to vary the order to allow disclosure to this Court. It is clear that, in contrast to Janowiec and Others, there was meaningful independent scrutiny of the asserted basis for the continuing need for confidentiality.",
