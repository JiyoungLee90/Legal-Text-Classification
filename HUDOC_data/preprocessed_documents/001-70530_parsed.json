Afraid that he would not get anything, Victor agreed to the sum of MDL 75. He later had his car fixed by some acquaintances, who laughed at him for being fooled like a boy. Victor spent a little bit more than MDL 200 for the repair \u2013 a sum that might seem ridiculous to some traffic inspectors. For Victor though, this is really big money. But it is not the money, that he\u2019s worried about, but the way he was treated at the Traffic Police Centre, in particular this Sergeant-Major Jora, who treated him as a man from the lowest strata, almost as a nonentity. After a few days Victor went to Jora and asked for his driver\u2019s licence back. The Sergeant-Major promised to return the driver\u2019s licence, but only on condition that Victor paid a fine of MDL 18. Victor was dumbfounded. \u2013 \u2018Why should I pay a fine? What did I do?\u2019 The Sergeant-Major, answered very furiously: \u2018Once I say that you should pay, then you should pay, without asking any questions.\u2019",

Ukraine, no. 72713/01, 29\u00a0March\u00a02005 in which the applicant was awarded EUR 33,000 for non-pecuniary damage.

Referring to the Busuioc case, in which the applicant was awarded EUR 4,000, she argued that in that case the Court found several interferences not to be in breach of Article 10 and, therefore, she was entitled to a higher award.",
