Having examined the specific conditions and procedures under which the State had alienated its assets to private individuals, the Court noted that they were within the State\u2019s exclusive competence and held that the defects in those procedures resulting in the loss by the State of its real property should not have been remedied at the expense of bona fide owners of the property. The Court further reasoned that such restitution of property to the State or municipality, in the absence of any compensation paid to the owner, imposed an individual and excessive burden on the latter and failed to strike a fair balance between the demands of the public interest on the one hand and the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions on the other.",

The Government\u2019s submissions remain silent, however, as to when and how the fraud had been discovered and why the authorities had failed to take necessary steps to prevent the fraudulent acquisition of the flats by the perpetrators. In this connection, the Court finds it striking that it took the City of Moscow over six years to institute a criminal investigation into A.\u2019s fraudulent actions (application no.\u00a07359/14). It is also a matter of concern for the Court that the state authorities condoned an unauthorized sale of the flat suspecting that it was subject to unlawful occupancy (application no.\u00a069173/14).",

Each time they were sold it was encumbered on the registration authorities to verify the legitimacy of the transaction. The Government, however, did not proffer any explanation, as to why those safeguards had not been effective in detecting fraud and protecting the interests of the municipalities. In such circumstances, the Court considers that it was not for the applicants to assume the risk of the title to the property being revoked on account of the said omissions on the part of the authorities in procedures specially designed to prevent fraud in real-property transactions. The Court reiterates that the consequences of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Stolyarova, cited above, \u00a7 49). The Court therefore concludes that the forfeiture of the title to the flats by the applicants and the transfer of the ownership of the flats to the municipality, in the circumstances of the case, placed a disproportionate and excessive burden on them. There has therefore been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",

Belgium (Article\u00a050), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85; Tchitchinadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a018156/05, \u00a7 69, 27 May 2010; Fener Rum Patrikli\u011fi (Ecumenical Patriarchy) v.  (just satisfaction), no. 14340/05, \u00a7 35, 15 June 2010, \u00a7\u00a0198; and Stoycheva v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 43590/04, 19 July 2011). Consequently, having due regard to its findings in the instant case and to the fact that the applicants did not receive compensation for loss of title to the flat in the domestic proceedings, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to restore the applicants\u2019 title to the flats and to annul the eviction orders. Thus, the applicants would be put as far as possible in a situation equivalent to the one in which they would have been had there not been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (compare, Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106). In the alternative, if the State no longer own the flats, or if they have been otherwise alienated, the Government should ensure that the applicants receive equivalent flats.",
