According to this tradition, which was comparable to a similar tradition in the armed forces, there was no appeal against a transfer decision. If an appeal were to be allowed, it would cause an unreasonable delay in the organisation of parish work. The Cathedral Chapter also reiterated that it was known to all parties in question that the applicant had not been able to discharge all his functions in the parish of Rovaniemi and that he had also faced disciplinary proceedings, resulting in a written warning. As the applicant had not denied this, the Cathedral Chapter found it undisputed that he was incapable of fulfilling his duties in the parish of Rovaniemi. The aim of the transfer was to avoid future disciplinary proceedings. Thus, it was also in the interests of the applicant that he be transferred. Moreover, there was a shortage of parish priests in the parish of Keminmaa. The Cathedral Chapter disputed the applicant\u2019s contention that he had a right to be heard on the reasons discussed when his transfer was being considered. It also contested that the presence of the Vicar of the parish of Rovaniemi had raised any disqualification issue. The vicar had not taken part in the decision-making.",

He pointed out that he could be removed only on grounds provided for by law and that the decision certainly concerned his rights.

The limitation of the right to appeal was not disproportionate to this aim.

It recalls that Article 6 \u00a7 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way the Article embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect only (see Golder v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no.18, p. 18, \u00a7 36).",

Article 6 \u00a7 1 will however apply to disputes of a \u201cgenuine and serious nature\u201d concerning the actual existence of a right as well as to the scope or manner in which it is exercised (see Benthem v. the Netherlands judgment of 23 October 1985, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a097, p. 15, \u00a7 32). In assessing therefore whether there is a civil \u201cright\u201d, the starting-point must be the provisions of the relevant domestic law and their interpretation by the domestic courts (see Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands, judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no.\u00a0327A, p. 19, \u00a7 49; Roche v. the  [GC], no.\u00a032555/96, \u00a7\u00a0120, ECHR 2005...). In carrying out this assessment, it is necessary to look beyond the appearances and the language used and to concentrate on the realities of the situation (see Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium, judgment of 24\u00a0June 1982, Series A no. 50, pp. 20-21, \u00a7 38; Roche v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 121).",

The transfer was based on the unilateral decision of the Cathedral Chapter against which no ordinary appeal lay. The applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal with the  with a view to having the decision set aside. Chapter 6, section 8a(6), of the Church Act makes the lawfulness of the measure in issue subject to only one condition: there has to be \u201ca justified reason\u201d for making such a decision (see paragraph 9 above). The transfer of parish priests is therefore a matter within the discretion of the Cathedral Chapter, a factor which argues against the existence of a \u201cright\u201d (compare and contrast De Moor v. Belgium, judgment of 23 June 1994, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0292A, \u00a7\u00a043).",

Firstly, the transfer of a parish priest\u2019s assignment may take place without his or her consent. Secondly, no appeal lay against a decision like the one in issue and it is clear that the legislator had not intended to provide for any judicial determination of the merits of grievances filed by clergymen wishing to contest the change of their place of service. It is to be noted in this latter connection that in the domestic proceedings, the Cathedral Chapter declared that it was an old tradition that a parish priest could be transferred to another parish with or without his consent, if the transfer was considered to be in the interests of the Church. The Court\u2019s conclusion regarding the non-existence of a substantive right is not affected by the limited review possibility offered by means of an extraordinary appeal. The Court also notes that the legislator has in 2003, albeit in connection with an amendment concerning posts in the National Ecclesiastical Board and the Cathedral Chapter, taken the opportunity to reaffirm that the Constitution does not require the availability of an appeal (see paragraph 31 above).",

It is independent in matters such as the appointment of its priests and the latter\u2019s service. The relevant legislation leaves it to the Church as employer to determine the period and place of pastoral activity. The Court notes that when accepting ecclesiastical employment, parish priests are aware of the possibility that they may later be transferred to another post. Hence, the applicant, by agreeing to serve as a parish priest within the Church, undertook to abide by the rules of his church incorporated in the Church Act and the Church Rules of Procedure.",

In that case, the Court concurred with the domestic courts\u2019 findings that the judicial determination of issues such as the continuation of a priest\u2019s service within a church would be contrary to the principles of autonomy and independence of churches guaranteed by, inter alia, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms.
