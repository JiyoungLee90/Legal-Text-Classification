It had concerned a dispute over the election results between Mr K. and the electoral commission; the applicant had been a third party to that dispute. The issues relating to defamation or compensation for non-pecuniary damage had not been examined in the judgment of 4 June 2002. The applicant further maintained that the defendants had submitted evidence proving the truthfulness of the contested allegations. In particular, the witnesses had confirmed that all the statements contained in the leaflet were true. The District Court\u2019s findings had been contradictory. In particular, although the District Court had found that Mr\u00a0K., being the majority shareholder of the Okrtyabrskiy department store, had influenced its policy, it had also found, conflictingly, that Mr K. had not been personally responsible for the impugned omissions.

It was clearly the subjective opinion of the signatories of the leaflet that Mr K. was unsuitable for election to the regional legislative assembly because he had, in their view, abused his influential position within the Oktyabrskiy department store and had treated the minority shareholders and employees of that store unfairly. That opinion was based on their own experience of dealing with Mr K. Their allegations that after the issue of additional shares at the initiative of Mr K. the stock had been depreciated, that Mr K. had offered to buy the shares of the minority shareholders at a low price, that several employees discontented with Mr\u00a0K.\u2019s policies and attitudes had been dismissed, and other similar allegations, found confirmation in the domestic proceedings. Accordingly, the signatories of the leaflet cannot be accused of having distorted the facts or made any allegations which did not repose on a sufficient factual basis. The Court sees no reason to doubt that they acted in good faith. It therefore considers that by publishing the leaflet the applicant was assisting in disseminating an opinion on a matter of public concern which had a sufficient factual basis.",

It is however necessary to bear in mind that political invective often spills over into the personal sphere; such are the hazards of politics and the free debate of ideas, which are the guarantees of a democratic society (see Lopes Gomes da Silva v. Portugal, no. 37698/97, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2000X). The Court accepts that certain expressions used in the leaflet could be considered to be polemical. They do not, however, amount to insult or constitute a gratuitous personal attack because the authors supported them with an objective explanation. Although the comments contained in the leaflet were without doubt severely critical, they nevertheless appear proportionate to the frustration and indignation caused by Mr K.\u2019s behaviour towards the signatories as perceived by them.",

The applicant\u2019s defence was therefore limited to the extracts mentioned by Mr K. in his statement of claim. The judgment of the first-instance court was also clearly confined to analysing the extracts contested by Mr K. The appeal court, however, chose to examine the entire leaflet and to declare that its contents were untrue. The Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s assertion that the appeal court did not go beyond Mr K.\u2019s claim. It notes that in its judgment the appeal court referred to statements which had not been mentioned in Mr K.\u2019s statement of claim, such as, for example, \u201cthe story of K[.]\u2019s dark fortune\u201d and \u201chis fortune was made from our tears\u201d, and found that they had damaged Mr K.\u2019s honour, dignity and professional reputation. The appeal court, moreover, stated explicitly that \u201cthe entire leaflet contain[ed] untrue statements\u201d and decided to increase the award accordingly (see paragraph 21 above). Given that under domestic law the courts might go beyond the scope of the plaintiff\u2019s claim only in cases specified in federal laws (see paragraph 29 above) and that the appeal court did not refer to any federal law that would give it power to do so in the present case, the Court considers that the decision of the appeal court to declare the entire leaflet untrue could hardly be foreseeable to the applicant. It is also relevant that the appeal court\u2019s judgment was final, there being no further ordinary instance before which the applicant could have advanced his defence against its findings. It follows that in respect of the statements which had not been mentioned in Mr K.\u2019s statement of claim, the applicant was afforded no opportunity at any stage of the proceedings to prove that they were true or had a sufficient factual basis.",

In particular, the domestic courts referred to the finding contained in the judgment of 4 June 2002 that the applicant had not proved the truthfulness of the extracts contested by Mr K. (see paragraphs 16 and 21 above). However, the Court takes note of the applicant\u2019s argument, not contested by the Government, that during the electoral dispute she had not been called upon to prove the truth of the allegations contained in the leaflet. Indeed, that dispute concerned the allegedly unlawful electoral agitation and, under domestic law, its scope was limited to determining whether the leaflet contained statements encouraging social, racial, ethnic or religious hatred or enmity, calling for the usurpation of power or forcible change of the constitutional foundations of the Russian Federation, or advocating war (see paragraph 23 above). The  stated specifically that all the issues relating to defamation had to be examined in separate proceedings (see paragraph 12 above). The Court is therefore persuaded that during the examination of the electoral dispute the applicant was not given a meaningful opportunity to prove the truth of the allegations published by her. It finds it peculiar that during the subsequent defamation proceedings the domestic courts found that the applicant was barred from arguing that her allegations had been true because she had failed to do so during the electoral proceedings. Owing to that finding, the applicant was deprived of any chance to show that the allegations contained in the leaflet had a sufficient factual basis.",

The Court therefore considers that the Russian courts did not adduce \u201csufficient\u201d reasons justifying the interference at issue and that they overstepped the narrow margin of appreciation afforded to them for placing restrictions on debates of public interest. Accordingly, the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression was disproportionate to the aim pursued and not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",
