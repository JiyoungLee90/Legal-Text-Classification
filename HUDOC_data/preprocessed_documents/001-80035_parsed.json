The Court furthermore cannot agree with the Government's assertion that the quality of the poppy-tar had been irrelevant for the applicant's conviction, as it concerned the corpus delicti of the offence. The Bureau drew up the expert report whose transmission to the public prosecutor set in motion the criminal proceedings against the applicant (see paragraph 12 above). As the expert opinion supported the prosecution's case and was used in evidence against the applicant, the defence requested the national courts to appoint another expert to determine the quality of the poppy-tar. This request was based on two grounds: first, that the disputed opinion subsequently set in motion the criminal proceedings against the applicant and, second, that the analysis had not been carried out properly. The courts refused the applicant's request as they found the Bureau's expert opinion conclusive.",

Austria, judgment of 6 May 1985, Series A no. 92, \u00a7\u00a032). Such apprehensions may have a certain importance, but are not decisive. What is decisive is whether the doubts raised by appearances can be held objectively justified (see Brandstetter v. Austria, judgment of 28\u00a0August 1991, Series A no. 211, \u00a7 44).

The Court observes that there is nothing in the case file to suggest that there was any involvement of a police officer acting as an agent provocateur or that without such intervention the offence would not have been committed. The national courts did not rely on any evidence or statements given by anonymous sources such as informants or agents provocateurs (see a contrario, Kostovski v. the Netherlands, judgment of 20\u00a0November 1989, Series A no. 166, \u00a7\u00a044; and Teixeira de Castro v.\u00a0Portugal, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV, \u00a7\u00a038). The Court further notes that even assuming that Mr N.N., the final buyer of the poppy-tar, was an undercover agent, it cannot be concluded that his involvement had any impact on the applicant's conduct. Nor could he have exercised an influence such as to incite the commission of the offence, as the applicant had already been involved at an earlier stage. In addition, the applicant did not even contact Mr N.N.: his role was over before the poppy-tar finally reached the alleged agent provocateur.",

Having regard to the fee note submitted by the applicant, the Court finds that EUR 310 related to the lawyer's fees for the preparation of the two requests for extraordinary mitigation of sentence and for an application for a stay of execution of the sentence. As these remedies could not prevent or rectify the violation found or provide the applicant with redress, the Court considers that they were not necessarily incurred; it therefore rejects the applicant's claim under this head. As to the remaining claims, it finds it difficult to assess which costs were incurred in order to seek prevention or redress before the national courts of the violation found by the Court. However, some of the lawyer's fees were undoubtedly expended with a view to obtaining an alternative expert opinion to counter the report provided by the Bureau or to limiting the effects of the violation.",
