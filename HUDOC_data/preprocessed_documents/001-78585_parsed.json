The failure of Moldtranselectro, which was a State company, to fulfil its obligations vis-\u00e0-vis the Ministry of Finance by presenting it with the documents required by the latter, could not affect the rights of the applicant company, which had paid for electricity supplied from Ukraine. It noted that the Treasury bond did not contain any provision making the payment dependent on the fulfilment of Moldtranselectro's obligations towards the Ministry of Finance. The court also noted that the applicant company had on many occasions asked the Ministry of Finance for payment, but that the Ministry had refused and had asked for the documents which should have been presented by Moldtranselectro. The court considered the Ministry of Finance's request to be unlawful and argued that, according to the law, it was Moldtranselectro that should have presented the documents.",

The charges against him were based on the fact that the energy supplied to Moldtranselectro, for which the applicant company had paid the Ukrainian private company, had not been consumed by state institutions. The prosecution argued that a Treasury bond could be issued by the Ministry of Finance only for energy supplied to state institutions. Contrary to that provision, Moldtranselectro had asked the Ministry of Finance on 25 March 1998 to issue a Treasury bond in favour of Oferta Plus and such a bond had been issued by the Ministry of Finance on 27 March 1998.",

The charge against C.T. was contrary to the principle nullum crimen sine lege, because at the time when the company had obtained MDL 5,000,000 and was claiming another MDL 15,000,000, the judgment of 27 October 1999 was in force. Accordingly, the claims of Oferta Plus were not fraudulent but based on a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice. Moreover, he was charged on the basis that the applicant company had not presented evidence that the energy supplied with its participation in 1997-98 had been consumed by state institutions. In this respect, the Treasury bond itself provided that it was for Moldtranselectro to present to the Ministry of Finance evidence concerning the electricity supplied and not for Oferta Plus. That view had been supported by the domestic courts in the proceedings which culminated in the final judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice of 10 February 2001.",
