In particular, the case had been very complex, involving examination of complicated issues of legal succession and inheritance. The proceedings had been further complicated by the claimant\u2019s death. The domestic courts had needed additional time to identify the heirs and invite the legal successors to participate in the proceedings. Furthermore, an aggregated delay of over two years had been caused by the three expert examinations authorised at the parties\u2019 request. In the Government\u2019s opinion, the applicant and her representatives had also added to the length of the proceedings by failing to attend four hearings and asking for an adjournment of an additional three hearings to enable additional evidence to be obtained.

However, in violation of the domestic legal norms, it had taken the experts over a year and five months and over seven months respectively to perform the second and third expert examinations.

Furthermore, the Government did not explain why it had been necessary to stay the proceedings for the second time in June 2005, allegedly to identify the claimant\u2019s heirs, when the proceedings had previously been stayed for more than six months for the identical purpose (see paragraphs 11 and 15 above).",
