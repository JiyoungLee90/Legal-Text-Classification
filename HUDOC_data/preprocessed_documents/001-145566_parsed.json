The rule is based on the assumption that the domestic system provides an effective remedy in respect of the alleged breach. The burden of proof is on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that an effective remedy was available in theory and in practice at the relevant time; that is to say, that the remedy was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see, inter alia, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV; Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a056581/00, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2006-II; and Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.)

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of the individual case. This means, amongst other things, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7 69, and Selmouni v.

As noted above, there are no objective criteria for one\u02bcs ethnic affiliation (see paragraph 8 above). It depends solely on one\u02bcs own self-classification. There may be different reasons for not declaring affiliation with any particular group, such as for example intermarriage or mixed parenthood or simply that the applicant wished to declare herself as a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina. While it is not clear what the present applicant\u2019s reasons are, the Court considers them in any case irrelevant.

The Committee of Ministers adopted three interim resolutions urging the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to take all the necessary steps for the full execution of that judgment by adopting necessary measures aimed at eliminating discrimination against those who are not affiliated with a constituent people in standing for election to the House of Peoples and the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to bring its constitution and electoral legislation in conformity with the Convention requirements without any further delay (see paragraph 12 above; see also Resolutions nos. 1701(2010), 1725(2010) and 1855(2012) and Recommendation no. 2025(2013) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe).

In that judgment, the Court proceeded in four steps. Firstly, it analysed the powers of the House of Peoples of Bosnia and Hercegovina and emphasised their broad scope (paragraph 41). Secondly, given the broad scope of the powers enjoyed by this parliamentary chamber, it concluded that elections to it fell within the scope of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. Thirdly, the Court verified whether the applicants\u2019 continued ineligibility to stand for election to the House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina had an objective and reasonable justification. Fourthly, after carrying out an analysis of Bosnian law, it concluded that \u201cthe applicants\u2019 continued ineligibility to stand for election to the House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina lack[ed] an objective and reasonable justification and ha[d] therefore breached Article\u00a014 taken in conjunction with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1\u201d (see paragraph 50 of the Sejdi\u0107 and Finci judgment).",

I am not persuaded that the wording of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 justifies accepting these assumptions as the necessary legal consequences of this provision.

One of the possible justifications for a second chamber is to correct representational shortcomings in the first chamber. Constitution-makers may therefore devise a second chamber ensuring representation of special interests and opt for an electoral system which gives a stronger voice to certain social groups.

It is also completely different from the wording of Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states that \u201cevery citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in Article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions ... to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors\u201d.",

There can be no doubt that free elections to the legislature refers to universal suffrage, understood as a lack of unreasonable restrictions on the right to vote and on the right to be elected. At the same time, democratic European constitutionalism has accepted certain inherent limitations on the scope of those rights. Electoral rights in respect of parliament are to be granted to adult citizens and do not necessarily encompass incapacitated persons or persons deprived of their right to vote in connection with a criminal conviction. Further restrictions and qualifications may be acceptable in the elections to the second chamber of parliaments.",

I agree that the distribution of legislative powers between the chambers of a national parliament is an important parameter from the perspective of this provision. If the second chamber has only limited powers, and if its opposition may be overcome by the first chamber, then the freedom to shape the method of selecting its members is extremely wide. If, however, the second chamber enjoys legislative powers equal to those of the first, then the scope of constitutional autonomy left to the States in shaping the method of selecting the members of the second chamber is much more restricted. However, I am not persuaded that in such a situation Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 not only imposes an obligation to elect the second chamber, but also lays down the same standards for such an election as for elections to the first chamber.",

Belgium, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 53, Series A no.\u00a0113)\u201d. Furthermore, in my view, if Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 allows a method of selecting the members of the second chamber other than through election by citizens, we can derive from this provision neither a subjective right to vote nor a subjective right to stand in elections to this chamber. In the absence of a right protected by the Convention and its Protocols, Article\u00a014 is not applicable. This latter provision cannot apply to a right to stand for election to the second chamber which is enshrined only in domestic legislation.",

The provision in question requires that the constitutional system as a whole complies with the following standard. Free and direct elections to the first chamber, coupled with the adopted system of choosing the members of the second chamber, should ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature. As mentioned above, this general assessment has to take account, among other things, of the scope of the powers enjoyed by each chamber of the national parliament. The constitutional architecture should enable citizens to determine the political orientation of the legislative power, considered as a whole.",
