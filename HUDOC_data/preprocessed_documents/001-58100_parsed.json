The Federal Court has proceeded in a similar manner: leaving aside exceptional cases, it will regard an appeal against detention as having become devoid of purpose and strike it out of its list if the applicant has been released during the Federal Court proceedings ... The justification it gives for this case-law is that in such a case there is no longer a live practical interest in securing a decision on the appeal against detention, even in respect of any claims for compensation and satisfaction ... These considerations are applicable also in relation to cantonal appeal proceedings.

Quite clearly, he would not have been able to do so where the detention lasted, as in Lucerne, for four or five days; but the length of his detention elsewhere, as in Glarus, St Gall and the Canton of Aargau for eleven, eighteen and ten days respectively, would perhaps have given him enough time at least to institute such proceedings.
