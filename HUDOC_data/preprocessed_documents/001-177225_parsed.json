While he had known that an appeal had been lodged, he had not been sent a copy and had reasonably expected to be informed of the \u201chearing\u201d date and be invited to submit his objections.

The applicant alleged, and the Government did not contest, that he received no response (see paragraph 7 above). Admittedly, the nature of his request to the Court of Appeal demonstrated a certain confusion on his part as to the procedural rules applicable to his case, since he was seeking to obtain the \u201cdate of the hearing\u201d in his case, which was non-existent given that his case had been examined at first instance in accordance with the rules of abridged procedure (see paragraph 5 above) and the Court of Appeal was likely to examine, and in fact did examine, his case in camera without a hearing. However, the applicant\u2019s request was sufficient to alert the Court of Appeal that he was unaware of the progress of the proceedings in his case and was seeking this information.
