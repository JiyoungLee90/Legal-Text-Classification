It attached importance to the serious nature of those offences and the likelihood of a severe prison sentence being imposed on the applicant. In this connection the court noted that the applicant had admitted to having committed some of the offences of which he had been suspected, including incitement to murder. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might go into hiding. As regards the latter, the court relied on the fact that he did not have a permanent place of residence in  and that he had already been hiding from the police. Finally, the court underlined that the applicant was a member of an organised criminal group and that some other members of that group were still at large which increased the risk that a detainee, if released, might obstruct the proceedings.",

The Court acknowledges that the seriousness and the nature of the accusations against the applicant could initially warrant his detention. The Court also notes that the latter was amplified by the fact that during the preliminary stage of the domestic proceedings the applicant admitted to having committed some of the offences of which he had been suspected (see paragraph 7 above). It was therefore reasonable to believe for the authorities extending the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention that a severe sentence could be imposed on him. Further, in the Court\u2019s view, the fact that the case concerned a member of a criminal group should be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 (see B\u0105k v. Poland, no. 7870/04, \u00a7\u00a057, 16 January 2007).",

The Court reiterates that, while the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself justify long periods of pre-trial detention (see Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02, \u00a7\u00a049, 4 May 2006).",

In this regard, the Court reiterates that the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the alleged criminal activities of the applicant may be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings (see G\u00f3rski v. Poland, no. 28904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4 October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent extensions of the detention (see Celejewski, cited above, \u00a7 37). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present one concerning organised criminal groups, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-accused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is in the nature of things often particularly high.",

The Court is of the opinion that there was objectively a substantial risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding which persisted throughout his pre-trial detention. This risk was confirmed by a number of relevant factors, such as the fact that the applicant was a foreigner and did not have a permanent place of residence in , lacking social links to or property in the country. It was therefore reasonable to assume that the applicant would be under considerable pressure to evade trial, especially in light of the heavy prison sentence to which he was liable. In view of the above, the Court is persuaded that the danger of absconding constituted, in the particular circumstances of the present case, a relevant and sufficient ground for refusing the applicant\u2019s applications for release and to remand him in custody for the relevant period (see, mutatis mutandis, Van der Tang v.\u00a0Spain, 13 July 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 64-67, Series A no. 321).",
