The repetition of those remittal orders discloses a serious deficiency in the criminal investigation (see Oleynikova v. Ukraine, no. 38765/05, \u00a7\u00a081, 15 December 2011). It is relevant to note that in quashing the sixth decision terminating the investigation, the domestic court found that there remained serious contradictions in the case file which had not been removed despite numerous orders given to the investigators dealing with the case.

The Court reiterates that the effectiveness of an investigation implies a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition. Even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see \u0160ilih v.
