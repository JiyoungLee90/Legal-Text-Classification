Such a remedy can, in principle, be both preventive and compensatory in nature. Where the applicant has already resorted to either of the available and relevant remedies, considering it to be the most appropriate course of action in his or her particular situation, the applicant should not then be reproached for not having pursued an alternative remedial course of action (see, mutatis mutandis, Melnik v.

Those requests, in the Court\u2019s view, clearly voiced the first applicant\u2019s fears for his life (see and compare with Dybeku v.\u00a0Albania, no. 41153/06, \u00a7 28, 18 December 2007, and Makharadze and Sikharulidze v.

Nonetheless, the first applicant continued to be detained even after the prosecution had agreed to his release given the gravity of his health condition (see paragraphs 39-40 above). Neither was he released after the verdict had been pronounced in his case with the penalty being limited to a fine and not providing for any custodial sentence (see paragraph 47 above). His mother, the second applicant, could only passively witness this in a state of complete helplessness. Furthermore, her complaints about the underestimation of the seriousness of her son\u2019s condition were disregarded, even though later they were found to be well-grounded (see paragraphs 33, 69 and 74 above). The Court does not lose sight either of the second applicant\u2019s fruitless efforts to get the handcuffing of her son\u2019s lifted during his stay in hospital (see paragraphs 49-50 above). Lastly, the Court observes that even after the death of the first applicant, the authorities manifested an equally unacceptable attitude towards the second applicant, in particular, by ignoring her requests to get access to her son\u2019s medical file (see paragraphs 63, 66 and 191 above).",
