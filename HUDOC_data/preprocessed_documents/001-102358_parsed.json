Spain, 23 April 1992, \u00a7 48, Series A no. 236). It considers that, in requiring the applicant to prove the truth of the statements made in the article while at the same time depriving it of an effective opportunity to adduce evidence to support those statements and thereby show that they constituted fair comment, the domestic courts overstepped their margin of appreciation (see Jerusalem, cited above, \u00a7 46).",

The Court can accept this argument in principle as it has repeatedly attached particular importance to the duties and responsibilities of those who avail themselves of their right to freedom of expression, and in particular, of journalists (see Jersild, cited above, \u00a7 31, and Prager and Oberschlick, cited above, \u00a7 37). However, in the circumstances of the present case the Court finds no indication of such deliberate carelessness on the part of the applicant. It rather appears that Mr\u00a0E.P.'s statements did not constitute a gratuitous personal attack as they were made in a particular political situation in which they contributed to a discussion on a subject of general interest such as the use made of budgetary funds (see, mutatis mutandis, Unabh\u00e4ngige Initiative Informationsvielfalt v.\u00a0, no. 28525/95, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2002I).",

The Court reiterates in this respect that the degree of precision for establishing the well-foundedness of a criminal charge by a competent court can hardly be compared to that which ought to be observed by a journalist when expressing his opinion on a matter of public concern, in particular when expressing his opinion in the form of a value judgment (see Unabh\u00e4ngige Initiative Informationsvielfalt, cited above, \u00a7 46). The standards applied when assessing a public official's activities in terms of morality are different from those required for establishing an offence under criminal law (see Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v. , no. 39394/98, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2003XI). Therefore, the Court is reluctant to follow the logic implied in the district court's reasoning that in the absence of criminal prosecution of the plaintiffs no media could have published an article linking them to instances of alleged misuse of public funds without running the risk of being successfully sued for defamation.",

Therefore, having regard to the fact that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest (see, among other authorities, S\u00fcrek, cited above, \u00a7 61, and Guja v.
