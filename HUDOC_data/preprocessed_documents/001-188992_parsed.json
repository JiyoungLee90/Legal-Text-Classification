The reason was that the events at the origin of the present application had taken place many years earlier and the final domestic judicial decision had been that of the SCC of 24 March 2009. Thereafter, bona fides third parties might have acquired property rights over the estate in question and a reopening of the proceedings as a result of the Court\u2019s judgment would pose a threat to their lawfully acquired rights. Also, given the lapse of time, it was highly likely that the files of this case were either archived or even destroyed. The Government underlined that reopening of proceedings which had ended with a final judgment had to be distinguished according to the type of proceedings: in that sense, in the criminal or administrative law context one of the parties was always the State or an administrative authority and therefore the risk of interfering with bona fides third parties\u2019 rights was minimal.",

The new interpretative decision adopted by the SCC in the meantime had changed the scope of the term \u201cheir-at-law\u201d to exclude the applicant\u2019s uncle from that category. That new interpretation had not only prevented the applicant from having his claim determined by a court, but it also had become an unsurmountable obstacle to any future attempts on his part to recover his reserved share, given that the time-limit for preparing an \u201cinventory\u201d had long expired (see Petko Petkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 14).",

Consequently, it was impossible for her to have complied with that newly adopted procedural requirement, given that the applicable law only gave applicants three (at the most six) months to resort to an \u201cinventory\u201d, counted from the moment of learning about the death of the relative whose heirs they were. The applicant\u2019s grandfather had died more than two years before the adoption of the interpretative decision in question.

They explained that that was not the case in the applicant\u2019s situation given that, if a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 were established by the Court, the applicant was entitled under national law to seek reopening of the proceedings, following which the national courts would decide on her claim.
