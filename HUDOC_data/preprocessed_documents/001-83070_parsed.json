The first period began when the person was arrested or detained and ended on the day when the prosecution authorities finalised the investigation and sent the criminal case file, along with the bill of indictment, to the competent court for trial. Such an understanding of the procedural law was explicitly acknowledged by the Constitutional Court which, furthermore, clearly stated that the constitutional time-limit of nine months applied solely to the period of detention \u201cpending investigation\u201d (see paragraph 34 above). The Court reiterates, in this regard, that it is not its task to take the place of the Constitutional Court and interpret the Georgian Constitution or to call into question the Constitutional Court\u2019s findings (see Apostol v. , no.\u00a040765/02, \u00a7\u00a039, ECHR 2006...).",

This consideration was, in any case, palliated by the two-tier system of detention review: the applicant and his lawyer had another opportunity, on 13 May 2004, to question on appeal the prosecutor\u2019s motion in the light of all the relevant circumstances of the case. Moreover, since the proceedings of 8 and 13 May 2004 both took place at oral hearings attended by the applicant and his advocates, they had ample opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the prosecutor\u2019s submissions (see, Galuashvili, decision cited above; Schiesser v.\u00a0Switzerland, judgment of 4 December 1979, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a034, p.\u00a013, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03031). In these circumstances, the Court does not find any appearance of a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention in this respect.",

A court decision of that kind would need a more solid basis to show not only that there was genuinely \u201ca reasonable suspicion\u201d, but also that there were other serious elements of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighed the right to liberty (see, amongst others, Lavents v.

Such an approach was apparently envisaged by Article 151 \u00a7 3 in fine of the CCP but, in the Court\u2019s view, it cannot be justified under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Rokhlina\u00a0v.
