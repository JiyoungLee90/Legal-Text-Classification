The Court accepts the Government\u2019s argument that at the investigation stage there were no grounds for the domestic authorities to arrange for such possibility since G. and H. were interrogated by the police as co-suspects of the applicant. It further shares the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s view, as reflected in its decision of 16\u00a0August 2004, that it had not been foreseeable for the domestic authorities that G. and H. would subsequently refuse to answer questions of the defence when examined in court in their capacity as witnesses.",

The latter had, in any event, explicitly refused to answer any further questions by the trial court itself. The Court recalls in this context that it has recognised that, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6 (see Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996, \u00a7 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996VI). The Court further finds it relevant to note that it had been in particular the allegations by the applicant and another accused in the course of the trial, indicating that the witnesses had been involved in the events at issue, that were at the origin of the court\u2019s decision to grant the latter the right not to answer questions of the applicant and defence counsel.",

It therefore shares the Government\u2019s view that the interests of justice were obviously in favour of admitting G. and H.\u2019s testimony since otherwise any further prosecution of the accused police officers would have de facto been blocked. It is also recalled in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly and in particular whether the defendant\u2019s rights have not been unacceptably restricted and that he or she remains able to participate effectively in the proceedings (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, \u00a7 83, 16\u00a0December 1999 and Stanford v. the United Kingdom, 23 February 1994, \u00a7 26, Series A no.\u00a0282A).",

The trial court further observed that the witnesses had plausible reasons for their decision not to answer questions by the defence. The Court considers that the arguments advanced by the domestic courts in this respect were not immaterial for their conclusion that the testimonies given by G. and H. were credible and consistent to the extent they concerned the circumstances of the victim\u2019s ill-treatment (see De Lorenzo v.

While such elements of evidence taken separately may not have been conclusive for the charges the applicant was found guilty of, these items taken together and in combination with the further factual evidence secured at the crime scene as well as the expert opinions and medical diagnosis specifying the victim\u2019s injuries, nevertheless corroborated G. and H.\u2019s testimonies.

The Court finds that there is nothing to establish that the assessment of the evidence by the domestic courts in the case at hand was arbitrary or that the reasons advanced for their conclusion that there had been a causal connection between the victim\u2019s ill-treatment and his subsequent death in hospital, infringed the principle of in dubio pro reo.",
