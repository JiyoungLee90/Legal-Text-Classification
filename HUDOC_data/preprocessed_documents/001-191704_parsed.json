Russia, no. 14800/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a095-96, 4 December 2008; Dangayeva and Taramova v. Russia, no.\u00a01896/04, \u00a7 83, 8 January 2009; Khachukayev v.

The applicant\u2019s husband was killed in an area that was under the full control of the State, and the manner in which the killing was carried out showed that the perpetrators were not afraid of drawing the attention of the local law-enforcement agencies; what is more, they did not hesitate to open fire on the eyewitnesses (see paragraphs 7, 10, 11 and 51 above). From the documents submitted it can be seen that eyewitnesses maintained that Vakhid Magamedov had been killed by State agents, and the domestic investigation did not duly examine any other theories on the perpetrators\u2019 possible identities, and even obtained concordant witness statements, which it did not, for some reason, investigate further (see paragraphs 10, 13 and 14 above).",

Russia, nos.\u00a02944/06 and 4 others, \u00a7 217, 18 December 2012). In the cases at hand, even though the incidents concerned the killing of the applicant\u2019s husband, the Court observes a number of similar defects rendering the criminal proceedings in question ineffective. The investigation has been ongoing for a number of years without attaining any tangible results, despite the existence of evidence implicating the State agents (see paragraphs 10, 11, 13 and 14 above), as alleged by the applicant. However, the investigators failed to verify the allegations of the involvement of federal servicemen and identify and question the policemen who \u2013 according to the eyewitnesses \u2013 had directly spoken with the servicemen implicated in the killing of Mr\u00a0Magamedov (see, for example, paragraphs 7, 8, 10, 39 and 52 above). It is noteworthy that the first real step in this direction was taken only in November 2014 \u2013 that is to say more than eight years after the beginning of the investigation. Furthermore, the contents of the investigation file, as submitted to the Court, show that the investigators failed to take the most basic steps, systematically failing to comply with repeated orders from their superiors (see paragraphs 23, 36, 44 and 55 above). Taking those steps would have played an important role in elucidating the circumstances of the crime. The investigators\u2019 reluctance to take them led to the loss of precious time and negatively affected the overall conduct of the criminal proceedings (see, for example, Askhabova v. Russia, no. 54765/09, \u00a7 153, 18 April 2013). In such circumstances, the Court does not find it necessary to examine whether the investigation was sufficiently independent.",

Therefore, it is highly doubtful that any further court appeals by the applicant against the investigators\u2019 decisions or inaction would have had any prospects of effectively influencing its conduct.
