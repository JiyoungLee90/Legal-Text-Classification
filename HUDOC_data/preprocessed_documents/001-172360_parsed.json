In the same way as material goods, certain other rights and interests constituting assets can also be regarded as \u201cproperty rights\u201d and thus as \u201cpossessions\u201d for the purposes of this provision (see Iatridis v.

Thus, an individual can own a building while the land remains in State or municipal ownership (see Akhverdiyev v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a076254/11, \u00a7 76, 29 January 2015). However, in accordance with Article\u00a0243.1 of the Civil Code, domestic law automatically grants a right of use over a plot of land owned by another person to the owner of immovable property located on the land (ibid.; see also paragraph 30 above). Article 4.4 of the Land Code provided that immovable property and the land underneath it were \u201cinseparable\u201d in market circulation (see paragraph 24 above). It follows from the above-mentioned provisions, as well as a number of other provisions of the domestic law (see paragraphs 23, 33 and 34 above) that the new owner of an immovable property transferred into private ownership had the right to either purchase, lease or use the land underneath it.",
