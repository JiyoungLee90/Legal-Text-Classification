However, the Court notes that Turkish law makes no provision for a union outside civil marriage which has a basis in law and creates a civil partnership allowing two persons of the same or opposite sex to enjoy rights identical or similar to those granted to married couples. Given the margin of appreciation left to the Contracting Parties to the Convention in the matter, the Court cannot require them to legislate in a sphere such as this. In the instant case, according to the domestic law in force, a religious marriage (imam nikah) celebrated by an imam does not entail any undertakings vis\u00e0-vis third parties or the State. Irrespective of the applicant\u2019s arguments, the decisive factor is not the length or mutually supportive nature of the relationship, but the existence of an undertaking carrying with it a body of rights and obligations of a contractual nature. In the absence of a binding legal agreement, it is not unreasonable for the Turkish legislature to afford protection solely to civil marriages. Thus, the Court points out that it has already found that marriage remains an institution that is widely accepted as conferring a particular status on those who enter it (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, \u00a7 65, 29 April 2008, and Shackell v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 45851/99, 27 April 2000).

The Court has, indeed, frequently had occasion to observe that the notion of family life encompasses both marriage-based relationships and other de facto relationships (see Merger and Cros v. France, no.\u00a068864/01, \u00a7 44, 22 December 2004) and that de facto situations may lead it to recognise the existence of conventional family life in the absence of legal ties. Factors to be taken into consideration in this connection include whether the couple live together, the length of their relationship and, in general terms, any factors which demonstrate their commitment to each other, such as their having had children together (see Al-Nashif v. , no. 50963/99, \u00a7 112, 20 June 2002).

Hence, it would have been possible to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 taken in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention. In that connection, we would point to the Court\u2019s very solid case-law on the subject of discrimination in the social security sphere based on nationality (see, among other authorities, Gaygusuz v.
