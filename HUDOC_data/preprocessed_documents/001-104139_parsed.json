Principles of the rule of law must be accepted by every member of the Council of Europe pursuant to Article 3 of its Statute which has been ratified by all High Contracting Parties to the Convention. One of the aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty which presupposes respect for the principle of res judicata. This principle underlines that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination (see Ryabykh v.\u00a0Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52, ECHR 2003-IX).",

In particular, higher courts' power to quash binding and enforceable judicial decisions should be used only for correction of fundamental defects committed by the lower courts (see Protsenko v.
