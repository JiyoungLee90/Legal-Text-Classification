The case originated in an application (no. 2765/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Aligül Alkaya (“the applicant”), on 23 December 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr F.N. Ertekin and Mr K. Öztürk, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 11 December 2009 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1967 and was detained at the Tekirdağ Ftype prison when the application was lodged.
On 9 April 2003 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist organisation.
On 13 April 2003 the applicant was brought before the judge at the Istanbul State Security Court who placed him in detention on remand taking into consideration the nature of the offence, and the state of evidence.
On 23 July 2003 the Istanbul public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Istanbul State Security Court, charging the applicant with membership of a terrorist organisation, and attempting to undermine the constitutional order of the Republic of Turkey by force. The criminal proceedings against the applicant commenced.
On 10 November 2008 the court held a further hearing, in which both the applicant and his lawyer were present. At the end of that hearing, the court ordered the continuation of the applicant’s detention.
On 10 November 2008 the applicant’s lawyer filed an objection against this decision. On 27 November 2008 the 13th Chamber of the Istanbul Assize Court dismissed the objection without holding a hearing. In delivering its decision, the court took into consideration the written opinion of the public prosecutor, which had not been communicated to the applicant or his representative.
On 4 May 2011 the Istanbul Assize Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to life imprisonment.
On 25 September 2012 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.
