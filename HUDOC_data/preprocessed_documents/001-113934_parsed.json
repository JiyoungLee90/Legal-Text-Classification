And in civil matters one can scarcely conceive of the rule of law without access to the courts being possible (see, among many other authorities, Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 January 1975, \u00a7\u00a7 34 in fine and 35-36, Series A no. 18; Z. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a029392/95, \u00a7\u00a7 9193, ECHR 2001-V; and Kreuz, cited above, \u00a7 52).",

Where the individual\u2019s access is limited, either by operation of law or in fact, the Court will examine whether the limitation imposed impaired the essence of the right and, in particular, whether it pursued a legitimate aim and whether there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0May 1985, \u00a7 57, Series A no. 93; Zwi\u0105zek Nauczycielstwa Polskiego v.\u00a0Poland, no. 42049/98, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2004IX; and Szwagrun-Baurycza v.\u00a0Poland, no. 41187/02, \u00a7 49, 24 October 2006).
