He put him back in the cell naked and handcuffed him lying on the floor, with his hands secured behind his back. The applicant spent two to three hours like this.

The doctor was of the opinion that the injuries to the applicant\u2019s body were consistent with the blows described by him. In his view, these injuries amounted to intermediate bodily harm within the meaning of the 1968 Criminal Code (see paragraph 25 below) and were the result of a number of blows made with considerable strength and causing pain for prolonged periods of time.",

The injuries were noted by a medical doctor two days after his release, and were apparently visible on photographs taken one day after his release (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). Where a person, when taken in custody, is in good health, but is found to be injured at the time of release \u2013 as in the case at hand \u2013, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation how these injuries were caused (see, among many other authorities, Tomasi v. France, judgment of 27 August 1992, Series A no. 241A, pp. 4041, \u00a7\u00a7 10811; Selmouni v.

Neither the domestic authorities nor the Government in the proceedings before the Court tried to provide such an explanation, or to produce appropriate evidence that could cast doubt on the account given by the applicant. On the contrary, the decisions of the prosecution authorities make it clear that the guards had used force to restrain the applicant.

On this point, the Court observes that they were numerous and widespread. While some of them \u2013 for instance, those to his back and forearms \u2013 may have been the inevitable result of the guards\u2019 effort to make him drop the piece of glass and immobilise him, a number of others \u2013 for instance, those to his thorax, flanks, buttocks, thighs and legs \u2013 appear to be the result of random blows, probably with truncheons, made with considerable force (see paragraph 16 above). According to the applicant\u2019s uncontroverted account, most of these blows were administered while he was lying defenceless on the ground after being subdued. The Court therefore finds that the force used against him was clearly excessive, both in intensity and duration. According to its settled caselaw, any recourse to physical force in respect of a person deprived of his liberty which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Ribitsch v. Austria, judgment of 4\u00a0December 1995, Series A no. 336, p. 26, \u00a7 38; and Toteva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055).",

Secondly, no medical documents were gathered and no medical doctors \u2013 for instance, first lieutenant N.T. and doctor K., who examined the applicant while he was in custody (see paragraph 14 above) \u2013 were interviewed either. Thirdly, the investigation did not comprehensively account for all of the applicant\u2019s numerous and widespread injuries. They were not even mentioned by the prosecutors of the Sofia Regional Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Military Appellate Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The prosecutor at the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor\u2019s Office described them, but surmised, without giving any reasons, that all of them could have been the result of the applicant\u2019s being restrained or to a beating by his cellmates. Finally, the prosecution authorities\u2019 decisions did not even mention the alleged beating on 28 May 1999 (see paragraphs 1719 above).",
