The Government specified that while there was no indication that the length of the proceedings in connection with the applicant\u2019s administrative appeal and the proceedings before the Federal Administrative Court failed to comply with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, there had indeed been delays of in total three years and one month in the proceedings attributable to the Dresden Administrative Court, a delay of eighteen months following the applicant\u2019s application to be granted leave to appeal with the Saxon Administrative Court of Appeal and another period of at least fifteen months and three weeks attributable to this court during the subsequent appeal proceedings. However, the regrettable length of the proceedings had not only been due to the complexity of the case that had required the taking of several expert opinions with sometimes divergent results but in particular to an exceptional workload of the Dresden Administrative Court and the Saxon Administrative Court of Appeal as a consequence of subsisting staff shortages in the administrative court system in Saxony that had been newly established following German reunification.",

As to the conduct of the proceedings, the Court accepts that there is no indication that the length of the proceedings in connection with the applicant\u2019s administrative appeal and the proceedings before the Federal Administrative Court failed to comply with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Court further accepts that the proceedings were of some complexity and necessitated the taking of several expert opinions at different levels of jurisdiction. However, these difficulties do not explain the considerable periods of inactivity by the  and the Saxon Administrative Court of Appeal which are not contested by the Government. In this connection the Court also takes note of the Government\u2019s submissions that the  and the Saxon Administrative Court of Appeal were subject to an overload of work as a consequence of subsisting staff shortages in the newly constructed administrative court system in Saxony following German reunification. The Court recalls in this respect that it is for the Contracting States to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can guarantee to everyone the right to a final decision within a reasonable time in the determination of his or her civil rights and obligations (see Frydlender, cited above, \u00a7 45). While acknowledging that a temporary backlog of court business may not entail a Contracting State\u2019s international liability if that State takes appropriate remedial action with the requisite promptness (see Klein v. Germany, no. 33379/96, \u00a7 43, 27 July 2000), the Court nevertheless notes that the applicant in the instant case first had recourse to the domestic courts in March 1996, more than five years after the reunification treaty entered into force. The proceedings lasted until 2006 and, as conceded by the Government, delays attributable to the domestic courts have repeatedly occurred throughout this period. The Court reiterates in this context that according to its established case-law, a chronic overload of court business cannot justify an excessive length of proceedings (see Gast and Popp v. Germany, no. 29357/95, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2000II).",
