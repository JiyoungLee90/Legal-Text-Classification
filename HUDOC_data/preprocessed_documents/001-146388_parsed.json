On Sunday, 28 June 2009, at approximately 9 a.m. Mr\u00a0Z.\u00a0Kh. had taken the GAZ-3102 to the service station for repair.

At approximately 4.30 p.m. Mr\u00a0S.\u00a0Kh. had gone outside and had seen three cars near Mr\u00a0Z.\u00a0Kh.\u2019s house: a silver Lada Priora and two white VAZ-2107s. In the yard of the house there had been about ten armed men, aged between twenty-five and thirty years old, wearing camouflage uniform. They had not been wearing masks and had appeared to be of Chechen ethnic origin. At the time there had been no one in Mr\u00a0Z.\u00a0Kh.\u2019s house because his wife and children had gone to visit relatives. When Mr S.\u00a0Kh. approached the armed men, they had not offered any explanation and had forbidden him to come closer to his son\u2019s house, threatening him with automatic weapons. Mr S.\u00a0Kh. had called the local ROVD and informed them of the situation. About thirty minutes later the armed men had left, taking Mr\u00a0Z.\u00a0Kh.\u2019s Toyota Camry with them. Five or ten minutes later a man who had introduced himself as B. had called Mr\u00a0S.\u00a0Kh.\u2019s other son, Mr\u00a0Sh., and had told him to come to a certain junction to fetch his brother\u2019s car.

The guards had been armed with automatic weapons, had been of Chechen origin and had spoken in Chechen to the staff of the hospital and to the patient. They had treated the patient correctly and had done most of the everyday care, such as changing, washing and feeding the patient; the doctors and nurses had not spoken to him, had had very little contact with him and, if at all, it had always been in the presence of the guards. Some doctors and nurses were asked if they would be able to describe or identify the guards, or to identify or sketch the patient, but they responded in the negative.

The men had been dressed in camouflage uniforms bearing the Ministry of the Interior insignia and were armed with Kalashnikov automatic rifles and hand pistols. They had said that they worked for the ROVD, and Mr Rizvan Kh. assumed that they meant the Achkhoy-Martan ROVD. The men had brought in a wounded man, aged around 29, about 170 cm tall, dark-skinned, dark haired. He had a gunshot wound to the right leg, a piercing wound to the abdomen and a head trauma. His wounds had been operated on, and a neurosurgical team from Grozny had been called in to treat his head trauma. The armed guards had forbidden the hospital personnel, including the director, to talk to the patient. The hospital director had presumed that the patient was employed by the security services, perhaps by the Achkhoy-Martan ROVD, since at that time a number of servicemen were being treated at the hospital. For this reason, he had not passed on information about the patient to the police. At about 4 p.m. on 7 July 2009 the guards had removed the patient from the hospital without any warning.

He had then taken the driver outside and made him lie down on the ground. Mr M. could hear screaming in Chechen outside and from the talking of approximately six armed men he had grasped that they were tying down a guy who was resisting them. The man in the black uniform had returned and asked for a piece of wire. Mr M. had understood that the men had used it to tie the hands of the passenger in the GAZ-3102 car. At some point he had heard two shots. The men then left in two white Lada Priora cars, taking with them both the passenger and the driver. Later, officers from the checkpoint near the service station had removed the GAZ-3102 car. Later that day and the following day, law-enforcement officers, including investigators, had come to the station and questioned Mr M. about those events. Mr M. would not have been able to identify the passenger, having noted only that he must have been twenty-eight to thirty years old. However, he would probably have been able to identify the driver, whom he described in detail. He might also have been able to identify the man in black uniform.

Despite the introduction of such measures of a systemic, legislative and regulatory nature, the information gathered during the visit had led the Commissioner to conclude that the situation had remained essentially unchanged in practice since his previous visit in September 2009.

Applying the above-mentioned principles, it has concluded that it would be sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case of abduction of the missing persons by servicemen, thus falling within the control of the authorities, and it would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof, either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, among many examples, Aziyevy v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7626/01, \u00a7 74, 20 March 2008; Utsayeva and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 29133/03, \u00a7 160, 29 May 2008; and Khutsayev and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a016622/05, \u00a7 104, 27 May 2010). If the Government failed to rebut this presumption, that would entail a violation of Article 2 in its substantive part. Conversely, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Tovsultanova v. Russia, no. 26974/06, \u00a7\u00a7 77-81, 17 June 2010; Movsayevy v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a020303/07, \u00a7 76, 14 June 2011; and Shafiyeva v.

While there is no reliable information about Mr Apti Zaynalov\u2019s whereabouts between 25 June and 28 June 2009 (see paragraphs 10 and 22 above), the parties agree that on 28 June 2009 Mr Apti Zaynalov was brought to the Achkhoy-Martan district hospital by a group of armed men wearing camouflage uniforms and, according to the hospital director, bearing the insignia of and in possession of ID documents from the Ministry of the Interior (see paragraphs 47-49 above). The men acted openly and possessed the necessary authority to issue orders to the hospital personnel. Thus, they instructed the doctors and nurses to treat Mr Apti Zaynalov for his gunshot wounds in conditions of strict confidentiality and anonymity, in clear breach of the relevant instructions. Regularly changing the composition of the team, they remained at the hospital for ten days in order to prevent the patient from escaping or from contacting the hospital personnel, in full view of the staff and visitors and, it appears, without taking any precautions. It seems, although the date indicated in the internal document is 26 June 2009, that the same persons prevented the district prosecutor from entering the room and ascertaining the identity of the patient; the prosecutor was under the impression that they were guarding his anonymity under a witness protection programme (see paragraph 53 above). All the hospital staff questioned and the district prosecutor Mr\u00a0P. perceived these men to be servicemen of the law-enforcement authorities, although none of them noted any details. On 7 July 2009, as soon as the applicant and Mrs\u00a0Estemirova had lodged their complaint with the district prosecutor\u2019s office and had come to the hospital, these men removed Mr\u00a0Apti Zaynalov from the hospital, apparently taking with them all documentary and material evidence of his stay (see paragraphs 18, 19, 30, 48, 49 and 53 above).",

Not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For the Court to find a violation of the positive obligation to protect life, it must be established that the authorities knew, or ought to have known at the time, of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see Osman, cited above, \u00a7 116; Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, \u00a7 55; Medova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 25385/04, \u00a7 96, 15 January 2009; Rantsev v.

As is apparent from the information summarised above (see paragraphs 67-68 above), the Russian authorities were sufficiently aware of it, and had lately taken a number of specific actions to render investigations of this type of crime more efficient, including the creation of a special unit within the Investigative Committee of the Chechen Republic.

Although it appears that the prosecutor\u2019s assistant, Mr A., visited the hospital later in the day on 7\u00a0July 2009, he allegedly obtained no information relevant to the case. This appears particularly at odds with the subsequent submissions by all the hospital staff that the unknown patient had been held there for ten days and had been taken away by the guards at 4 p.m. on 7 July 2009 (see paragraphs 30, 31, 47-49 and 53 above). In the days following the applicant\u2019s complaint, the police contented themselves with collecting several explanations and exchanging requests for information (see paragraphs 28-34 above). No further questioning of the applicant took place, neither she nor Mr G. was asked to indicate the exact place in the hospital where they had last seen Mr Apti Zaynalov, and no urgent examination of the premises was undertaken. In fact, it was another twenty days before a criminal investigation was instituted (see paragraph 45 above). This was clearly an inadequate response to a well-founded submission about a crime that was so serious and so widespread in the region.",

This is true of any criminal abduction and disappearance, but is especially so in the context of relatively widespread unresolved disappearances such as those in the Chechen Republic. An effective and rapid response by the authorities is absolutely vital in such circumstances, and one could reasonably expect that \u2013 in view of numerous previous similar crimes in the region \u2013 an adequate system would have been set up by the time of the events in question. However, it appears that this was not the case. The Court finds regrettable the absence of any operative response in the present case, where the authorities were apprised of relatively precise details of unacknowledged detention. It is difficult to reconcile their more than lenient attitude with the apparent gravity of the threat to the identified person\u2019s life and with the obligation to protect it from unlawful threats.",
