With reference to the conclusions of the medical expert examiners, the court established that the applicant\u2019s diseases had no causal link to his vaccination. It noted that the applicant had not had an allergic reaction or showed other signs that would normally have appeared within several days following the vaccination. The only disease that could be associated with the vaccination was urticaria (commonly known as hives), which the applicant had suffered from more than eight months after the vaccination and which could not therefore have had any causal link to it. The court also established that the applicant had not had any acute symptoms of any disease upon vaccination and therefore that his vaccination had not violated any medical rules. Furthermore, the epidemic situation in the  region had called for his vaccination against diphtheria. The court noted that no physical force had been applied to the applicant and that, being an adult of sound mind, he could have refused to have the vaccination, as he had done before on several occasions. The court noted that although the vaccination had not been performed in the vaccination room as required by the regulations, it had been conducted by a qualified nurse in a doctor\u2019s office, in a doctor\u2019s presence, with prior verification of the applicant\u2019s reaction to such a vaccination, and it had not caused the applicant to have any negative side-effects. The court also noted that the applicant\u2019s allegations about the quality of vaccine had been speculative and had not been confirmed by any evidence. The court observed that none of the applicant\u2019s diseases had had a causal link to the vaccination and that the applicant had spent so much time in hospital because he had been attempting to obtain disabled status. The court also examined the applicant\u2019s allegations about the alleged falsification of medical records and rejected them as unsubstantiated.",

The Government noted that the applicant\u2019s fitness for vaccination and possible contraindications had been checked by the doctors prior to the vaccination. In addition, they noted that, while being compulsory, the vaccination had not been forced or violently imposed, and therefore that the applicant, being an adult of thirtyfour years of age at the time of the events, could have refused to have the vaccination, as he had done previously on many occasions. They finally noted that the applicant\u2019s allegations about the quality of the vaccine and the negative side-effects of the vaccination on his health had been thoroughly examined by the doctors and the courts and had been found unsubstantiated.

Romania (no. 19234/04, 30\u00a0March 2010) and the issue is always the same. The modern doctrine of the principle of precaution offers an elegant solution to this legal enigma by transferring a priori the burden of proof onto the appropriate party. In T\u0103tar and B\u0103cil\u0103 cases, clearly this ought to have been the . In our case, the burden of proof, if we were to be guided by the principle of precaution, ought to have been on the company which had produced the vaccine and on the doctors who have injected it in an allegedly irreproachable way. If that burden were to be placed on them they would make an extra effort to show that the vaccine had in fact been produced and administered lege artis and the case would be, without undue burdening of the experts, resolved. This would have occurred, of course, if those who carried the burden were able to show that the allegations on the part of the applicant were in fact without any scientific basis.",
