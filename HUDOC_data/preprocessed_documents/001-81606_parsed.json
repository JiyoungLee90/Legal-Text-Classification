Where the plaintiff indicated too high an amount in the claim form, the court fees may exceed the sum awarded in damages, the overall financial award being in favour of the State despite the finding that the plaintiff suffered damage which called for compensation under the Act (see, for example, the following judgments of the Supreme Court of Cassation: judgment no. 1095 of 25.07.2000 in case no. 139/2000 and judgment no. 805/05 of 1.08.2005 in case no. 56/2004).
