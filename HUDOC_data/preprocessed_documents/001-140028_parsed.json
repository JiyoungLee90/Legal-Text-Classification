He was considered to have a slight intellectual deficit (an IQ of 67) and to be incapable of creating positive relationships with people. This inadequacy caused him to live military life with anxiety and fear of his fellow soldiers, who he considered were aggressive towards him, even if they had only been joking.

Indeed the first-instance Medical Commission had referred to a diagnosis of the applicant made in 1997 (when he had been admitted to hospital) which evidenced a fragile and vulnerable mental state. The court went on to note that it transpired that the medical examination of June 1994 to determine the applicant\u2019s fitness for service had not been accurate, since it should already have transpired that the applicant was not entirely fit to take up military service.",

It noted that the applicant, a mentally healthy subject upon undergoing medical assessments prior to being drafted, had never shown any symptoms of mental illness before conscription into the military service and it was only after repeated punishment that such traits had emerged. Therefore, even assuming that he was predisposed to mental health problems, it was evident that it was the treatment he had been subjected to during military service that had caused the emergence of the illness. The implications of military service were generally of great emotional impact and a source of stress, which for a person who was in a fragile state of mental health or predisposed to mental health problems, unlike in the case of a healthy person, could trigger mental illness. The applicant\u2019s being away from his family and his inability to relate to colleagues and superiors, in the absence of the necessary psychological support and in view of the repeated punishments imposed on him, had caused him to develop dysphoria which had later evolved into chronic OCD. Thus, in the applicant\u2019s case there had been a causal link between his mental health problems and his military service, or the latter had at least contributed to the development of his condition.",

As to the failure to disclose documentation, it considered that such documentation did not relate to the period during which the applicant had carried out military service. In any event the crux of the applicant\u2019s complaint had concerned the conclusions of the Medical Board\u2019s report which did not accord with his claim. However, the CS considered that the report was not contradictory or illogical in itself and it had not ignored relevant facts. It followed that given that the CS (in its limited powers of judicial review of administrative acts) (in sede di legittimit\u00e0) was not allowed to assess the merits of that report, the applicant\u2019s challenge could not be upheld. In respect of the original medical examination to determine the applicant\u2019s fitness for military service, the CS again adopted the findings of the Medical Board, which had considered that it was possible that the applicant\u2019s health problems had not manifested themselves in the absence of particular stimuli.",

Indeed, there had been provision for further tests if called for; however, they had not been undertaken in his case despite sufficient indications that they were necessary (see paragraph 6 above). Ironically, specific and more rigorous tests had been in place for conscripts for voluntary military service (given the more demanding performance required of them), despite the fact that mandatory conscripts actually had a greater need of such psychological testing, the duty of military service being imposed on them. Moreover, this more specific testing went to show that the tests for mandatory conscripts had been weaker and not sufficiently accurate. He noted that even the TAR in its judgment of 20 July 2007 had found that the pre-conscription examination had been inaccurate and inappropriate (see paragraph 23 above).

There had not been a system in place capable of speedily detecting behavioural problems or providing psychological support. Thus, his military superiors had again failed to detect any health problems and had instead opted to impose consecutive and repeated punishments on him, which had irretrievably prejudiced his health and isolated him even more. He had first started suffering from nervous tics, which eventually developed into chronic OCD (which could transform itself into more serious forms of psychosis according to the applicant\u2019s expert) as a result of the compulsory military service and the treatment he had endured during that time. In his view there was no doubt that the stresses of military life away from his family, coupled with the punishments endured, could trigger such consequences in a subject who was already in a fragile mental state, or at least predisposed to mental health problems. Even assuming that military life and the treatment he had endured had not been the sole cause of his present condition, it could not be denied that it had been at least a partial cause. The applicant disagreed with the Government that the punishments could not have affected him and referred to the report by the NHS of Tricase of February 1995 (see paragraph 10 above). Moreover, the applicant\u2019s expert (report of 6\u00a0May\u00a02010 by Dr Russo) had precisely stated that the punishments had been the determinative cause of the applicant\u2019s mental health problems. The applicant also challenged the Government\u2019s contention that he had been moved to Lecce as some sort of ameliorative measure following the detection of his symptoms. Indeed the said move had only occurred by chance and it was only in Lecce that the military commander had detected the applicant\u2019s discomfort (see paragraph 9), at a stage at which his health had already deteriorated to the extent that he had developed nervous tics.",

In addition, the applicant had not substantiated that he had been subject to a lot of ribbing by colleagues or intolerant or negligent behaviour by superiors. The Government noted that the tasks entrusted to the applicant had been normal, routine tasks in the military (such as guard duty), in respect of which they could not be expected to keep records years later. However, he had not been ordered to perform tasks on discriminatory or punitive grounds. As to his punishments, namely the twenty-eight days of \u201cconsegna semplice\u201d (a punishment prohibiting an individual from leaving the base) and one day of \u201cconsegna di rigore\u201d (a punishment confining the individual to a specified area on the base), the Government stressed that contrary to what had been claimed by the applicant in the application, these punishments had not been continuous and uninterrupted. Furthermore, the Government could not see how prohibiting the applicant from leaving the base (the most common punishment he had been subjected to) could have been particularly detrimental to him, given that he had claimed before this Court to be inclined to isolate himself from others. Neither had the applicant given specific details about his one-day confinement to a specified area on the base, which in the Government\u2019s view indicated its lack of relevance.

It followed, in the Government\u2019s view, that the applicant\u2019s health problems had been hidden at the time of conscription, as also shown by the fact that when training in Chieti in the first month of his military service \u2013 at which time they considered his stress to have reached its height \u2013 the applicant had displayed normal behaviour.

While completing military service may not in any way be overwhelming for a healthy young person, it could constitute an onerous burden on an individual lacking the requisite stamina and physical strength owing to the poor state of his health. Accordingly, given the practical demands of military service, States must introduce an effective system of medical supervision for potential conscripts to ensure that their health and well-being would not be put in danger and their human dignity would not be undermined during military service. State authorities, in particular drafting military commissions and military medical commissions, must carry out their responsibilities in such a manner that persons who are not eligible for conscript military service on health grounds are not registered and consequently admitted to serve in the army (see Kayankin v. Russia, no. 24427/02, \u00a7 87, 11 February 2010).",

The State has a primary duty to put in place rules geared to the level of risk to life or limb that may result not only from the nature of military activities and operations, but also from the human element that comes into play when a State decides to call up ordinary citizens to perform military service.

The expert body was directly dependent on the Ministry, and the fact that one of its members had been external to the Ministry had made no difference.

Furthermore, the applicant had not been able to challenge its findings, in so far as the CS had rejected his challenge to the report and his ex parte expert report on the basis that it was not for that court to assess the merits of expert findings.

In addition, as to the substance of the report the Government noted that its findings, namely that it had only been coincidental that the applicant\u2019s illness had appeared while undertaking military service, had also been based on a medical report (by the NHS of Tricase of October\u00a01995) which had found that the applicant had not had neuropsychiatric problems before entering the military (see paragraph 12 above).",

However, the opinion of an expert who has been appointed by the competent court to address issues arising in the case is likely to carry significant weight in that court\u2019s assessment of those issues. In its case-law the Court has recognised that a lack of neutrality on the part of a court-appointed expert may in certain circumstances give rise to a breach of the principle of equality of arms inherent in the concept of a fair trial.

In particular, the Board (hereinafter understood as the five experts drawing up the report in the applicant\u2019s case) was made up of at least three military officials, including the President of the Section. In that light, the Court considers that its structure and composition could give rise to certain concerns on the part of the applicant, which could not be dispelled simply because one of the Board\u2019s members was a civilian. While such concerns may have a certain importance, they are not decisive: what is decisive is whether the doubts raised by appearances can be held to be objectively justified (see Brandstetter v.

There is also no doubt as to the reliance of the CS on the Medical Board\u2019s report, the findings of which it endorsed without hesitation or further assessment. Indeed, while adopting the report\u2019s conclusions, the CS noted that in its limited powers of judicial review of administrative acts (sede di legittimit\u00e0) it could not examine the merits of that report (despite a contrasting report having been produced by the applicant\u2019s expert), irrespective of the fact that the report had only been submitted at the appeal stage.
