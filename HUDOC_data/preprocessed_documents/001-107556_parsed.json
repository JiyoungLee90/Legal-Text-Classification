He further suffered from a schizophrenic-type disorder, which was generally characterised by eccentric behaviour and abnormalities in the person\u2019s thinking and mood, which gave the impression of schizophrenia without any symptoms indicating actual schizophrenia: the applicant displayed eccentric and mistrustful behaviour, lacked social contact and experienced occasional hallucinations.

The preventive detention of the persons concerned could only be prolonged if, owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct, they were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if, additionally, they suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of sub-paragraph (e) of Article 5 \u00a7 1. If that was not the case, the detainees had to be released no later than 31 December 2011. The applicant had been obliged to exhaust that new domestic remedy.",

In contrast, the preventive detention of the applicant in the present case was justified under sub-paragraph (e) of the said provision. The sentencing  had found that the applicant suffered from a personality disorder but had acted with full criminal responsibility (see paragraph 8 above). In the Government\u2019s view, that personality disorder had to be qualified as a \u201ctrue mental disorder\u201d for the purposes of the Court\u2019s case-law as established, in particular, in Winterwerp v. the Netherlands (24\u00a0October 1979, Series A no. 33), and the applicant thus had to be considered as being of unsound mind. They stressed that the fact that a person had committed an offence with full criminal responsibility did not warrant the conclusion that the person did not suffer from a mental disorder for the purposes of sub-paragraph (e) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 and section 1 of the Therapy Detention Act (see paragraph 50 above). A person may have been fully capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act and of acting accordingly at the time of his offence and thus have been criminally responsible.

He had further considered that the applicant did not suffer from schizophrenia. That latter diagnosis had been made in previous examinations, notably in 1996, prior to the applicant\u2019s transfer to a psychiatric hospital (see paragraph 9 above). It had subsequently been maintained by the medical director of the psychiatric wing of Straubing Prison (see paragraphs 17 and 20 above), but had already been contested previously by another external psychiatric expert, W., in 2005 (see paragraph 17 above). The Court notes that it appears from these findings that the applicant developed a schizophrenic-type disorder after his conviction in 1987, when he had been found to suffer only from a personality disorder characterised, in particular, by antisocial conduct, which was not such as to be classified as pathological (see paragraph 8 above).",

As the  itself stressed (see paragraph 19 above), it was not decisive for their decision whether the applicant\u2019s preventive detention should take place in a psychiatric hospital, and even less so for the extension of his preventive detention as such, whether the applicant suffered from a mental illness and the particular nature of that illness. The question before them was whether the applicant was liable to reoffend if released (Article 67d \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code, see paragraphs 18-19 and 46 above), be it because of his mental condition or not (compare in this respect also Kallweit, cited above, \u00a7 56). The courts further had to determine under Article 67a \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 47 above) whether the applicant\u2019s reintegration into society could be better promoted if his necessary preventive detention took place in a psychiatric hospital.

Since 1999 and notably also in the proceedings here at issue, he has maintained that the applicant\u2019s condition, which he considered as a mental illness, could be adequately treated only in a psychiatric hospital, and not in the psychiatric department of Straubing Prison \u2013 where the applicant has not received treatment since 2002 (see paragraphs 12, 17 and 20 above).",

The Court cannot but subscribe in this context to the reasoning of the  in its judgment of 4 May 2011 in respect of the suitable institutions for persons in preventive detention. That court stressed that both the German Constitution and the Convention required a high level of individualised and intensified offer of therapy and care by a team of multi-disciplinary staff to persons in preventive detention.

The wording of Article 7 paragraph 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 28; Jamil, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031; Adamson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42293/98, 26 January 1999; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 142).

It thereby fully assumed that responsibility.
