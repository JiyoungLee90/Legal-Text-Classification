It considered firstly that the Antidiscrimination Ordinance applied to the applicants\u2019 situation and on this point it dismissed the defendant party\u2019s allegations of a breach of the principles of the separation of powers by the courts. It further considered that, in the light of Article 2 of the Anti-discrimination Ordinance and of the Court\u2019s case-law on Article 14, the applicants had proved their allegations of discrimination, particularly that they had been treated differently from individuals in similar situations, without justification. In the court\u2019s view, the protected right at stake was the principle of equality of treatment in the system of remuneration for work. On the merits of the case, the court relied on the laws regulating \u201cconfidentiality bonus[es]\u201d (spor de confiden\u0163ialitate), noting that the applicants had to respect the confidentiality of the information to which they had access and for this reason concluded that they should be entitled to a \u201cconfidentiality bonus\u201d, like other members of the judiciary and ancillary staff.

Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. A review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise and the mere possibility of two views on the subject is not grounds for re-examination. Departures from that principle are justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see, for instance, Ryabykh, cited above, \u00a7 52). Higher courts\u2019 powers to quash or alter binding and enforceable judicial decisions should be exercised for the purpose of correcting fundamental defects. That power must be exercised so as to strike, to the maximum extent possible, a fair balance between the interests of an individual and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the system of justice (see Giuran v. Romania, no.\u00a024360/04, \u00a7\u00a030, ECHR 2011 (extracts)).",

The Court further notes that the extraordinary appeal proceedings did not last unreasonably long: the application was lodged on 20 November 2008 (see paragraph 15 above) and the decision was rendered on 14 October 2009 (see paragraph 17 above). As a result, the extraordinary appeal, as applied in the particular circumstances of this case, constituted the next logical element in the chain of domestic remedies at the disposal of the parties in the case, rather than an extraordinary means of reopening proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Trapeznikov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 37, with further references) and was therefore not incompatible with the principle of legal certainty enshrined in the Convention.",

In particular, after examining the extraordinary appeal, the Court of Appeal quashed the impugned decision and then looked at the case anew (see paragraph 18 above, and ibid., \u00a7\u00a051).

It is moreover necessary to take into account, inter alia, the diversity of the submissions that a litigant may bring before the courts and the differences existing in the Contracting States with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules, legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments.

However, the Court of Appeal in its impugned decision of 14\u00a0October 2009 considered that the applicants\u2019 initial action had been about a legislative change and relied exclusively on the decisions rendered by the Constitutional Court. In doing so the Court of Appeal failed to explain on what grounds it considered that those decisions were relevant to the applicants\u2019 action. In addition, it made no reference to the relevant Convention provisions (which moreover had not been the object of the Constitutional Court\u2019s examination).",

Romania (dec.), no. 65161/10, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 14 and 15, 6\u00a0September 2011, where the Court accepted as valid under Article 6 of the Convention the fact that the domestic courts had applied during the appeal proceedings a new interpretation made by the High Court of Cassation and Justice by means of an appeal in the interest of the law which had been binding on all the domestic courts). Admittedly, the applicants asked the court to examine the case in their absence. However, it appears from the material presented before the Court that the Ministry of Justice did not rely on the Constitutional Court decisions in their submissions. In addition, the observations filed by the parties with the Court of Appeal referred only to the admissibility of the extraordinary appeal, and not to the merits of the initial action (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). Therefore, that court should have sought the parties\u2019 opinion on the merits of the original action in the light of the recent developments brought by the Constitutional Court decision, in particular since the interpretation of the legal provisions at stake was a contentious point during the first set of proceedings which took place before the adoption of the said decisions (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above).",

In other words, the domestic courts have a duty to allow the parties to present their arguments and to conduct a proper examination of the submissions, arguments and evidence adduced by the parties (see the case-law quoted in paragraph 59 above). In the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that the introduction, in the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning, of the argument based on the unconstitutionality of the provisions of the Anti-discrimination Ordinance took the applicants by surprise and breached the principle of adversarial proceedings.",

It is not clear from the reasoning of the Court of Appeal whether that question was considered not to be relevant to the case, to have been already absorbed by the assessment of the domestic legislation, or whether it was simply ignored (see, mutatis mutandis, Dhahbi v.\u00a0Italy, no. 17120/09, \u00a7 33, 8 April 2014).

Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2003IX; see also S.C.\u00a0Textinc S.A. v. Romania [Committee], no. 52018/10, \u00a7\u00a026, 6\u00a0February 2018, in which the Court considered that it was not justified to quash a final and binding decision only because two domestic courts had had different views on a matter discussed in the appeal proceedings). Nothing in the case or in domestic practice permits the belief that in allowing the application for correction of the decision the first appellate formation conducted an arbitrary interpretation of the notion of \u201cmaterial error\u201d. As judicial staff were not entitled to confidentiality bonuses, there was no reason to assume that the first appellate formation had examined the confidentiality bonus and not the loyalty bonus. Moreover, the benefit at stake in the case was indisputably the loyalty bonus and there was no mention of the confidentiality bonus in the applicants\u2019 submissions. The county court correctly used the term \u201cloyalty bonus\u201d when deciding the case. While having the power to re-examine the merits of the case, the first appellate formation in the proceedings which gave rise to the decision of 30\u00a0May 2008 was bound by the subject matter of the action as defined by the applicants in their application lodged before the county court. It therefore must be inferred that the Court of Appeal was in fact examining the matter of the loyalty bonus, as requested by the applicants in their action, and not that of the confidentiality bonus, and that the use of the term \u201cconfidentiality bonus\u201d stemmed from a technical error, which was later confirmed by the same bench.

In the instant case the Government failed to submit any argument justifying a departure from the approach described above. Despite the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State in this field, supervisory review proceedings cannot justify the applicants\u2019 deprivation of possessions acquired by means of a final and enforceable decision (see Blidaru v.\u00a0Romania, no. 8695/02, \u00a7 55, 8 November 2007, and SC\u00a0Ma\u015finexportimport Industrial Group SA, cited above, \u00a7 46).",

It appears from that ordinance that the loyalty bonus was meant to reward time served in the same post. Judicial officers were subject to the same obligations, restrictions and rules in office as judges and prosecutors. Although they had to serve a five-year term, nothing prohibited the renewal of their mandate or their early departure. They were subject to essentially the same incentives as other judicial staff to continue their work in the same post. Consequently, for the purpose of encouraging their loyalty, for which the loyalty bonus was designed, judicial officers were in the same situation as other judicial staff involved in case processing in courts.",
