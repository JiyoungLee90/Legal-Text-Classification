Referring to Article 46 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on mandatory defence and to Article 48 of the same Code on the investigative authorities\u2019 duty to appoint defence counsel under certain conditions, the court observed that the duties of the investigative authorities also included giving effect to the constitutional right to defence. The court concluded that measures concerning the exercise of mandatory defence qualified as public-interest activities, and any related data were of great importance for society and were not to be considered as a matter of personality rights or subject to the protection of private interests. The names of defence counsel and the number of their respective appointments did not therefore constitute information of a private nature, in relation to which disclosure would only be possible with the approval of the person concerned. The court went on to state that, given the public-interest nature of mandatory defence, the interest in informing society seemed to be stronger than the need to protect privacy, which in any case was not infringed since the role of defence counsel was public from the moment of indictment. The court ordered the respondents to surrender the information requested.",

The court rejected the applicant NGO\u2019s argument that ex officio defence counsel exercised public functions within the meaning of the Data Act. In the court\u2019s view, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure relied on by the applicant NGO provided for equal recognition before the law and for the right to defence and imposed a duty on the State to ensure these rights. However, the provisions did not prescribe that the activities of ex officio defence counsel were public duties, irrespective of the fact that they were financed by the State. The court held that the duty of the police to appoint defence counsel in certain cases was to be distinguished from the latter\u2019s activities. It noted that personal data could only be processed under section\u00a05(1) of the Data Act for a well-defined purpose in the exercise of a right or in fulfilment of an obligation, and that personal data processed by the police departments could only be transferred with the permission of the person concerned.",

On occasion he has held temporary membership which has given him access to some but not all facilities of the organisation. When he does not hold at least temporary membership he does not have access to the media facilities nor can he take notes of Parliamentary proceedings. The Committee notes that the State party has claimed that the author does not suffer any significant disadvantage because of technological advances which make information about Parliamentary proceedings readily available to the public. The State party argues that he can report on proceedings by relying on broadcasting services, or by observing the proceedings. In view of the importance of access to information about the democratic process, however, the Committee does not accept the State party\u2019s argument and is of the opinion that the author\u2019s exclusion constitutes a restriction of his right guaranteed under paragraph 2 of article 19 to have access to information...\u201d",

It observes that the information should be provided without the need to prove direct interest or personal involvement in order to obtain it, except in cases in which a legitimate restriction is applied. The Committee also recalls its position in relation to press and media which includes a right for the media actors to have access to information on public affairs and the right of the general public to receive media output. It further notes that among the functions of the press and media are the creation of forums for public debate and the forming of public or, for that matter, individual opinions on matters of legitimate public concern, such as the use of the death penalty. The Committee considers that the realisation of these functions is not limited to the media or professional journalists, and that they can also be exercised, for example, by public associations or private individuals. With reference to its conclusions in Communication S.B. v. Kyrgyzstan, the Committee also notes that the author in the present case is a legal consultant of a human rights public association, and as such, he can be seen as having ... special \u2018watchdog\u2019 functions on issues of public interest. In light of the considerations listed above, in the present communication, the Committee is satisfied, due to the particular nature of the information sought, that the author has substantiated, for purposes of admissibility, that he, as an individual member of the public, was directly affected by the refusal of the State party\u2019s authorities to make available to him, on request, the information on use of the death penalty.",

The Committee considers that the realisation of these functions is not limited to the media or professional journalists, and that they can also be exercised by public associations or private individuals (see paragraph 6.3). When, in the exercise of such \u2018watchdog\u2019 functions on matters of legitimate public concern, associations or private individuals need to access State-held information, as in the present case, such requests for information warrant similar protection by the Covenant to that afforded to the press. The delivery of information to an individual can, in turn, permit it to circulate in society, so that the latter can become acquainted with it, have access to it, and assess it. In this way, the right to freedom of thought and expression includes the protection of the right of access to State-held information, which also clearly includes the two dimensions, individual and social, of the right to freedom of thought and expression that must be guaranteed simultaneously by the State. In these circumstances, the Committee is of the opinion that the State party had an obligation either to provide the author with the requested information or to justify any restrictions of the right to receive State-held information under article 19, paragraph\u00a03, of the Covenant.\u201d",

The Institute did, however, place at his disposal the ballot paper accounts drawn up by randomly selected citizens at each polling station of the country\u2019s 300 electoral districts. According to the national legislation, those accounts list the number of votes cast for each candidate, the number of spoilt ballot papers and the number of unused ballot papers. By law, votes are scrutinized in the presence of representatives of the political parties, as well as by accredited election observers in some cases, and the results returned by each polling station may be challenged and submitted for review by higher authorities, as indeed occurred in the 2006 presidential election when the initial results were partially reviewed by the Electoral Tribunal.",

Lists of public defenders were widely available to the public, thereby showing that lawyers providing legal aid had waived, to some extent, their privacy rights. Furthermore, the publication of information concerning appointments did not encroach upon the confidentiality of lawyer-client relationships. If a national authority categorised information as private rather than publicinterest information, it had to justify such a decision by reference to the countervailing interests protected by Article 10. Without such a balancing exercise, national authorities could not be viewed as having struck a fair balance between the relevant interests at issue. If such a balancing exercise was carried out, it should necessarily favour the disclosure of information on the appointments of lawyers, since access to information ensured external oversight and thereby safeguarded compliance with Article 6 of the Convention, an interest far more important than the protection of the identities and commercial activities of lawyers.",

This consideration was, without much discussion, further developed in Sdru\u017eeni Jiho\u010desk\u00e9 Matky (cited above). The Court first referred to the principles set out in Leander, Guerra and Roche and observed that \u201cit is difficult to derive from the Convention a general right of access to administrative data and documents (see Loiseau v.\u00a0France (dec.), no.\u00a046809/99, ECHR 2003-XII (extracts)\u201d. Then, referring to Grupo Interpres SA (cited above), it went on to hold that the impugned refusal of the public authority to grant access to the relevant administrative documents, which were readily available, constituted an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to receive information guaranteed by Article\u00a010 of the Convention. As in the situation in the Grupo Interpres SA case, the Convention complaint in the Dammann case related to the application of a duty, imposed by national law, to provide access to the requested documents, subject to certain conditions. Having satisfied itself that the impugned restriction had not been disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, the Court subsequently declared the complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded.",

In finding an interference, the Court moreover had regard to the consideration that access to the information in question was an essential element of the exercise of the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression, or that it formed part of the legitimate gathering of information of public interest with the intention of imparting that information to the public and thereby contributing to public debate (see Kenedi, 26 May 2009, \u00a7 43; Youth Initiative for Human Rights, 25 June 2013, \u00a7 24; Ro\u015fiianu, 24 June 2014, \u00a7\u00a064; and Guseva, 14\u00a0February 2015, \u00a7 55; all cited above, and all referring in this context to T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g, described in more detail below).

With hindsight the Court considers that this line of case-law did not represent a departure from, but rather an extension of, the Leander principles, in that it referred to situations where, as described by the intervening Government, one arm of the State had recognised a right to receive information but another arm of the State had frustrated or failed to give effect to that right.",

Here the Court recognised, subject to certain conditions \u2013 irrespective of the domestic-law considerations prevailing in Kenedi, Youth Initiative for Human Rights, Ro\u015fiianu and Guseva \u2013 the existence of a limited right of access to information, as part of the freedoms enshrined in Article 10 of the Convention. In T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g the Court emphasised the social \u201cwatchdog\u201d role of the applicant organisation and observed, using reasoning which was confirmed in Kenedi, Youth Initiative for Human Rights, Ro\u015fiianu and Guseva, that the applicant organisation had been involved in the legitimate gathering of information on a matter of public importance (a\u00a0request by a politician for review of the constitutionality of criminal legislation concerning drug-related offences) and that the authorities had interfered in the preparatory stage of this process by creating an administrative obstacle. The Constitutional Court\u2019s monopoly of information had thus amounted to a form of censorship. Furthermore, given that the applicant organisation\u2019s intention had been to impart to the public the information gathered from the constitutional complaint, and thereby to contribute to the public debate concerning legislation on drug-related offences, its right to impart information had been clearly impaired (see\u00a0T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g, \u00a7\u00a7 26 to 28). Comparable conclusions were reached in \u00d6sterreichische Vereinigung (see \u00a7 36 of that judgment).",

It was repeated in the plenary and Grand Chamber rulings in Guerra and Others, Gaskin and Roche (and also in Gillberg). However, whilst holding that Article 10 did not, in circumstances such as those at issue in Guerra and Others, Gaskin and Roche, confer on the individual a right of access to the information in question or embody an obligation on the Government to impart such information, the Court did not, however, exclude the existence of such a right for the individual or a corresponding obligation on the Government in other types of circumstance. The above-mentioned recent case-law (including Gillberg) may be viewed as illustrating the types of circumstance in which the Court has been prepared to recognise an individual right of access to State-held information. For the purposes of its examination of the present case, the Court finds it useful to take a broader look at the question of the extent to which the right of access to information can be gleaned from Article 10 of the Convention.",

It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person. It can therefore embrace multiple aspects of a person\u2019s physical and social identity. Elements such as, for example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8 (see S. and Marper, cited above, \u00a7 66, and Pretty, cited above, \u00a7 61, with further references). Private life may also include activities of a professional or business nature (see Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 251B). The Court has also held that there is a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s, cited above, \u00a7\u00a083).",

Indeed, any criticism or suggested improvement to a service so directly connected to fair-trial rights must be seen as a subject of legitimate public concern. In its intended survey, the applicant NGO wished to explore its theory that the pattern of recurrent appointments of the same lawyers was dysfunctional, casting doubt on the adequacy of the scheme. The contention that the legal-aid scheme might be prejudiced as such because public defenders were systematically selected by the police from the same pool of lawyers \u2013 and were then unlikely to challenge police investigations in order not to be overlooked for further appointments \u2013 does indeed raise a legitimate concern. The potential repercussions of police-appointed lawyers on defence rights have already been acknowledged by the Court in the Martin case (cited above). The issue under scrutiny thus going to the very essence of a Convention right, the Court is satisfied that the applicant NGO intended to contribute to a debate on a matter of public interest (see paragraphs 164-65 above).

It is perhaps significant that the other bodies for human-rights protection \u2013 be they judicial or quasi-judicial, international or regional  also often adopt the approach in question (see, purely by way of indication, the judgment of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Supreme Court of Justice (Quintana Coello et al.) v. Ecuador of 23\u00a0August 2013, \u00a7\u00a0153, on the henceforth wider interpretation of the concept of an \u201cindependent court\u201d, confirmed by the judgments in Constitutional Tribunal (Camba Campos et al.) v. Ecuador of 28 August 2013 and L\u00f3pez Lone et al. v.\u00a0Honduras of 5 October 2015). However, as has been amply demonstrated, the evolutive method of interpretation has been used by other international and national judicial bodies, including the International Court of Justice, the arbitral tribunals, the supreme courts of France, the United Kingdom, Germany, etc. (see E. Bjorge, The Evolutionary Interpretation of Treaties, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2014, and id., \u201cThe Convention as a Living Instrument Rooted in the Past, Looking to the Future\u201d, to appear in Human Rights Law Journal, \u201cColloquy in Honour of Judge Paul Mahoney\u201d). In other words, although the \u201cliving instrument\u201d doctrine has been emphasised by the Court, the resulting interpretative approach is not exclusively tied to the Convention (or to the other conventions and treaties for human-rights protection). It extends far beyond this context and is part of national and international judicial practice in respect of many other areas of international law, and even of law in general.",

It held on that occasion that \u201cArticle 2 cannot, without a distortion of language, be interpreted as conferring the diametrically opposite right [to the right to life], namely a right to die; nor can it create a right to self-determination in the sense of conferring on an individual the entitlement to choose death rather than life\u201d.

This is why the Court usually insists on the existence of a \u201cEuropean consensus\u201d or, at any rate, of a significant trend in the legislation and/or practice of the Contracting States towards the chosen interpretation.

By describing the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires as a \u201csupplementary means\u201d of interpretation, Article 32 takes account of the changes in practice which developed following the end of World War Two, namely abandonment of the subjective method of interpretation, which gave priority to the \u201creal intention\u201d of the parties (and which was still being partially followed in the inter-war years), in favour of the objective method of interpretation, which unambiguously favours the \u201cdeclared intention\u201d.

In other words, all of the Contracting Parties to the Convention, represented at a high level within the Council of Europe \u2013 the Committee of Ministers on the one hand, and the relevant Steering Committee on the other \u2013 acknowledged that the wording of Article 10 \u00a7\u00a01 could create \u201cdoubts\u201d and stated that they were willing to dissipate these by adopting a provision that would harmonise the corresponding provisions of the Convention and the Covenant.",

To repeat the categorical terms used by the Court at the time, \u201cthe freedom to receive information, guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention, implies freedom to seek information\u201d.

This approach was shared by the Convention organs and by the Contracting States (and, it seems, by the Parliamentary Assembly).

In other words, the text does not include the freedom to seek information, unlike Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights. The verb to receive, in its ordinary everyday meaning and when applying simple common sense, cannot be understood to include a right to access information that the holder does not want to impart. Thus, until today, this Court has, in Plenary and Grand Chamber judgments, found in a clear and concise manner, on the basis of a contextual reading of the text of Article\u00a010 \u00a7\u00a01 in accordance with its ordinary meaning, that the \u201cright to freedom to receive information basically prohibits a Government from restricting a person from receiving information that others wish or may be willing to impart to him. Article 10 does not ... embody an obligation on the Government to impart such information to the individual\u201d (see Leander v\u00a0 Sweden, \u00a7 74, 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116; see also below, paragraphs 19-29).",

The freedom to receive information under Article 10 \u00a7 1 is, in this sense and in accordance with its ordinary meaning, a passive right, triggered by the positive action of a willing provider of information and ideas, unlike the right to seek guaranteed by the abovementioned provisions of the ICCPR and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is manifested by the positive actions of the person or entity requesting information. When rightly understood within the context of Article 10 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the freedom to receive information and ideas, exercised without interference by a public authority, is thus limited to situations where a person wants to impart information to another person or entity, for example a journalist, an NGO or whomever, correspondingly limiting the ability of Government to interfere with that transfer of information unless such an interference can be justified under Article 10\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention. For example, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, the right to receive information under Article 10 \u00a7 1 secures in this way the fundamental right of the press to receive information from anonymous sources (see Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, [GC], no. 17488/90, 27 March 1996).",

Second, the preparatory work must be considered to enjoy a degree of importance in assessing the legitimacy of the interpretive option that the right to receive in any event encompasses the right to seek information from public authorities, notwithstanding the latter\u2019s deliberate omission. It is important to recall the fact that the initial draft of Article\u00a010 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention was based on an already existing international principle in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, where these two methods of exercising the right to freedom of expression were clearly distinguished.",

In this sense, Article 10\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 is different from the first paragraphs of Articles\u00a08, 9 and 11 of the Convention, the latter being textually framed in such a way as to allow the Court more flexibility in recognising positive obligations and identifying novel rights than is possible under Article 10. It follows that the example given by the majority in this context in support of its findings, that is, the recognition of a negative right to freedom of association under Article\u00a011 of the Convention, as found in the case of Sigur\u00f0ur A. Sigurj\u00f3nsson v.\u00a0Iceland (30 June 1993, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 264), is quite inapposite (see paragraph\u00a0125 of the judgment).

The answer to that question depends on one\u2019s conception of the theoretical foundations of freespeech rights. Constitutional theory in those countries that first adopted the European Convention on Human Rights, which forms the underlying doctrinal premise for many of the fundamental freedoms in the Convention, is based on the idea that freedom of expression is a liberty, a right not to be interfered with by those in power, rather than a mandate for proactive measures by Government. The right to freedom of expression as provided by the Convention requires that governments refrain from limiting the free expression of opinions and ideas, not that governments are under a binding obligation, pursuant to the Convention and in the absence of a legal duty under domestic law, to impart documents or other information that they hold. That is the theoretical foundation of the Court\u2019s prior case-law in this area, in conformity with the negative textual formulation of Article 10 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see paragraphs 19-29 below). Of course, the founders could have taken a more overarching view of the object and purpose of freespeech rights by including the words to seek information in Article\u00a010 \u00a7\u00a01, thus requiring that governments actively disclose information to the public, but they decided not to do so, a clear and concrete decision that this Court must respect.",

For the Court, in circumstances where access to information is instrumental for the exercise of the applicant\u2019s right to receive and impart information, its denial may constitute an interference with that right.

It is hardly a debatable claim that a fully transparent and open society, where all data and information, whatever its origins, would be accessible to every person, can be conducive to a more informed debate on matters of public interests as well as enhancing the ability of the public to effectively monitor the exercise of governmental power. Indeed, as I stated at the outset, the positive value of access to information is unquestionable, as is demonstrated firstly by the fact that most of the member States of the Council of Europe have enacted freedom-of-information legislation at the level of primary law and, secondly, that the Council of Europe has adopted the 2009 Convention on Access to Official Documents (see further, paragraph 33 below). But, again, the Convention is an international treaty with legal force. It has its limits, set out in its text and structure as interpreted in the light of the fundamental interpretive principles of the VCLT. The principle requiring a practical and effective interpretation of the Convention, by reference to its object and purpose, is not an open invitation for the judges of this Court to elevate any positive development in the member States to the level of a binding international norm, thus limiting the States\u2019 sovereign and democratic rights. In other words, even though the Convention is a humanrights treaty it \u201cmust surely be wrong ... to say that because of the importance of the object and purpose of human-rights treaties this particular element of interpretation should take on greater importance when one is interpreting [such] treaties than when one is interpreting other types of treaty\u201d (see Eirik Bjorge, The Evolutionary Interpretation of Treaties, Oxford University Press, 2014, p.\u00a036).",

Article\u00a010 of the Convention does not textually provide for the freedom to seek information, but is limited to the freedom to receive information. Hence, the right of access to information cannot be created without any textual basis by reference to the object and purpose of Article 10 and the need to interpret that provision to be more practical and effective, when the text itself makes clear that the purpose of the freedom of expression under the Convention is more narrow: it guarantees a freedom from governmental interference, nothing more.",

These judgments at Chamber level do not in my view have precedential value, as they were in direct conflict with the Leander line of Plenary and Grand Chamber caselaw. These judgments might have had some precedential value for the present case had they examined directly the arguments advanced in the previous cases, in particular by analysing the wording of Article 10\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, its object and purpose and the preparatory work, which all clearly point in a different direction and support directly the Leander principles as I have explained above.

On the contrary, as is clearly manifested by the great reluctance of Member States to ratify the 2009 Council of Europe Convention on Access to Information, States seem to want to retain their margin of democratic discretion in this area. For the Court to find, irrespective of the fact that only seven member States have to date ratified the 2009 Convention, that the mere adoption of the 2009 Convention at the level of the Council of Europe \u201cindicates a definite trend towards a European standard\u201d is debatable to say the least. It is important to recall why the Council of Europe considered it necessary in the first place to draft and then propose the adoption of a Convention on access to official documents. The reason was, as explained in the Explanatory Report to the 2009 Convention, that Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights does not guarantee a general right to access to official documents. Today\u2019s judgment thus severely limits the significance of the 2009 Convention, and in fact deprives the member States of the power to decide for themselves, based on their own sovereign and democratic will, whether they wish to be bound by obligations in this area at the international level.",

The Court\u2019s reference to Article 42 of the EU Charter thus seems actually to prove the opposite of what is intended by the majority in its reasoning. In other words, due to the fact that access to official documents is not inherent in freedom of expression, the EU Charter provides for that right in a special provision that is distinct from the provision guaranteeing free speech. In addition, it is important to stress that Article 42 of the Charter only covers access to documents held by EU institutions and bodies. Despite the extensive regulatory powers conferred by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, member States of the latter have opted, as regards a wider right of access to documents held by national authorities, to retain their margin of discretion and legislative competence in this area.",

But that is not the case for Article 10 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. To the extent that the Court refers to other general soft-law international instruments, recommendations and reports of the UN Special Rapporteur, these can only be assessed in this context as \u201cgeneral aspirations\u201d at the level of policy. However, the issue before the Court is, as rightly noted in the same context by the UK Supreme Court in Kennedy (cited above, \u00a7 99), whether Article 10 \u201ccontains a concrete decision to give general effect to them at international level enforceable without any more specific measures and without any controlling qualifications and limitations at that level\u201d. I\u00a0find nothing in the majority\u2019s reasoning in today\u2019s judgment that is persuasive enough to conclude that Article 10 \u00a7 1 can be interpreted in that manner.",

Once recognised under Article 10, a right of access will generally have to be balanced with either the privacy interests of non-disclosure under Article 8 of the Convention, when the requested information is of a personal nature, or in other situations with public-interest considerations under Article\u00a010 \u00a7 2. These balancing exercises will not necessarily coexist harmoniously with domestic norms providing for absolute limitations on public access to documents in, for example, the fields of national security, law enforcement or data protection. These difficulties can in fact be seen in stark terms by the manner in which the Court applies its reasoning to the circumstances of the present case.",

Thus, the Data Act prevented the domestic courts from examining the potential public-interest nature of the information (see paragraph 176 of the judgment), and this is an important element in the Court\u2019s reasoning in finding a violation of Article\u00a010 on the facts of the case (see paragraph 199). In other words, the practical consequences of the Court\u2019s judgment is that member States of the Council of Europe may now have to change fundamentally their national freedomofinformation laws in order to take account of the requirements of Article\u00a010 of the Convention that logically flow from today\u2019s judgment.

The Court rightly considers that the request made by the applicants at domestic level for the names of the public defenders related to \u201cpersonal data\u201d. However, in the Court\u2019s view, given that the data \u201crelated predominantly to the conduct of professional activities in the context of public proceedings\u201d, the Government had not demonstrated that the disclosure of the data requested for the specific purposes of the applicant\u2019s inquiry could have affected the public defenders\u2019 enjoyment of their right to respect for private life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. In my view, this line of reasoning is not in conformity with the Court\u2019s settled case-law in the field of data protection, in which the Court has consistently interpreted the scope of Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in a broad manner, so as to encompass the \u201cstoring of data relating to the \u2018private life\u2019 of an individual\u201d and in that regard has further found that there \u201cis no reason of principle to justify excluding activities of a professional or business nature from the notion of \u2018private life\u2019\u201d (see Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. , \u00a7\u00a065, 16\u00a0February 2000, and, more recently, Uzun v. Germany, no. , \u00a7\u00a048, 2 September 2010). In the Grand Chamber judgment in Amann, cited above, \u00a7 65, the Court referred in this regard to Article 2 of the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, which defines personal data as \u201cany information relating to an identified or identifiable individual\" (see also Uzun, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

That issue has been taken into account in the merits assessment of whether, on the particular facts of a case, disclosure of such data constitutes a proportionate interference with privacy rights under Article\u00a08 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention. The majority judgment in the present case calls into question this whole line of the Court\u2019s case-law and may also prove difficult to reconcile with ongoing legislative and jurisprudential developments in the field of data protection in European Union law (see Article 1 (1) of Directive 95/46/EC and Regulation (EU) 2016/79 on the protection of natural persons with regard to processing of personal data and the free movement of such data).",

What about private entities holding official documents on the basis of outsourcing or contract relations between those entities and Government? In fact, and again using the prescient words of the UK Supreme Court in Kennedy (cited above, \u00a7\u00a094), interpreting Article 10 \u00a7 1 to include a duty of governmental disclosure of all matters of public interest \u201cleads to a proposition that no national regulation of such disclosure is required at all, before such a duty arises. Article 10 would itself become a European-Wide Freedom of Information law. But it would be a law lacking the specific provisions and qualifications which are in practice debated and fashioned by national legislatures according to national conditions and are set out in national Freedom of Information statutes\u201d.

In other words, although the general right to freedom of expression under Article 10 \u00a7 1 applies to \u201ceveryone\u201d, the application of the novel right to access official information is determined by whether the person requesting such documents is doing so to foster expressive activity in the public interest.",

The \u201coccupation of [the role of a social watchdog] cannot sensibly represent any sort of formal pre-condition, before a breach of a domestic duty of disclosure engages [Article 10 \u00a7 1 of the Convention]\u201d. My colleague Judge Wojtyczek made this same point in even starker terms in his dissenting opinion in Guseva v. Bulgaria (cited above), where he stated that this approach \u201cimplicitly differentiates between two categories of legal subjects: journalists and non-governmental organisations on the one hand, and all other persons on the other. The first category enjoys stronger protection in respect of the right of access to information, whereas the second category does not enjoy the same protection. All this leads to an implicit recognition of two circles of legal subjects: a privileged elite with special rights to access information, and the \u2018commoners\u2019, subjected to a general regime allowing more far-reaching restrictions\u201d.",

In fact, this reading of today\u2019s judgment fully conforms with the Court\u2019s own stated reasoning at paragraph 168, where the Court explicitly declares that the newly established Convention right of access to official documents does not exclusively apply to NGOs and the press. On the contrary, the right not only extends to \u201cacademic researchers\u201d and \u201cauthors of literature on matters of public concern\u201d, but also to \u201cbloggers and popular users of the social media\u201d who may also be \u201cassimilated\u201d with public watchdogs.
