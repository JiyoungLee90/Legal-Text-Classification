He cannot, however, claim compensation for the time he spent in detention on remand in the instant case. In the light of the course of the trial so far, the circumstances rebutting the presumption of innocence are, in the view of the Chamber, so overwhelming that a conviction is clearly more likely than an acquittal (Bei W\u00fcrdigung des bisherigen Prozessgeschehens \u00fcberwiegen nach Ansicht der Kammer die Umst\u00e4nde, welche die Unschuldsvermutung entkr\u00e4ften, derart, dass eine Verurteilung deutlich wahrscheinlicher ist als ein Freispruch). Furthermore, Mr. Englert - even if he were acquitted - could not be compensated for his detention, since it was his own actions that gave rise to the strong suspicion that he had committed an offence of extortion with menaces.",

After Mrs. K had said, when a statement was taken from her on the afternoon of 24 February, that Mr. Englert had put the DM 150 he had extorted from her into his swimming costume, [he] was searched, and a DM 100 note was indeed found in his swimming costume, as [she] had said. Not until 22 April 1981, when the investigating judge (Haftrichter) questioned him, did Mr. Englert explain how he came to have a DM 100 note belonging, as he admitted, to Mrs. K. The reasons why that explanation is unconvincing were set out in detail by the 3rd Criminal Chamber in its judgment of 2 November 1981. Even if the version offered by Mr. Englert was true, however, it has to be said against him that he himself prompted the criminal proceedings by his grossly negligent (grob fahrl\u00e4ssig) behaviour, for he failed to consider the obvious and elementary fact that he could be proved to have lied about the money in his possession and that this would provide evidence of the credibility of Mrs. K\u2019s statements and his own lack of credibility. Compensation must therefore be refused him, in accordance with section 5(2) of the Criminal Proceedings (Compensation) Act (Gesetz \u00fcber die Entsch\u00e4digung f\u00fcr Strafverfolgungsmassnahmen).\"",

Even if the terms used were ambiguous and unsatisfactory, the court confined itself in substance to noting the existence of \"reasonable suspicion\" that the defendant had \"committed an offence\" (Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention) (art. 5-1-c). On the basis of the evidence, the decision described a \"state of suspicion\" and did not contain any finding of guilt. In this respect it contrasts with the decisions the Court considered in the Minelli case (see the judgment previously cited, Series A no. 62, pp. 8-10, \u00a7\u00a7 12-14, and pp. 11-12, \u00a7 16) and also with the decisions set aside by the Federal Constitutional Court on 26 March 1987 (see paragraph 22 above).",

Moreover, the refusal to order reimbursement of Mr. Englert\u2019s necessary costs and expenses and to award him any compensation in respect of his detention on remand does not amount to a penalty or a measure that can be equated with a penalty. In this respect too, the instant case very clearly differs from the Minelli case, as also from the cases decided by the  on 26 March 1987 (see paragraph 22 above). The Swiss courts had directed that Mr. Minelli should bear part of the costs of the proceedings and had ordered him to pay the private prosecutors compensation in respect of their expenses (see the judgment previously cited, ibid.), thus treating him as guilty. Nothing comparable occurred in the instant case : Mr. Englert did not have to bear the costs of the proceedings but only his own costs and expenses, and he was not awarded any compensation for his detention on remand. The competent court, acting on an equitable basis and having regard, among other things, to the strong suspicions which seemed to it to exist concerning him, did not impose any sanction on him but merely refused to order that the said costs and expenses or any compensation should be paid out of public funds. And, as the Court has already pointed out, the Convention - more particularly Article 6 \u00a7 2 (art. 6-2) - does not oblige the Contracting States, where a prosecution has been discontinued, to indemnify a person \"charged with a criminal offence\" for any detriment he may have suffered.",

Here the wording used, quite clear in itself, not only speaks of a probable conviction which is also represented as clear (and of course a conviction necessarily postulates guilt), but also actually refers to the presumption of innocence, to conclude in express terms that it is rebutted by overwhelming circumstances, which are obviously taken as proved.

The principle of the presumption of innocence can be violated independently of the application of such penalty or measure. That presumption accompanies a person charged with a criminal offence throughout the whole trial until conviction. Indeed this cardinal principle of the modern criminal trial would have been lamentably improvident if its scope had to be confined to the non-application of a penalty or, to use again the wording of the judgment, a measure which can be equated with one. Punishment is usually only the last stage in the unfolding of a criminal trial and modern criminal legislation also envisages convictions without punishment or a measure which can be equated with it (cf. for instance in the British system \"absolute discharge\").",
