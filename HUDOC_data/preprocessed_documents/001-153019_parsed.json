On 16\u00a0October 2006 the Lublin Medical Academy informed the court that the requested opinion could not be prepared because the applicant was its employee. On 17\u00a0October the court requested the Pozna\u0144 Medical Academy to prepare a\u00a0forensic opinion. The request was repeated on 8\u00a0November 2006. The opinion was submitted on 15\u00a0November 2006. It stated that the applicant\u2019s ailments were of chronic nature and that there was no possibility of a\u00a0complete recovery. The opinion concluded that the applicant could be treated in detention. In view of his condition, it was necessary to ensure to the applicant frequent medical checks, in particular by a cardiologist and pulmonologist and the regular administration of prescribed drugs. Furthermore, he should be ensured the use of his respirator.",

In addition, the particular condition set out in Article 258\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (severity of the likely penalty) had also been satisfied. In this respect, the Regional Court invoked the same elements as in its earlier decision which warranted the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on the applicant (see paragraph\u00a017 above). It further noted that Article\u00a0258\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Code of Criminal Procedure established a\u00a0presumption to the effect that the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed might induce the applicant to obstruct the proceedings.

The court found that it was justified to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention beyond the ordinary threemonth period.

It agreed with the lower court that the particular condition set out in Article\u00a0258\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (severity of the likely penalty) had been satisfied in the applicant\u2019s case. However, the fact of this condition being satisfied could not lead to automatic extension of detention on remand. In accordance with Article\u00a0257\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the application of the most severe preventive measure was limited to exceptional cases, namely those where there were grounds to assume that other measures would not have been sufficient to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings. In the court\u2019s view, at the current stage of the proceedings, the application of detention on remand was not appropriate since \u2013 in accordance with the principle of proportionality of the application of preventive measures \u2013 they should be applied in the manner that was commensurate to the existing risk to the proper conduct of the proceedings. The court found that in the present case there had been no grounds to consider that the applicant would have interfered with the proper conduct of the proceedings because of the severity of the likely penalty. The applicant made his statements in the case, was not previously convicted and had a permanent abode. It was incorrect on the part of the prosecutor to argue that the risk of obstructing the proceedings was justified by the fact that the case could have developed further and the related necessity to question more witnesses. The court emphasised that the severity of the likely penalty alone did not constitute a sufficient ground for application of detention on remand unless it was linked with a substantiated risk that a\u00a0suspect might take actions obstructing the proper conduct of the proceedings with a view to avoiding the likely penalty. The evidence collected in the case did not provide any grounds for such an assumption. The court concluded that bail would be a sufficient preventive measure in the applicant\u2019s case.",

A failure to use the respirator could lead to the applicant\u2019s death which was confirmed by medical reports in the case. Despite being aware of this serious medical condition and the subsequent need for treatment, the authorities did not take adequate steps in response. The applicant\u2019s respirator was damaged by prison guards during searches of the cell and the applicant was left to repair it by himself. The applicant was in constant fear that one of his fellow inmates in his crowded cell would interfere with the respirator or that a\u00a0power cut would occur. Referring to Kaprykowski v.\u00a0Poland, the applicant submitted that his reliance on the respirator had put him in a situation that created anxiety and suffering beyond that which normal detention gave rise to.",

For two weeks he was put into a cell with five smokers, a situation that was particularly difficult given his health condition. He was later put into a cell which had been previously occupied by prisoners suffering from tuberculosis but had not been disinfected. The evidence of the lack of appropriate medical treatment was clear from the subsequent significant deterioration of the applicant\u2019s health. The applicant relied on the medical certificates of December 2006 and his hospitalisation in connection with ischemic heart disease. The Government did not contest these facts which were not indicative of the appropriate level of medical care afforded to the applicant.

However, this provision does require the State to ensure that prisoners are detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject them to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, their health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7\u00a094, ECHR 2000XI; S\u0142awomir Musia\u0142 v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a028300/06, \u00a7\u00a086, 20\u00a0January 2009; and Kaprykowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a023052/05, \u00a7\u00a069, 3\u00a0February 2009).

From the first check carried out on the day of his arrest until the last expert opinion issued on 15\u00a0November 2006 the doctors and forensic experts repeatedly found that the applicant could be suitably treated in detention provided that he could use his respirator and be administered appropriate drugs. The Court considers that the number of medical opinions obtained in the course of six months of the applicant\u2019s detention shows that the courts were attentive to the issue of the applicant\u2019s suitability for detention. In view of these consistent medical findings throughout the whole relevant period, the Court finds that there were no grounds to consider that the applicant\u2019s detention was excluded on medical grounds (compare and contrast, Rokosz v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a015952/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03940, 27\u00a0July 2010; and see Turzy\u0144ski v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no.\u00a061254/09, 17\u00a0April 2012).

He alleged that his respirator had been damaged by the prison guards; however this allegation remains unsubstantiated by any document or complaint made to the authorities. With regard to the applicant\u2019s fear of a power cut in prison or a detainee unplugging the appliance, the Court does not wish to underestimate the applicant\u2019s anxiety but does not find it established that the alleged risk went beyond the hardship normally associated with detention.

In addition, the courts ignored the applicant\u2019s assertion that he had not and would not interfere with the proceedings as well as his submission that there were no concrete circumstances to substantiate the risk of obstruction. They further ignored the petition from a group of doctors to release the applicant and waited until after six months of detention on remand to finally consider alternatives to detention.

With regard to the said presumption, which was strongly criticised by the applicant, the Court notes that in a number of previous cases against Poland concerning complaints under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03, the domestic courts relied on the impugned presumption. The Court did not disqualify the presumption as incompatible per se with Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03, but consistently stated that, while the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself justify long periods of detention on remand (see, among others, Kankowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a010268/03, \u00a7\u00a054, 4\u00a0October 2005; Michta v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a013425/02, \u00a7\u00a049, 4\u00a0May 2006; K\u0105kol v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a03994/03, \u00a7\u00a051, 6\u00a0September 2007; \u0141aszkiewicz v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a028481/03, \u00a7\u00a058, 15\u00a0January 2008; Kauczor v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a045219/06, \u00a7\u00a046, 3\u00a0February 2009; Jamro\u017cy v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a06093/04, \u00a7\u00a038, 15\u00a0September 2009; Jarkiewicz v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a023623/07, \u00a7\u00a053, 6\u00a0July 2010; Finster v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a024860/08, \u00a7\u00a040, 8\u00a0February 2011; Bogus\u0142aw Krawczak v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a024205/06, \u00a7\u00a085, 31\u00a0May 2011; M.B. v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a011887/07, \u00a7\u00a039, 26\u00a0July 2011; Dochnal v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a031622/07, \u00a7\u00a079, 18\u00a0September 2012).

It should be noted that pursuant to Article\u00a0249\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the CCP preventive measures, including detention on remand should be applied with a view to ensuring the proper conduct of the proceedings. The same provision requires that preventive measures could be applied only in the case of reasonable suspicion that an offence was committed.

The Lublin Regional Court referred to the principle set out in Article\u00a0257\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the CCP that detention on remand was the ultima ratio of the preventive measures. It clearly stated that the severity of the anticipated penalty alone (i.e. the condition set out in Article\u00a0258\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the CCP) was not a sufficient ground for application of detention on remand unless it was connected with a substantiated risk of obstruction of the proceedings. In the absence of any indications to that effect the Regional Court found no justification for the applicant\u2019s continued detention. The Court considers that this approach is compatible with the principles established in its caselaw referred to above. In addition, it is consistent with the subsequent Resolution of the Supreme Court on the interpretation of Article\u00a0258\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the CCP (see paragraph\u00a040 above). This approach of the domestic courts indicates, contrary to the applicant\u2019s assertion, that there was no blind and automatic application of Article\u00a0258\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 and of the impugned presumption and that the domestic courts carried out a rigorous review of the circumstances militating for and against the applicant\u2019s detention. This is further demonstrated by the fact that in the course of the investigation the applicant was charged with at least ten additional counts of similar offences; yet the courts found that there was no need to prolong his detention on remand. Having regard to the above, the Court cannot agree with the applicant\u2019s assertion that the domestic courts\u2019 decisions were limited to paraphrasing the reasons for detention provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure, without explaining how they applied in the applicant\u2019s case (compare and contrast, Castravet v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a023393/05, \u00a7\u00a034, 13\u00a0March 2007.",

In its second decision of 28\u00a0August 2006, the district court found that noncustodial measures would have been insufficient given the risk that he might obstruct the proceedings since the investigation was still ongoing. However, in its third decision of 29\u00a0November 2006, the district court held that bail would be an adequate measure given the period that the applicant had already spent in custody and the advanced stage of the investigation. With regard to the applicant\u2019s allegation that the domestic courts failed to take into account the guarantees put forward by the Lublin Medical Chamber and the doctors of his clinic, the Court notes that on the basis of the case file it is not possible to determine whether those bodies filed relevant applications with the court in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure. In addition, there was no mention of those guarantees in any of the appeals lodged by the applicant against decisions prolonging his detention. The applicant also alleged that in the course of the investigation he had been approached by police officers who offered him favourable treatment in exchange for his cooperation in the investigation against other doctors.

On 28\u00a0September 2006 the same court decided to obtain a forensic opinion on the applicant\u2019s state of health from the Lublin Medical Academy. The court\u2019s request was futile because the Lublin Medical Academy could not prepare an opinion on its employee. This request caused another delay in the proceedings lasting nearly three weeks. Then, the court turned to the Pozna\u0144 Medical Academy and finally obtained a forensic opinion after nearly a\u00a0month. There was a further delay of eight days between the receipt of the opinion (15\u00a0November 2006) and the actual decision of the Regional Court (23\u00a0November 2006). This opinion was prepared solely on the basis of the medical dossier of the applicant.
