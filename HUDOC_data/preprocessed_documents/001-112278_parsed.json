It is not the Court\u2019s task to assess whether the suspension of the impugned non-contentious court proceedings was in fact necessary. It will limit itself to observing that this obviously was the opinion of the domestic court (see paragraphs 13 and 32 above) as well as the Government and that the applicant did not object to it (see paragraph 8 above). Having said that, the Court notes that the Government have merely relied on the fact that the delay in the proceedings in question was due to their suspension. They have not shown that the denationalisation proceedings, which were allegedly decisive for the continuation of the impugned non-contentious proceedings and which seem to have lasted over at least fifteen years, were conducted diligently by the courts.

The Court notes that as a consequence of the system provided by the 2006 Act, whereby access to a compensation claim is dependant on the termination of the proceedings, the applicant and now his successor have never been able to claim just satisfaction for the undue delay.",

The Court reiterates that it does not consider itself bound by domestic scales and practices, although it may derive some assistance from them (see, among many other authorities, Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, 13 July 1995, \u00a7 77, Series A no. 316-B, and Ba\u015fkaya and Ok\u00e7uo\u011flu v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos. 23536/94 and 24408/94, \u00a7\u00a098, ECHR 1999-IV). In the present case, however, the applicant did not justify his claim by reference to the statutory domestic scale nor did he submit any supporting documents or detailed information which would show that the costs claimed were actually and necessarily incurred (see S.I.\u00a0v. Slovenia, no. 45082/05, \u00a7\u00a087, 13 October 2011). The Court therefore rejects this claim.",
