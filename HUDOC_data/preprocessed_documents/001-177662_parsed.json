As regards the risk of collusion, the Court considers that this was not a compelling reason once the investigation had been terminated. Nevertheless, the coercive measures continued for more than two more years. Furthermore \u2013 although quite rightly somewhat concerned with and inclined to apply less coercive alternatives \u2013 the authorities seem to have been preoccupied with the risk of reoffending. For them, however, this risk emanated chiefly from the allegation that the applicant belonged to a criminal group, and they failed to perform an individualised assessment of the danger of committing new offences against the background of the specific circumstances of the case.",
