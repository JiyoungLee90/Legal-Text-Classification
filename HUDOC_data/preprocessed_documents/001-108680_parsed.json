The doctor-patient privilege applies to any information shared between doctor and patient or accessed by the doctor in respect of the patient during the course of medical care. This principle prevents doctors and other health professionals from revealing the content of conversations, examinations, medical records and any medical data related to patients, including psychiatric information (see Panteleyenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a011901/02, 29\u00a0June 2006). The bond of trust between the health professional and the patient built upon this principle is of paramount importance both for the diagnostic process, which relies on the assessment of an accurate history of the illness, but also subsequently for the treatment phase, which often depends as much on the patient\u2019s trust in the health professional as it does on medication and surgery. This is a non-negotiable tenet of medical practice, although exceptions to this principle have been carved out over the centuries, such as where a patient threatens himself or herself or a third person with bodily harm.",

Any common citizen could easily identify the persons to whom the director of the CWS referred in the article of 15 June 2001, owing to the proximity in time of the newspaper articles and television interview of the applicant and the newspaper interview of the director of the CWS, who even specifically mentioned the applicant\u2019s television interview to which he was reacting. The conclusion of the Inspector of Journalistic Ethics, that \u201cthe applicant was recognisable\u201d, is thus correct.",

Firstly, the director of the CWS disclosed more information than that revealed by the applicant, and this information was particularly sensitive and damaging for the persons involved. In fact, the director of the CWS did not refrain from exposing to the general public a suspicion of sexual abuse of the child and even the results of the medical examinations performed in order to confirm that suspicion. He also referred to a supposed aggression of the child by the applicant, who had allegedly on one occasion pulled the child by his hair and bit him, as well as the explanation given by the mother to the doctors. These facts were never referred to by the mother in her press articles or television interview.",

Here again, the conclusion of the Inspector of Journalistic Ethics, that the applicant\u2019s \u201cactions and life choices were described one-sidedly, seeking to create a negative image\u201d, is in our view pertinent. If the director of the CWS intended to defend the reputation of his service and its health professionals from the alleged \u201cslander\u201d committed by the applicant, he chose the wrong way of doing it, by breaching his duty of confidentiality and denigrating the applicant in public. Besides, the applicant\u2019s criticism of the services was not found to be in breach of the law, since no criminal or civil action was initiated by the CWS against the applicant. In fact, the Children\u2019s Rights Ombudsman even concluded that \u201cthe CWS employees did not take all the steps to protect the boy\u2019s interests\u201d, thus giving credit to the applicant\u2019s criticism of the CWS.",

This coverage enhanced the negative impact of the words of the director of the CWS, and he was aware of this and took advantage of it in order to maximise that impact. Such behaviour is, to say the least, unprofessional.",

The newspaper\u2019s apology on 18 June 2001, although acknowledging the unethical character of the article and interview published on 15 June 2001, came too late and did not repair the tremendous damage already caused to the applicant and her son by the allegations of the director of the CWS. The same applies to the acknowledgment by the Vilnius Child Development Centre on 4 September 2001 that the director of the CWS had acted unethically in disclosing the applicant\u2019s son medical records.",
