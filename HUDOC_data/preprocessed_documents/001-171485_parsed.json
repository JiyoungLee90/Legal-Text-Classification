The Court notes that the issues raised by the applicant are essentially the same as those examined in the Gafgaz Mammadov case (cited above). The facts of both that case and the present case are similar to a significant degree. The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions made in the Gafgaz Mammadov case also apply to the applicant\u2019s first case. In particular, the Court noted the existence of serious concerns about the foreseeability and precision of the legislation governing public assemblies, and about the possibility of public assemblies being abusively banned or dispersed (ibid., \u00a7\u00a055); the doubts about the credibility of the formal ground, namely Article\u00a0310.1 of the CAO, relied on by the authorities to arrest and convict the participant of an unauthorised demonstration (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 56 and 62); a failure by the authorities to take into consideration the fact that the demonstration had been notified (ibid., \u00a7\u00a060); a lack of relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstration which had been intended to be peaceful and had been conducted in a peaceful manner (ibid., \u00a7 61); and a lack of any acknowledgment that the act of participating in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration was by itself protected by Article\u00a011 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 63-64). Having regard to the above, in the Gafgaz Mammadov case the Court found that the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of assembly had been violated on account of the dispersal of the demonstration and his arrest and conviction.",

The Court observes that the organisers did not submit proper prior notice to the BCEA of the demonstration of 10 March 2013. Examining the applicant\u2019s argument that no such notice was required by law, the Court notes that, indeed, in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 IV of the Law on Freedom of Assembly no prior written notification was required for \u201cspontaneous assemblies\u201d. Nevertheless, the applicant failed to sufficiently substantiate his allegation that the demonstration in which he had participated had been spontaneous. In such circumstances, the Court is ready to accept that the dispersal of the demonstration of 10 March 2013 was lawful (compare Ibrahimov and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 69234/11, 69252/11 and 69335/11, \u00a7\u00a7 74-75, 11 February 2016).",

It follows that for the same reasons as those outlined in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment, the Court concludes that the authorities in the present case did not adduce relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstration (see Gafgaz\u00a0Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 61). The authorities also failed to acknowledge that the act of participating in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration was by itself protected by Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 63-64).",

The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions made in that judgment also apply to the present cases. In particular, the Court noted that the administrative proceedings had lacked the necessary safeguards and guarantees, as there had been a lack of adequate time and facilities to prepare the defence (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 78-81); strong reliance by the domestic courts on the administrative offence report prepared by the police (ibid., \u00a7 85); utter disregard by the domestic courts of important factual circumstances and legal issues of the case, inter alia, the peaceful nature of the unauthorised demonstration (ibid., \u00a7 86); an absence of legal assistance at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a090-91); failure to provide an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of one\u2019s own choosing (ibid., \u00a7 92); and formalistic representation by a State-funded lawyer (ibid., \u00a7 93). Having regard to the above, the Court found that that the administrative offence proceedings against the applicant in the Gafgaz Mammadov case, considered as a whole, had not been in conformity with the guarantees of a fair hearing.",
