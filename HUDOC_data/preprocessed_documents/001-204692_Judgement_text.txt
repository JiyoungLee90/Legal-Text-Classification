The case originated in an application against Slovakia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) on 8 November 2019.
The applicant was represented by Mr Z. Perhács, a lawyer practising in Jelenec.
On 12 December 2019 the Government were given notice of the application.
The applicant’s details are set out in the appended table.
On 16 September 2014 the applicant filed a request for information with the Special Criminal Court pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (Law no. 211/2000 Coll.). The request concerned his surveillance by the State authorities in the period from 14 September 2008 to 11 December 2008.
On 18 September 2014 the Special Criminal Court refused to disclose the information requested, arguing that it was classified (utajovaná informácia). By decision of 20 October 2014 the Ministry of Justice, acting as the higher administrative body, upheld the decision of the Special Criminal Court.
On 28 October 2014 the applicant lodged an administrative action against the decision of the Ministry of Justice before the Bratislava Regional Court (‘the Regional Court’). On 28 September 2016 the Regional Court dismissed the action and the judgment was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 31 October 2016.
Upon the applicant’s cassation appeal, on 15 March 2018, the Supreme Court quashed the Regional Court’s judgment and remitted the case back before that court for a fresh examination. The Supreme Court’s judgment was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 10 April 2018.
By a new judgment of 23 May 2019, served on the applicant’s lawyer on 1 July 2019, the Regional Court quashed the decision of the Ministry of Justice and remitted the case back to the latter.
It appears from the applicant’s observations of 14 April 2020 that the proceedings before the administrative bodies are still pending. The Government did not provide any further information in that regard.
On 5 August 2016 the applicant lodged his first constitutional complaint challenging the length of the proceedings before the Regional Court.
On 3 August 2017 the Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint as manifestly ill-founded (II. US 508/2017). It examined the Regional Court’s conduct in the proceedings which had lasted from 28 October 2014 to 31 October 2016, i.e. for two years, and found, inter alia, that although the Regional Court had not acted without delays, those could not be qualified as unreasonable. It had regard to the fact that the proceedings before the Regional Court had been concluded at the time of its decision.
On 25 September 2018 the applicant lodged his second constitutional complaint challenging the length of the judicial proceedings as a whole. Although he requested the Constitutional Court to examine the overall length of the proceedings, the summary of the complaint was directed exclusively at the Regional Court.
On 20 August 2019 the Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint as manifestly ill-founded (I. US 305/2019). It held that although the Regional Court’s conduct had not been flawless or sufficiently effective, in light of all the circumstances and the overall length of the proceedings, the sum of the delays had not reached the required intensity. It had regard to the fact that the proceedings before the Regional Court had been concluded.
