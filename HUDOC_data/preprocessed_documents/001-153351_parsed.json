Where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of those under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.

It is not in dispute between the parties that on the day preceding the applicant\u2019s arrest he sustained two cuts. Whatever their origin, it is clear that he was engaged in a serious altercation before his arrest and was not taken into custody \u201cin good health\u201d. By way of substantiation that the scratches, bruises and other soft-tissue injuries complained of were sustained at the hands of the police, the applicant referred to the fact that on 30 January 2003 the forensic expert had recorded numerous injuries, which did not feature in the report by the ambulance team drafted on 29 January 2003. At the same time, he also submitted that the ambulance had been called precisely because he had no longer been able to withstand torture and that it had refused to record all the injuries properly. He also argued that he had been severely beaten during his arrest. The Court notes that these submissions are at odds with allegations that the injuries not featured in the report by the ambulance team were inflicted after its departure and that overall the applicant\u2019s submissions as regards the timing of his injuries lack consistency. It also observes that, as follows from the record of the questioning of 29 January 2003, the applicant, who was assigned a legal-aid lawyer on that date, did not raise any ill-treatment complaints before the investigator of the prosecutor\u2019s office, who was questioning him, and gave no self-incriminating statements. Contrary to the applicant\u2019s submissions, there is no evidence that the lawyer was absent during his questioning. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s defence strategy chosen on the day of his arrest remained the same throughout the proceedings. Namely, he always pleaded not guilty to the offences imputed to him. The Court finds no basis on which to draw an indirect inference that the applicant could have been subjected to either physical or mental pressure by the authorities in order to break his moral resistance (compare and contrast with Kovalchuk v. , no. 21958/05, \u00a7\u00a060, 4 November 2010 and Dushka v. , no. 29175/04, \u00a7\u00a052, 3 February 2011).",

For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, 28\u00a0October 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 102 et seq., Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII, and Savitskyy v. , no. 38773/05, \u00a7\u00a099, 26 July 2012). For an investigation to be effective, those responsible for and carrying out the investigation must be independent and impartial, in law and in practice. This means not only a lack of hierarchical or institutional connection with those implicated in the events but also a practical independence (see, e.g., Kolevi v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a01108/02, \u00a7 193, 5\u00a0November 2009). Moreover, the notion of an effective remedy in respect of an allegation of ill-treatment also entails effective access for the complainant to the investigation procedure (see Assenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 117).",

The questions posed by the investigative authority were largely directed at verifying whether the injuries complained of could have been sustained as a result of L.S. defending herself. The Court observes that the applicant provided very detailed descriptions as to the manner in which the police officers had purportedly tortured him (namely by twisting his fingers and stepping on them; putting plastic bags filled with smoke over his head; punching him while a book was pressed against his body, and so on). The only question possibly relating to verification of his account, whether there were signs of suffocation or strangling was considered by the forensic expert only in April 2003, more than two months after the incident. In the Court\u2019s view, this unexplained delay irretrievably affected the authorities\u2019 ability to collect vital evidence. No questions concerning other types of ill-treatment alleged by the applicant were posed at all. As regards the investigations of the incidents of 6 and 16 May 2003, as follows from the materials before the Court, they were entirely limited to questioning of the officers accused by the applicant of having beaten him and of their colleagues.",
