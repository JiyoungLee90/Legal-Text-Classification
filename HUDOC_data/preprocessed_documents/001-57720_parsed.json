As it did not act as prosecuting authority, save in exceptional cases (see paragraph 16 above), it was in their view neither party to the proceedings nor the opponent of anyone. Its sole task was to advise the Court and thereby help to ensure that its case-law was consistent: at the hearing, by making submissions; at the deliberations, by assisting in the drafting of the judgment. Its total impartiality was derived in particular from the independence which it enjoyed vis-\u00e0-vis the Minister of Justice and the lack of any hierarchical link between the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral of the Court of Cassation and the officials of the minist\u00e8re public in the lower courts. Recent statistics confirmed moreover that, as had been the case in the past, the submissions of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department were frequently in favour of the convicted person (see the above-mentioned Delcourt judgment, Series A no. 11, pp. 18-19, para. 34).

Appearances cannot, chameleon-like, change in respect of the same individual according to his interest in a case, because if the majority view is correct, the same individual may in one case consider the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Court of Cassation as an ally and in another case as a foe. And if there are two separate questions of law involved in a single appeal, he may even do so in one and the same case. The same applies also if there are two successive appeals to the Court of Cassation on two separate issues in the same case. This is in fact what actually happened in the present case, where the legal opinion of the very same avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral was in favour of the applicant\u2019s first appeal, which was in fact upheld, and against his second appeal, which was rejected. Obviously, the applicant was quite happy with one and, no less obviously, unhappy with the other.

But in the present judgment the Court says that, having regard to the grounds set out in Delcourt, it does not perceive any breach of the Convention requirements on the issue of the impartiality and independence of the Court of Cassation and its procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department.

After all, surely to look behind appearances at the realities of a given situation is in itself, as a general proposition of both law and common sense, perfectly sound. It is also something which the Court has explicitly done in quite a number of other cases besides Delcourt (see, for instance, the judgments of Deweer, Series A no. 35, p. 23, para. 44; Van Droogenbroeck, Series A no. 50, pp. 20-21, para. 38; Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth, Series A no. 52, pp. 24-25, para. 63).

The public submissions of the juge rapporteur constitute, in this system, the first stage of the process by which the Court forms its judgment (which is arrived at in camera) and I fail to appreciate why fairness demands that the parties, who already have had every opportunity to defend their case, should at that stage be heard again: lites finiri oportet.",

Firstly, because Article 141 of the Judicial Code (see paragraph 16 of the judgment) makes it clear that officials of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s office cannot be considered a party to the appeal in the ordinary sense of that notion. Secondly and more importantly, because under the case-law as it stands (see paragraph 3.5 above) this conclusion would imply that the court is saying that in view of the opinion of the avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral it cannot exclude the possibility that he is prejudiced.

During the last century the impossibility for the parties to reply to the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s submissions was often criticised (see, for example, the leader in Weekblad van het regt no. 238 (30 November 1841) and Mr. J. de Wal, Het regt van\u2019t laatste woord in cassatie (1869), but when the present Code of Criminal Procedure was enacted (1921) Article 440 was justified explicitly by pointing out the special position of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Supreme Court. This explanation was severely criticised by the leading handbook of those days (see A.J. Blok and L.CH. Besier, Het Nederlandsche Strafproces (1925) II, pp. 445 et seq., who used arguments in very much the same way as the majority in the present judgment), but that criticism has not been repeated by later writers.",

Joliet, Le droit institutionnnel des communaut\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes, Li\u00e8ge, 1981, p. 214; see also similarly: the judgments of Defrenne II (8 April 1976), Gravier (13 February 1985) and Blairot (2 April 1988) of the Court of Justice of the European Communities; see also and in particular the Marckx judgment of the European Court of Human Rights).",

The instant overruling of the European Court\u2019s case-law is all the more disturbing because it is based not only on the importance attached to appearances but also in response to \"[an] increased sensitivity of the public to the fair administration of justice\" (see paragraph 24 in fine of the present judgment). This new notion introduced by the Borgers judgment has no link with the previous case-law and contains a reference to \"the increased sensitivity of the public\" which is in my view extremely dangerous.",

The opinion of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department in civil proceedings (and clearly also social security, commercial, tax proceedings, etc.) can in no way violate the right of the defence or the principle of the equality of arms in the context of adversarial proceedings in which two - or indeed more - parties are opposed.",
