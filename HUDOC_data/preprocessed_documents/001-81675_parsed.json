The proceedings before the appellate instance took one year, three months and twenty-one days, ending on 27 December 2000. They were finally concluded some nine months later on 10 October 2001, when the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal. Thus the overall length was seven years, two months and seventeen days for three levels of jurisdiction, of which some two years is clearly not attributable to the authorities (see paragraph 27 above).",

It can also be seen from the District Court\u2019s judgment that the plaintiff\u2019s claims and evidence were vague and confusing and that the District Court had to examine the case in line with its own perception of the subject matter of the dispute. The Court observes that the applicants did not show due diligence in the case and did not facilitate the courts\u2019 examination of it. Thus their conduct prolonged the proceedings.",
