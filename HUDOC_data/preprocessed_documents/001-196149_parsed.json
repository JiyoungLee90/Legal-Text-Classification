The applicant denied that he was suffering from a serious mental disorder and argued that bribery was involved in the process of his psychiatric examination. He also stated that his relationship with his wife had been unbearable, since she had swindled him and frequently ridiculed him in front of others and that, as a result, he wanted to divorce her. The applicant also urged the judge to read \u201cArticle 48 of the European law\u201d and \u201cArticle 32 of the Armenian law\u201d. The presiding judge asked the applicant\u2019s wife to explain the reasons why she sought to deprive the applicant of his legal capacity. The applicant\u2019s wife firstly confirmed that they had had a conflictual relationship over the past 12\u00a0years and one of the reasons for this was that the applicant was overly jealous and suspicious. In addition, she stated that the applicant had threatened to stab himself with a knife. She explained that when the applicant filed the divorce and eviction claim, she had felt compelled to lodge an application seeking to declare him incapable.",

It was questionable whether the stated illness, namely \u201cdelusional disorder\u201d, in fact deprived him of the ability to understand the meaning of his actions, as the contested judgment did not state any example or situation in which his alleged incapability was displayed. In addition, the District Court had failed to order a new medical assessment of his mental health and relied on the outdated opinion of 25\u00a0September 2012. Relying on Article 8 of the Convention and the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Shtukaturov v. Russia (no. 44009/05, ECHR 2008), the applicant argued that the failure of the domestic courts to scrutinise closely the degree of his illness was a breach of his right to private life. The applicant also submitted that the motivation of the applicant\u2019s wife to deprive him of legal capacity was to deprive him of his flat. Finally, the applicant also expressed discontent with regard to his procedural status of a \u201cthird party\u201d, as he could not be a mere \u201cthird party\u201d in a case concerning deprivation of his legal capacity.",

It concluded that, in such circumstances, requiring the applicant to seek judicial protection as regards the appointment of his guardian exclusively through his guardian was, at least, ineffective in practice.

Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Stanev, cited above, \u00a7 230, and Nataliya Mikhaylenko, cited above, \u00a7 31).",

Thus, domestic law imposed a blanket ban on the applicant\u2019s access to court in all spheres of life. Furthermore, as will be discussed below under Article 8 of the Convention, the domestic legal system did not differentiate between different degrees of incapacity for persons suffering from a mental disorder and did not provide for measures of protection tailored to the individual needs of the person concerned. Thus, such questions as to whether the applicant could understand the meaning of divorce or eviction and whether he could act autonomously in that sphere of life, including defending his rights before the courts, without causing disruption to the proper administration of justice or harm to himself or others, were never addressed and answered. Therefore, it is questionable whether such a blanket ban on the applicant\u2019s access to court, which resulted in his inability to pursue his divorce and eviction claim, pursued any legitimate aim. The Court, however, does not find it necessary to answer that question conclusively since, even assuming that it did, the restriction on the applicant\u2019s access to court was, in any event, unjustified in the particular circumstances of the case for the following reasons.",

Furthermore, the applicant himself applied to that body and requested that his opinion be taken into account when appointing his guardian (see paragraph 29 above). However, as it follows from the decision of the Court of Cassation of 28 September 2016, the body of guardianship and trusteeship failed to hear the applicant and appointed his son as his guardian, despite the fact that the applicant apparently had a conflictual relationship with his son and opposed his appointment. In this connection the Court stresses the importance of respecting Principle 8 of Recommendation No.\u00a0R\u00a0(99)\u00a04 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (see paragraph 71 above). It also refers to Article 12 \u00a7 4 of the CRPD which requires appropriate and effective safeguards ensuring that measures relating to the exercise of legal capacity by persons with disabilities be free of conflict of interest and undue influence (see paragraph 73 above) and which Armenia, by adhering to the CRPD, undertook to take into consideration (see Guberina v. Croatia, no. 23682/13, \u00a7 92, 22 March 2016). Those principles were of particular significance for the applicant in the present case since, being fully deprived of his legal capacity and, as a result, of his right of access to court, the only proper and effective means of protection of his legal interests before the courts was through a conflict-free guardianship.",

In this connection the Court observes that the District Court failed to carry out any examination of the question of whether the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s request to withdraw the claim was in the applicant\u2019s best interest and to provide any explanation for its decision to accept that request (see paragraphs 31 and 34 above). It is not clear on what ground the District Court stated that the applicant\u2019s son had been appointed as the applicant\u2019s guardian upon his consent and at his wish, a finding which, as already indicated above, was later rebutted by the Court of Cassation. The Court therefore considers that the domestic court failed to carry out the necessary scrutiny and oversight when deciding to accept the request to withdraw the applicant\u2019s claim and that consequently the termination of the divorce and eviction proceedings was unjustified.",

In particular, the right to ask a court to review a declaration of incapacity was one of the most important rights for the person concerned since such a procedure, once initiated, would be decisive for the exercise of all the rights and freedoms affected by the declaration of incapacity (see Stanev, cited above, \u00a7 241, and Nataliya Mikhaylenko, cited above, \u00a7 37). This right was therefore one of the fundamental procedural rights for the protection of those who had been partially or fully deprived of legal capacity. Hence, such persons should in principle enjoy direct access to the courts in this sphere (see Stanev, cited above, \u00a7 241, and Nataliya Mikhaylenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38-40).",

Nevertheless, it seems clear that this problem may be solved by other, less restrictive means than automatic denial of direct access, for example by limiting the frequency with which applications may be made or introducing a system for prior examination of their admissibility on the basis of the file (see Stanev, cited above, \u00a7 242).",

The Court also notes that such blanket prohibition on direct access to court was not in line with the general trend at European level. In particular, the comparative analysis conducted in the case of Stanev showed that seventeen of the twenty national legal systems studied provided at the time for direct access to the courts for persons who had been declared fully incapable (see Stanev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 88-90 and 243). In the applicant\u2019s case this situation was further exacerbated by the fact that the authorities had failed to ensure a conflict-free guardianship (see paragraph 95 above). Lastly, the Court considers it irrelevant whether the request lodged by the applicant in August 2014 could be considered as a \u201cproper application lodged with a court\u201d because, even assuming that it was not, the prohibition on the applicant\u2019s access to court was enshrined in law and the applicant cannot be held accountable for not trying to initiate a procedure which he had no right to initiate by law.",

In this connection, the Court observes that the applicant was indeed initially excluded from the hearing at which the District Court decided to divest him of his legal capacity, since he was not a party to those proceedings (see paragraph 15 above). However, this shortcoming was remedied by the Civil Court of Appeal which quashed that judgment specifically on that ground and remitted the case for a fresh examination (see paragraph 20 above). During the new examination of the case the applicant was granted status as a third party, allowing him to enjoy all the main procedural rights of a party, including the right to be present, make submissions, lodge requests and appeal against decisions. As a result, the applicant was summoned and took part in almost all the hearings before the District Court (see, by contrast, Shtukaturov, cited above, \u00a7 69; X and Y v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 5193/09, \u00a7 81, 3 November 2011; and Lashin v. Russia, no.\u00a033117/02, \u00a7 82, 22 January 2013). Furthermore, contrary to the applicant\u2019s claim, it follows from the materials of the case that he actually made submissions before the District Court and that questions were posed to him by the examining judge (see paragraph 24 above). The Court cannot therefore accept the applicant\u2019s argument that his participation in the hearing was of a purely formal nature. The Court notes that the applicant did not provide any other, more specific arguments in support of his allegations of an unfair trial. In such circumstances, the allegations of an unfair trial and lack of adversarial procedure, as formulated by the applicant, are not sufficient for the Court to conclude that the conduct of the proceedings as a whole did not guarantee the applicant a fair hearing.",

A stricter scrutiny is called for in respect of very serious limitations in the sphere of private life. In this connection the Court is mindful that depriving someone of legal capacity entails grave consequences for various spheres of that person\u2019s life (see Shtukaturov, cited above, \u00a7 88; X and Y v.\u00a0Croatia, cited above, \u00a7 109; and Lashin, cited above, \u00a7 81).",

The Court does not cast doubt on the competence of the doctors who examined the applicant and the findings of that report. However, the Court has held in a number of cases that the existence of a mental disorder, even a serious one, cannot be the sole reason to justify full deprivation of legal capacity. By analogy with the cases concerning deprivation of liberty, in order to justify full deprivation of legal capacity the mental disorder must be \u201cof a kind or degree\u201d warranting such a measure (see Shtukaturov, cited above, \u00a7 94, and Lashin, cited above, \u00a7 90). Both in Shtukaturov and Lashin the Court found that in the domestic proceedings the issue of \u201cthe kind and degree\u201d of the applicant\u2019s mental illness remained unresolved, since Russian law did not provide for any intermediate form of limitation of legal capacity for mentally ill persons and distinguished only between full capacity and full incapacity.",

The Armenian law similarly did not provide for any borderline or tailor-made response in situations like the applicant\u2019s and distinguished only between full capacity and full incapacity. Thus, the questions posed to the doctors, as formulated by the judge, similarly did not concern \u201cthe kind and degree\u201d of the applicant\u2019s mental illness. As a result, the psychiatric expert opinion of 25 September 2012 did not analyse the degree of the applicant\u2019s incapacity in sufficient detail. It referred to the applicant\u2019s overly suspicious and at times aggressive behaviour, incoherent thoughts and inclination for conflict, and concluded that the applicant suffered from delusional disorder and was therefore unable to understand his actions and to control them. At the same time, the report did not explain what kind of actions the applicant was incapable of understanding or controlling. The incidence of the applicant\u2019s illness is unclear, as are the possible consequences of the applicant\u2019s illness for his social life, health, pecuniary interests, and so on. The opinion of 25 September 2012 was not sufficiently clear on these points. Nor did it allege any self-destructive or otherwise grossly irresponsible behaviour on the part of the applicant or that he was partially or completely unable to take care of himself (see, mutatis mutandis, Shtukaturov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94, and Lashin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a090-91). Assuming, nevertheless, that the applicant\u2019s condition required some sort measure of protection in his respect, the Court notes that, as already indicated above, the domestic court had no other choice than to apply and maintain full incapacity \u2013 the most stringent measure which meant total loss of autonomy in nearly all areas of life (see, by contrast, A.M.V. v. Finland, no. 53251/13, \u00a7\u00a7 89-90, 23 March 2017).",

Germany [GC], nos. 10211/12 and 27505/14, \u00a7 131, 4 December 2018). In the present case, the Court notes that the psychiatric expert opinion was issued on 25 September 2012, that is more than fourteen months before the judgment of the District Court declaring the applicant incapable and almost a year and a half before the decision of the Civil Court of Appeal upholding that judgment. That opinion, in the Court\u2019s view, cannot be regarded as \u201cup-to-date\u201d within the meaning of Principle 12 of the above-mentioned Committee of Ministers Recommendation No.\u00a0R\u00a0(99)\u00a04 (see, mutatis mutandis, H.F. v. Slovakia, no. 54797/00, \u00a7 41, 8\u00a0November 2005). Furthermore, it was the first time that the applicant had been subjected to a psychiatric medical examination, as he had no history of mental illness, and nothing in the case file suggests that the applicant\u2019s condition was irreversible. The Court considers that, in such circumstances, the domestic courts should have sought some sort of fresh assessment of the applicant\u2019s condition (see, mutatis mutandis, Lashin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84). The District Court, however, relied solely on that opinion without questioning whether it credibly reflected the applicant\u2019s state of mental health at the material time, while the Civil Court of Appeal made reference to the absence of any evidence rebutting the findings of that report or suggesting that the applicant had recovered, despite the fact that it was the duty of the domestic courts to seek such evidence and, if necessary, to assign a new medical examination.",

It notes, firstly, that while the applicant did not specifically use the word \u201cproportionality\u201d in his submissions before the domestic courts, he raised the question of the disproportionate nature of the interference in substance. Secondly, the Court notes that the full deprivation of the applicant\u2019s legal capacity \u2013 a measure which the Court found to be disproportionate in the circumstances of the case \u2013 was, as already indicated above, the only measure which the domestic court was competent to apply under domestic law in the absence of any intermediate form of limitation of legal capacity for mentally ill persons. In other words, the domestic law itself deprived the domestic court of the possibility to assess the proportionality of the applicable measure in cases requiring a restriction of legal capacity. It is therefore doubtful that raising that issue, whether explicitly or in substance, had or could have had any prospects of success. In sum, the Court considers that the applicant has exhausted the domestic remedies and dismisses the Government\u2019s objection.",
