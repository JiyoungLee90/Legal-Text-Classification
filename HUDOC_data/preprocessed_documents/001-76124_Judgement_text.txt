The case originated in an application (no. 41514/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mrs Jelena Stevančevič (“the applicant”), on 6 November 2002.
The applicant was represented by the Verstovšek lawyers. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, State Attorney-General.
The applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts to which she was a party was excessive. In substance, she also complained about the lack of an effective domestic remedy in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings (Article 13 of the Convention).
On 15 September 2004 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Šoštanj.
On 24 August 1998 the applicant was injured in a car accident. The perpetrator of the accident had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZM.
On 8 April 1999 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZM in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 4,136,681 Slovenian tolars (approximately 17,240 euros) for the injuries sustained.
On 19 January 2000 and 17 October 2002 the applicant lodged preliminary written submissions.
On 19 January and 16 October 2001 she made requests that a date be set for a hearing.
Of the two hearings held on 19 February and 5 November 2002, neither was adjourned at the request of the applicant.
During the proceedings, the court appointed a medical expert.
At the last hearing, the parties reached a conditional court settlement. On 6 November 2002 ZM revoked the settlement and the court consequently delivered a written judgment. The judgment, upholding the applicant’s claim in part, was served on the applicant on 9 December 2002.
On 24 December 2002 the applicant appealed to the  (Višje sodišče v Celju). ZM cross-appealed.
On 5 May 2004 the court allowed both appeals in part.
The judgment was served on the applicant on 24 August 2004.
On 21 September 2004 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court (Vrhovno sodišče) and requested that a Supreme Court’s judge stepped down.
On 25 January 2005 the President of the Supreme Court issued a decision rejecting the applicant’s request to exclude a judge from the proceedings.
The proceedings are still pending.
