In taking this decision the court considered, among other relevant factors, the child\u2019s strong affection for the applicant and the warm and trusting relationship which existed between them. The court established, on the other hand, that the child had an ambiguous relationship with his father S.\u00a0B. Witness M., a child psychiatrist of the Novosibirsk Regional Children\u2019s Psychoneurological Clinical Centre (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0435\u0440), submitted that she had seen Yar. B. on two occasions. In March 2008 the boy had been accompanied by both parents. The major complaints during the first visit were the child\u2019s problems with speech, and appropriate medication was prescribed. During the second visit, in August 2008, the child was accompanied only by his mother. He submitted that he was worried about his parents\u2019 divorce proceedings. He also said that his father S.\u00a0B. hit him on the hands and shouted at him, and that he wanted his parents to be divorced. He submitted that he had sleeping problems and that he feared that when he fell asleep his father would come and take him away. M. found that the divorce proceedings were having an effect on the child: his stammering had worsened and he had become unhappy and fearful. She diagnosed the boy with childhood anxiety, phobic disorder and stammering, and recommended medication, sessions with a psychologist, and family therapy. It was further recommended that the child\u2019s communication with his father be assessed and that the father be communicated with. The court further established that the boy had not lived with his father S.\u00a0B. since August\u00a02008. S.\u00a0B. had not been paying the child support ordered by the court in August 2008. He had taken no interest in the child\u2019s education. The Novosibirsk Regional Department of Education had been unable to get in touch with S.\u00a0B., who was avoiding all contact. It had therefore been impossible to make a full assessment of the latter\u2019s personality. The court expressed concern at the behaviour of S.\u00a0B., who, knowing of the proceedings pending, deliberately changed the child\u2019s place of residence by abducting him, and had been hiding the child ever since, thus disrupting the latter\u2019s usual lifestyle and preventing the child from communicating with his mother. S.\u00a0B. acted through his representative in the proceedings.",

The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and cooperation of all concerned are always important ingredients. Whilst the national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such cooperation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited, since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, as should be, more particularly, the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article\u00a08 of the Convention (see P.P. v. Poland, no. 8677/03, \u00a7\u00a082, 8\u00a0January 2008; Hokkanen, cited above, \u00a7 53; and Ignaccolo-Zenide v.\u00a0Romania, no. 31679/96, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2000I).

In particular, on 19 October and 29 October 2009 S.\u00a0B. was brought in to the Zayeltsovskiy District UVD for questioning; he admitted that the boy lived with him, yet refused to divulge his whereabouts. On 5 July 2010 S.\u00a0B. was brought in to the Novosibirsk Regional GUVD for questioning. He once again limited himself to saying that the child lived with him, and promised to appear at the GUVD the following day accompanied by his lawyer, which he did not do. On all three occasions the police let S.\u00a0B. go, without taking any initiative to ascertain whether in fact the child lived with him, whether the former attended any school, or any other question relating to the child. Subsequently, on 22\u00a0December 2010 S.\u00a0B. was seen in the company of three police officers at the applicant\u2019s office in Novosibirsk. In March 2011 he was again apprehended by the Novosibirsk Dzerzhinskiy District Economic Crimes Bureau. There is no evidence, however, that on any occasion after the institution of the enforcement proceedings in January 2010 the police had any contact with the Bailiffs\u2019 Service with a view to working out together a clear idea or plan of action as to what could and should be done to find Yar.\u00a0B. and enforce the judgment of 12\u00a0March 2009 (see Khanamirova v.

Furthermore, S.\u00a0B. had been participating in court proceedings through his representatives (see paragraphs 11 and 89 above).
