Russia, no. 59498/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-42, ECHR 2002-III; Ka\u00e7ar\u00a0and Others v.

The Court considers that there is nothing to warrant a departure from its findings in the previous cases. It notes that the authorities effected the first payment two years and five months after the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision and that the second payment was made almost seven years after the said decision. Consequently, the Court finds that the delay in the payment of the additional compensation awarded by the domestic courts was attributable to the expropriating authority and caused the owners to sustain loss additional to that of the expropriated land. As a result of that delay and the length of the proceedings as a whole, the Court finds that the applicants have had to bear an individual and excessive burden that has upset the fair balance that must be maintained between the demands of the general interest and protection of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see M.\u00a0Kaplan\u00a0v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 29016/04, \u00a7\u00a7 16-19, 9 December 2008).",
