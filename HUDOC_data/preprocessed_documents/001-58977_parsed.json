The Government disagreed with the Commission, arguing that the nature and severity of the penalty at stake in the present case was not such as to bring the matter into the criminal sphere. They pointed out that the amount of the maximum penalty, i.e. ATS 400,000, although very high, was the only element which distinguished the present case from the Putz v. Austria judgment of 22 February 1996, (Reports of judgments and decisions 1996-I), in which the Court came to the conclusion that Article 6 was not applicable. Referring to the Court\u2019s Bendenoun v. France judgment of 24 February 1994 (Series A no. 284), the Government further argued that the amount of the penalty alone could not suffice to conclude that the proceedings at issue fell within the criminal sphere. Moreover, the prison term in default which was at stake in the present case, was considerably shorter than the one at stake in the Ravnsborg case. The fact that the fine in the present case could be converted into a prison term without any further hearing could not justify the conclusion that Article 6 was applicable.",
