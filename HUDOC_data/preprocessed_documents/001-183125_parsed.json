The court noted that the judgment of 2 July 2010 ordering the return of the child had not been enforced, and found that the child had in the meantime settled in a new environment in Ukraine. In that regard the court referred to the psychological and pedagogical report which concluded that the child was attached to his mother and that discussion about his father caused him feelings of fear. It also examined reports by the local childcare authorities suggesting that the child should live with his mother. The court found that the child was being given appropriate care by his mother and that it would be in his best interests to stay with his mother.

In addition, when difficulties appear, mainly as a result of a refusal by the parent with whom the child lives to comply with the decision ordering the child\u2019s prompt return, the appropriate authorities should then impose adequate sanctions in respect of this lack of cooperation. Although coercive measures against children are not desirable in this sensitive area, the use of sanctions must not be ruled out in the event of manifestly unlawful behaviour by the parent with whom the child lives (see Maire v.

(see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). Accordingly, the judicial proceedings leading to the final judgment in the case lasted for about one year. In previous cases similar periods have given rise to violations of the Convention (see, for example, Monory v. Romania and Hungary, no.\u00a071099/01, \u00a7 82, 5 April 2005, Karrer v.

The bailiffs started the enforcement procedure by allowing B. a short period for the voluntary execution of the return order. However, nothing suggests that either at that early stage or later during the enforcement proceedings the authorities ever considered arrangements for voluntary compliance with the return order, for example, by developing a comprehensive compliance strategy. Moreover, the childcare and family services were not involved in that regard. This significantly diminished the possibilities for cooperation with the abducting parent. Indeed, the only instance of constructive negotiation between the parties took place on 25\u00a0January 2011, but in the event turned out to be unsuccessful (see paragraph 28 above). Although, admittedly, the voluntary execution is always preferable (see, mutatis mutandis, Cengiz K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a016192/06, \u00a7\u00a0132 in fine, 6 December 2011 and Kacper Nowakowski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 32407/13, \u00a7 87, 10 January 2017), the Court observes that the entrenched positions often taken by the parents in such cases can render such voluntary execution difficult making it necessary, in appropriate cases, to have recourse to proportionate coercive measures.",

It is noted that the relevant court hearings were attended by the mother, who resided quite openly at two places of residence, both of which were known to the authorities. For a considerable period of time the second applicant was attending a state school and nothing suggests that there had been any real difficulty in identifying his whereabouts. At a certain point, the domestic courts concluded that placing the child in temporary care was not an available option under the domestic law in the applicants\u2019 case (see\u00a0paragraph 33). Accordingly, the requests made by the bailiffs demonstrated not only their inactivity, but also their lack of co-ordination with the other authorities in order to secure effective enforcement of the return order.

Taking into account the principles outlined above, according to which the best interests of the child must be the primary consideration, the Court accepts that a change in the relevant circumstances may exceptionally justify the nonenforcement of a final return order (see Sylvester v. Austria, nos. 36812/97 and 40104/98, \u00a7 63, 24\u00a0April 2003). However, having regard to the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 8 and the general requirement of respect for the rule of law, the Court must be satisfied that \u201cthe change of the relevant facts\u201d was not brought about by the State\u2019s failure to take all measures that could reasonably be expected to facilitate the enforcement of the return order (see Sylvester, cited above, \u00a7 63 and S\u00e9v\u00e8re v.

The Court notes that since his removal from the Czech Republic in 2009, the second applicant had been constantly living with his mother in Ukraine, separately from the first applicant. Therefore, the finding of the Ukrainian courts in 2014 that the child had adapted well to living in Ukraine was not surprising, having regard to the considerable period of time which had passed by that time. However, the Court considers that the passage of time leading to such a finding had been mainly imputable to the Ukrainian authorities who had not dealt swiftly with the return request and who had failed to take appropriate measures to enforce the return order. Accordingly, by the time of the court decisions referred to by the Government, the domestic authorities had already failed to ensure the effective protection of the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their family life.",
