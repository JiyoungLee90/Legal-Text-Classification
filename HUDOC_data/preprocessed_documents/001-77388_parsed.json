In a final judgment of 23 December 2005 that court fully quashed the lower courts' judgments and awarded the applicant BGN\u00a05,000 (2,556.46 euros (EUR)), plus interest as from 2 November 2000, the date of the filing of the action. It also ordered the defendants to pay the applicant's legal costs, amounting to BGN 1,340 (EUR\u00a0685.13). The court described in some detail the unfolding of the criminal proceedings against the applicant and his pre-trial detention, and found that the applicant's reliance on the provisions of the Convention was wellfounded. It stated that the length of the pre-trial detention had breached the law. It also found that at the material time and until 2003 Bulgarian law did not set any timelimits for finishing the pre-trial phase of criminal proceedings. The provision that controlled this was therefore Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which was part of domestic law. The period between 1991 and 2003 \u2013 throughout which the criminal charges against the applicant had not been determined and during which the applicant could not use any mechanism to speed up the proceedings \u2013 was significant and exceeded the reasonable time for examining the case. In such situations, where national law did not provide a possibility to vindicate infringed rights, they could be vindicated under international treaties which had been ratified by  and had become part of its domestic law. For instance, Article 13 of the Convention, thus applicable, required an effective remedy against any alleged violation of that Convention. The inaction of the investigation and the prosecution authorities and the courts had infringed the applicant's right to a trial within a reasonable time and had caused him nonpecuniary damage. Taking into account that the applicant had sustained non-pecuniary damage on account of a pre-trial detention exceeding the time-limit provided by law and the failure to bring the criminal proceedings against him to an end between 1995 and 2003, and ruling in equity, the court considered that the damage could be made good by an award of BGN\u00a05,000. It did not order the applicant to pay any court fees or costs for the remainder of his claim.",

During its visit to the Burgas Prison the CPT found that the conditions (in particular, the overcrowding and the poor lighting and ventilation) in the cells accommodating inmates suffering from tuberculosis, coupled with the limited possibilities for outdoor exercise, were conducive to the spread of the disease.

This conclusion was confirmed in the 1999 report, no significant improvement having been noted (see paragraphs 66 and 67 above). In this latter report the CPT also observed that the measures taken to screen cases of tuberculosis in the prisons were inadequate and that the conditions in which inmates suffering from that disease were kept in the Burgas Prison were conducive to the spread of the disease (see paragraph 68 above).

As regards the Varna Prison, it seems that there the applicant was allowed to take a daily fortyminute walk.

The judgment did not mirror the cause of the applicant's action, which was different from the length of his pre-trial detention and the duration of the criminal proceedings against him. Despite being a welcome development, it was an isolated incident and did not represent the established caselaw of the Bulgarian courts in respect of claims relating to length of pre-trial detention or of criminal proceedings. One could not deduce from it that there existed effective remedies in respect of such violations. On the contrary, it could be used to bar the successful prosecution of a claim under section 2(2) of the State Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988 on res judicata grounds. It failed to specify how much money was awarded in respect of each of the breaches of the applicant's rights identified in it.

Bulgaria (dec.), no.\u00a047092/99, 3 March 2005; and also, mutatis mutandis, Ble\u010di\u0107 v. Croatia [GC], no. 59532/00, \u00a7\u00a7 6668, ECHR 2006...). Before going into the merits of each complaint, the Court must be satisfied of the applicant's continuing status as a victim in respect of it, this question being relevant at all stages of the proceedings (see, as a recent authority, Scordino (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7\u00a0179). The Court reiterates on this point that a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of this status unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 180). Although these acknowledgement and redress are most often the result of the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies, they need not always be (see, by way of example, Schlader v. Austria (dec.), no.\u00a030193/96, 7 March 2000; Hellum v. Norway (dec.), no. 36437/97, 5\u00a0September 2000; T\u00edm\u00e1r v. Hungary (dec.), no. 36186/97, 3 May 2001; Fiecek v. Poland (dec.), no. 27913/95, 23 October 2001; Lacko and Others v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 47237/99, 2 July 2002; Ekimdjiev, cited above; Kaplan v.

It is therefore immaterial for assessing the applicant's victim status whether the compensation awarded by the Supreme Court of Cassation was a direct result of his claim made under the State Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988 and, accordingly, whether that court ruled, as alleged by the applicant, on an issue which was different from the one in fact brought before it. It also follows from the above that the Court's ruling in the instant case has no bearing on its assessment of whether there exist in Bulgaria effective domestic remedies in respect of allegedly excessively lengthy detentions pending trial or allegedly unreasonably lengthy criminal proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Holzinger v.  (no. 1), no. 23459/94, \u00a7\u00a7 2021, ECHR 2001I).",

Although that court's reasoning on these points could have been more precise, the Court accepts that it did acknowledge the failure of the domestic authorities to comply with Articles 5 \u00a7 3 and 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in these respects (see, mutatis mutandis, Hansen and Others v.

This award came at the close of proceedings which had lasted a little over five years for three levels of court. While the duration of such proceedings may have an impact on the amount which needs to be awarded in order to be considered as sufficient redress of the violation (see, mutatis mutandis, Scordino (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 20507), the Court is satisfied that, in the circumstances, the sum which the defendants \u2013 the Prosecutor's Office and the Varna Regional Investigation Service \u2013 were ordered to pay was adequate in this respect. Regarding the costs of the proceedings, which are another factor bearing on the adequacy of the redress (ibid., mutatis mutandis, \u00a7 201), the Court first notes that the defendants were also ordered to reimburse the expenses incurred by the applicant. It also notes that, since the applicant's action was characterised by the courts as being one under section 1 of the State Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988, he was, in line with section 10(2) of that Act, not required to pay up front the court fee for filing it. Moreover, while at the close of the proceedings the Supreme Court of Cassation only partially granted his claim, it apparently disregarded the command of the same section 10(2), and did not order him to pay the defendants' costs and the court fees corresponding to the remainder of his claim (see paragraphs 46 and 59 above).",

Austria, judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, p. 40 \u00a7 14). Since what is at stake is the fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Article 5, the authorities must take as much care in fixing appropriate bail as in deciding whether or not continued detention is indispensable (see Iwa\u0144czuk v. Poland, no. 25196/94, \u00a7 66, 15 November 2001). It follows that where an accused remains in custody despite an order for his or her release on bail, the question whether or not its amount is justified is an issue concerning the lawfulness of the continued detention and must be subject to judicial review, in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see, mutatis mutandis, Asenov v.

The effective enjoyment of the right to compensation guaranteed by that provision must be ensured with a sufficient degree of certainty (see N.C. v.

Such compensation covers the nonpecuniary and the pecuniary damage suffered on account of the criminal proceedings and the detention imposed during their pendency (see paragraphs 57 and 58 above). The applicant was acquitted in a final judgment of 18 April 2005 of the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraph 24 above). From that moment on, he could have made a claim under section 2 of the Act. The Court considers that the compensation due to the applicant under that provision as a result of his acquittal is indissociable from any compensation he might have been entitled to under Article 5 \u00a7 5 of the Convention as a consequence of his deprivation of liberty being contrary to paragraphs 3 or 4 thereof (ibid., mutatis mutandis, \u00a7 57). It follows that the Bulgarian legal system affords him, with a sufficient degree of certainty, a right to compensation for his detention. It is true that this is so only because of his final acquittal. Had it been otherwise, he would have probably not been entitled to any compensation under the abovementioned provision. However, this is not decisive, as the Court's task is not to review the law in abstracto, but to determine whether the manner in which it affected the applicant gave rise to a violation of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 55 and 56).",

Firstly, that averment is speculative. Secondly, the impossibility to obtain compensation will, even if the averment is true, stem solely from the fact that the applicant has already been awarded compensation \u2013 accepted by the Court as sufficient to deprive him of his victim status in respect of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03 (see paragraphs 9093 above) \u2013 for his deprivation of liberty.
