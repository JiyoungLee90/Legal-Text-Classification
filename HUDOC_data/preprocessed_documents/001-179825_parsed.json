The court held that one of the buildings belonging to J.P. had previously been a school building, but since 1992 it had been registered in the register of immovable property as a residential building. The court observed that some mistakes had been made in the process of restoring both J.P.\u2019s mother\u2019s and the applicants\u2019 father\u2019s property rights. The court further held that the conclusion of the Var\u0117na District Court that J.P. was entitled to a plot of land measuring 0.51 hectares was unfounded. Although there were some buildings on the land that had been returned to the applicants\u2019 father, the exact size of the plot necessary in order for the buildings to be used had not been determined. Moreover, although the applicants and J.P. had provided some evidence, this was insufficient to prove that the size of the plot of land under the buildings had to be 0.51 hectares.

The court considered that the person who had measured the land for the applicants had not marked the house in that area, and had not taken any actions to find out who the owner of the house was; therefore, he was the person who had made a mistake. The court noted that in fact 0.5019 hectares overlapped the applicants\u2019 land, but as J.P. was not asking for this, only 0.4863 hectares of land had to be taken from the applicants.

The member of the Seimas asked for explanations about the procedure for restoring the applicants\u2019 property rights and why their property rights to the 0.4863 hectares of land had not been restored. In May 2015 the Var\u0117na Division of the National Land Service explained that the applicants\u2019 property rights to the plot of land of 0.4863 hectares had been annulled in accordance with the decisions of the domestic courts (see paragraphs\u00a017-19 above). In January 2014 the applicants had been asked to choose the means by which they wished their property rights in respect of the 0.4863 hectares of land to be restored (see paragraph 20 above), but they still insisted on having the land returned in natura (see paragraph 21 above), which was not possible. The Var\u0117na Division of the National Land Service also provided detailed information about monetary compensation as a means of restoring the applicants\u2019 property rights. The monetary compensation procedure could be started after the applicants submitted a request for their property rights to be restored by means of monetary compensation. As a preliminary estimate, the value of the plot at issue was estimated at 217 euros (EUR).",

The applicants were also informed that the procedure could be started after a request to restore their property rights by means of monetary compensation was received by the authorities (see paragraph 42 below). The preliminary estimate as to the value of the plot was also indicated as being EUR 217. It appears that the applicants did not reply to this letter, nor did they submit a request for monetary compensation, but the National Land Service calculated the compensation at EUR 433 after having adjusted it in line with the inflation index, and on 12\u00a0July 2017 invited the applicants to come and discuss the restoration of their property rights. The meeting was adjourned once until 25 July 2017 because the applicants\u2019 lawyer had holidays planned. On 24 July 2017 the applicants\u2019 lawyer asked to adjourn the meeting again because one of the applicants was ill, but she did not provide any documents confirming this. The National Land Service decided to hold a meeting as planned on 25 July 2017, and issued a decision to restore the applicants\u2019 property rights to the 0.4863 hectares of land by paying them monetary compensation of EUR 433.60. One of the applicants collected the decision on 8\u00a0September 2017. The decision was not appealed against.",

After the decisions of the domestic courts had become final, the applicants had been informed of the necessity for them to express how they wanted their property rights to be restored. However, they had constantly asked for restitution in natura, which was not possible. The Government stated that the applicants could still have their property rights in respect of 0.4863 hectares of land restored, but they were preventing this process by not expressing their wish. Contrary to the applicants\u2019 statements, there was no vacant land between their land and J.P.\u2019s land, as it belonged to the heirs of the third party. The applicants could also receive monetary compensation, but had never submitted a request to receive it. Only in their submissions to the Court had the applicants mentioned an equivalent plot of land or monetary compensation as a means of restoring their property rights. Lastly, as the applicants had still not indicated to the authorities the specific way in which they wanted their property rights to be restored, the authorities had started the procedure of paying them monetary compensation. The value of the land had been calculated, adjusted in line with the inflation index and estimated at EUR 433.60.",

Lithuania, no.\u00a02657/10, \u00a7 62, 18 April 2017; Pyrantien\u0117 v. Lithuania, no. 45092/07, \u00a7\u00a048, 12 November 2013; and Pauk\u0161tis v.

Indeed, finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, the Court has declared that it will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation. This logic applies to such fundamental changes in a country\u2019s system as the transition from a totalitarian regime to a democratic form of government and the reform of the State\u2019s political, legal and economic structure, phenomena which inevitably involve the enactment of large-scale economic and social legislation (see Pyrantien\u0117, \u00a7 46, and Pauk\u0161tis, \u00a7 80, both cited above). In these circumstances the Court accepts that the deprivation of property experienced by the applicants served not only the interests of J.P., as the owner of the buildings on the land in question, but also the general interests of society as a whole (see Pyrantien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 48, and the references therein, see also paragraph 44 above).",
