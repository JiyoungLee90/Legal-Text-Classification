Under the second, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge\u2019s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his impartiality.  In this respect even appearances may be of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public. This implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held objectively justified (see the Hauschildt judgment, cited above, p. 21, para. 48, and, mutatis mutandis, the Fey v.  judgment of 24 February 1993, Series A no. 255-A, p. 12, para. 30).",

In the first place, the judgment of 2 June 1988 of the Caltanisetta Assize Court of Appeal, presided over by Judge S.P. (see paragraph 26 above) contained numerous references to the applicants and their respective roles in the attack on the barracks. In particular, mention was made of the \"co-perpetrators\" of the double crime and of \"the precise statement by G.V. that G.G. together with Santangelo had been responsible for physically carrying out the murders\", and it was affirmed that Mr Ferrantelli had helped to search the barracks and to transport material belonging to the carabinieri. Secondly, the judgment of the Juvenile Section of the Caltanisetta Court of Appeal of 6\u00a0April 1991 (see paragraph 30 above) convicting the applicants cited numerous extracts from the decision of the Assize Court of Appeal concerning G.G. In the Juvenile Section it was once again Judge S.P. who presided and indeed he was the reporting judge.",
