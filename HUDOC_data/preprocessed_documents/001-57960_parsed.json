One looks in vain, however, for evidence of this methodological principle being put into practice: there does not follow any analysis of what the applicant argued before the , nor is there any trace of \"regard\" to these arguments in the assessment of the adequacy of the 's jurisdiction.  For the rest, I refer to the methodological objections to this \"test\" that I raised in paragraph 18 of my separate opinion in the case of Fischer v.  (judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312).

In the three civil cases discussed in my aforementioned separate opinion, the Court found that the  met the requirements of a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  In the paragraph under discussion, however, it reaches the opposite conclusion, stressing that in this case the  was sitting in proceedings of a criminal nature.  One cannot but infer that the Court is of the opinion that in a case which under national law is an \"administrative\" one but under the Convention is a \"criminal\" one, the safeguards afforded by the tribunal that is to review the final decision of the administrative bodies differ from those required in a case that under national law is an \"administrative\" one but under the Convention is a \"civil\" one.  I cannot see any justification for such differentiation, which does not find support in the wording or the purpose of Article 6 (art. 6) .  Nor does the Court offer one, its decision on this crucial point being unsupported by any argument.  This is the more to be regretted as this differentiation is contrary to the Court's case-law . ",
