Where the applicant has died after the application was lodged, the Court has accepted that the next of kin or heir may in principle pursue the application, provided that he or she has sufficient interest in the case (see Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu v. Romania [GC], no. 47848/08, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2014, and Murray v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 10511/10, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2016). When assessing the relatives\u2019 standing to pursue the application on behalf of a deceased person, what is therefore important is not whether the rights at issue are transferable to the relatives or heirs but whether the victim made a choice to exercise his or her right of individual application under Article\u00a034 of the Convention by activating the Convention mechanism. It follows that, if an applicant dies after lodging an application with the Court, his or her heirs or close relatives may in principle pursue the application on his or her behalf. By contrast, the situation is different if an application is introduced by close relatives after the death of the direct victim of an alleged violation of the Convention (see\u00a0Ergezen v. Turkey, no.\u00a073359/10, \u00a7\u00a7 28-30, 8 April 2014, with further references).",

Some delay in implementing a decision to release a detainee is understandable and often inevitable in view of practical considerations relating to the running of the courts and the observance of particular formalities. However, the national authorities must attempt to keep it to a minimum (see\u00a0Quinn v. France, 22\u00a0March 1995, \u00a7 42, Series A no.\u00a0311; Giulia Manzoni v.

The Court reiterates that administrative formalities connected with release cannot justify a delay of more than several hours (see\u00a0Nikolov,\u00a0cited above, \u00a7 82). It is for the Contracting States to organise their legal system in such a way that their law-enforcement authorities can meet the obligation to avoid unjustified deprivation of liberty (see Shukhardin v.
