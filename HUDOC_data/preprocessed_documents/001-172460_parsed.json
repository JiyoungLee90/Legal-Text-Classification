The \u201cTRNC\u201d Attorney-General had consented to such a meeting. According to the \u201cTRNC\u201d Chief of Police, there were possibly more suspects and the first applicant had given inaccurate information to the Cypriot police, including the wrong photo of the alleged fifth suspect. As a first step, the \u201cTRNC\u201d Chief of Police had suggested the participation in the investigation of an equal number of officers of the same grade from both sides and the presentation of all exhibits collected which could help solve the crime, such as photographs and fingerprints of the suspects and samples of genetic material. He had also mentioned that in order to ensure the continued detention of the suspects, the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities would like to have the results of the DNA tests linking the suspects to the case. As a second step, the \u201cTRNC\u201d Chief of Police had suggested that the \u201cTRNC\u201d police be given information concerning the ballistic evidence in order to enable the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities to compare that evidence with information in their database. The SPA had noted that there would be no discussion in any meeting held as to which side would bring the suspects to justice, as the matter at this stage would be limited to the investigation of the case, without giving rise to any political implications. This matter could be discussed later on a political level. The Cypriot police had expressed their hesitations as to the usefulness and repercussions of such a meeting. They would inform her of the Chief of Police\u2019s decision on the matter.",

This case is an illustration of the growing number of crimes across the cease-fire line, such as smuggling, drug trafficking, illegal immigration and human trafficking.

Nonetheless, as the Court explained in Rantsev, special elements in a case will justify departure from the general approach (ibid.). Where there are cross-border elements to an incident of unlawful violence leading to loss of life, the fundamental importance of Article 2 requires that the authorities of the State to which the suspected perpetrators have fled and in which evidence of the offence could be located, of their own motion, take effective measures in that regard (see O\u2019Loughlin and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 23274/04, 25\u00a0August 2005, and Cummins and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 27306/05, 13 December 2005).

In the Court\u2019s view, this investigation afforded the State an opportunity to put matters right since it could have resulted in the identification and the punishment of those responsible.

Thirdly, in a letter dated 30 November 2006 to the Prime Minister of Turkey, the applicants\u2019 lawyer had stated that they had exhausted the possibilities for reaching the desired compromise through negotiation and mediation (see paragraph 122 above).

This is particularly true with respect to complaints relating to any obligation under the Convention to investigate certain events. As the passage of time leads to the deterioration of evidence, time has an effect not only on the fulfilment of the State\u2019s obligation to investigate but also on the meaningfulness and effectiveness of the Court\u2019s own examination of the case.

Where there is an investigation of sorts, even if plagued by problems, the Court accepts that applicants may reasonably wait for developments which could potentially resolve crucial factual or legal issues (ibid., \u00a7166).

In the initial year and a half or so the investigations were intensive and there was a strong involvement on the part of UNFICYP to find a solution. The applicants were in contact with all the authorities concerned and UNFICYP in their efforts to help the investigations progress. Although it appears that the applicants started to lose hope because of the lack of cooperation by the two sides, the Court considers that it was reasonable for the applicants to wait for the ongoing investigations and the mediation via UNFICYP to yield results. Nor can it be said that the applicants waited unduly before introducing their complaints before the Court on 16\u00a0August 2007, two years and seven months after the death of their relatives. At the time that they lodged their application with the Court the Cypriot Government\u2019s investigation was still continuing.

Furthermore, the \u201cTRNC\u201d was obliged to refuse extradition when the crime that was the subject matter of the extradition request had been committed fully or partly within its territory or where the \u201cTRNC\u201d courts had jurisdiction. Under the Courts of Justice Law the \u201cTRNC\u201d Assize Courts had jurisdiction to try the suspects as the crime had been committed on the island of Cyprus (section 31 (1)(b)).

There had been an evolution from an inter-governmental model of cooperation towards an approach where cooperation contributed to the fulfilment of human rights obligations. The Council of the European Union had adopted various measures designed to ensure cross-border cooperation: the European Arrest Warrant, created by Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA, and the European Evidence Warrant, created by Framework Decision\u00a02008/978/1JHA. Both instruments were designed to operate in such a manner as to comply with the requirements of the ECHR (recitals 13 and 27 respectively). Furthermore, they both provided for an exception to the rule of double criminality for certain offences specifically listed in the Framework Decisions. These included the offences of murder, rape, arson, and sexual exploitation of children, which involved acts contrary to Articles\u00a02, 3, 4 and 8 of the Convention. Such acts created obligations for the State on whose territory the crime had been committed, but also for the State within whose jurisdiction evidence or persons crucial to an effective investigation could be found. The AIRE Centre submitted that the positive obligations arising under the above-mentioned instruments mandated some level of confidence on the part of Contracting Parties either between each other or with other States so as to make essential cooperation in investigating acts contrary to those Articles possible. This was necessary to ensure that the rights guaranteed under the Convention were not theoretical and illusory but practical and effective (\u0130lhan v.

Cyprus, (dec.) nos. 60441/13 et al., \u00a7 29, 11 March 2014, and Charalambous and Others v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 46744/07 et al., \u00a7 64, both with further references). It emphasises in this respect that disclosure or publication of police reports and investigative materials may involve sensitive issues with possible prejudicial effects on private individuals or other investigations and, therefore, cannot be regarded as an automatic requirement under Article 2 (see G\u00fcrtekin, \u00a7 29, cited above, and Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 347, ECHR 2007II).

Romania, no. 64301/01, \u00a7 113, 1 December 2009). However, the Court must examine whether the applicants were afforded access to the investigation to the extent necessary to safeguard their legitimate interests (see Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a023458/02, \u00a7 311, ECHR 2011 (extracts)).",

Whilst it must be frustrating for the applicants that suspects were identified, arrested, questioned and then released, Article 2 cannot be interpreted as imposing a requirement on the authorities to launch a prosecution irrespective of the evidence which is available (Nje\u017ei\u0107 and \u0160timac, \u00a7 69, and G\u00fcrtekin, \u00a7 27, both cited above). As the Court has held on numerous occasions, the procedural obligation under Article 2 is not an obligation of result, but of means (see Armani Da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 5878/08, \u00a7 233, ECHR 2016). In this connection the Court notes that the suspects all denied involvement in the crime and the investigation carried out did not result in evidence linking them to the crime. Furthermore, although certain steps were taken by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities following the communication of the case and the trial of the first and second suspects, these did not lead to solid new evidence on which to base a prosecution. The \u201cTRNC\u201d and Turkish authorities had limited evidence at hand, as the crime was committed in the territory controlled by the Cypriot Government. In order to prosecute the suspects, the \u201cTRNC\u201d and Turkish authorities needed reliable evidence that would be admissible in a court.",

Although the first and second suspects were questioned again in 2010 this did not lead to anything. The Turkish Government are still waiting for all the evidence in the case to be handed over so they can try the suspects.

The suspects were in Northern Ireland. The Court stated that it did not have to decide whether, or to what extent, Article 2 could impose an obligation on one Contracting State to cooperate with inquiries or hearings conducted within the jurisdiction of another Contracting State concerning the use of unlawful force resulting in death, as the relevant complaint had been filed outside the six-month time-limit. Shortly afterwards, in Cummins (cited above), which concerned bombings in Dublin in December 1972 and January 1973, the Court declared similar complaints against the United Kingdom to be manifestly ill-founded, as a failure to cooperate with the investigations into the deaths and injuries had not been established. Since these decisions, in its judgment in Rantsev, the Court found that the corollary of the obligation on an investigating State to secure evidence located in other jurisdictions was a duty on the State where evidence was located to render any assistance within its competence and means sought under a legal assistance request by the State in which the death occurred (Rantsev, cited above, \u00a7 245). It therefore found that the procedural obligation under Article 2 required the Cypriot authorities to seek assistance from Russia and that Russia had a corresponding obligation to assist the Cypriot authorities due to the fact that certain evidence had been located on its territory. The Court has therefore acknowledged that the procedural obligation under Article 2 mandates cooperation between states in securing available evidence.",

In circumstances such as those of the present case, where the investigation of the unlawful killing unavoidably implicates more than one State, the Court finds that this entails an obligation on the part of the respondent States concerned to cooperate effectively and take all reasonable steps necessary to this end in order to facilitate and realise an effective investigation into the case overall. Such a duty is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life as afforded by Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention (see, among other authorities, Nachova, cited above, \u00a7 93). Indeed, any other finding would severely diminish the purpose of the protection guaranteed by Article\u00a02 and render illusory the guarantees in respect of an individual\u2019s right to life as any real possibility of elucidating the circumstances of the killing and bringing the perpetrators to justice would be hampered and lead to impunity for those responsible. The Convention is a system for the protection of human rights and it is of crucial importance that it is interpreted and applied in a manner that renders these rights practical and effective, not theoretical and illusory (see Varnava, cited above, \u00a7 160).",

A most recent example of failure to implement a judgment can be seen with the Grand Chamber judgment in Cyprus v. Turkey of 12 May 2014 (cited above), as regards the issue of just satisfaction, in respect of non-pecuniary damage suffered by the relatives of the missing persons and by the enclaved Greek Cypriot residents in the Karpas peninsula, a territory of Cyprus under the control of Turkey, that being contrary to Article 46 of the Convention and contrary to international law (see Articles 26 and 27 of the VCLT, pacta sunt servanda). That judgment, together with the judgment on the merits of the same application, found, like other judgments of the Court, that the Republic of Cyprus was the only recognised government in Cyprus. However, Turkey continues to ignore it. In the 2014 Cyprus v. Turkey judgment, the first to find that Article 41 of the Convention on \u201cjust satisfaction\u201d applies also to inter-State applications, incorporated the principle of international law according to which a violation by a State of a treaty, in that case Turkey, entailed a duty to make adequate reparation. To mention only a couple of other judgments of the Court on applications against Turkey, of Cypriot origin, which have not been implemented by Turkey, and which every three months are listed for supervision at a human rights meeting of the Committee of Ministers: Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey, no.\u00a046347/99, 22 December 2015, and a group of 33 cases, and Varnava and Others v.

Turkey ((merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 123-36).

If the Republic of Cyprus abides by the precedent of the judgment, but Turkey does not, this may lead to an increase in crime in the free territory of Cyprus, because criminals who reside in the northern part of Cyprus will come to the free part, commit crimes there and then return to the northern part (as the suspects of the murder did in the present case), in the belief that, after the judgment, they will not be tried by the lawful courts of the Republic of Cyprus and probably by no court in Cyprus.",

This means that the legal structure of the Republic of Cyprus would have to evolve so that it cooperates with an entity which does not enjoy international recognition, inter alia that of the Council of Europe, and which has violated its territorial integrity. In my humble opinion, this finding is at odds with the principle that the Convention must not be interpreted in a vacuum but in harmony with the general principles of international law (see Kessler and Krenz v.

To be sure, it was not ascertained, in this territorial conflict between courts, whether or not the respective positions (see, inter alia, paragraph 55 of the observations of the Republic of Cyprus of 3 September 2009) were compatible with the rule of law and the principle of good faith.

States have a very broad margin of appreciation in such matters and it must be noted that the refusal by the Republic of Cyprus was in no way arbitrary.

Turkey the violations of the Convention took place on the territory controlled by the \u201cTRNC\u201d, and (b) the present conflict arose on account of the lack of mutual legal assistance between the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus and those of the \u201cTRNC\u201d, whereas that institutional dimension was absent from Cyprus v. Turkey.",
