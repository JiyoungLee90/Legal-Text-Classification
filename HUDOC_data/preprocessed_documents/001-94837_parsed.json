As the Court has consistently held, the second limb of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 does not give judicial authorities a choice between either bringing an accused to trial within a reasonable time or granting him provisional release pending trial. Until his conviction, the accused must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continued detention ceases to be reasonable. A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons to justify the continued detention (see, among other authorities, Castravet v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a023393/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030 and 32, 13\u00a0March 2007; McKay\u00a0v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a0543/03, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2006-X; Jab\u0142o\u0144ski\u00a0v.

Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention cannot be seen as unconditionally authorising detention provided that it lasts no longer than a certain period.

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina\u00a0v. Russia, no.\u00a054071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005, and Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 84-85, 26 July 2001). The national judicial authorities must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and must set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is not the Court's task to establish such facts and take the place of the national authorities which ruled on the applicant's detention. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in the domestic courts' decisions and of the true facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Korchuganova\u00a0v.
