The Court finds that since the domestic courts examined the substance of the applicant\u2019s complaint he cannot be said to have failed to exhaust domestic remedies on account of his failure to raise the same claims against the military unit before the commercial courts (see Dzhavadov v.

Romania, no. 34461/02, \u00a7 34, 22 July 2008).

Consequently, a person who complains of a violation of his or her right under Article 1 of the Protocol must first show that such a right existed; a \u201cclaim\u201d can only fall within the scope of that Article if it is sufficiently established to be enforceable (see OAO Plodovaya Kompaniya v. Russia, no.\u00a01641/02, \u00a7 27, 7\u00a0June 2007; Zhigalev v. Russia, no. 54891/00, \u00a7 146, 6\u00a0July 2006; Uskova v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a020116/02, 24 October 2006; and Grishchenko v.

Russia (dec.), no.\u00a030877/02, 20 October 2005; Gerasimova v. Russia, no.\u00a024669/02, \u00a7\u00a7 18-22, 13\u00a0October 2005; and Regent Company v.

Thus, the Court has to ascertain whether the assignment in the present case resulted in the acquisition by the applicant of a \u201cpossession\u201d or a \u201cclaim\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of the Protocol.",

It found that the applicant had adduced no evidence that any unlawful actions on the part of the respondent, the Ministry of the Interior, had caused him damage. Lastly, the appeal court held that the applicant and the military unit had entered into a legal relationship under Article 906 of the Civil Code for storage of the fuel (see paragraph 15 above). Thus, it concluded that any damage caused to the fuel during the storage period should have been imputable to the keeper. Subsequently, the cassation-instance court upheld the judgments given by the courts below.
