For the reasons set out below, the Court finds that the application with regard to the third set of criminal proceedings is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 (a) of the Convention.

While it is for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, since a failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention under Article 5 \u00a7 1, it follows that the Court can, and should, exercise a certain power of review of such compliance (see, for example, M.S. v.

The Court reiterates that the Convention refers essentially to national law, but it also requires that any measure depriving the individual of his liberty be compatible with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see, for example, Lukanov v.

In addition, Parliament gave authorisation to arrest the applicant in relation to the second set of proceedings on 2 April 2015. The Court observes that the applicant was deprived of his liberty as of 26 March 2015 and that he was thereafter in detention in relation to the first and second sets of proceedings. The Court notes that the GPO\u2019s request of 28 March 2015 for Parliament\u2019s authorisation with a view to ordering the applicant\u2019s arrest did not mention the charges under Article 257/a and 287 of the CC. Indeed, the GPO initiated the criminal proceedings against the applicant in relation to the third set of proceedings only on 1 April 2015, and on the same day decided to join that set of proceedings to the second set of proceedings against the applicant. Parliament\u2019s decision to grant authorisation to detain the applicant was taken on the basis of that request. In these circumstances, the Court accepts that Parliament may not have been informed that it was called on to decide also in relation to the third set of criminal proceedings, in addition to the charges under Article 78/1 and 25 of the CC in the second set of criminal proceedings. The Court observes, however, that although Parliament did not in fact give authorisation for the applicant\u2019s detention in relation to the third set of proceedings, the deprivation of his liberty was nonetheless lawful in the framework of the first and second criminal proceedings. Thus, although the authorities failed to specifically request Parliament\u2019s authorisation for arrest in relation to the third set of proceedings, that failure did not render the applicant\u2019s detention unlawful, since the entire period of detention was \u201clawful detention\u201d on the basis of the first and second sets of criminal proceedings, in relation to which the Parliament had given its authorisation (see, mutatis mutandis, Borisenko\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 25725/02, \u00a7 44, 12 January 2012, and Porowski\u00a0v.\u00a0Poland, no. 34458/03, \u00a7\u00a7 104-106, 21 March 2017).",
