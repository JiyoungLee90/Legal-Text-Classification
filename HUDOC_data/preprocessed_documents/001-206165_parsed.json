A lawyer could only give comprehensive legal advice to a company if the managing director(s) acting for it provided him with a full account of the relevant facts. In particular, if the managing director(s) did not also provide information potentially relevant in future criminal proceedings against them, a lawyer was unable to advise the company on risks that certain acts might make its representatives liable to criminal prosecution. It was therefore essential for the functioning of the lawyerclient relationship with a company that the managing director(s) kept the right to decide whether or not to release the lawyer with whom they had worked from professional secrecy.",

These courts argue, in essence, that there was a contractual relationship only between the lawyer and the company, which alone was protected by the lawyer\u2019s duty of confidentiality and could decide alone whether or not it was in its interest to release the lawyer from that duty (see, in particular, Cologne Court of Appeal, file\u00a0nos.\u00a0III-2 Ws 544/15 and 2 Ws 544/15, order of 1 September 2015; Nuremberg Court of Appeal, file no. 1 Ws 289/09, order of 18 June 2009; and Oldenburg Court of Appeal, file no. 1 Ws 242/04, order of 28 May 2004).",

Moreover, in his exchanges with company representatives, a lawyer usually obtained knowledge also of the representatives\u2019 personal secrets (see, in particular, Zweibr\u00fccken Court of Appeal, file no. 1 Ws 334/16, order of 8 December 2016; D\u00fcsseldorf Court of Appeal, file no. 1 Ws 1155/92, order of 14 December 1992; Celle Court of Appeal, file no. 1 Ws 194/85, order of 2 August 1985; Koblenz Court of Appeal, file no. 2 VAs 21/84, order of 22 February 1985; and Schleswig Court of Appeal, file nos. 1 Ws 160/80 and 1 Ws 161/80, order of 27 May 1980).",

Thus, the lawyer-client privilege granted to this communication covers both the companies and the communicators \u2013 the managing directors.
