In particular, although the litigation ended with partial success of the applicant, it nevertheless lost the entire deposited amount because of its own obligation to honour the rules on default interest payable on the award. This interest was very significant as a consequence of the courts\u2019 delay in deciding the case. At the same time, the applicant was not allowed to access or use its deposit, let alone to accumulate interest on it. In these circumstances, the Court considers that this complaint merits separate consideration.",

In particular, a positive obligation arises for the State to ensure in its domestic legal system that property rights are sufficiently protected by law and that adequate remedies are provided whereby the victim of an interference can seek to vindicate his or her rights, including, where appropriate, by claiming damages in respect of any loss sustained (see Blumberga v. Latvia, no.\u00a070930/01, \u00a7\u00a067, 14\u00a0October 2008). The Court has already held that when scrutinising an interference with an applicant\u2019s right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions, the state of uncertainty in which the applicants might find themselves as a result of delays attributable to the authorities is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State\u2019s conduct in such litigations (see Almeida Garrett, Mascarenhas Falc\u00e3o and Others v. Portugal, nos.\u00a029813/96 and 30229/96, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2000-I; and Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a031443/96, \u00a7\u00a7 151 and 185, ECHR 2004\u2013V). This is so because \u2013 although there is no obligation under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to apply an inflation-proofed default interest rate to private claims (see O.N. v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 35221/97, 6 April 2000; and Grozeva v. Bulgaria (dec.), no.\u00a052788/99, 3 November 2005) \u2013 national law often provides for default interest payable to a successful plaintiff, whose amount will increase with time.",
