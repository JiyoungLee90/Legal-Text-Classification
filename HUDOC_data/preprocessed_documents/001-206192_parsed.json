The 8th Assize Court was not governed by a separate legal framework, nor did it have a separate organisational structure from the other assize courts. The judges appointed to that court were competent to serve in all Istanbul courts. It further emphasised that the right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention included first and foremost the right to be tried by a competent and well-informed judge. Courts with special jurisdiction, such as that one, were a manifestation of that right and they served the interests of the accused. The unprecedented developments witnessed in global economic relations and technology had brought about a new generation of economic crimes, which required specialised courts equipped to deal with such complex matters. It therefore concluded that its establishment as a specialised court was not only in compliance with the principle of \u201cnatural judge\u201d, but that it actually served the requirements of the right to a fair trial.",

They stressed in that connection that having regard to the scope and the characteristics of the fraudulent operations that could be performed with the use of the accounting software in question, it was evident that the software had been custom-designed for the very purpose of enabling such operations. They further found that Merkez Yat\u0131r\u0131m agents had also taken part in efforts to remove data during the handover of the bank management to BRSA to prevent the discovery and tracing of the fraudulent transactions. Moreover, the collective resignation of the board members and the senior managers of Merkez Yat\u0131r\u0131m and \u0130marbank right before the handover (see paragraph 7 above) showed a unity of action that strongly suggested that the relevant individuals had been aware of the illegal acts in question and had taken part in those acts.",

The trial court held that this crime \u2013 the biggest banking corruption incident in the country\u2019s history \u2013 had been facilitated by the software programme developed for \u0130marbank by Merkez Yat\u0131r\u0131m, which had exclusively catered to Uzan-group companies. The programme had been used to divert money, inter alia, to other companies in the Uzan Group. Having regard (i) to the fact that this criminal enterprise had been headed by the applicant\u2019s brother, who had also been the chairman of Merkez Yat\u0131r\u0131m and with whom the applicant had admitted to having very close ties, including working relations over the course of many years, (ii)\u00a0to the applicant\u2019s position as the vice-chairman of Merkez Yat\u0131r\u0131m, in addition to his duties in other Uzan-group companies, and (iii) to the instrumental role played by Merkez Yat\u0131r\u0131m over the years in funnelling tremendous amounts of money from \u0130marbank, the trial court found it established that the applicant had knowingly participated in the offence of aggravated embezzlement and had thus taken part in this criminal organisation. It stressed in this regard that it was through the use, under his apparent knowledge, of the relevant software programme that a great part of his personal taxes had also been paid. It further noted that the applicant had admitted to working under the instructions of his brother, K.U., and that he had resigned from his duties at Merkez Yat\u0131r\u0131m together with the other board members following orders by K.U. in that regard. The trial court moreover emphasised the absolute secrecy in which this fraudulent scheme had been conducted, which was evidenced, inter alia, by the phone-tapping records obtained in the past few years in the context of a separate (but related) criminal investigation. In the trial court\u2019s opinion, all the evidence in the case file pointed to the finding that the legal entity of the bank had been used as a cover for the criminal enterprise.",

They relied in that connection on a judgment delivered by the Turkish Constitutional Court on 14 January 2015 (E.2014/164-K.2015/12), in which it affirmed that the principle of a \u201cnatural judge\u201d provided under the Constitution did not mean that new courts could not be established or judges newly appointed to existing courts could not hear a case concerning previously committed offences (see paragraph\u00a033 above). Accordingly, the transfer of the applicant\u2019s case to the Istanbul 8th\u00a0Assize Court following the relevant legislative amendment, together with all other cases concerning banking offences pending before the Istanbul Assize Courts, had not contravened the applicant\u2019s right to have his case heard by a \u201cnatural judge\u201d as argued.",

His trial before that court had been carried out, therefore, against both the \u201cnatural judge\u201d principle, as set out in the Turkish Constitution and Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, and the right to an independent and impartial tribunal. On this latter point, the applicant emphasised the perceived political rivalry between the executive and his family, as was evidenced by the statements made by members of the ruling party, including the Minister of Justice, who targeted his family in connection with the alleged bank fraud at issue and who, allegedly, aimed to put pressure on the judges hearing their case. He submitted some newspaper articles in support of this claim, including one where the Minister of Justice was quoted as stating, in very strong words, that he would come down very hard on bankers implicated in fraud if he were a prosecutor. He also submitted a statement by another member of the executive, saying that C.C.U. (see paragraph 5 above) and his family had made it into the \u201cworld history of thefts\u201d. In support of his arguments regarding the \u201cextraordinary\u201d nature of the specialised court, the applicant also pointed to temporary provision 2 of Law no. 5020, which granted the judges sitting on that court \u201cadditional guarantees\u201d not offered to other assize court judges (see paragraphs 12 and 31 above).",

In the Court\u2019s view, it is clear from a plain reading of the relevant provision that the lawmaker offered the competent State authorities the choice between (i) designating the 1st Assize Court as the specialised court for the relevant purposes, (ii) selecting another assize court to serve as the specialised court, and (iii) setting up a new assize court altogether for that purpose, as needed, upon the proposal of the Minister of Justice and the final decision of the HCJP. It thus follows that while the law did not provide any specific criteria that would justify the setting up of a new court, the discretion used in the instant case to put the 8th Assize Court into operation had an unequivocal basis in law and was not an arbitrary act.",

It notes in this connection that in determining whether a body could be considered \u201cindependent\u201d, regard must be had to such factors as the manner of appointment of the body\u2019s members, the duration of their term of office, the existence of guarantees against outside pressures and the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence (see Maktouf and Damjanovi\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2013 (extracts), with further references therein). As regards the requirement of impartiality, the Court has established that there are two aspects to that requirement: first, the tribunal must be subjectively free of personal prejudice or bias; secondly, it must also be impartial from an objective viewpoint, that is, it must offer sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see Sacilor-Lormines v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a065411/01, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2006XIII). The objective test mostly concerns hierarchical or other links between the judge and other protagonists in the proceedings. It must therefore be decided in each individual case whether the relationship in question is of such a nature and degree as to indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the tribunal (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e S\u00e1, cited above, \u00a7 148).",

Relying on material evidence, the trial court had established that the programme developed by Merkez Yat\u0131r\u0131m had enabled fraudulent transactions on the part of \u0130marbank. Noting furthermore that Merkez Yat\u0131r\u0131m had not offered technical support services to any companies outside the Uzan Group, the trial court had pointed to the strong evidence suggesting that that company may have been established for the sole purpose of facilitating \u0130marbank\u2019s unlawful financial dealings.
