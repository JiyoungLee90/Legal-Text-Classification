This required reasonable opportunities to undertake courses aimed at helping prisoners to address their offending behaviour and the risks they posed. While Article 5 \u00a7 1 did not impose any absolute requirement for prisoners to have immediate access to all courses they might require, any restrictions or delays encountered as a result of resource considerations had to be reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, bearing in mind that whether a particular course was made available to a particular prisoner depended entirely on the actions of the authorities (see \u00a7 218 of the judgment).",

Thus, where, as in the present case, the applicant claims that delay in his access to prison courses constituted a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 (a), the applicant\u2019s general progression through the prison system must be assessed in light of the particular circumstances of the case (see Hall, cited above, \u00a7 32; and Black, cited above, \u00a7 54).",

The following month, discussions took place between the applicant\u2019s offender supervisor and the psychology department to identify the nature of assessment required (see paragraph 18 above). Less than three months later an initial SOTP assessment was completed (see paragraph 20 above). Immediate clinical guidance was sought by the psychologist in the case and the outcome was that further assessments were sought to evaluate the level of dynamic risk that the applicant posed (see paragraph 21 above). The applicant was informed of his referral for further assessment and given a timetable for progression of his case (see paragraph 22 above). The TNA was completed by August 2011 and a further prison transfer subsequently took place (see paragraph 24 and 27 above). TNA and Treatment Pathway reports, which concluded that the applicant was suitable for the SOTP, were completed in November 2011 and disclosed to him in December (see paragraph 29 above).

However, the evidence demonstrates that throughout this period his case was under active examination by the relevant professionals and relevant assessments were being identified and carried out. In this respect it is clear that the applicant\u2019s representatives were mistaken in expressing the view in December 2011 that no progress had been made since April (see paragraph 30 above). Finally, once it was established in late November 2011 that the applicant was suitable for participation in the SOTP, it was not unreasonable that he had to wait until May 2012 to commence the course having regard both to resource considerations and to the progress that he had already made. A prompt modification was made to the applicant\u2019s parole timetable presumably to enable completion of the course and preparation of post-course assessments in time to be taken into account at his next review (see paragraph 32 above).",
