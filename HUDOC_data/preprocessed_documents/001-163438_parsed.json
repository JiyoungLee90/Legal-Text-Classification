However, the general concept of a fair trial, encompassing also the fundamental principle that proceedings should be adversarial (see Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain, 23 June 1993, \u00a7 63, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0262), requires that all parties to civil proceedings should have the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed or evidence adduced with a view to influencing the court\u2019s decision (see Lobo Machado v. Portugal, 20\u00a0February 1996, \u00a7 31, Reports 1996I).

Secondly, the applicant claims that the appointment of an ex officio lawyer was not effective in the circumstances of the case (see paragraph 12 above); criticism which the Government have not contested. Lastly, as regards publication in the State Gazette, the Court has already drawn attention to the fact that such notifications may, in certain circumstances, have negative consequences for the addressees (see Dilipak and Karakaya, cited above, \u00a7\u00a083). The authorities should have pursued the other avenues provided by the Code of Civil Procedure before resorting to this method of notification.",

The Court notes the divergent case-law of the Supreme Court of Cassation as to whether an interested party could still seek re-opening under the 2007 Code where, as in the present case, a judgment had entered into force under the rules of the 1952 Code and one year had expired since its entry into force (see paragraph\u00a022 above).",
