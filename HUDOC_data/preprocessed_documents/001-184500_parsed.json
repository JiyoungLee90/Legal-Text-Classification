In the court\u2019s view, by chanting those slogans the applicants had not intended to find a solution to a problem but had praised and glorified the source of the problem, that is to say, the terrorist organisations concerned. Hence, the applicants had incited terror.

In the Court\u2019s view, the applicants\u2019 reaction to the above-mentioned killings amounted to a criticism of the acts committed by the security forces but did not incite the use of violence, armed resistance or uprising and did not constitute hate speech (see Yavuz and Yaylal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 52). Besides, the slogans in question are well-known and stereotyped leftist slogans and they were chanted during peaceful public gatherings (see G\u00fcl and Others, cited above, \u00a7 41). There is also nothing in the case file showing that the applicants were involved in any violent acts or had the intention of inciting violence. The Ankara Assize Court, however, does not appear to have given consideration to any of the above factors.
