The present complaint illustrates the manner in which that unlimited discretion can be, and has been, abused. The investigator refused a pastoral visit on the ground that it would negatively affect the course of the investigation without explaining why it was so or assessing the impact which that decision would have on the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of religion. The courts did nothing to censure the abuse and endorsed the investigator\u2019s unlimited discretion.
