It is not the Court's task to determine whether there existed a sufficient link between the two sets of proceedings and whether the proceedings at issue were thus properly stayed, because, as a general rule, it is for the domestic courts to establish the facts and to interpret and apply national law. The Court will not interfere with their rulings, unless the applicants succeed in demonstrating that they acted arbitrarily. Nor can the Court find that a system providing for the dependence of one set of civil proceedings on another one, when they concern the same or related facts, goes per se against the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Djangozov v. Bulgaria, no. 45950/99, \u00a7 38, 8 July 2004, and Todorov v. Bulgaria, no. 39832/98, \u00a7\u00a048, 18 January 2005).
