The case originated in an application against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 by the applicant Mr A.O. (“the applicant”), an Italian national, on 25 May 1993. The application was registered on 26 August 1993 under file No. 22534/93. Before the Court the applicant acted by himself. The Italian Government (“the Government”)] were represented by their Agent, Mr Umberto Leanza, and by their coagent, M. Vitaliano Esposito.
The applicant complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 about his prolonged impossibility to recover possession of his apartment through lack of police assistance.
On 11 January 1995, the Commission (First Chamber) decided to give notice of the application to the respondent Government and invited them to submit their observations on its admissibility and merits. The Government submitted their observations on 17 March 1995 and 15 April 1996, to which the applicant replied on 12 May 1995.
Following the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 § 2 thereof, the application was transferred to the Court.
In accordance with Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Second Section. The Chamber constituted within the Section included ex officio Mr B. Conforti, the judge elected in respect of Italy (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 26 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court), and Mr C. L. Rozakis, the President of the Section (Rule 26 § 1 (a)). The other members designated by the latter to complete the Chamber were Mr M. Fischbach, Mr P. Lorenzen, Mrs M. Tsatsa-Nikolovska, Mr A. Baka and Mr E. Levits (Rule 26 § 1 (b)). Mr. M. Fischbach was replaced by Mr. G. Bonello, Substitute Judge.
On 7 October 1999, the Court declared the application admissible.
On 9 December 1999, the Government submitted additional observations.
In 1969, the applicant let at a low rent, pursuant to a 1969 law on rent control (equo canone), an apartment he owned in Rome.
On 10 October 1986 the applicant served a notice to quit (disdetta) on the tenant on expiry of the term on 31 December 1987, but she refused to leave.
In a writ served on the tenant on 28 November 1986, the applicant reiterated his intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Rome Magistrate (pretore).
In a decision of 10 April 1987, which was made enforceable on the same day, the magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 30 September 1988.
On an unspecified date the applicant served notice (precetto) on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises. He subsequently served notice on the tenant informing her that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff (significazione di sfratto).
Between 28 November 1989 and 29 March 1991, the bailiff made nine attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful as, under the statutory provisions providing for the suspension or staggering of the evictions, the applicant was not entitled to police assistance. The competent prefect, in fact, had to give priority in the grant of police assistance to any pending urgent cases.
Thereafter, the applicant decided not to pursue the enforcement proceedings, in order to avoid useless costs, given the lack of prospects of obtaining the assistance of the police. He resumed the proceedings on a later, unspecified date.
On 15 November 1995 the bailiff evicted the tenant. In the report on the eviction, the bailiff noted that the tenant, who was elderly and sick, had been lying in bed for two years; she had to be transferred by ambulance to a council flat which was allocated to her by the Municipality of Rome on the same day.
The applicant thus recovered possession of his flat.
The relevant domestic law is described in the Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy judgment of 28 July 1999, to be published in the Court’s official reports, §§ 18-35.
