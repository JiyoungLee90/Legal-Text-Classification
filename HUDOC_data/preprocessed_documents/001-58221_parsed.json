While the consequences for Mr Benkessiouer of the administrative authorities\u2019 decisions were also partly pecuniary, that factor did not suffice to make the \nproceedings in issue \u201ccivil\u201d ones (see the Huber judgment cited above, pp.\u00a0115\u201316, \u00a7 37). The consequences flowed from the initial decision to refuse Mr\u00a0Benkessiouer extended sick-leave; that decision, however, primarily concerned the development of the career of a civil servant. As to the payment of damages, it was directly dependent on a finding that the impugned decisions had been unlawful. Furthermore, the relevant legislation in this instance (see paragraphs 19\u201321 above) conferred unilateral discretionary powers on the State and these were based on the public service and not, as in the case of private-law employees, on contract and agreement.",

A civil servant is, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, protected by Article 6 \u00a7 1 only if the dispute concerns, not his or her recruitment, career or termination of service, but, for instance, a purely economic entitlement. In addition, it is a requisite for the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 that the discretionary powers of the administrative authority in question should not be in issue.
