Nevertheless, the only remedies that must be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and are also available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, in particular, Vernillo v. France, judgment of 20\u00a0February 1991, Series A no. 198, pp. 11-12, \u00a7 27).
