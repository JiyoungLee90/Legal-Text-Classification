The Court accepts that in cases concerning organised crime the risk that a detainee if released might put pressure on witnesses or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings is often particularly high. These factors can justify a relatively longer period of detention. However, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure (see Osuch v. Poland, no.\u00a031246/02, \u00a7\u00a026, 14 November 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 4\u00a0May 2006). Taking into account that the applicant was suspected of being an active member of an organised criminal group, the Court accepts that the authorities could justifiably consider that the risk of pressure on witnesses and jurors was initially present. However, the Court is not persuaded that that ground could in itself justify the entire five-year period of the applicant\u2019s detention. Indeed, the domestic courts referred to the risk of hampering the proceedings in a summary fashion without pointing to any aspect of the applicant\u2019s character or behaviour in support of their conclusion that he was likely to resort to intimidation. In the Court\u2019s view, such a generally formulated risk may not serve as justification for the applicant\u2019s detention for a period of more than five years. The domestic courts failed to consider the fact that that ground inevitably became less and less relevant with the passage of time. The courts\u2019 reasoning did not evolve to reflect the developing situation or to verify whether at the advanced stage of the proceedings that ground retained its sufficiency. The Court is not therefore convinced that, throughout the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention, compelling reasons existed for a fear that he would interfere with witnesses or jurors or otherwise hamper the examination of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh the applicant\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

Russia, no.\u00a028957/02, \u00a7 68, 24 May 2007). In any event, the mere absence of permanent employment could not serve as justification for more than five years\u2019 detention pending trial.",

The Court accepts that it may be necessary to issue custody orders in respect of convicted prisoners, for example to make possible the person\u2019s transfer from the correctional colony where he is serving his sentence to a detention facility situated in the area where the investigation and trial are conducted. However, in the present case the domestic courts did not refer to such a necessity. Instead, they repeated the stereotyped formula without any assessment of whether, considering that the applicant was detained in a correctional colony, the risk of fleeing from justice, reoffending or intimidating witnesses or jurors was real. The Court considers that the extension orders issued between 6 April 2004 and 31 July 2006 attested to the domestic courts\u2019 perfunctory attitude to the applicant\u2019s detention, which was extended automatically without concrete relevant facts being addressed or the changing circumstances taken into account. Although it is true that the extension orders issued during that period did not affect the applicant\u2019s situation in practical terms, as he was in any event being held after conviction by a competent court, this fact is not decisive for the Court\u2019s assessment. The existence of a violation is conceivable even in the absence of prejudice or damage; the question whether an applicant has actually been placed in an unfavourable position or sustained damage becomes relevant only in the context of Article\u00a041 (see, among many authorities, Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others v. Austria, no. 40825/98, \u00a7 67, 31 July 2008; Wassink v. the Netherlands, 27\u00a0September 1990, \u00a7\u00a038, Series A no. 185-A; and Marckx v.

It accepts that in cases concerning organised crime and involving numerous defendants, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task, as it is necessary to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources and to determine the facts and degree of alleged responsibility of each of the co-suspects (see, mutadis mutandis, \u0141aszkiewicz v.

The possibility for a detainee to be heard either in person or through some form of representation features among the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty (see Kampanis v.

Possible exceptions from this rule are conceivable: the Court observes in this connection that in order to determine whether a proceeding provides adequate guarantees, regard must be had to the particular nature of the circumstances in which such proceedings take place. The detainee\u2019s personal presence is always required when the court has to assess his personality, the risk of his absconding or his predisposition to further offences, when the court changes the basis for the detention or when it extends the detention after a significant lapse of time (see Lebedev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7 113, 25 October 2007).",
