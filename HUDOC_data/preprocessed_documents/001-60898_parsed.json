In April 1994 the Council installed a CCTV surveillance system in Brentwood. It was fully operational by July 1994. The Council's monitoring operator had a direct visual and audio link to the police so that if it was considered that an incident warranting police intervention was taking place, the images being captured could be switched through to the police.

The BBC was directed to broadcast a summary of the adjudication of the BSC with the episode of \u201cCrime Beat\u201d on 12 June 1997 and a summary of the adjudication was also published in The Daily Telegraph on 12 June 1997.",

It found that the applicant's identity was not adequately obscured and that he was readily identifiable and easily recognisable by those who knew him. It found that section 2(2) and (5) of the Code had been breached and the decision of the ITC was published in its Programme Complaints and Interventions Report of June 1996.

In this case, the film footage showed a man walking in the High Street carrying a large knife in his hand. It did not show him attempting to commit suicide. It was plainly a potentially dangerous situation which the Council's monitoring employee quite properly put to the police, as a result of which the man was arrested. ... It was not unreasonable for the Council to conclude that the footage was a useful example of how a potentially dangerous situation can be avoided. ... In those circumstances, it seems to me that the decision of the Council to distribute the film footage to the media could not be said to be irrational or unreasonable, bearing in mind that the film did not show an attempted suicide and that, at the time, they did not know the applicant's identity. They therefore had no reason to consult the police as to whether an offence had been committed. They did not sell the take-outs from the CCTV footage for commercial gain and, more importantly, they had imposed on the television companies a requirement that an individual's face should be masked. It is true that that was a verbal rather than a written requirement, but I am not persuaded that what happened was likely to have been different if it had been a written requirement. In the event, the fault lay with the television companies. Anglia TV failed to mask the applicant's identity adequately. The BBC failed to mask the applicant's identity at all in the trailers. As soon as the Council were notified about that by the applicant, two days before the programme went out, which was the first time they were aware of the applicant's identity, they immediately contacted the BBC and received assurances that his image had been masked in the programme.

Since there are occasions when people knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activities which are or may be recorded or reported in a public manner, a person's reasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, although not necessarily conclusive, factor. A person who walks down the street will, inevitably, be visible to any member of the public who is also present. Monitoring by technological means of the same public scene (for example, a security guard viewing through closed-circuit television) is of a similar character. Private life considerations may arise, however, once any systematic or permanent record comes into existence of such material from the public domain.\u201d ",

On the other hand, the recording of the data and the systematic or permanent nature of the record may give rise to such considerations. Accordingly, in both Rotaru and Amann (to which P.G. and J.H. referred) the compilation of data by security services on particular individuals, even without the use of covert surveillance methods, constituted an interference with the applicants' private lives (Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, \u00a7\u00a7 43-44, ECHR 2000-V, and Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, \u00a7\u00a7 65-67, ECHR 2000-II). While the permanent recording of the voices of P.G. and J.H. was made while they answered questions in a police cell as police officers listened to them, the recording of their voices for further analysis was regarded as the processing of personal data about them amounting to an interference with their right to respect for their private lives (see P.G. and J.H., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60).

In those cases, the Commission attached importance to whether the photographs amounted to an intrusion into the applicant's privacy (as, for instance, by entering and taking photographs in a person's home), whether the photograph related to private or public matters and whether the material thus obtained was envisaged for a limited use or was likely to be made available to the general public. In Friedl the Commission noted that there was no such intrusion into the \u201cinner circle\u201d of the applicant's private life, that the photographs taken of a public demonstration related to a public event and that they had been used solely as an aid to policing the demonstration on the relevant day. In this context, the Commission attached weight to the fact that the photographs taken remained anonymous in that no names were noted down, the personal data recorded and photographs taken were not entered into a data-processing system and no action had been taken to identify the persons photographed on that occasion by means of data processing (ibid.). Similarly, in Lupker, the Commission specifically noted that the police used the photographs to identify offenders in criminal proceedings only and that there was no suggestion that the photographs had been made available to the general public or would be used for any other purpose.

Disclosure of CCTV footage complemented this aim: the policy was to give CCTV as prominent a role as possible in order to avoid covert surveillance, to inspire public confidence and support for the system and to deter criminals. This aim of deterrence was expressly accepted by the High Court as one of the bases of the Council's conduct, and crime had decreased since the installation of the CCTV system.

In so finding, the Court referred, mutatis mutandis, to Articles 3 \u00a7 2 (c), 5, 6 and 9 of the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (European Treaty Series no. 108, Strasbourg, 1981). It went on to find that the above considerations were \u201cespecially valid\u201d as regards the protection of the confidentiality of information about a person's HIV status, noting that the interests in protecting the confidentiality of such information weighed heavily in the balance in determining whether the interference was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Such interference could not be compatible with Article 8 of the Convention unless it was justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest. Any State measures compelling disclosure of such information without the consent of the patient and any safeguards designed to secure an effective protection called for the most careful scrutiny on the part of the Court.",

Indeed the High Court suggested that lessons could be learnt from this \u201cunfortunate incident\u201d and that, with the benefit of hindsight, the Council might see if it could tighten up its guidelines to avoid similar incidents in the future. The Council itself clearly intended to have a written licence agreement with the producers of \u201cCrime Beat\u201d but this does not appear to have been concluded as no final and signed agreement was disclosed to the applicant or submitted by the Government to this Court.

In such circumstances, and even though the applicant does not directly complain about damage to his reputation, the Court considers that particular care was required of the Council, which would reasonably have included verifying with the police whether the individual had, in fact, been charged or not. It is difficult to accept the Government's explanation that the Council was unaware of his identity. As noted above, the Council's own CCTV News article of 9 October 1995 would seem to imply that the Council had established that the relevant individual had been questioned and given assistance for his problems and could therefore have verified whether the applicant had, in fact, been charged.

In such circumstances, the Court considered it clear that, even assuming that the essential complaints of Ms Smith and Mr Grady before this Court were before and considered by the domestic courts, the threshold at which those domestic courts could find the impugned policy to be irrational had been placed so high that it effectively excluded any consideration by the domestic courts of the question of whether the interference with the applicants' rights answered a pressing social need or was proportionate to the national-security and public-order aims pursued, principles which lay at the heart of the Court's analysis of complaints under Article 8 of the Convention.

The present applicant would have had much greater difficulty in establishing that the footage disclosed had the \u201cnecessary quality of confidence\u201d about it or that the information had been \u201cimparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence\u201d. The Government argued before the Court under Article 8 that the applicant's right to respect for his private life had not even been engaged. They have cited no domestic case which could be considered similar or analogous to the present case and which would suggest that these two elements of the breach-of-confidence claim were satisfied. Douglas v. Hello! Ltd, cited above, post-dated the relevant facts of the present case and, as importantly, the entry into force of the Human Rights Act 1998. In any event, only one of three judges in that case indicated that he was prepared to find that there was now a qualified right to privacy in domestic law. Moreover, the Court is not persuaded by the Government's argument that a finding by this Court that the applicant had an \u201cexpectation of privacy\u201d would mean that the elements of the breach-of-confidence action were established. The Court finds it to be unlikely that the domestic courts would have accepted at the relevant time that the images had the \u201cnecessary quality of confidence\u201d about them or that the information was \u201cimparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence\u201d.

The applicant could only have applied for such an injunction after he became aware of the disclosures in late October or early November 1995 and therefore only against the Yellow Advertiser and the BBC. Although an award of an account of profits is not dependent on the grant of a prior injunction, the Government have referred to no case where this has been ordered in respect of a broadcast. While an account of profits in respect of the national press was a possibility open to Earl and Countess Spencer, the Yellow Advertiser had a local as opposed to a national circulation. ",
