The applicant party had submitted for registration minutes of reorganisation of fifty-three regional branches having a total membership of 10,686 persons. The District Court observed that an inspection by the Ministry had revealed that twenty-five minutes of regional conferences had contained untrue information as per the above-cited list (see paragraph 10 above). The District Court further noted that regional branches in the Kemerovo and Leningrad Regions and in St\u00a0Petersburg had been dissolved by a judicial decision on account of gross violations of legal requirements of minimum membership and the procedure for election of management bodies. On the basis of those elements, the District Court reached the conclusion that the applicant party had submitted untrue information to the registration body and that at the date of its registration it had not had properly established regional branches in one half of Russian regions or a ten-thousand-strong membership. Thus, the applicant party did not meet the requirements for a political party within the meaning of section 3 \u00a7 2 of the Political Parties Act.",
