It was only since 2006, as a result of legislative amendments to the Criminal Code (see paragraph\u00a019 below), that staff members of the Fund had fallen within the personal scope of the offence of neglect of official duties. Furthermore, their duties, as set out in the relevant regulations, had not been clearly defined. As a result, they could not have anticipated that their negligence, if indeed there had been any, could have constituted a crime committed by an official or a person of equivalent status. Moreover, neglect of official duties under Article\u00a0342 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Criminal Code was a minor offence with a twoyear statute of limitations that had already expired on 19\u00a0October 2006 when the charges had been brought in respect of offences allegedly committed before 1\u00a0January 2004. In the applicants\u2019 submission, at the time the Zugdidi District Court delivered its judgment, \u201cno legal ground had existed to justify the imposition of criminal responsibility\u201d. Therefore, the applicants submitted that they should have been acquitted or, \u201ceven accepting that they had committed the offence imputed to them, they should [have been] released from serving the sentence, in accordance with Article 71 of the Criminal Code and Article\u00a028 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(e) and\u00a06 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\u201d (see paragraphs\u00a018 and 20 below).",

In response, the Supreme Court noted that the applicants had been tasked with revealing beneficiaries of the Fund who had been in gainful employment and ensuring the return of the pensions paid to such individuals back to the Fund\u2019s account. In that connection, the Supreme Court noted that as of 7\u00a0May 2000 the Fund had been classified as a public-law legal entity (see paragraph\u00a023 below) and concluded that \u201can inspector [of the Fund was] covered by the offence of official misconduct as [he or she] carried out public functions as part of the [relevant] public-law legal entity.\u201d The Supreme Court therefore upheld the appellate court\u2019s judgment in respect of the applicants\u2019 conviction.",

However, the Court\u2019s powers of review must be greater when the Convention right itself, Article\u00a07 in the present case, requires that there was a legal basis for a conviction and sentence. Article\u00a07 \u00a7\u00a01 requires the Court to examine whether there was a contemporaneous legal basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction and, in particular, it must satisfy itself that the result reached by the relevant domestic courts was compatible with Article 7 of the Convention. To accord a lesser power of review to this Court would render Article 7 devoid of purpose (ibid., \u00a7 52).",

In this context, the main question before the Court, subject to its power of review under Article\u00a07 of the Convention (see paragraph 36 above), is whether there was a valid legal basis for the applicants\u2019 conviction in view of the expiry of the statute of limitations in respect of the relevant offence.",

As to the legal impact of such a finding, the Court observes that the relevant domestic law \u2013 namely Article\u00a028 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(e) of the Code of Criminal Procedure \u2013 provided that criminal proceedings were to be terminated if the statute of limitations in respect of the relevant offence had expired (see paragraph\u00a020 above). However, if the accused was\u00a0\u201cagainst such a termination\u201d, the criminal proceedings would continue under the ordinary procedure, and be terminated with the accused being either acquitted or convicted and exempted from serving the sentence (ibid.). The Court will therefore assess whether the applicants had made an explicit request not to have the proceedings terminated to justify the domestic courts\u2019 decision to proceed with the conviction in respect of the relevant time-barred offence.",

However, it is not for the Court to speculate on the reasons why the applicants formulated the relevant applications in such a manner, save for noting that these submissions can hardly be taken as an explicit waiver (being \u201cagainst the termination\u201d, as required by Article\u00a028 \u00a7\u00a06 \u2013 see paragraph\u00a020 above) of the important domestic law safeguard against being convicted of a time-barred offence.",

Given the Supreme Court\u2019s silence on the matter and the importance of the right at stake, the Court will not speculate as to whether the domestic courts treated the applicants\u2019 above-mentioned submissions as an implicit waiver of their right \u2013 guaranteed under the domestic law \u2013 not to be convicted of a time-barred offence. It is therefore apparent that the applicants were convicted for acts which were no longer punishable owing to the lapse of the statute of limitations under the relevant domestic law (see paragraph\u00a039 above), and the domestic courts offered no explanation for taking such an approach to their case (contrast and compare Co\u00ebme and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0150). Furthermore, the Court notes that despite the fact that the applicants were exempted by the Supreme Court from serving the sentence with the further effect of no criminal record existing in respect of the relevant offence (see paragraph\u00a015 above),\u00a0in the subsequent proceedings against the Social Services Agency for the award of the damages, the domestic courts, up to and including the Supreme Court, treated the applicants as having been convicted in the previous proceedings (see paragraph\u00a016 above).",
