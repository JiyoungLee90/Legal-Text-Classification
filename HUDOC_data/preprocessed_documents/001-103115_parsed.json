The applicant was duly informed of this procedure (see\u00a0paragraph 6 above). Therefore, the onus was on him to request legal representation for the effective participation in the appeal hearing. He,\u00a0however, did not do\u00a0so (compare Sakhnovskiy v.\u00a0Russia\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a021272/03, \u00a7\u00a020, 2\u00a0November 2010, where the applicant made a request, prior to the appeal hearing, to be assigned a lawyer to represent him in the appeal proceedings because his counsel was unable to attend the hearing).
