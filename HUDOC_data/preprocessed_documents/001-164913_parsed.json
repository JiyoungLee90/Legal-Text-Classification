In these circumstances, any subsequent developments in the criminal proceedings against them would not have affected the core of the matter underlying their complaints under the Convention, because a significant period of their detention had already taken place. Accordingly, the Court is unable to find that a lack of information about further extensions of the applicants\u2019 detention and their conviction could have had a decisive influence on its judgment, or could have prevented it from ruling on the case (see Kalinin v. Russia [Committee], no.\u00a054749/12, \u00a7 18 \u2013 21, 19 February 2015). It finds the Government\u2019s argument without merit and of no legal consequence to the proceedings.",
