Moreover, it appears from the material in the case file that, from 28 October 2005, H.S. sent several statements to the relevant courts and other authorities whereby he repeatedly retracted any statements that could be construed as accusations against the applicant. However, these subsequent statements were not taken into account by the domestic courts. The Court considers that hearing H.S. in person and an adequate examination of his subsequent statements were crucial for the assessment of the truthfulness of H.S.\u2019s original written statement. Furthermore, there was no other evidence corroborating the allegation that the applicant had engaged in bribing voters. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the evidence relied on by the courts was insufficient and, in any event, was not assessed in a manner that would remove legitimate doubts as to its reliability.",

The Court notes, however, that none of these complaints provided any specific details of inappropriate or illegal behaviour by the applicant (such as examples of any \u201cinsulting\u201d statements, descriptions of any other specific unlawful behaviour, or the date and time of the alleged misconduct). Rather, they were all very vaguely worded and essentially contained unsubstantiated allegations. The courts failed to verify the identities of the authors of these complaints, to seek more detailed information from them as to the specific alleged misconduct by the applicant, to corroborate that information with any additional evidence, or to hear any of the complainants in person and thus give the applicant an opportunity to defend himself against their allegations. Thus, these written statements, in themselves, could not be considered as proving any factual circumstance, let alone any illegal conduct by the applicant. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the written complaints and telegrams cannot be considered to be relevant, sufficient or adequately assessed proof of any misconduct on the applicant\u2019s part.",

The Court notes that these accusations emanated from the applicant\u2019s main opponent in the election and his political supporters and, therefore, called for exceptional scrutiny by the courts charged with the task of assessing their truthfulness. However, none of the authors of these complaints was summoned and heard by the courts. Moreover, as the applicant was accused of disrupting M.I.\u2019s campaign meeting in an unlawful manner, it is reasonable to assume that a large number of participants in that meeting and other persons would have witnessed the alleged incident. However, the courts failed to identify and seek to hear any witnesses of the alleged incident in order to verify the statements of M.I. and the YAP members and to determine whether the applicant\u2019s alleged actions indeed qualified as a breach of the relevant provisions of the Electoral Code.",

However, they failed to provide any legal reasoning for their decision to class the alleged misconduct by the applicant as falling within the ambit of those provisions. In particular, the Court notes that, while all the complainants accused the applicant either of \u201cinsulting\u201d his opponents or disrupting M.I.\u2019s meeting, the Court finds it difficult to understand how such actions, even if they had taken place, could be considered an \u201cabuse of the right to campaign in the media by inciting social, racial, ethnic or religious hatred and hostility\u201d, as prohibited by Article 88.2 of the Electoral Code. While it is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute itself for the national courts in matters of interpretation of the domestic law, it nevertheless observes that Article 88.2 of the Electoral Code, if read literally, appears to be irrelevant to the types of misconduct that the applicant was accused of. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the failure by the domestic courts to provide any legal reasons for application of the above-mentioned provisions of the Electoral Code contributed to the apparent arbitrariness of their decisions.",

Subsequently, upon the examination of the ConEC request by the Court of Appeal, the applicant was not afforded sufficient time to examine the material in the case file and to prepare arguments in his defence, as he had been notified of the forthcoming judicial hearing only a very short time before it began. The Court reiterates that considerations of expediency and the necessity for tight time-limits designed to avoid delaying the electoral process, although often justified, may nevertheless not serve as a pretext to undermine the effectiveness of electoral procedures (see, mutatis mutandis, Namat\u00a0Aliyev\u00a0v. Azerbaijan, no. 18705/06, \u00a7 90, 8\u00a0April 2010) or to deprive the persons concerned by those procedures of the opportunity to effectively contest any accusations of electoral misconduct made against them (see\u00a0Orujov, cited above, \u00a7 56). In the present case, it appears that the examination of the issue of the applicant\u2019s disqualification took place without reasonable advance notice, and as such caught him by surprise and left him unprepared for the hearing. Lastly, the domestic courts failed to take into account, and provide any reasoned response to, the applicant\u2019s objections and submissions made during the judicial hearings and in his appeals.",
