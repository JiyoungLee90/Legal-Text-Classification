He alleged that, had the domestic authorities established the incorrect assessment of his examination papers within due time, he would have passed his state examinations. Referring to the good results he had obtained during his university studies and to the fact that two professors had offered him the possibility to write his thesis, the applicant submitted that he would have pursued a successful university career and reached at least the post of an assistant lecturer with a yearly income of some EUR\u00a050,000.
