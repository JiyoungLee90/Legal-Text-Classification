The period to be taken into consideration therefore began only on 28 June 2001 when the applicant joined the proceedings, and ended on 1 September 2005 with the District Court\u2019s decision (see paragraph 10 above).

Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or convincing argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present circumstances. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.
