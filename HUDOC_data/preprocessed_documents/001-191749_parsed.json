Indeed, the Court has already expressed the view that failure to properly investigate or provide appropriate judicial response to complaints of sexual abuse against children or other vulnerable persons such as persons with intellectual disabilities creates a background of impunity which may be in breach of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention (see I.C. v.

Moreover, her complaints in this respect (see paragraphs 21, 23 and 27 above) were overlooked by the domestic courts (see paragraph 29 above). The Court also notes that the applicant on several occasions alerted the authorities, to no avail, that she was afraid of retaliation by the alleged perpetrator (see paragraphs 17 and 21 above). An approach such as the one taken by the authorities in the current case deprived the national legal framework on violence against women and protection of victims of its purpose, and was inconsistent with international standards on these issues.",
