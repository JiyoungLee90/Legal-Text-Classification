France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII). Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or convincing argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present circumstances, especially since special diligence is necessary in employment disputes (Ruotolo v. Italy, judgment of 27 February 1992, Series A no. 230-D, p. 39, \u00a7 17). Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.",

In particular, there are no elements to suggest that the courts lacked impartiality or that the proceedings were otherwise unfair or that the applicant was arbitrarily deprived of his possessions. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

The Government contested these claims. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. However, it considers that the applicant must have sustained some non-pecuniary damage.
