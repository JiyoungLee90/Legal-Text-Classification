The court attached weight to the fact that the confessions had been handwritten by the applicant himself and included a detailed description of his modus operandi; it also argued that more often than not the first declarations made in a case reflected the truth, as the person had not yet had the time to reflect and prepare a defence. The court also observed that the applicant had repeated his confession before the prosecutor in the presence of a lawyer, and that at that time he had made no mention of abuse by the investigators. It noted that the applicant had refused to provide biological samples for testing and that the polygraph test he had taken had showed \u201csimulated behaviour\u201d.

They argued that in convicting the applicant the County Court had relied on an extensive body of evidence and that his initial statements given without a lawyer had been neither the sole nor the decisive basis for his conviction; they had been one element in the file which corroborated the remaining evidence. The Government averred that the court had attached significance to the applicant\u2019s complete change of position from full admission in the early stages to denial in the later stages, and had explained in great detail why it had relied on the former to the detriment of the latter.
