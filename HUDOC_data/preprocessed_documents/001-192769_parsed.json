Any opinions \u2013 from approval to criticism of the arrests \u2013 were welcome. He hoped that the \u201cpicket\u201d would be approved.

The applicant then criticised the fact that regional governors were appointed by the President and expressed the wish that governors be elected by the people. He asked why Mr Gaizer had been appointed governor of the Komi Republic in 2010 if, according to the investigators, he had been a member of a criminal gang since 2006. He then said that the accusations against Mr Gaizer and the others seemed to be based on a very slim evidentiary basis, which gave reasons to believe that the criminal proceedings against them were politically motivated. In his opinion, Mr\u00a0Putin was trying to frighten other governors into submission. In any event, appointed governors always served the interests of those who had appointed them. He therefore wanted to propose a discussion about the future of the Komi Republic and, in particular, about whether the people wanted the next governor to be appointed or elected.",

The town administration had, however, refused to allow the \u201cpicket\u201d because it was prohibited to hold public events at that location.

It provides that a refusal to approve a public event, its location or time or the manner in which it is to be conducted may be challenged before a court either by the event organiser or by a person appointed by the organiser to fulfil certain organisational tasks (point 2). When examining such administrative complaints, the courts have to examine whether the interference by a public authority with the right to freedom of public assembly was lawful, necessary and proportionate to a legitimate aim. The courts must examine all the grounds advanced by the public authority and all the evidence submitted by it and assess whether the reasons for the interference were relevant and sufficient (point 9). Furthermore, Ruling no.\u00a028 provides that the courts must verify whether the proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner of conducting it was made within the three-day statutory time-limit. Failure to comply with that time-limit means that the public event must be considered to be approved by default (point 10).",

They must mention specific facts showing that public interest considerations make it manifestly impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. Such public interests may include: normal functioning of essential public utilities, social and transport infrastructure and communications (such as emergency maintenance work on engineering and technical networks); maintenance of public order and safety of citizens (both those participating in the public event and passers-by, including on account of a risk of building collapse or an expected number of participants in excess of the maximum capacity of the location); disruption of pedestrians or traffic or of citizens\u2019 access to residential premises or to social or transport facilities); and other similar considerations. At the same time, inconvenience caused to citizens by a public event or an assumption by the authorities that there might be a risk of such inconvenience may not in themselves be considered valid reasons for changing the location or time of a public event. For example, a necessity to temporarily divert pedestrians or traffic may not be considered a valid reason for changing the location or time of a public event, provided that it is possible to ensure that the traffic and the conduct of everyone involved in the event will comply with the established rules and will not lead to traffic accidents. On the other hand, disruption of pedestrians or traffic or a risk of disruption of essential public utility services may be considered valid reasons for proposing to change the location or time of a public event, provided that holding the public event will breach traffic or public transport safety requirements or limit citizens\u2019 access to residential premises or public facilities, irrespective of measures taken by the public authority to ensure compliance with such requirements. The public authority must therefore submit to the court evidence of specific facts making it impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. The courts may not take into account any circumstances which were not mentioned in the proposal to change the location or time of the public event (point 12).",

If approval was denied because it was prohibited to hold public events at the chosen location, the public authority may suggest an alternative location for that event. The organiser must reply in writing, stating whether he or she accepts the proposed alternative location and/or time, no later than three days before the planned date of the event. The organiser may also propose another location or time for approval. However, if the organiser wants to change the date of the event, he must submit a new notification (point 13).",

The organiser must enclose with the notification the consent to the public event signed by the premises\u2019 owner (points 8 and 14). It is not necessary to notify a public event planned at a specially designated location for public events, provided that the number of participants does not exceed the number permitted for each such location by regional law. The organiser must ensure the safety of participants and must therefore make enquiries about any other events planned at the same location at the same time to make sure that the maximum capacity of the location will not be exceeded. The fact that the organiser informed the public authority about the intended public event will be taken into account if he or she is held liable for failure to ensure public order and safety. The public authority may propose a change of location or time of a public event to be held at a specially designated location and not requiring notification only if another public event has been scheduled to take place at the same location and time and (i) the number of participants of the two simultaneous events will exceed the maximum capacity of the location; or (ii) it will not be possible to ensure the peaceful character of the simultaneous events by applying security arrangements habitually used at public events with a comparable number of participants, that is to say, it will be necessary to apply exceptional security measures (point\u00a015). On the other hand, a cultural event, a fair or some other mass event not falling under the Public Events Act, scheduled to take place at the same specially designated location at the same time, may not in itself serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event. It may serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event only if information about that mass event was duly published and it will not be possible to ensure safety at the two events if they are held simultaneously (point 16).",

Russia (nos. 4916/07 and 2 others, \u00a7 99, 21 October 2010) the Court found that Russian law, as in force at the material time, did not provide for a preventive remedy, and it found a violation of Article 13 on that ground. Subsequently, in the case of Lashmankin and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 356-60) concerning the events between 2009 and 2012, the Court found that the judicial remedy under former Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d) and the Judicial Review Act available to the applicants at the material time \u2013 in addition to its inability to allow an enforceable judicial decision to be obtained on the authorities\u2019 refusal to approve the location, time or manner of conduct of a public event before its planned date \u2013 had insufficient scope of review.

It was large and closed to traffic, and was therefore perfectly suitable for public events. In 2011 the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic had moved to the seventh floor of a building on that square; thereafter, the town administration had prohibited the holding of public events in Stefanovskaya Square altogether (see paragraphs 34 and 35 above). Referring to the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 17 July 2007 (for a summary of the domestic law provisions, see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 254), the applicant argued that the perimeter of the zone in the vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic was to be determined on the basis of the land or urban planning register and had to be objectively justified by the aim of ensuring the normal functioning of that court. The Syktyvkar Town Administration\u2019s decree determining the perimeter of the zone in the vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic (see paragraph 35 above) did not meet those criteria, in particular because it provided for a zone covering a total area of about 51,800 sq. m comprising several plots and parts of plots of land registered separately in the urban planning register. Such a large perimeter was not necessary to ensure the normal functioning of that court, which occupied several offices on the seventh floor of an office building. Nor was it necessary to prohibit the holding of public events in the vicinity of the court during periods when it was not in session, as well as on weekends and public holidays. The applicant submitted a list of twenty festive public events held in Stefanovskaya Square in 2016, showing that the prohibition was not always complied with.",

That prohibition was justified by the special legal regime pertaining to those locations and the need to ensure their security. In particular, referring to a decision of 29 May 2007 by the Constitutional Court (for a summary of the domestic law provisions, see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0253), the Government argued that the aim of the prohibition on holding public events in the vicinity of court buildings was to protect the independence of the judiciary and to prevent pressure being put on judges. The restriction was therefore justified, and did not breach citizens\u2019 constitutional rights. The perimeter of the zone in the vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic had been determined by Syktyvkar town administration\u2019s decree no. 9/3483 of 4\u00a0September 2013 (see paragraph 35 above); the location chosen by the applicant had been within that perimeter. The domestic authorities had therefore proposed that he change the location of his event to one of the specially designated locations for holding public events. The applicant had not discharged the burden of proof to show that those locations had been unsuitable for his purposes: they had been within the town of Syktyvkar, open to the public and large enough to accommodate high numbers of participants. The Government pointed out that public events had been regularly held at the specially designated locations in Syktyvkar. They produced copies of ninety-one notifications of public events lodged by the followers of the Vedic culture, as well as a dozen notifications lodged by other associations, to be held in the specially designated locations. The applicant had himself held a public event there in July 2016 after the town administration had proposed one of the specially designated locations for a meeting planned by him.",

However, a general ban on demonstrations can only be justified if there is a real danger of their resulting in disorder which cannot be prevented by other less stringent measures. In this connection, the authority must take into account the effect of a ban on demonstrations which do not by themselves constitute a danger to public order. Only if the disadvantage of such demonstrations being caught by the ban is clearly outweighed by the security considerations justifying the issue of the ban, and if there is no possibility of avoiding such undesirable side effects of the ban by a narrow circumscription of its scope in terms of territorial application and duration, can the ban be regarded as being necessary within the meaning of Article\u00a011\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention (see Christians against Racism and Fascism v. the United Kingdom, no. 8440/78, Commission decision of 16\u00a0July 1980).",

Furthermore, it was never argued that the general ban could not be relaxed without a risk of abuse, significant uncertainty, discrimination or arbitrariness. Lastly, the general ban is not limited in time and applies to all public events, irrespective of the number of participants and the event\u2019s potential to cause disruptions of people\u2019s ordinary life.

It provides, in particular, that complaints against the authorities\u2019 decisions concerning changes to a public event\u2019s purposes, location, type or the manner of conducting it are to be examined by a district court, and if possible any appeal is also to be examined, before the planned date of the event.

The judicial decision is subject to immediate enforcement (see a summary of the domestic law provisions in Lashmankin and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 289-94 and 297). The Court considers that those developments in the domestic law have corrected the first defect identified in Alekseyev (cited above) and Lashmankin and Others, by henceforth allowing an enforceable judicial decision to be obtained on the authorities\u2019 refusal to approve a public event\u2019s location, time or the manner in which it is to be conducted before its planned date.",

It follows that the second defect identified in Lashmankin and Others has not been corrected by the CAP. Indeed, in the present case the domestic courts did not strike a fair balance between private and public interests, holding that the applicant had no right to choose the location of a public event and that the proposal to change the location had not therefore restricted his right to freedom of assembly. That finding is in clear contradiction with the standards established by the Court under Article\u00a011 (see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0405-08).",

Section 15.3 of the Information Act does not require them to examine whether the wholesale blocking of the entire website or webpage, rather than of a specific information item published on it, is necessary, having regard to the criteria established and applied by the Court under Article 10 of the Convention. Such an obligation, however, flows directly from the Convention and from the case-law of the Convention institutions. In particular, Article 10 requires the authorities to take into consideration, among other aspects, the fact that such a measure, by rendering large quantities of information inaccessible, is bound to substantially restrict the rights of Internet users and to have a significant collateral effect on the material that has not been found to be illegal (see Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7 66, and Cengiz and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos.\u00a048226/10 and 14027/11, \u00a7 64, ECHR 2015 (extracts)).

However, the breadth of the executive\u2019s discretion is such that it is likely to be difficult, if not impossible, to challenge the blocking measure on judicial review (see, for similar reasoning, Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, no. 4158/05, \u00a7\u00a7 80 and 86, ECHR 2010 (extracts); Lashmankin and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0428; and Ivashchenko v. Russia, no. 61064/10, \u00a7 88, 13 February 2018). Moreover, as a result of the one-month time-limit for the examination of the judicial review complaints (see paragraph 37 above) \u2013 combined with the statutory prohibition on campaigning for participation in a public event before it is approved by the regional or municipal authorities (see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 \u00a0249) and the tight time-frame of the notification and approval procedure (ibid., \u00a7 348) \u2013 there is no guarantee that the complaint against the blocking measure would be decided before the planned date of the event. The Court is of the opinion that in cases concerning prior restraints on publications calling for participation in a public event, there must be a possibility to obtain a judicial review of the blocking measure before the date of the public event in question. Indeed, the information contained in the post is deprived of any value and interest after that date, and the annulment of the blocking measure on judicial review at that stage will therefore be meaningless (see paragraph 91 above, and, mutatis mutandis, B\u0105czkowski and Others v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a01543/06, \u00a7\u00a7 81 and 82, 3\u00a0May 2007).",

In the context of public assemblies, this means that the absence of prior authorisation and the ensuing \u201cunlawfulness\u201d of the action do not give carte blanche to the authorities; they are still restricted by the proportionality requirement of Article 11 (see Kudrevi\u010dius and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0151). It follows that the fact that the applicant breached a statutory prohibition by calling for participation in a public event held in breach of the established procedure is not sufficient in itself to justify an interference with his freedom of expression. The Court must examine whether it was necessary in a democratic society to block the publications at issue, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case.",

Thirdly, the impugned Internet posts did not contain any calls to commit violent, disorderly or otherwise unlawful acts during the public event. Fourthly, only about fifty people were expected to attend the public event (see paragraph 7 above) and, as asserted by the applicant and not contested by the Government, the chosen location was closed to traffic (see paragraph 46 above). In view of the event\u2019s location, small size and peaceful character, there is no reason to believe that it would have been necessary for the authorities to intervene to guarantee its smooth conduct and the safety of the participants and passers-by, for example by diverting traffic. Lastly, as noted above, the applicant explicitly and clearly stated on his blog that the public event had not been duly approved. He did not therefore try to mislead prospective participants by making them believe that they were going to participate in a lawful event.",
