In this connection the Court notes that after the war in  had ended in 1995 the State has had ample time and opportunity to secure proper housing for R. Furthermore, the Court notes that even after the applicant sought repossession of her property a period of more than six years has elapsed so far and that no pressing need has been made out such as to require R.\u2019s further occupation of the applicant\u2019s flat. The Court therefore finds that the applicant\u2019s prolonged and continuing inability to recover possession of her flat has placed a disproportionate individual burden on her. In these circumstances none of the remedies relied on by the Government is effective because none is aimed at the repossession of her flat by the applicant.

It therefore considers that the Government must secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the Ministry\u2019s decision of 12 December 2003 in so far as it relates to the return of the applicant\u2019s flat. The Court also considers that the applicant must have suffered pecuniary damage as a result of her lack of control over her flat and that the relevant period commenced in January 2002 when she first sought its repossession and has not yet ended. As regards the loss of rent, the Court firstly notes that the applicant already had accommodation and therefore it is reasonable to assume that she would have attempted to let the flat (see Prodan v. Moldova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072; Popov v.  (no. 1) (just satisfaction), no.\u00a074153/01, \u00a7\u00a011, 17 January 2006; and Radanovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a09056/02, \u00a7\u00a063, 21 December 2006). Having examined the parties\u2019 submissions, the Court will take the amount specified in the Government\u2019s submission as to the minimum rent for a flat of the same size and in the same location as the applicant\u2019s flat as a reference point for assessing the loss suffered.",

Having regard to the foregoing, and deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 10,000 on account of pecuniary damage. As regards the loss of the applicant\u2019s personal belongings in the flat, the Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged. It therefore rejects this claim. The Court, however, also awards the applicant EUR 3,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage on account of the excessive length of the proceedings, plus any tax that may be chargeable on these amounts to the applicant.",
