The \u201csignificant disadvantage\u201d criterion should not therefore, in her view, apply to declare her application inadmissible. She also added that the Government had not submitted any evidence in support of their assertion that the appellate court had read out its judgments in their entirety, such as transcripts (which in fact had not been prepared at the time in accordance with the appellate courts\u2019 general practice), or statements by judges or secretaries. There had been no general system in place for establishing the date on which reasoned judgments had been prepared. The relevant information was in the possession of the authorities, which therefore bore the burden of proof. Even assuming that the appellate court had read out its judgments succinctly, this would not have corrected the lack of public pronouncement of the detailed reasoned judgments of the first-instance court. Furthermore, Law no.\u00a0262FZ had entered into force later than the proceedings in her case, and the violations of the Convention in her proceedings had post-dated the delivery of the Ryakib Biryukov judgment.",
