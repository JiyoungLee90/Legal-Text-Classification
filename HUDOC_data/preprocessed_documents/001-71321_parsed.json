As such, it attracted the application of the moratorium (see paragraph 6 above), barring the attachment and sale of the capital assets of the Company. The Court recalls that domestic law does not offer a creditor like the applicant, or the Bailiffs, any possibility to challenge this restriction in case of abuse or an unjustified application. Nor can a compensation claim be made for the delay in enforcement caused by this restriction (see Trykhlib v. Ukraine, no. 58312/00, \u00a7 51, 20\u00a0September\u00a02005).",

Ukraine, no. 38722/02, \u00a7\u00a075, 5 April 2005). The Court reiterates that the domestic remedies must be \u201ceffective\u201d in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred (see Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 158, ECHR 2000XI).",

Ukraine (dec.), no. 29439/02, 16\u00a0December 2003). The facts of the case show that, throughout the period under consideration, the enforcement of the judgments in question was hindered by legislative measures, rather then by the Bailiffs\u2019 misconduct. In this respect the Court recalls its established case law that the claim for damages against the Bailiffs cannot be considered an effective remedy where the delay in the enforcement of the judgments was due to reasons beyond the Bailiffs\u2019 control (see, among many others, Mykhaylenky and Others v.
