Under that law, jurisdiction for examining criminal accusations in respect of offences committed jointly by civilians and servicemen lay with the ordinary civil prosecutors\u2019 offices and courts, and no longer with the military prosecuting authorities and courts as in the period prior to the legislative reform.

The documents in question included reports and orders of the day, by unit, from several military units, and related to the missions conducted during the events of December 1989 and subsequently; they contained information, inter alia, on the orders received, the numbers deployed, the ammunition available and the actions taken. They indicate that the majority of the military units were on combat mission until 17\u00a0December\u00a01989 to the beginning of January 1990. They also show that, until the Ceausescu couple fled, the military units were on a partial state of alert, while a report of 22\u00a0December 1989 indicates that, following that event, the National Salvation Front Council ordered that, with immediate effect, all military personnel and Patriotic Guards were to be a state of alert and to participate, with all of their number and resources, in securing and defending the achievements of the revolution.",

In consequence, finding that the passivity of the domestic authorities amounted to a fault, which had occasioned pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage for the purposes of the provisions of Articles\u00a0998 and 999 of the Civil Code on civil liability in tort, the court ordered the Ministry of Finance to pay the complainants 100,000 new Romanian lei (RON) and RON\u00a050,000 respectively.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that deliberate concealment of evidence casts doubts on the ability of an investigation to establish the facts (see McKerr, cited above, \u00a7 137). Equally, the fact of classifying as \u201ctop secret\u201d and \u201csecret\u201d information that was essential for the investigation \u2013 including the reports and combat logs of several military units relating to their missions during the events of December 1989 \u2013 is liable to compromise the task of the judicial bodies responsible for the investigation.

Prior to that date, however, the Court is not persuaded that the applicants\u2019 interests in participating in the investigation, or the public interest in there existing a sufficient element of public scrutiny in respect of the investigation, were adequately protected (see Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a024746/94, \u00a7\u00a0134, ECHR 2001III (extracts)).",

It considers, however, that the political and social stakes relied on by the Government cannot by themselves justify either the length of the investigation or the manner in which it was conducted over a very lengthy period, without the applicants or the public being informed of its progress. On the contrary, its importance for Romanian society, which consisted in the right of the numerous victims to know what had happened, implying the right to an effective judicial investigation and a possible right to compensation, ought to have prompted the domestic authorities to deal with the case speedily and without unnecessary delay, in order to prevent any appearance of tolerance of or collusion in unlawful acts (see also \u015eandru and Others, cited above,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a079).",

Moldova, no. 25198/02, \u00a7 34, 10\u00a0February 2009). Thus, the Court has also accepted that an individual may, under certain conditions, claim to be the victim of a violation occasioned by the mere existence of secret measures or of legislation permitting secret measures, without having to allege that such measures were in fact applied to him. Otherwise, where a State institutes secret surveillance the existence of which remains unknown to the persons being controlled, with the effect that the surveillance remains unchallengeable, Article 8 could to a large extent be reduced to a nullity. It is possible in such a situation for an individual to be treated in a manner contrary to Article 8, or even to be deprived of the right granted by that Article, without his being aware of it and therefore without being able to obtain a remedy either at the national level or before the Convention institutions (see Klass and Others v.
