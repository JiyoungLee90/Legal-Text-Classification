In their view, after the party had been dissolved it could no longer hold assemblies.

The grounds for detention were described in Article 97 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 38 above) and the courts had referred to all of them in their decisions. It was not the Court's role to assess itself the facts which had led national courts to adopt one decision rather than another. If it were otherwise, the Court would be acting as a court of third or fourth instance, which would be to disregard the limits imposed on its action (see Kemmache v.  (no.\u00a03), judgment of 24 November 1994, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0296C, \u00a7\u00a044). The courts had relied on specific facts in their detention orders: they had indicated the imputed criminal offence and had listed the investigator's arguments advanced in his requests for an extension. The applicant's potential to abscond had been gauged by reference to the facts that he had no permanent place of residence in , had gone into hiding after the fight and had only been found a month later, on non-residential premises. Moreover, the applicant did not live at his registered address in . He had left for  where he had got married and rented a flat. When questioned by the authorities, his mother had stated that she did not know his address in . Therefore, the courts' finding that he had no permanent place of residence had been correct. The potential for reoffending had been gauged by reference to the fact that the applicant had been prosecuted previously for disorderly behaviour and the criminal proceedings had been discontinued because the applicant and the victim had reached a reconciliation, that is on non-exonerating grounds. The Government considered the applicant's pre-trial detention had been founded on \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons.",

It is however necessary, among other conditions, that the danger be a plausible one and the measure appropriate, in the light of the circumstances of the case and in particular the past history and the personality of the person concerned (see Clooth v. Belgium, judgment of 12\u00a0December 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0225, \u00a7\u00a040). In the present case the domestic courts did not specify the offence for which the applicant had been prosecuted. The Government explained that he had been prosecuted for disorderly behaviour, without indicating however the specific acts imputed to him. Moreover, as the charges against the applicant had been dropped, his guilt had never been established by the competent judicial authorities. It is also worth noting that the offence imputed to the applicant was allegedly committed in 2002, that is four years prior to the commencement of the present proceedings.

The Court accepts that in cases concerning organised crime, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, in such cases the risk that a detainee if released might put pressure on witnesses or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings is often particularly high. All these factors can justify a relatively longer period of detention. However, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure (see Osuch v. Poland, no.\u00a031246/02, \u00a7\u00a026, 14 November 2006; and Celejewski v. , no.\u00a017584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 4 May 2006). The fact that a person is charged with acting in criminal conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of detention, his personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account. There is no indication in the present case that before his arrest the applicant had made any attempts to intimidate witnesses or to obstruct the course of the proceedings in any other way. In such circumstances the Court has difficulty accepting that there was a risk of interference with the administration of justice at the later stages of the proceedings. Such risk was bound to gradually decrease as the trial proceeded and the witnesses were interviewed (compare Miszkurka v. , no.\u00a039437/03, \u00a7\u00a051, 4 May 2006) The Court is not therefore persuaded that, throughout the entire period of the applicant's detention, compelling reasons existed for a fear that he would interfere with witnesses or otherwise hamper the investigation of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh the applicant's right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

It is not necessary for the Court to determine whether the applicant had been in hiding before his arrest. It is not its task to assume the place of the national authorities who ruled on the applicant's detention or to supply its own analysis of facts arguing for or against detention (see Nikolov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a038884/97, \u00a7\u00a074, 30\u00a0January 2003, and Labita, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0152).

The Court is concerned by the fact that the District Court accepted such an unelaborated argument and extended the applicant's detention, finding that there was no reason to refuse the investigator's request. The District Court devoted no attention to discussion of the applicant's arguments that he had no criminal record, had a permanent place of residence and employment in , and positive references. It treated those arguments as irrelevant, holding that the gravity of the charges carried a greater weight than the specific facts militating in favour of the applicant's release, and blamed the applicant for the failure to advance more convincing arguments (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). The Court considers that the domestic courts shifted the burden of proof to the applicant who was required to demonstrate the absence of risk of absconding, reoffending or interfering with the proceedings, failing which he was bound to remain in detention throughout the proceedings.
