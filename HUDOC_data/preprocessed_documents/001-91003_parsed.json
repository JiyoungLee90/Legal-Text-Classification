Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force for effecting a lawful arrest, but force may only be used if it is indispensable and must not be excessive (see Ivan Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a048130/99, \u00a7\u00a063, 12 April 2007 with further references; and Peleckas v. Lithuania (dec.), no.\u00a018293/03, 6 November 2007). Recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by the person\u2019s own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention. In order to fall within the scope of Article 3, the ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity, the assessment of which depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among others, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a025, p.\u00a065, \u00a7\u00a0162). In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Zelilof v. , no. 17060/03, \u00a7\u00a044, 24\u00a0May 2007).",

The applicant affirmed that he had been beaten up during and immediately after his arrest. At the trial he pleaded that the police officers had forcibly pinned him to the ground, handcuffed him and beat him up. As can be seen from the medical report submitted by the applicant, after the arrest he had a bruise on his left shin and an injury to his left shoulder (see paragraph 6 above). While the Court does not exclude that the applicant could have sustained them during the arrest, no sufficient and cogent elements have been provided which could support the applicant\u2019s allegation of police brutality. Accordingly, the Court is unable to find, beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant\u2019s complaint is sufficiently substantiated. Overall, the Court has doubts as to whether in the circumstances of the case the use of force by the police was excessive and whether the applicant\u2019s resulting injuries reached the level of severity required under Article 3. Finally, the Court notes that the parties made no submissions as regards the advancement of the investigation after its resumption in 2005. It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

Belgium, judgment of 25\u00a0March 1992, Series A no. 235-B, pp.\u00a032-33, \u00a7\u00a033). An applicant claiming a violation of his right to obtain the attendance and examination of a defence witness should show that the examination of that person was necessary for the establishment of the truth and that the refusal to call that witness was prejudicial to the defence rights (see Guilloury v. , no.\u00a062236/00, \u00a7\u00a055, 22 June 2006). Although it is normally for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce, there might be exceptional circumstances which could prompt the Court to conclude that the failure to hear a person as a witness was incompatible with Article 6 (see Destrehem v. France, no.\u00a056651/00, \u00a7\u00a041, 18 May 2004, and Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7\u00a0July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, \u00a7\u00a089).",

Thus, it does not appear that the applicant was barred from making a request for witnesses during the trial, which he actually did on several occasions. The Court considers that the Government\u2019s argument, as presented, to the effect that the applicant had not objected to concluding the trial proceedings in the absence of the witnesses is devoid of any substance.

It has not been claimed that the applicant\u2019s request for defence witnesses was vexatious or that he made no reasonable effort to obtain their attendance, for instance, by omitting to provide their full names and addresses. There is no doubt that the request was sufficiently reasoned, relevant to the subject-matter of the accusation and could arguably have strengthened the defence position or even led to the applicant\u2019s acquittal (see, in this respect, Perna v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a048898/99, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2003-V, and Guilloury, cited above, \u00a7\u00a064; Dorokhov v. Russia, no.\u00a066802/01, \u00a7\u00a074, 14\u00a0February 2008).
