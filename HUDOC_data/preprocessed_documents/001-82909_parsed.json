The court received testimony from the defendants, the complainants and over 40 witnesses. On 29 May and 10\u00a0June 1998 the prosecution presented documentary evidence, including some documents drawn up by a Mr G., who was working off-shore for a bank and who, in answer to a letter rogatory sent by the National Bureau of Investigation (keskusrikospoliisi, centralkriminalpolisen) to the Guernsey authorities, had produced documents (including \u201cnotes for archives\u201d pertaining to meetings on 3 and 22 June 1993 and charts) related to a plan to transfer funds.",

In short and in so far as relevant, the court found on the basis of, inter alia, the testimonies of J.S., S., the applicant and his brother and the documentary material, including the documents obtained from the Guernsey authorities, that the applicant and his brother had discussed the planned transfers of assets with G. It also found that the documentary evidence pertaining to the off-shore companies and the transfer of moneys proved that the assets acquired from the sale of the \u201cbank group I.\u201d had been transferred via companies specified in G.'s charts to trusts, the beneficiaries of which the brothers had appointed. As both brothers had been present during the negotiations with G. on 3 June 1993 and the plan to transfer funds had been proved to have materialised, the court found that they had acted together in, inter alia, removing the funds from Finland.",
