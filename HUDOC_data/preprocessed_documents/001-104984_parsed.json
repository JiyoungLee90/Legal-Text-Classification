None of these matters seems to have been adequately addressed by the courts dealing with the applicant\u2019s requests and appeals.

Although she did not provide information on the reasons which motivated the grant of permission, the Court cannot but note that it was given after the ban had been applied for four years and shortly before the expiration of the statutory prescription, when it must have become clear that the proceedings stood little chance of ending with a final judgment.",
