Neither is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or brought before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or dispelling suspicions which were the grounds for detention (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0October 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no.\u00a0300-A).",

The Court stresses in this connection that, in the absence of a reasonable suspicion, the arrest or detention of an individual must never be imposed for the purpose of making him confess, testify against others or elicit facts or information which may serve to ground a reasonable suspicion (see Cebotari v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 35615/06, \u00a7 48, 13\u00a0November 2007).",

Turkey, no. 20869/92, \u00a7 64, ECHR\u00a02000-VIII). This does not mean, however, that the investigating authorities have carte blanche under Article 5 to arrest suspects for questioning, free from effective control by the domestic courts and, ultimately, by the Convention supervisory institutions, whenever they choose to assert that terrorism is involved (see Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058).",

In the instant case the applicants were brought before a judge approximately three days and nine hours after their arrest. As such, the length of the applicants\u2019 detention in police custody is, prima facie, compatible with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3. However, for the particular reasons stated below, the Court considers that the delayed presentation of the applicants to a judge does not appear to have been sufficiently prompt, within the meaning of that provision. Firstly, the Court attaches great importance to the fact that the applicants were minors at the time of their arrest. However, this fact does not appear to have been taken into consideration by the investigative authorities, particularly the prosecutor, who extended the applicants\u2019 detention for two additional days. Secondly, these minors were incarcerated for more than three days in the absence of any safeguards - such as access to a lawyer \u2013 against possible arbitrary conduct by the State authorities. Finally, during this time, the only investigative measures taken by the police with regard to the applicants appears to have been limited to questioning them on 3 December 2001 - some two days after their arrest and a day before they were brought before a judge. If other investigative measures were undertaken, the Government have failed to indicate them to the Court. In such circumstances, the Court, especially in view of the applicants\u2019 young age, finds that none of the arguments put forward, in general terms, by the Government is sufficient to justify their detention in police custody for more than three days, even in the context of terrorist investigations.",

In the absence of any documents regarding the outcome of the criminal proceedings against them, the Court cannot speculate whether the applicants had the possibility\u00a0of bringing a case for compensation relying on Section\u00a01 \u00a7 6 of Law no. 466. However, since it has already held that the national courts, when awarding compensation under the terms of Section\u00a01\u00a0\u00a7 6, base their assessment solely on the conditions required by that law and not whether the deprivation of liberty was in contravention of the first four paragraphs of Article 5 (see Sinan Tanr\u0131kulu and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 50086/99, \u00a7\u00a050, 3 May 2007, Medeni Kavak v.
