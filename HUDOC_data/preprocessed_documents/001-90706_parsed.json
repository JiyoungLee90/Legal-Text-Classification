This subsidiary character is reflected in Articles 13 and 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\u00a0The rule in Article 35 \u00a7\u00a01 is based on the assumption in Article 13 (with which it has a close affinity) that there is an effective domestic remedy available in respect of the alleged breach of an individual\u2019s Convention rights. Nevertheless, the only remedies to be exhausted under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention are those which relate to the breaches alleged and which at the same time are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be adequately certain not only in theory but also in practice (see Ba\u0161kien\u0117 v. , no.\u00a011529/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a063-65, 24\u00a0July 2007).",

As regards the judicial proceedings the Government argued that no delay could be attributed to the courts. The hearings were adjourned twenty-six times because of the failure of co-accused, their counsel or witnesses to appear before the trial court.
